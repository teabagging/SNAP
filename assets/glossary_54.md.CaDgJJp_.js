Buy It.","review":"'Music for St. Anthony of Padua' by French / Italian early Renaissance composer, Guillaume Dufay is a full standard mass, with all the parts you would expect, even if you are of the Protestant persuasion. It includes an Introit, Kyrie, Gloria, Gradual, Alleluia, Credo, Offertory, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and Communion. If you read the English translation of the Latin, it will look almost identical to the text in our very Lutheran liturgy, as attested to by my very Lutheran pastor who happened to pore over the liner notes.This may be the primary interest for the piece for the musical amateur who happens to like liturgical music. But, it is equally noteworthy in the quality of the performance and the greater interest in the composition, which has much more going on than the simple chants and choruses of Medieval masses. One thing it has which I don't recall seeing in earlier works are duets of tenor and baritone voices.A very nice treat for fans of early music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"After reviewing the technical data on this monitor, I was expecting it to be a quality product.

The edges are a little dimmer than the center, and when you view the monitor from a sharp angle the edges seem to disappear. This is not abnormal though, even on much more expensive monitors that I've used.I would say this unit is equally as good as the Samsung 955DF, but it's cheaper.

The mystery is not very convincing, but there is a surprise at the end that actually works. The protagonist is likable, reminds me of many people who are unsure of themselves, but mask it with a manner of assurance.

The reason I bought it was that it is the only book I found that discusses teaching English in Japan. Unfortunately, this part of it is overshadowed by the ridiculous sections on relationships with Japanese women. The relationship sections were shallow, awkwardly written, and full of narrow-minded generalizations. The only useful nuggets I found in this book were the author's descriptions of his everyday life as an English teacher. Unfortunately, these were few and far between, and buried in trash. This author couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to write a travel/reference book, an autobiography, or a relationship book.

Fats was a total package. He was a singer, an entretainer, an acomplished pianist, and one of the greatest composers in jazz. That he died before his 40th birthday is sad but also speaks greatly of the man who could compose songs just by opening his mouth.The collection is divided in 3: disc one features Fats the composer, disc 2 Fats the pianist and disc 3 is Fats the entretainer (singing Tin Pan alley songs). Great care and love was put in selecting the songs and the packgaing. The booklet alone deserves a grammy. Great essays and photos. And the price is right.

Characters and relationships had the potential to be memorable and endearing but were insufficiently developed. I felt cheated as I would love to have gotten to know some of these people! The pace of the story was uneven--lurching into unbelievable places then dragging as characters dealt with what had happened. Disappointing from such a popular novelist.

Also, by the end of the book, I seriously felt like just about everyone had died. I mean come on, I understand that Alaska is unpredictable, but seriously do that many people have to die in one book?So all in all, unless you're really desperate and just have to know what happens to Jayce and Jacob...don't read this book.

He is quick to point out that he's not been, nor does he want to be part of the continuation of that life, then lists his social conquests. The only part that involved real Italians, and real life there was when he talks about the flood. He clearly didn't get into the life of the city he claims to know so well.

It's certainly not worth reading as literature and it doesn't take you there from your arm chair.This book is just a boring rendition of sort-of famous people who lived or live in Florence, coupled with David Leavitt's intention of showing you all the famous or important people he knows.

I can not tell you how terrible the range is and we have tried three different locations. Maybe 30 feet.And the instruction manual is worthless. Interstingly, they are very vague about range and never tell you how far it should be. And they have a million excuses as to what could be affecting it.So, we can not even use it in half our house. And the old phone worked fine range wise. Save your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"The songs are beautifully written. The production is excellent and the performance is superb. I have a feeling this is an album that I will be listening to years from now. It's not disposable music that goes away after a year or two. This is timeless music. What more could one want? The opening track \\"Forget the Radio\\" decribes the feeling I personally have of being alienated by the mass marketing of music. There is a world of music out there that is undiscovered. I must add that one must read the lyrics (which are hard to see due to lack of size, but worth the strain). Another jem here is \\"Sanctuary\\". The melody will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up it is so beautiful. Above all I think it's Marty's honesty and integrity (and ability) in the way he delivers the songs that make this an amazing album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Radio","review":"Okay, so I'm a Church fan. I give up. I'm also a fan of this album. I don't listen to the radio anymore and I'm obviously not missing anything. This is one of the best albums to come across my desk in a while. You put it in and turn it on and you go into an audio dreamscape that lasts well after the last track. Enchanting music. Just buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new in the world...","review":"The only reason you're remotely interested in this album is because you love The Church, right? But you've bought every other Marty Willson-Piper CD and none of them have ever quite delivered on their promise. Well, you think to yourself, maybe this is the one. But you'd be wrong. Unfortunately, this album consists primarily of utterly silly and insipid love songs, crooned out dripplingly, as in post nasal. And yet, like all the other Willson-Piper albums, there are moments of pop bliss, primarily when he stops singing between the bridge and the final verse in any of these songs, and the musicians jam for a minute. Then you hear the intricate patterns of melody that only Willson-Piper can construct. My advice, don't buy this album, just take out one of your old ones, dust if off, and play it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A humorous and sexy novel about blue blooded Latin ladies","review":"What a wonderful read, Gerson manages to drone in on some of the silly yet tragic truths about Mexican society.

Here, at first, a mysterious, and catchy repetitive beat carries you along expectantly. A sudden \\"hey\\" interspersed occasionally in the midst of this steady beat and outer gurgling sound to the right, then left, end a trip to somewhere. 13 tracks vary what is a listening experience. Titles of each track may or not influence the imagination such as \\"Fun\\" with its bouncy rhythm and outside softer faster acompinament. The outstanding virtue of Library Science is the amazing use of off stage sounds coming around you in circles, way off in the distance and to right or left all unexpected, creating a certain theme in the core melody patterns. Words can barely describe this disc. You just have to hear it for sheer personal enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholy","review":"As a previous reviewer noted, the tone of this collection of poems is much more somber than his previous work.

First Off, if you are a Morgan Freeman Fan, please be aware that Morgan Freeman has a VERY SMALL PART and doesnt even appear until an hour into the film! This Film is so SHAMEFULLY BAD! It looks like it was shot with a Camcorder and the Editing is HORRIBLE! There are parts of the film in which the sound doesnt even match the scene! How a great actor of High Caliber such as Morgan Freeman got suckered into doing this film is beyond me. Maybe he was doing a relative or friend a favor by \\"starring\\" in it!

When I rented this movie, I knew that it might be bad, but I never expected a train wreck like this. It's not so much that the script was boring, but the way the movie was executed was somewhat bizarre. People's behavior (the police in particular) just didn't make much sense. I expected a certain level of quality given that the movie included Morgan Freeman, but I was unpleasantly surprised. His character wasn't particularly interesting or important. I have a suspicion that in the original script, Lieutenant Redding was a very minor character, but when they landed Morgan Freeman the Lieutenant was given more face time, though no more relevance. If you watch the trailer, it appears that the movie is centered on him.

This movie is clearly one of the worst movies ever and should be in the Guinness Book of Records. The manager at my local Blockbuster was so embarrassed, they gave me my money back and also told me that most people who had rented it, had turned it off after 10 minutes viewing.

My son who is 20 months old, still watches it and the three other Baby Einstein videos I purchased since. He still loves to watch Bear in the Big Blue House and Elmo, but when he needs some quiet time these videos still do the trick. Now he can say the words that go with the pictures, so he's learning as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Mom's!","review":"I ordered this tape and when I showed it to my daughter at 7 months she was not interested...I was somewhat let down...well, fast forward 2 months later and she was captivated....now at age 13 mos., she will sit mesmerized thru this tape and the baby Bach and the Baby Dolittle neighborhood animals tape...It makes feeding her soooo easy and also is a lifesaver if I have to get something done....I don't care to have her watch much TV but atleast once a day she watches this video and LOVES it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great forbabies and toddlers!","review":"I bought Baby Mozart as a gift for my niece, she was 6 months old when I gave it to her. Although my daughter who is 2 1/2 years old was who talked to me about it all the time, she goes to \\"maternal\\", in a kindergarten, and they used to play it for her classroom, she loved it. When I read the description on amazon, I thought it would be OK for my niece, and it has been more than OK!! it's been GREAT!!!, we went to the beach house for Christmas holidays and I was able to see how she and my daughter, in such different ages were amazed with this video, I am very happy they can watch it and enjoy this video together!!Patricia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled ! - Think twice","review":"I know that Baby Mozart and Einstein have been very popular and I even have them in our home, but now I know better! ...The BRAINY BABY videos are FAR better for the same price (in fact the Brainy Baby videos are 45 minutes, instead of the 25 minutes you get with Mozart). ...!If your child watches Brainy Baby, they actually LEARN their ABC's, 123's, Colors, etc. as well as being entertained with BEAUTIFUL images! I say buy these types of videos for your children, (Right Brain and ABC's are our favorites) but if you want your child to become smarter as well as be entertained with beautiful and creative images, then [choose]Brainy Baby.

We bought a boxed set at Christmas for our baby. The sound quality is absolutely horrific, being one who enjoys classical music this tape just beats it to death, the recording is choppy and it skips notes. When buying something mainly for the purpose of exposing my children to classical music I am really saddened that at times I feel this video is better viewed with the volume off.The video quality is not that great either the tapes are already starting to flip after just 5-6 viewings.Like I said the idea of the project is very creative, but you could probably create a better video at home with you own video camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freaky Puppets","review":"Some of the video was cute, but the puppets scared my daughter, and I have to say, they freaked me out a bit too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the hype","review":"My sister in law raved and raved about how wonderful the Baby Mozart was for her son. I went over and watched him many days when he was a newborn, and he would literally be glued to the TV. This video teached him at a young age not to interact with people, but to be glued to the TV. Sure it seems that your childed it getting alot of stimulation, however interaction with people is much better than sticking your child in front of this for hours each day. My son-in-law is now 2 years old and has yet to speak yet. He also has many issues expressing himself, and reverts to \\"biting\\" people, and other kids to express his feelings. After seeing the effects of sitting a newborn in front of the TV for hours at a time, I refuse to subject my own kids to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see the hype","review":"I don't understand the hype of the Einstein/Mozart stuff.

She was fascinated with the images right from the start. I immediately purchased Baby Bach and Baby Beethoven too. She is now 6 months old and still loves all three videos. It is amazing to watch her while she watches the videos. She recognizes the puppets (Pavlov is her favorite!)and the inch worm in the beginning (she gets excited when he comes on the screen!). I like the way the music has been orchestrated for little ones. We have other videos that feature classical music as well and I can see that she recognizes the different pieces of music that she had heard on her Baby Einstein videos. I don't know if that would be the case had the music been more complex. She likes her other videos, but the Baby Einstein videos are by far her favorites!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful stimulation from day 1!","review":"Our daughter had colic for the first few months of her life and absolutely NOTHING helped until a friend suggested putting her in a bouncy seat and sitting her in front of the Bach and Mozart videos. I cannot believe what a lifesaver these two videos were for me. She stared in amazement at them and was absolutely quiet until she was able to smile and then eventually laugh. Now, she is 15 months old and has the ENTIRE Baby Einstein collection. She absolutely loves them and is learning quite a bit. Being a stay-at-home mother, these videos are a big help in teaching our daughter about colors, shapes, animals, and more. I buy them as gifts now for all expecting friends of mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boring for adults, kids can't stop watching","review":"This is one of the more boring videos in this series. However it still keeps my son entertained. It is all music based. It is obivous that this is one of there earier more low budget ones. And this is like torture for adults to have to endure. However it will keep you little one glued to the tv for 20-30 minutes. This one has no education value. For you first video get Baby shakespear or van gogh"},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea but boring and non educational","review":"I think that this video is a good idea.

I sit her right in front of our TV in her bouncy seat or swing and she gets so excited when the music starts! She kicks her feet and makes little noises! The brightly colored shapes and pictures are wonderful stimulation for her, especially when the room is somewhat dark and she can really see the TV well. The music is beautiful and I feel it is definitely making her a smarter baby. I would recommend this video to anyone with a new baby at home...I was a little skeptical at first, since she is so young. But, she watches every second of it! I definitely plan to buy the whole Baby Einstein set, so she will have some variety!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 7-week old loves it!","review":"My 7-week old infant is delighted by the video. She loves to see all of the interesting pictures on the screen. She also seems to enjoy the classical music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"If it is possible to make Mozart dull, the folks at Baby Einstein have done it.

It isn't refundable or exchangeable.Save yourself the money and just play your child some classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be a bit much for your baby","review":"While I do not disagree that this is a good video, I want to point out that if you have an easily excited baby, this may not be a good choice for your baby. My baby is 5 months old and since she was 3 months she has occasionally watched bits of the video (we are still not through the whole video). She watches it very intently for a few minutes and then starts screaming and crying! After she sees the video she is so would up that she falls apart at the littlest thing for the next 3 days! She is much happier if I let her watch airplanes on TV with the music on instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this?!","review":"I'm sorry but this is nonsense. I feel terrible for those who think these videos are \\"educational\\" as there is nothing useful, educational, or related to mental development in these silly videos. How come people feel better just because the title says Einstein and Mozart? Videos are not even pretty, they could get my son's attention for a minute or so. By the way, I would suggest J.

One feature I love about the DVD, is that it has repeat play."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE GREATEST!","review":"My friend sent me Baby Mozart days after my son was born. He watches the entire video every time and will not be interrupted until the baby appears at the end. Baby Mozart has prevented my home from being overtaken by flora and fauna, as I have a child who will occasionally go for a day without a nap. The friend who sent it to me says she could not have made it through he daughter's first year without Baby Mozart. This is my baby shower gift of choice. Bravo, Juile Clark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing: A How to Watch TV Video","review":"After hearing so many parents raving about this series I was very disappointed when I tried both Baby Mozart and Baby Bach out with my infant son. My expectations--of stimulating, beautiful music with amazing graphics--may have been too high, but I wasn't prepared for what is simply a video of toys accompanied by cheesy synthesized muzak, punctuated with random appearences by the creator's children, Sierra and (I'm not making this up) Aspen. I felt I was just teaching my son how to watch TV. He wasn't interested; even if he were, I don't think watching these images would do him much good. A strangely dispiriting experience. Buy a big red ball instead, and bounce it on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - but....","review":"There is one major flaw with this product. The music is wonderful and well produced. It is gentle and soothing to match the simple (yet perfectly hypnotizing to your little guy or gal). The problem is that in two different sections (the music stops) and a hand puppet and giant spider on a string jump out and make a HUGE SCARRY NOISE! They scare the living daylights out of my child and make him physically jump and cry. If it wasn't for those two sections - I would reccommend the product. But - in reality - I cannot."},{"rating":"2","title":"from an educator's point of view","review":"I went to school for music education and am now working in early childhood... I LOVED this video for kids... every child I have showed it to has been captivated, from several months to several years old, regardless of how often they had seen it before. It also introduces many concepts to young children in accessable ways -- definately one for any parent who needs a 1/2 hour break once in a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Mozart Review","review":"My 9 month old son can't get enough of this video!

The best video purchase we ever made for our family were these videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful video for Babies!!!!!!","review":"Our baby have been sleeping in our room and I enjoy it very much !He has been waking up earlier that we do.

It will be even better if you can sit down with your baby and watch the tape together."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"My grandaughter has this tape,she is now 9 months old,has been watching it for several months,it truly amazes me!she loves it! i have never seen anything hold a young babies attention as this tape does!she is glued to the tv when its on,she doesnt want to miss a thing of it! its a wonderful,wonderful tape!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All babies should have this video!","review":"I bought this video for my 10 month old a few months ago. He is can't get enough of it! Every morning we watch it together. He has his favorite parts and laughs and squeals when they come on. He gets upset if you are blocking his view. I find myself looking forward to watching it too since it makes him so happy. It is definitely worth buying. I plan to get the other related videos for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertained my daughter for hours on end.","review":"This video is excellent. It combines the wonderful music of Mozart with fun toys and pictures. I can see how much my 6 month old daughter loves this video and gets excited when I put in on.

I'm even entertained by it and have favorite parts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifesaver!","review":"Ah, THANK YOU, Baby Mozart!!! If not for this video, I would have not eaten or showered daily. Well, maybe I'm stretching that a bit, but really....the video helped me gain some time for myself. My baby absolutely LOVED this video from 1 1/2 months of age. He is almost 4 months now and still loves it! His face lights up when the video begins, and often I will see him laughing or kicking his legs in delight throughout the video. This is the one and ONLY video he will watch. The music is fast-paced and lively, and the content very engaging. I have tried other videos, and nothing interests my son in the same way. Believe me, this video is worth it's weight in gold! I would have paid 10 times it's worth for all the showers and small meals it's given me in return! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"We can eat dinner again!","review":"This video is among one of the BEST purchases I have ever made. We bought it when my son was 3 months old and now, a year later, he is still as facinated with it as the first time we played it for him. The videos images are timed perfectly to capture and hold his attention and the music is arranged beautifully(considering I am not sick of it yet)--you can't say that about the music of most children's toys. He seems to find comfort and peace when watching this video and it allows us 20 minutes of freedom. Now that he is older we are using the pictures to teach him words. I highly recommend you buy this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! The best children's video on the market!","review":"My 10 month old son started watching Baby Mozart and Baby Einstein when he was 8 weeks old. He can't go one day without watching Baby Mozart and he is also quite fond of Baby Einstein. If he is in a fussy mood we can put in the Baby Mozart video and he immediately cheers up when he sees the Bear at the beginning of the video. It is amazing! My husband and I were hesitant about allowing him to watch TV at such a young age, but it is amazing how much focus and concentration he has developed. We believe this to be, in part, because of Baby Mozart. I highly recommend this video to everyone. I have personally purchased it for all of my friends and family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds the attention of my grandchildren ages 7mos, 3 & 4 yrs","review":"The music is delightful & in keeping with the visuals. It keeps the interest of the children because it moves quickly & is never boring. The content is varied -- quiet sometimes & \\"bubbly\\" at others. The 7 month old has been watching for 2 months & she recognizes & giggles at what is appealing to her. The 3 & 4 year olds have memorized what's coming next & learned some new words along the way; such as \\"metronome\\". A great gift for children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fool yourself...","review":"...into thinking that this video is somehow \\"good\\" for you child. The Mozart effect research was done with children playing in day care as the music played in the background, not with them staring into a TV and watching a disembodied hand play with toys to poorly performed snippets of Mozart's music. If your child enjoys this video and you get a chance to rest--great. But if you want to do something \\"good\\" for your child, buy a book from Amazon.com and read it to him or her."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"We started with Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals (great video). We moved on to Baby Shakespeare (very good as well). So we thought we'd give it a third try with Baby Mozart. Big mistake. The classical music is nice and my daughter will dance to it, but there are several minute-long segments to this video that are just plain BORING - spinning balls and beads, swinging pendulums, swirling liquid. A baby cannot relate to these objects at all. My 15 month old daughter loses interest after a few seconds and strolls away from the tv. Even pictures of animals would have been better. I would return this video if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for toddlers","review":"My daughter received this video as a one-year-old birthday present. The tape can hardly hold her attention. I am disappointed because I am a classical music fan and hoped my daughter will be one also. However, I really could not expect any toddler to be content watching spinning balls (albeit bright) accompanied by soft music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My babies liked it","review":"I have twins (boy and girl) that are 11 month old. For some reasons, they both like to watch this DVD, more so than other DVDs I have. Initially, my boy liked them more. Now, my girl is more into it and my boy doesn't like it as much. I have no idea why. Overall, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have movie!","review":"This movie is awesome. Keeps my 3 year old enthralled, and my newborn interested. It's also great soothing background music for the adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"Our baby has been hypnotized by this video from 3 months old and still loves it a 17 months. As she's gotten older she also LOVES Baby McDonald and Favorite Place. Some of the other Baby Einstein are less facinating, but these are great teachers and extremely entertaining for our (VERY verbal) girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Visuals and Relaxing Music","review":"We have watched this video 100's of times. It is a great video for younger viewers as it is easy to follow. Classical music accompanies colorful images of toys and other objects.This video was a favorite with my daughter and she usually fell asleep while watching. It was also good for calming her down when she was more hyper.The only downfall I have seen is that kids may want some of the enchanting objects seen in the video.Although the \\"Mozart Effect\\" was debunked, the calm melodies do work well for quieting kids down and getting them to relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"We received this video as a gift and I so wish that I had it with my first child. My 4 month old son is totally enthralled by this video and I can guarantee myself 30 minutes of free time when it starts. Even is he is fussy and nothing else will calm him down, I start the video and he immediately quiets down and its no time before he is gurgling and laughing. He loves it so much that we have purchased every other video that Baby Einstein has for his age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite video!","review":"This video is my daughter Lauren's favorite thing. I bought it for her when she was 4 weeks old, and she watches it at least once a day. When she is fussy, I put in the tape and she immediately starts smiling. She squeals, waves her arms and coos the entire time. The music is wonderful because it's just classical music, and you don't seem like a dork if you're whistling the tunes later (which my husband and I have done with our other baby video songs!). I recommend that you purchase the DVD since you'll be playing it several times, and I also recommend the audio tape for the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this video today!","review":"Baby Mozart is wonderful.

If you flip a coin to decide which of the two most likely suspects are the murderer, there's a 50% chance of your being right. But that's totally unimportant. I won't recount the plot since the other reviewer has done a splendid job of that. I'll just comment that this does get you immersed in the infernal triangle involving the victim and the two suspects. The crux of the story lies in the three cornered relationship and in the portrayal of the three characters involved. Really, there are no good guys (or gal) and no bad guys (or gal) here. The story is of three human beings with individual personalities and codes of ethics. And as a first novel, this book establishes the author as a master of his crafy who has continued to give us some splendid novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Characters, Bad Mystery","review":"I always like to give new authors a chance, so I read \\"When Death Comes Stealing\\" hoping for a good mystery.

Several of the movements are ruminations on music history. The Duo opens with \\"Homage a Ravel\\" and ends with \\"Homage a James Brown.\\" The Scherzo of the cello suite is a \\"Homage a Copland.\\" The Suite for Viola (Prelude, Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gigue and Postlude) refers to Bach's dance suites for solo strings. The Suite for Violin is full of the sorts of gestures found in the string quartets of Bartok, whose long shadow looms over almost everything on this disc. Though many allusions are highly specific and some of the sections are frankly modeled on historical precedents, Hagen is not merely aping or appropriating. He is responding, perhaps in the languages of other composers, but in his own voice and dialect. Hagen weaves about the idioms of Bartok, Bach, Copland, Ravel illuminate the older music and remind us of why we like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading/Reference book","review":"This is an excellent book for general reading or for reference since it covers quite a bit of stuff.I found this book very useful if you are looking for understanding the Comp H/W from all perspectives.I would recommend this book to every Com Science student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong gaskets!","review":"The item came packaged with the wrong gaskets.

All their albums must be selling because, from week to week, they have different albums of Mogwai in stock. It should not be long to get what I want.I don't know why I like it so much, maybe because it is delicate, repetitive, mellow and cacophonic. \\"Sin wave\\" is a nice frying thing which ends with a long distant etheral guitar. \\"take me somewhere nice\\" is repetitive but georgous. \\"Dial:revenge\\" is perfect and the nicest song on this album. It will take me time to sing that Welch language!! \\"You don't know Jesus\\" is second favorite starts very softly and gets more and more cacophonic to become soft again at the end. \\"2 rights make 1 wrong\\" is a nice happy song with delicate banjo at the end (really beautiful).Quite a unique band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wall of sound","review":"Mogwai's best album to date, Rock Action is 30+ minutes of beautiful, beautiful noise. Mogwai is at the forefront of a wonderful music scene that has evolved in Glasgow, Scotland.Although it is a bit on the short side, Rock Action worth every penny.

Catch them on tour if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good glance at Mogwai","review":"I think this is the most accessible Mogwai record to anyone.It is balanced with beautiful singing, nice tunes, atmospeherics, experimentation and offers classic Mogwai slow-build guitar playing.On the other hand, it may appear that Mogwai are going more into a mainstream direction at this point, having as a guest on track 4 the singer from Super Furry Animals.Overall the album works because there is something from everyone.Additionally, despite the fact that there is not much \\"rock\\" in this album, I recommend the album just for track 5 \\"You don't know jesus\\". This is one of the most powerful tracks ever done by any rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhhhhhhh...","review":"For some real pleasure listen to \\"Sine Wave,\\" or the whole album for that matter, but especially \\"Sine Wave\\" while making-out or other sexual goings-on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original work gets a five, the censorship does not.","review":"I was reading this at the bookstore when, lo-and-behold, the images were censored.

Very little seemed solely applicable to boys and single moms. The last chapter was the most applicable, and that was because it was about finding time for yourself and how important that was, particularly for a single parent. On the whole, though, I would recommend any of the Sears' books, Penelope Leach's or Terry Brazelton's books. This one was ok, but since it billed itself as a book for single moms raising sons, I expected more about single moms and sons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring and pathetic","review":"Unfortunately, this is one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read. To my surprise Gamboa falls into a boring an unnecessary overextended autobiography of his life in Paris and his experiences with other immigrants. It does depict a more obscure Paris, but it doesn't elucidate on anything new or alluring to the globalized culture of this century. His stream of consciousness becomes boring after the first 50 pages. For being such a famous writer, his style is too basic and relies too much on extremely detailed descriptive prose, delivering a novel very predictable for an amateur reader. The plot is spiced up by Paula's nymphomaniac practices that start to get boring by page 120.This is as bad as reading Marquez's \\"Memorias de mis putas tristes\\" with the difference that Marquez's novel is less painful to read just because is shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on Walkin","review":"My Favorite Club/Pop song of all time and thats not the only song on this Cd good songs up tempo beats is the story of this album if you like early 90 club music get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is this great talent today?","review":"Every song on her debut disc SLAMS!

Much of the book is direct at the teacher, who is urged to micro-plan his or her classroom experience, e.g., have pencil, pen, and paper, use homework helpers, getting set up for class, having a place to study, and so forth. Ernst then writes about grading systems (not sure what that has to do with study skills), and then, finally, addresses some specific study skills. The suggestions in the section \\"Reading This and That\\" seemed fairly elementary to me, and were not, in fact, process skills that students could use.I found Laurie Rozakis' book Super Study Skills to be more useful in this age group. William Luckie's book Study Power is more useful in the high school and early college age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle Schoolers need what's in this book!","review":"I was given the task of creating a Guided Studies class for special education students at my middle school.

This is what happen to the main character (Christian Slater) in this movie.The movie in my opinion is a satire of the contemporary US society with Christian Slater brilliant as usual.In certain way I think Billy Wilder in his movie The apartment with Jack Lemmon started to denounce the beginning of this kind of social problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT a \\"Quiet\\" performance","review":"In a year filled with films that take a wide base of characters to throw them all into a single storyline that try their best to connect you to the plethora of characters (most with little luck). Seemingly in this onslaught a brillinat little film slipped through the theatrical cracks and has now landed on DVD. This film is none other than HE WAS A QUIET man which stars a very different and withheld Christian Slater in the role of an office and societal recluse whom fanatsizes about revenge, but when faced with his macabre fantasy seems to break free of his malicious intents and become that of a hero.Not to be overshadowed is the riveting performance by Ms. Elisha Cuthbert whose role of the office \\"looker\\" turned quadriplegic demands an emotional response from it's viewer.THIS IS A GREAT FILM PEOPLE, give it a shot, watch it for the performances given by Slater and Cuthbert, watch it again to question your own reality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Widor Mass - AWESOME","review":"I got this CD having never heard any of the works on it.

I consider their Superman series (avoid the WinStar set) to be one of the greatest creative feats of American popular culture.After watching half of this DVD I've come to the conclusion that I never need to see any of these cartoons again. Perhaps they are interesting from a historical viewpoint, but they are not as entertaining as the product of the other major studios. Maybe I should watch the whole DVD, in case the second half is markedly superior to the first 16 cartoons, but I doubt it.If you do buy this set, don't be surprised when you come to the realization that they are nowhere near as good as the majority of reviews here imply.

The main character wants and feels more than is comfortable in his given life; and it is that raw and difficult tension that adds dimension and subtlety to this film.

Focusing primarily on a journey made by Bruegel when the artist was in his twenties author Shafer brings this enigmatic figure to life.After gaining membership in the prestigious Antwerp painters' guild Bruegel embarked on a trip across the Alps, heading for Rome where he planned to see the works of the great artists as well as that city's historic landmarks.With thoughtfully imagined diary entries and breathtaking illustrations Shafer enables readers to observe the young Bruegel as he navigates a forest, visits Lyon, rides a barge up a winding river, and visits an alchemist.Bruegel's two year odyssey is presented with panache and superb drawings. Included is a composite of Bruegel's art as well as author's notes defining Shafer's interest in the artist.

The stories can get a little awkward if you don't read them closely, it may take a second reading to get everything straight, but just to look at the pictures is reason enough to buy this graphic novel.

It was hard to take this work seriously as he put forth some of his theories with no hard facts to back them up. The misfortunes that have been visited upon this family are more a result of their storied recklessness than a curse.

The only criticism I have is that some of the operations have to be taken from a catalog of functions that can sometimes be cumbersome to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty product, bad service","review":"Bought a Texas Instruments TI-86 Graphing Calculator from them. Not even one month it went dead and nothing showed up on the screen. I sent an email but no reply. So I put my review. Immediately they emailed me and promised to send a replacement right the way.

I emailed them but never got reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I have only used the TI-83 before purchasing the TI-86.From the few weeks that I have used this calculator, it has saved me a lot of time and effort. The biggest time saving thing on it is the solver and the simultaneous equation solver. What would take me tons of time and an entire page of writing, solving for 3 or even 4 unknowns, now just takes a few seconds. All I have to do is put it in and hit solve!Also, the vector function of this calculator is nice for my Calc III, statics, and Physics classes. It comes most handy when working in 3D. However, the interface is hard to work with and can take too much time. They should come up with a faster and easier to use menu to edit, enter, and use vectors.Other than these things, it does everything the TI-83 does without any trouble. It is a good scientific calculator, as long as your teacher allows it to be used!I am glad I made this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent calculator","review":"This calculator can do anything you will need for Calc I.

It is a useful text with which to prepare for board exams, but of very limited benefit in its contribution to a sensitive exploration of the classical approaches to health and illness that Chinese medicine offers. If this book is optional for you, I would encourage you to go hear Mr. MacIocia speak in person, and then decide if he is the scholar whose text you want at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst FIRST-Year TCM Foundations book EVER!","review":"If this is your first year studying TCM and you have to use this book, then brace yourself. I hope you have a great teacher who can decipher this book with all it's horrible formatting and confusing theory. Read Kaptchuk's first \\"The Web that has no Weaver\\" before you start on this one. Kaptchuk's book saved my life, and kept me from failing my basic foundations class. Here is another valuable tidbit...just read the boxes in the text, and the chapter summaries and study hints at the end of every chapter. This will keep you sane as you muddle through the book. If you are a TCM student, you HAVE to get the book. No choice. It's going to be on your board exams. I am hoping that the TCM association can lobby to remove it from the board exams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for TCM students","review":"I bought this book to go along with my Traditional Chinese Medicine studies. I hesitated due to the price tag, but I can't believe that I waited! It is well worth every cent! I refer to this book all the time! Anytime I am working on a case it is nearby and used extensively. It is very easy to understand and is organized in a very concise way. The author explains how one pattern of disharmony leads to another, etc.This book does not include western illnesses and how they relate to Chinese Medicine. So, if that is what you are looking for this book does not have it.If you are not studying to be a Traditional Chinese herbalist you will not find this book to be of any use to you. However, if you are pursuing Chinese Medicine this book is an invaluable resource! This has become my favorite herbal resource!

Maciocia tries to substantiate his understanding with excerpts from various classics that had radically different perspectives and paradigms, making this book inconsistent and incoherent. His repetition of the same ideas over and over does not make his incorrect and shallow understanding of TCM correct or deep; it's just mind numbing. The material of the whole book could have been covered within a hundred pages or so without losing any information that is of any value instead of spreading it out over a thousand pages. This is a bad textbook for TCM students who want to seriously study Eastern medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"If you intend to use this text as a reference, beware that the index is 90% incorrect and that although the text is beautiful, it is laid out in a very confusing manner. For instance, the summary box for Lung dryness, instead of being situated in the Lung Dryness section, is laid out under the text for Invasion of Lungs by Wind-Cold. This is the case throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good fin de scicle chamber music.","review":"For the musical omnivore who searches all the different corners of musical genres to see what there is to hear, these pieces are not as great on the ear as works from the contemporary 'greats' such as Wagner and Strauss, but they are very nice indeed, and have an amazing ring of modernity about them. I'm especially intranced by the combination of instruments, as the 20th century seemed to have forgotten how to write for the Organ. I'm also interested in contrasting these works to those of Busoni, Kurt Weill's mentor. Both have hints of early 20th century theatrical music, but here, the hints are faint. The only thing which distresses me about this CD from Amazon is the very high price. If you can get it for under its original list price of about 18 dollars, it's a bargain. For 85 bucks, one can get five or six excellent CD's from this period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video is horrible","review":"Sorry, but it's true. This video is a waste and a scam. The sound quality at times is awful! If you want to learn how to strip a gun go on youtube and watch it for free. Or ask someone at your local gun shop. A large portion of the first disc was filler of the companies other videos...about cowboy shoot! Tactical shotgun or people in western novelty shooting old weapons. At one point there is a 20 minute (could be more, I fast-forwarded) scene about black-powder shotguns shooting clays!! Tactical shotgun??? Also, who wants to watch a guy fumble through basic shooting and what seems like ad lib nonsense. No thanks. Save your money, and I wouldn't trust anything from this company.

We're sorry we bought it. Baby Bach has a similar format to the first 2 videos in the series but you would think that someone entirely different created the video. It is slow paced, the toys are less vibrant and the music selections are less than energetic. This would be more appropriate for very young babies to view before bedtime. However, my daughter, who will stare at most anything on the television, completely ignored this video. It would seem that the creators sacrificed quality to get another video out quickly. But never fear...Baby Shakespeare is excellent! If you have to make a choice...skip this one. Otherwise, I'm sure it would help for the sake of having some variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taken a-Bach by this DVD","review":"After we realized our son liked the Baby Mozart DVD, we decided to purchase more in the series. Being huge classical music fans we decided Baby Bach was the next logical choice. We are rather disappointed with Baby Bach, though. For one, our son (who is almost 1) doesn't seem at all interested in it (and it's not that he doesn't like Bach; he has the Pipe toy and loves to play with it - I've also written a review of that in the Toys area). Secondly, and this is probably just my personal bias, but there's just waaaay too much of the Clark children talking and dancing - it really interrupted the flow. Regarding the flow in general, the whole Theatre presentation seemed just thrown together: clumsy, illogical transitions and lots of extraneous sounds. I would recommend folks skip this one - if you get it as a gift, see if your child likes it, but don't spend the money yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Having bought so many of the other Baby Einstein DVDs, I couldn't wait to watch this one with my 18 month old son. We were both very disappointed. My son could not \\"get into\\" this one. It is the only one in the series that he hasn't liked so far. I believe it may be that the visuals just don't match well with the music, and the whole dvd is quite dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped for....","review":"My son (6 months old)has loved watching Baby Mozart since he was about 2 months old.

Mozart is our favorite by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddlers Still Loving It","review":"My two year old daughters have been watching the entire series since they were wee ones - about 4 mos. old. We recently purchased the Bach video. While I agree with some of the comments that the quality isn't the same as the Mozart and Einstein videos...

I meant to edit the sequence out, but after watching the video several times, I find it is really uninspired compared to the others and have decided not to keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old thing [....]","review":"I just can't believe they put out the same video as Baby Mozart but with a bit of variation and music change.

I continued playing the video until he was three and a half months old, but have given up on it for the moment.If only the volume had been softened on these two parts, we would have enjoyed the video more. My son did seem to like to look at the faces of the toddlers, so that part did not bother me.I received a free CD which had the cluck-cluck-cluck, clank-clank-clank and children's laughter eliminated.

The first words out of her mouth each morning are \\"Bach, Bach\\" (funny, given the chicken puppet that shows up periodically). At any rate, she is interested, and really enjoys these videos.

Hang in there, it WILL be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing -- save your money","review":"Baby Bach was a severe disappointment. Unlike their Baby Mozart video, which is lively and really holds our daughter's interest, this video is slow paced and not of much interest to our daughter.

I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing as compared to their Baby Mozart Video","review":"I was disappointed in this video. It really pales in comparison to their Baby Mozart video, which is very good. Given that this video was produced after Mozart, I expected improved production values. Instead, they were worse!

Also, like I've said in all my reviews of the composer vids, the timing is off for the vid portion and in a Bach video that's just not good. The Mozart vid is far better music wise but I suggest buying the c.d.s and forgoing the vids for this collection altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Bach Rocks","review":"My 8 month old son absolutely LOVES this dvd. We don't allow our children to watch tv for the most part. However, these videos are wonderful and really capture their attention.

We had Baby Mozart from the start and she loves it, stil, and I love it. It makes her smile, clap and bounce up and down with delight as soon as she hears the introductory music. I ignored the reviews and bought Baby Bach, for a change of pace. As one reviewer wrote, it does seem a lazier effort, the visual clips and the audio clips are much too short and not very interesting. Julie Clark's daughters are cute, but not very amusing for even my 12 month old. Baby Mozart was much, much better, but even Bach, is better TV than TV for young ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Baby Bach!","review":"My son who loves Baby Mozart cries non stop through Baby Bach.

Not so! After reading other reviews I now see that others have the same problem that I do; my son cries when he watches it. I have tried several times to get him to watch it, only to get the same reaction over and over. We never have this problem with the Mozart video.While this is not the most captivating video for adults, I have watched about 7 minutes of it before my son gets upset. Compared to the Mozart video there is much less movement and few contrasting colors and designs. She did not incorporate as many animals or puppets into Bach, something that my son loves about Mozart. I must say that the children in the video are not very interesting either (cute, but not necessary to the video.)My advice is to skip this one and buy Mozart instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible, lazy effort!

I'm looking forward to seeing Baby Shakespeare, where I've been told there are other children present.But despite that, I'm glad I bought Baby Bach.

If you want variety try something else. (Though we've also tried Baby Genius and others but nothing seems to hold our daughter's attention like Baby Mozart.) Good luck hunting, but please don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to replace Baby Mozart!!!","review":"Hi;My 8 months old daughter loved Baby Mozart from the moment she watched it (she still does).

The quality of the video was such that I could've taken my own camera and videod his toys to music. I suppose I was expecting more...I'll try Baby Mozart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"Not often is the cultural difference between Americans and the rest of the world this clear: This DVD is the silliest thing that I have ever seen - pictures of toys in motion, kids playing, other every day scenes - for crying out loud: Give your baby these toys and put on some classical music in the background, and you will achieve the same, plus he/she will learn some much needed motor skills as well. I was just so sad/disappointed when I played this for my baby, and I realized this was just using the TV as a babysitter and replacement for real learning activities. My advice, and an opinion I probably share with all of Europe, is to spend the money directly on some of good toys and music featured in this DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach is so good!","review":"I really like these videos. My daughter is 28-month's old and diagnosed with autism. She will only sit for 10 minutes to Book of Pooh, The Wiggles, Rolie Polie Olie and Kipper videos. I thought I'd give these a try after all I've read about them in children's magazines. I think the best two in this series is the animal ones: Neighborhood and World Animals, but Baby Bach is very good as well.In this video there are toys in motion to Bach's music. The toys are stuffed animals, trains, action toys. The motion of the toys fits very well to the music, which is superb. I am surprised my daughter will sit the entire 25 minutes to this tape. I think the quality of these Baby Einstein videos is remarkable. There are two young children in this video along with a few puppets. Not as many puppets as in later Baby Einstein films though. We really enjoy this tape and it is of very high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bach doesn't need any help reaching kids.","review":"In a certain sense, as a Bach fanatic, I support anything that exposes kids to his music. So my 1-star rating is a bit awkward in that light. However, I think it well worth pointing out that the music of Bach needs no video embellishment to captivate a child's attention. As a toddler, I was given cassette tapes of Bach's music, and listened to them constantly. In a very real sense, from about age 1 1/2 to 6 I lived *inside* the Brandenburg concertos, preludes, and fugues, and the immersive experience has irrevocably enhanced and deepened my perception and enjoyment of music to this day. So, consider allowing your child to focus on the marvelous harmonic intricacy of Bach without the concurrent distraction of an irrelevant stream of baby photos and implicit toy ads. Who knows? Maybe (s)he will grow up appreciating such music as more than mere auditory \\"scenery\\" (to which category Baroque music has largely been relegated in American society)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Bach is Bad","review":"Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven are much better musically and visually than Baby Bach which is unfortunate because of the wonderful pieces that could have been used but were not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Einstien Baby Bach","review":"This video is my daughter's favorite!

She has enjoyed that DVD since she was about 7 months old and never grows tired of it. She cannot take her eyes off the TV when it's on and squeals everytime a new animal comes on. After that one was such a hit, we bought Baby Bach...it's okay, but not nearly the DVD that Neighborhood Animals is. My baby's interest in Baby Bach is nothing compared to the other. The objects used are just not as captivating and seem a little dull after the first couple of segments. My husband and I agree that it's pretty boring compared to what we got used to. Some babies may enjoy it, but this is the result at our house. Baby Galileo is a GREAT one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4 month old love this DVD","review":"My 4 month old son loves this DVD; he cries when the music stops; he also has the baby einstein bach rabbit which also plays music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"Baby Mozart is great. Baby Beethoven is very good. But as others have noted, Baby Bach is slow, unimaginative, and not worth the money.The most annoying element, by far, is Julie Smith's shameless inclusion of her own kids - dressed and made up in a way that recalls the videos of Jon Benet Ramsey - in segments that have nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the video. It's like some kind of slealth 'video resume' for her kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish!","review":"My six-month-old and I had enjoyed a number of the Baby Einstein video titles, and the Baby Bach Concert for Little Ears was a naptime favorite. So the Baby Bach DVD seemed like a safe bet, and I bought it without looking at the reviews here. Mistake! I agree with the parents who were a little disturbed by the overexposure of little Aspen and Sierra, but I think the sound mixing bothered me even more. We'd seen the video several times before I could hear Sierra's riddle clearly enough to understand why those freakin' chickens keep showing up. (\\"Bach, Bach,\\" nyuck, nyuck.) They don't seem to bother Six-month-old, though, and neither does the shoddy digital editing that makes the robots look so pixelley to me. In short, Baby says thumbs up, Mom tries not to pay attention when it's on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"My daughter (12 months old) is a big fan of Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven, so I went out and bought Baby Bach and Baby Neptune. I was very disappointed by Baby Bach even though it seems to entertain my daughter for about 10-15 minutes. The excessive display of the children is annoying and seems to be the reason my daughter gets bored with the video. Baby Neptune is cute and I like it, but my daughter won't have anything to do with it. I'm hoping that the other Baby Einstein videos are better because I just bought Baby Van Gogh and Baby Neighborhood Animals for her 1st birthday.I also recommend the Brainy Baby series. The Brainy Baby Right Brain, Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven DVDs are my daughter's favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Baby Back","review":"I ordered Baby Mozart after hearing about it from a number of my friends. My 5 month old daughter loved it and would squeal with delight when it was on, so we decided to get her a couple more of the DVD's. When we received Baby Bach and put it on my daughter started crying within the first 5 minutes and wanted nothing to do with it. I tried it a couple more times over the next week and found no interest in this DVD. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this one \\"bach\\" on the shelf ...please!","review":"My 6 month old daughter adores the \\"Baby Mozart\\" video and we often have it on during dinner. It is nice to be able to sit and eat and listen to some pleasing music while the baby is entertained by the bright colors, interesting toys and soothing music.We were very disappointed with the \\"Baby Bach\\" video which was done by the same people. The musical selections are jarringly short and not particularly soothing. There is a loud and annoying chicken in the middle of the video and the originator's daughter telling goofy jokes.

The Baby Bach video is no exception. It has delightful images combined with the pleasant music of Bach. He asks to play it at least once a day.

It helps us wind down from a busy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little Bach!","review":"My baby loves his Baby Mozart and his Baby Einstein videos, but he starts to cry after a few minutes of Baby Bach. This video seems to be an advertisement for toy companies rather than an attempt at entertaining babies. The toys shown move slowly and do not appeal to young babies. Also- where is the Bach music??? My baby is very fond of listening to Bach - but this video contains very little actual Bach music, and too many weird sound effects. The Bach music that is heard is so Disney-fied that it has little to do with Bach anymore. If Bach's music is as good for babies' deveopment as they are claiming at the end of the video - why not give the babis some actual Bach music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Video Series","review":"The entire Baby Einstein Series is wonderful \\"Age appropriate\\" video viewing for your baby. Our daughter LOVES them all! They hold their interest and are the just the right length.

Nikki Turner is a great writer and I wonder if this book was rushed or if this was a setup for a part two. Nikki always writes about things you know happen in the hood. But to many questions about the people and the reason for their actions. So either way I will not be buying another G Unit book. Though I will keep reading Nikki Turner because she is a great writer.

After listening to it, however, it's clear I made a big mistake. This is one of the worst albums I've heard in a long time. Tosca should be ashamed of themselves for attaching their name to a collection of dated, uncreative remixes by a bunch of hack DJs. As if to add insult to injury, their one \\"new\\" track on here is 9 seconds of silence. Unfortunately, I'm quite serious. It will hard for me to overlook this travesty of an album the next time a Tosca CD comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unwelcome Departure","review":"I have been a big fan of Tosca as well as the Kruder and Dorfmeister team for years. The double CD set Sessions by K&D is the best downtempo collection ever, IMHO. I was very excited to learn recently that there was a Tosca CD (Souvenirs) about which I didn't know, so when I sat down to give it a serious listen with my headphones, I found myself extremely confused and disappointed. I did not understand this experiment. I found it to be so irritating that it broke my heart. I understand the need for artists to reach out and explore new directions, but not here. Not Tosca. I hope they go back to what they do best-- minimalist, deep, sexy grooves."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful, competent biography","review":"Ms. Jackson was a singular writer in 20th century America. However, much of her work is not known outside of literary circles and (before this book) less was known about her life. Ms. Oppenheimer's biography sheds considerable light on the latter subject.Ms. Oppenheimer's biography is competent because she interviews several primary resources (notably, Shirley's children) and because it is well-written. This material yields several insights into the life and work of a very good writer and a fascinating human being. While Ms. Jackson might not have appreciated this book, I believe she would have respected the workmanship involved. Writers, readers and researchers everywhere should be grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"Just discovered the works of Shirley Jackson, although I'd been familiar with The Lottery since high school. Awesome, totally original writer. I will never tire of reading the first paragraph of \\"The Haunting of Hill House.\\" The sheer skillful power of her writing ... as Stephen King wrote, she never had to raise her voice. Dug out a short, unsatisfying bio of Ms. Jackson by some German academic, then discovered Ms. Oppenheimer's work. A terrific biography, reads like a great story should. I can empathize somewhat with the Jackson offspring, since I, too, had a mother who was a writer and a giant personality and an overindulger in food and drink. But my mother cleaned up her health and lived till age 77 while Ms. Jackson's overworked heart gave out at age 49, truly a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"the female version of Stephen King","review":"Since I was a small child I have been a huge fan of Shirley Jackson's writing, she is amazing. I love the gothic stuff but her humorous writings are wonderful too. This was a really eye-opening biography as I knew very little of her personal life before I read it. It was a sad but engrossing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I am surprised by the praise this biography has received. Shirley Jackson has been my favorite American author since the 1960s.... having reread her books almost yearly. But this biography was more of a tell all- yet never informed me about THE WRITING.... I learned nothing about the behind the scenes of the novels themselves, the motivations... I found it to be more of an intrusion in a Private Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a painful, harrowing, beautifully written book","review":"I read this book when I was 15, and I never forgot it. It's a story of a 14 year old boy, living a cruel existance in a mental hospital and trying to make sense of the insanity of his life and others around him, and the inhumanity he suffers at the hands of those whom a child should be able to trust most.We understand his thinking, we are angry for him, and we want to reach into his nightmare of a life and pull him out. There are no happy endings here, he does not walk off into a fake sunset...but the book is written with an honesty and beauty that is not easily forgotten. I am 45 and have recently acquired a copy and it's just as gripping and touching now as it was then. (whoever gave this book only one star missed the point entirely...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chamber of Horrors","review":"Timmy, the protagonist of this book is a 14-year-old boy serving time in a state institution which can best be described as a Chamber of Horrors.Why Timmy is serving time there is never explained; he does, however provide a poetic narrative that makes the stark horror of his environment even more poignant.Timmy is sexually abused in the institution; guards falsify his records so that he is placed on a mens' ward where he is used by inmates and staff alike.There are more questions than answers in this book, but one can say that sentiment applies to real life.The book is very upsetting and the writing does tend to ramble without remaining within a concrete framework.

This section of the book is done reasonably well, but there are many cheaper books available that do a much better job.Unfortunately, the isometric concepts covered in the book were not thoroughly discussed. In fact only high level general concepts are mentioned in detail. I hate to say this, but I have found many much more useful information on the web for free. The book does a terrible job of covering pathfinding, line of sight, resolving colissions, and so on.I wish I could say that I would recommend this book to beginners in Windows game programming who would like an intro to Isometric engines.

The fact is, her playing seriously lacks the \\"chromatic textures, subtle expressivity and sheer tonal beauty\\" that is so important for Faure, and the only reason these recordings are so highly praised is because of patriotic bias.

C.S. Lewis does such a valuable job of guiding people into the service of others while expecting that each of us is enabled by the Word of God to provide that service, no matter how flawed we may be at the time. There is no reason why a Christian cannot learn the Word and perform ministry to both unbelievers as well as brothers and sisters in the Body of Christ. This book will inspire you into that service and will cause you to learn and apply the Bible to your daily life (which is one of the most effective means of ministry!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense Reading","review":"CS Lewis' writing has always been a challenge for me, because he was an extremely nuanced writer. He liked to build a case for his conclusions in a painstakingly layered way, and sometimes my little brain can't follow along. But the title essay, \\"The Weight of Glory\\", is less daunting than some of the others, and creates a beautiful vision of our future in heaven. In addition, this volume contains \\"Why I am not a Pacifist\\", which is a pretty thorough argument against avoiding military duty (written during WWII). There are several other interesting works in this version, and I do recommend it as a good CS Lewis primer (The Screwtape Letters and Mere Christianity are probably better places to start, however)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Lewis's the Weight of Glory","review":"Since the book is required for my class, my only concern was that it reached me before the class started.

Lewis's famous addresses on a variety of topics, ranging from continuing to live and learn in uncertain times to the moral uncertainties of pacifism. As to be expected from Lewis, the arguments are intellegently put forth and, no matter what side of the fence you happen to be, make you walk away with a better understanding of his side. Just about everything Lewis wrote on the subject of Christianity is essential to understanding the faith and reasoning of believers.

Bon appetit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Short Works","review":"The book is a collection of short works, originally given as sermons, homilies, talks, or addresses. Each one is a gem. In Lewis's day, such oral presentations were written out ahead of time and then read. Thus, they were short but very \\"idea-dense.\\" You had to listen carefully, but only for 20 minutes. (Modern-day pastors/speakers should take note!!) You can profitably read them as essays, but need to keep in mind that they were intended to be delivered orally by the author to a specific audience (sometimes with discussion to follow).

In this collection of individual essays / lectures / papers, he addresses many issues that were hot buttons in his day...and continue to be in ours. But, I think that the power behind his words is equally in how he expresses them, not just in the the thoughts behind them. Mr. Lewis was a master at taking rather complex matters and making them understandable to the average reader.While some of what Mr. Lewis writes I would not fully agree with, I give him much credit and am very lenient when I consider his personal background (atheist-turned-Christian apologist).I highly recommend this, and other, books he has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"These tend to shed their material with any kind of active use (like sports).

It screws on the cable-in port and makes a 90-degree turn to give you plenty of breathing room to hook up the cable. It only protrudes about 1/4 inch from the end of the cable-in port."},{"rating":"2","title":"good purchase","review":"the 90 degree coaxial connector worked perfectly for slim wall mount of led tv. channels cable nicely with no kink in the cable. works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart immediately","review":"There's little good to say. I guess it didn't cost much. Piece of crap fell apart literally 30 seconds after it came out of the box. It's made of brass and not steel or something harder which I guess doesn't help (come to think of it, that's not what's shown in the picture...) I took it out, attached it to the outlet, then to the cable. The minute I let go of the cable, the whole thing fell apart and I had to remove what was left of it from the jack with pliers. Then I went to the corner hardware store instead, picked up the exact same thing (except in steel) for $2.99 (this is $4.99 after shipping) and it's held up fine for the last week in the exact same setup. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Angle Co-Ax Connector","review":"I have an installation that requires a close distance from the back of the tv.

Fibromyalgia can destroy a family -- I've seen it all too often.Mr. Piburn's journey has been a difficult one, and I applaud him for writing this book. I think that this book is useful not just for fibro families, but for anyone who has a loved one suffering from a chronic condition or disease.I cannot think of enough superlatives to describe this book -- you will have to read it for yourself to find out.Thank you, Mr. Piburn, for being so honest and brave enough to write this book. And, also to the Piburn family. I am going to recommend this book at my next support group meeting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly written!","review":"This is one of the best books on how people cope with Fibro that I have read. This man is honest about how he feels and how he struggles in his role as caretaker of an ill spouse. It helped give me insight into what my husband must go through in helping to keep me sane and well as this illness steals both our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egocentric","review":"First of all, I highly commend Mr. Piburn for having the courage to write his story. Although, the further I got into the book, the more egocentric his style of writing became. I felt like many times he was focusing more on how to say things than sharing what was really going on. When I arrived at the part in the book where he expresses that a man has to ejaculate sometimes, I could no longer read this. It sounded chauvinistic to me. As a female partner of someone with chronic pain, I can only say that I'm sure both sexes have a need to experience the release of orgasm. Maybe the book would be more helpful to a male who is the well spouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've been wearing Stella for years & love it.

I strongly suggest not buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mellow Groove With the Essence of Morocco","review":"This cd took me quite by surprise when I first played it. I first heard of Imhotep from Cheb Mami song \\"Parisian du Nord\\". Upon further investigation found out about Iam. Since I love MC Solaar I thought I give this one a try. It isn't a hip-hop cd and goes along more with the likes of Digital Bled. Atmospheric grooves blended with the music and sounds of North Africa. It's sweet Cd that will remind one of a quiet Moroccan night whether it be in the desert or in a small coastal town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the worst books ever published. In fact, if it was a little worse it would be entertaining in a campy sort of way. Brad Dunaway lacks basic writing skills, and is neither a good story teller nor a competent builder of suspense.

We all agreed that this was one of the worst books we've ever read. This novel has no real plot, no action--nothing really at all except teenage angst. Not that good teenage angst, either, but boring angst! It was really hard to get through since I didn't want to read any further. This book would probably be something interesting for a 10 year old, but I'm not so sure that many people older than that would find this interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice early jigsaw","review":"Its a good early jigsaw for the 1.5-2.5 yr olds. We've had some fun times with this puzzle, and I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not our favorite puzzle","review":"This brand of puzzle isn't very well made, but this bus is the worst of the puzzles we own. The main problem with it is that the pieces aren't cut out in a logical manner. Several of the pieces are very similarly shaped and can be interchangeable. There are several odd pieces which are good to challenge an older child, but may not make sense to a child in the age range that typically are using wooden puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces don't fit","review":"After reading the favorable reviews on this puzzle, I've determined that I must have gotten a defective puzzle since the pieces are poorly cut and don't fit. Even for an adult it is difficult to force the pieces together. This is very disappointing since otherwise the puzzle is brightly colored and sturdy. I suppose the problem must be with quality control. My grandchildren, who love all other puzzles, cannot play with this puzzle since it is impossible to get the pieces to fit correctly. Glad that other customers didn't run into the same problem I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the TI-89 Titanium instead","review":"This calculator was discontinued several years ago.

Not only does it do integrals, derivatives, Taylor Series, matrix functions, etc....but it does it in a format that looks like what you would write down on your paper.

It is a lot to pay at one time, but it is so upgradable that you will never need to buy another calculator again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk...","review":"I am fairly certain all the glowing reviews of this product are from employees or paid hacks. This thing is a piece of junk, I am curious how much TI pays college professors to force us to buy these difficult to read, poorly documented, over priced hunks of crap. The display is unreadable unless you have a huge light directly over the display even then it sucks, especially compared to the displays available in other small hand held devices, like my iTouch or cell phone.

Just stay away from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Calculator - But Not Allowed on ACT","review":"This is a great calculator for anyone in a high school math course. It can be used on any standardized test EXCEPT the ACT and PLAN tests. (You don't even need a graphing calculator on those tests. Any regular one will do.) Individual teachers may ban its use if you're in Algebra 1 and doing factoring or solving algebraic functions. Otherwise, I'd defenitely recommend this. It's relatively easy to use, and most of its functions work the same way TI-83s do."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, an expensive load of garbage","review":"I bought this like 3-4 years ago and have hardly used it, and it worked great when I needed it, but just recently 1 day suddenly entire rows of pixels started dying on me (literally they started vanishing in front of me). The bottom most row where u enter data is fine, but several rows above it have died. I contacted TI and those thugs ask for 81 bucks for repair or replacement with a reconditioned model. Heck I'd much rather spend 81 bucks and buy some other companies product. Never going back again to TI's garbage again unless I need it for some course of mine. If I can find some alternate I'll definitely take that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Get Much better.","review":"This is a necessity for High School Math. It literally does *everything* for you. From basic algebra all the way to Calculus. It is by far the best portable calculator on the market.If you are thinking about purchasing a Ti83 or Ti-86, DON'T. Many teachers say it is best to have a Ti-83 and go along with the class. It's not. The Ti-89 makes all high school math a cinch. Shaves hours off homework time. Also, on TiCalc.org, there are thousands of programs available for download. So whatever your Ti-89 can't do normally it now can. There are chemistry and physics suites that I have used that are capable of solving almost all problems in AP Chemistry and AP Physics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this calc","review":"This calculator is worlds ahead of both the TI-83 and TI-86.For the most part, the calculator is pretty intuitive. After 10 or 15 minutes, you get the hang of it and can pretty much do everything you could do with the other TIs.Of course, that's just the tip of the iceberg. The CAS (computer algebra system) is great. You can take derivatives or integrals of functions of one (or more) variables. If you don't have caluclus, you can factor or expand expressions, which is great for avoiding tedious algebra.If you're into programming, you can find some great resources for programming it in C, or use the BASIC-like language built in to the calculator. With the built-in language, you can create both programs and functions that return values just like built-in functions.I feel that I must address a common complaint. I didn't notice the screen being tilted or at an angle, even upon close inspection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A test of your honesty","review":"I bought a TI-89 about a year ago and it is one of the best school purchases I have ever made. I'm only in 10th grade right now, but so far it has worked great. However don't look at the manual for anything, but how to make some neat 3D shapes. However if you go to ti.com and go to help, they will answer any problems/questions you have in about 24 hours. Finally I just want to say that this calculator is great and it does a TON of calculations for you, but you have to make sure you don't rely on it too much. If you want to learn then you won't have a problem, but only get this calculator if you want to learn. You can use it to fly through classes without thinking. Lower highschool classes anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than you need","review":"I'm goin to keep this short. Basically if your in high school, this calculator is more than you need. Im in college algebra in 10th grade and I'm not allowed to use it in class. The TI-89 contains a computer algebra system where you don't have to do any of the work. You just press the \\"solve(\\" key, type in the problem then \\",x\\" or whatever other variable your working with and it does the whole problem for you. This is the same as cheating because it doesn't show the work just gives the answer. That's why its not allowed in most high school math classes. Also, the TI-89 is not allowed on the ACT so don't just buy it so you can cheat to get a good score. Ok i'm bein a little unfair. The TI-89 is an excellent calculator, one of the best i've ever seen. I just recommend it for 12th grade and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This calculator is just for kids.","review":"When I started studying engineering in college I purchased a TI 89 because of the fancy reviews I read here, Afther taking my first calculus exam I changed my mind and changed it for an HP 49, the HP 49 is definitely made for engineers.

The enclosed manual was thicker than the one for my car! Not only that, but when I read about and tried the solve and factor functions, I was never more amazed. The best thing is, that you can punch in a problem like 4(37x+93)^2=24 and it will solve it in a manner of seconds, much quicker than I could ever hope to solve a problem. (not like that one's particullary difficult, mind, I'm only using it as an example) I will say that the only difficulty with this calculator is that programs written in the *.89p format are not compatable with any other model, so I am unable to share games or apps with friends.

Two years ago I purchased the 89 for my High School Algebra II class. It was too much calculator too soon. I became dependent on the thing, and missed entire concepts of the course because I figured I would do them on my 89. Like another reviewer said, I felt like I was cheating on every test.

After tagging along with me through most of high school, several different colleges and soon grad school, my TI-89 has worked, and still works, flawlessly. I keep up fairly religiously with most tech gadgets, but not when it comes to personal/academic calculators - I've never needed one better, and probably never will. It's powerful enough to satisfy all but the students of the most esoteric mathematics, and sturdy enough to tolerate constant abuse of a typical college boy's lifestyle for years.

It has many applications in calculus and trigonometry and despite its age is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Features, Poor Craftsmanship","review":"I use to own the original TI-83 and it was great. Recently it finally busted and I figured I'll replace it with a TI-89. So I buy the TI-89 and noticed 4 things:1) Great features! So many potantials.2) Cheap plastic compared to some of the older models.3) LCD directly exposed; unlike the TI-83(original) which had a transparent plastic shield over the display.4) Display is skewed by roughly 1 degree clockwise...which is VERY annoying.I am very disappointed at Texas Instrument's poor quality control. For a product that costs so much, the last thing I expected was poor craftsmanship. Don't get we wrong; the features on the TI-89 are top notch! I would give a 5 star rating for features alone.

Meaning that I only get A's on my math tests, and quiz's, and my report card grade is also an A. The TI-89 is truely a must have instrument. I am far ahead of my class mates with this calculator. Every parent which wants there child to succeed in any math cource should definitely purchase this calculator for there child.

The TI-89 has a vast array of functions that easily cover everything from statistics to differential equations. The Computer Algebra System works great and really helps when solving problems with unknown variables. The built in list of units helps when converting one thing to another. If you are going to take any math courses in the future, the TI-89 will easily take you through them. The games that are available for it are incredible.

I utilized the T-89 for a calculus class and it improved my marks significantly! The instruction manual is superb, it whisks you through the many functuons of this calculator. Don't program the Serpinski triangle command lines they furnish in the manual, due to the fact it will devour your batteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for kids but...","review":"This calculator will do well for students who are doing homework for their lower level classes but for the professional, the HP 49GX or HP49G is superior, both in terms of capability and product quality. As a chemical production engineer, I had a TI-89 until a fall from my desk left it dead. Since I had used an HP 41CV in school, I decided to replace it with an HP 48GX. Since that time I have noticed that ALL of my professional colleagues use HP calculators. Since that time, my HP has survived bumps, falls, and even complete submersion in water and still works as well as the day I purchased it.If you are a high school student and looking for a calculator for math class, buy the TI.

Then again Glen Miller did that too.Jingle Bell Rock is another classic that he tears to pieces. This is the hottest version on the planet with lightning fast guitar licks, just they way you expect to hear them from Brian.Let it Snow is another great rocker that he ups the tempo on.Mr Grinch is another song he has a lot of fun with.Brian Setzer has really come up with 2 very good Christmas albums and I would recommend them both to you.Both of his Christmas CD's will have you rockin time and time again.

I noticed on the back of the book that the author Judy Hall has thirty years experience. Good to know that the person who wrote this is so well qualified.The 'Quick Reference' in the back of the book is neat because it gives you information on crystals and the zodiac, the chakras, the aura, and correspondences which has to do with balancing body parts, and divinatory meanings.This is a great reference guide.

She should mention Azeztulite is opaque white quartz-if thats what it is. I am still researching info on that. Angelite is another name for Anhydrite.That said, the book contains metaphysical properties of the stones, what it does psychologically for you and the physical healing properties as well. I found that very useful in my line of work when people had questions as a \\"go to\\" guide for the issue.

This book twists Ender's Game's views a little, but not in a bad way. I liked Ender a lot more in this book than I did in Ender's Game.The book starts off very interesting, but has a slight downward slope as the plot begins to merge with the exact same events of Ender's Game and is simply re-told.Still a good read, but not as exciting as Ender's Game, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is science fiction?","review":"The majority of this book seems to revolve around the intricacies of relationships and talk of babies.

I particularly liked seeing Peter as a decent human being by the end of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bean gets his own story.","review":"I discovered the Ender stories by Orson Scott Card 26 years after they first appeared.

I am currently reading book 12 of 14 in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little slow","review":"Shadow of the Giant centers once again on Peter Wiggin, Bean, Petra and the rest of the battle school students after the formic war. There is more political intrigue as nations race to establish supremacy by both war and diplomacy. Peter's vision of a world without nations is finally established. We are further drawn in to the effort to find \\"Petra and Bean's\\" babies which were implanted in random women around the globe.A decent, but not great, conclusion to the series. I would state that, much like the main path of the ender series, the shadow series had its best books first. Still, if you have made it this far, the book is worth reading to conclude the events which establish the order of earth after the war..."},{"rating":"2","title":"urhero","review":"It ties up many loose ends, but it leaves thinking also.

It seemed very anticlimactic, but the end was very final. It did not leave a lot of questions to be asked, it was very clear. My biggest complaint was that several of the characters seemed very one-dimensional. I did not have that eagerness to read on that I did when I was reading the first book, but I still read it fairly constantly until the end.I miss the intricate detail that was in Enders Game. The way that Ender conducted his battles gave an insight into his mental state when he was fighting. You don't get the detail of how they conducted the battles, but only that they were brilliant, and that they were won or lost by a particular side.I miss a lot of the aspects that were in the other books, but the closure that this book gave made me like it enough to give it four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"The only word I can think of, having just finished this book, is \\"wow\\".I'm not going to give you a plot recap (others have given that). Rather, I will focus on my reactions... And there was a vast array of them.This book made me laugh, and brought me to the verge of tears. It caught me up in the political intrigue and strategy, and also in the personal stories of the characters. It is a book where you sympathize with the frustration, weakness, and hope of the characters that Card paints.If you are looking for a touching sci-fi series that balances political struggles with personal ones, then pick up the Shadow line of Card's \\"Enderverse\\". (This line includes Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, and Shadow of the Giant.)But, if you're looking for sci-fi which places great emphasis on the futuristic science... You should look somewhere else. Card uses it as a backdrop in these books. It is, ultimately, the characters that take center stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bean Series","review":"The latest book in Card's \\"Bean\\" series, a spin-off series from the original Ender's Game, is excellent. Orson Scott Card skillfully incorporates elements of today's terrorist fears and escalating world violence into the game for global domination fought out by the Battle School graduates, now in their late teens. Bean and Petra's continued search for their children is heartwrenching, but the character development that goes into Bean, Petra, and Peter Wiggin is worth all the tension. A good read and a good culmination--though certainly leaving things open for another installment, since one loose end remains untied at the end of the novel. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing end....","review":"The original Ender books were excellent. The Shadow series gets progressively worse until it finally appears to end with a wimpy conclusion. Some other reviewer mentioned that Card planned to write yet another sequel to all of this.

The thing goes to sleep constantly - to save battery power of your laptop I suppose - but this feature is very annoying if you use a 10-key a lot. The device also constantly freezes up - I find I have to stick the end of a paper clip into the 'reset' hole on the back of the device several times a week. The keys are also stiff - you have to hit them hard, which makes it easy to miss numbers if you are typing quickly.

It seemed to run good last year, but does not work this year. The compressor does not work.

However, when applying for our energy star rebate, we came to find out that it had been removed from the list a more then a year before we purchased it. False advertising if you ask me. When contacting their customer support about that they had NO clue what energy star meant. The lady said ALL appliances are required to be energy star.

Unfortunately, within 10 minutes of listening to Karen Holden I started to think I might go OUT of my mind. The woman never stops talking. Never. Because of her continuous, raspy voice, I couldn't hear the relaxing background music, or even stay focused on my movements & breathing. Holden takes the tranquility out of a discipline that requires serenity & self-focus. There are some good sequences in this video, but Holden compromises many of them with too much repetition. I may give the video another try - with the volume turned off & my own background music. Then again, I may just toss it & go back to my tried & true Scott Cole DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes","review":"Good topic for a book but like most Syngress books I've bought the editing is poor and too many errors slip by and make you wonder about the accuracy of the topics and examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're interested in historic recordings!","review":"If you are searching for good folklore music, keep searching. This is a CD filled with old recordings (at least 50 years old) of old LP's, thus the quality is questionable (track no 12 you can hardly hear at all). The reason may be the cheap production (no copyrights). Furthermore the selection of songs is not very clear: some authentic folklore, some choiresque, a christmass carol, some street orchestra and some patriot songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tier 2 concertos","review":"Certainly one of the better ones in this romantic piano concerto series.

In my case, I know Karen and I grew up in the same area where she grew up. We attended the same church and my mother knew her family. Whether one grew up in the same town, or whether you have been through the caring for parents, this book is a must read. Everything the author writes about flooded my memory with the same feelings as she experienced. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has cared for elderly parents or who may be facing future care of parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Journeys to the Father","review":"Karen wrote this book as a tribute to her family, whom she dearly loved. The stories of her early childhood were definitely seen through a child's eyes. Karen told this story with much forethought, and very much love!

The performances are very satisfactory and there are some very attractive sounds on this recording.Up to eight cornetts are used (in two pieces) and twelve trombones (sackbuts) feature in another work.A few organ works are included to break up the program a little.My only complaint it that some of the pieces are transposed down by a 4th. This really doesn't need to happen with this music - it is an option, of course - but why was it done here? A couple of my favourite canzonas sound very dark as a result.I enjoy this recording but it isn't one I'd listen all in one sitting. Rather, this is a CD to 'dip into'.Let us hope that Concerto Palatino or Musica Fiata tackle this landmark collection of music some time!PS: I am still enjoying this CD a lot! I hope that HMS&C; consider recording Gabrieli's 1615 Canzone & Sonate on HYPERION, too!

My sister pays no attention to them, she chews on the \\"shiny\\" disks and points to the cheap toys on the cover complaining she doesn't have them. I donated the disks to the Good Will for some other cheeseball to buy them. If you buy these you will go nuts and maybe even get so pissed, you crack the disks engaging your son/daughter into some dangerous activity. I hope you use this info wisely, and interact with your child/sibling instead of forcing them to watch the dumbest DVD ever.

Thanx!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical find!","review":"I purchased this book from on \\"on sale\\" rack outside a bookstore - bought it because it was cheap. What a find! This is a great historical novel about a time in Mexico I knew very little about. The setting and characters come alive as the reader begins to see the tremendous complexities of this time in Mexico. Only drawback - a bit too many Spanish and French phrases (although usually easily figured out) and a bit too detailed in some of the battle scenes - lovers of battle strategies will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Enough Book...","review":"But I highly suggest you look up a group called \\"Women Living Under Islamic Law\\" on the internet.

Again, please do not attempt these poses without having practiced in a class setting where an instructor can help correct your posture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrrrr.","review":"I read the other review in Amazon about this being the best video. The teacher is just annoying, and there is no music, so you hear everyone slobbering and breathing. Not relaxing. And, the workout seems a bit not centered ... I like the poses, but there doesn't seem to be a link between one pose and the next. Bryan Kests power yoga is MUCH better at getting a full, invigorating yet calming workout in. This guy was so annoying I couldn't even calm down and do the poses. Good ideas and poses, hard stuff, but not handled well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough and dry yoga","review":"I am totally looking for challenging yoga DVDs. While I must admit that I found some sections to be difficult (the mega push-ups), I didn't find it challenging in an overall way: no innovative poses or new territory chartered in the area of stretching, and of course, no spiritual or inner challenges.There was no music, and Mark does more walking around and touching the women than doing the poses himself. His style seems to me that of a Football coach - he kind of stands there barking out the poses.What can I say, I did this disc once, and haven't reached for it again. Too bad. I love a physical yoga challenge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Post-Crisis Superman stories out there.","review":"Superman: Exile is the story of Superman's grief after the first time he ever had to kill anyone. He has decided that the only way Earth can remain safe is for him to leave, so he dons a gasmask and portable teleportation unit and disappears into deep space. Features the first appearance of the Eradicator, Mongul, and War Planet. I really liked the Exile story-line, and I've re-read it at least once. I would highly recommend it to any Superman fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman in Despair","review":"I don't typically like Superman stories, try as I might. But this one isn't hard to enjoy.It's not often you get to see Superman hitting bottom, and the creators really pulled it off nicely. The first half of this book details his slide into despair and self-destruction, and really says a great deal about loss. We can't always live up to the unrealistically high ideals we tend to promote.This story proves that Superman has a great deal of humanity, more than most other superheroes out there. It's always a good thing to see heroes fail, because it's their reaction that defines who they really are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Journey!","review":"Exile is great - any Superman fan should try it out - I thoroughly enjoyed it! Superman takes a self-imposed journey into space, leaving Earth for awhile. He deals with an inner conflict (what if Superman kills his enemies?) and has several other adventures along the way involving aliens, early Kryptonian history and the Eradicator device, and Warworld. What I really liked about the story was the variety and also the satisfying conclusion.Of course the artwork is not the rich computer-colored style that we see nowdays. This is more of the late 80's look. But Superman is strong, heroic, deals with an inner conflict for a short time, and just in a word, is CLASSIC. Loved it! It goes up there among my favorites, definitely to be re-read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superman Exile : When I stopped reading","review":"I had always been a Superman fan as long back as I can remember. However, when \\"Superman\\" took the lives of three Zone criminals, I knew I was looking at an imposter. The Superman I grew up with would have never done such a deed. He would have returned them to the Zone and just dealt with it if they escaped again. Also if the real Superman had been forced to do likewise, in breaking his code, he would have exposed himself to Gold Kryptonite erasing his powers and ending his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I picked this one up........","review":"This is something I always thought should've been the next logical move for George to take.Jeff Pilson has always been a good player and singer/songwriter.The mix of styles is just right here for any new/old listener to dig.This is the George Lynch I like,not in the Lynch Mob trying to look like a Guns And Roses type band taking itself way too seriously....I have always liked George's playing and sound being a guitarist also myself.I know George's heart is in Lynch Mob so this little gem will be lost in the shuffle and die a quick death.It's a shame.Pick up this CD, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipe for the Wicked Underground","review":"Take the following 3 ingredients: 1 part \\"musical growth & tightness\\" of the mid-90's \\"Dysfunctional / Shadowlife\\" era DOKKEN (Lynch & Pilson's household name band), 1 part \\"hard rockin' crunch\\" of LYNCH MOB (Lynch's band offering after 80's split of DOKKEN), & 1 part \\"vocal punch\\" of WAR & PEACE (Pilson's band offering after 80's split of DOKKEN), stir it up and BOOM! You have LYNCH / PILSON - WICKED UNDERGROUND. If you are looking for the sound of the DOKKEN - UNDER LOCK & KEY (One of my Top 5 Best Hard Rock picks ever)days, this is not it. BUT! This is 4 Star, hard rock bliss! Tight songs, KILLER guitar work (as always from Lynch) & decent vocals (Not DON DOKKEN level but decent) make this a must for the true DOKKEN \\"family\\" fan & an enjoyable ride for the hard rock fan of the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"Maybe I'm missing something but this is not like old Dokken or Lynch Mob. It just blows the big one. It should have been called music for tired old men by tired old men. Its elevator music with fuzzy guitar. The album is song after song of uninspired music. If you liked Dokkens album dysfuntional you'll love this. If you liked old dokken and lynch mob don't waste your time. What happened it must be the steroids and the multiple divorces or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"Okay, so it's not 1984 and these guys aren't in their 20s anymore. Keeping this in mind and understanding this is no remnant of \\"Tooth and Nail\\" or \\"Back For The Attack\\", I write this review. I bought this cd on a whim as I am a big Dokken & Lynch Mob fan. I had limited expectations as I believe most 80s hair metal band's recent works are sub-par in respect to their glory day efforts. I have to say that this cd is a lot of fun. I have found it to be extremely addictive from first listen. If you are a fan of the aforementioned bands, I think this is a must have. I have to give props to J. Pilson. Who knew he had the pipes to sing like this? Wish Pils and Furious George would do a follow up. Take it for what it's worth on its own...pretty darn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"This cd in one word....Amazing. I have spun this disc non stop since I picked it up.

The long awaited and much anticpated release of George Lynch's combo effort with ex-Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson. It's a return to the Classic Lynch guitar sound with ear catching melodic crunching rhythms and screaming solos. I got it as soon as it was released and was not disappointed. It's the real thing and delivers the goods!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected much more from this collaboration","review":"After flailing around for several years post-Dokken, George Lynch reunites with Jeff Pilson and makes an album that, while quite listenable, breaks no new ground at all. It's basically \\"Dysfunctional Pt. 2\\". Yeah, there's some cool riffs, and all the characteristic quirks of Lynch's guitar style are on prominent display, but they're totally devoid of any feeling. Pilson's vocals sound like Don Dokken on quaaludes - competant, well executed, and boring as hell. You could bang your head harder to the Wiggles.For the couple of Dokken freaks out there that prefer \\"Dysfunctional\\" and \\"Shadow Life\\" to the earlier stuff, you'll love this. But for me, it's ultimately too derivitive of the past and too devoid of any fire to hold my interest. This looks like yet another in a series of bad post-Dokken career moves for Lynch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was very excited anticipating the arrival of this CD. Unfortunately, this CD stinks. It sounds exactly like King's X. Not a bad band but I thought they could have done much better. I doubt it will sell 5,000 copies. Dokken's latest, Long Way Home\\" is certainly no masterpiece but it is much better than this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks George Lynch!","review":"Rock-n-roll hasn't been the same to me since grunge music took over many years ago. (Glad that has changed). This is easily the best rock cd I've heard in probably ten years. Maybe it's not that this cd is that good but most music has been bad. What I mean is most cd's have 2-3 good songs tops. This cd has one or two bad songs and that's it. I loved Dokken and Lynch Mob(Wicked Sensation). Honestly speaking this is solely because George Lynch is incredible. After Wicked Sensation George made some so so albums with 2-3 good songs. This effort is much better. When I heard Jeff Pilson was singing on this album I wasn't ready to run buy it. However, he does a great job and perhaps in the 80's the name Dokken should have been Pilson. Thanks to Pilson and Lynch for the music. Please stay together and make the next album harder. 4 stars here because it could have and should have been harder guitar wise.By the way, buy Wicked Sensation immediately if you have not heard it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The talent behind Dokken comes to the fore front ....","review":"George Lynch and Jeff Pilson create great music when they get together. And in ' Wicked Underground ' they don't let you down. Breath and a Scream, Ever Higher, Closer to None, Awake .... a purchase you won't regret. Jeff Pilson's vocals are light years ahead of what Don Dokken has been dishing out recently. And George Lynch what can you say ), this master axeman puts his classy touch with great guitar work throughout. This CD when released was a hit on XM / Sirus radio. I'm glad that Jeff continues to stay busy with Foreigner and George keeps punching out Lynch Mob and solo music."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIV","review":"I viewed this films for a class I was going to give to professional counselors -- Film was lacking quality and was aged.

The box for one of the two cartridges was severely damaged (torn open and apparently water damaged) -- hardly retail packaging. There also was a blue HP sticker that held the box closed, sort of. This damage did NOT happen in shipping to me because the other cartridge box was in perfect condition. I can only conclude that whoever stocked my shipment made a conscious decision to include a questionable (refurbished/damaged?) item into my shipment along with the other good cartridge. The cartridge from the damaged box appears to work ok, thus far.

I double checked installation, cleaned, etc to no avail, the cartridge was not working and making a general mess on the paper. Tried the last \\"new\\" cartridge and it did the exact same thing. I was getting concerned that my printer was faulty at this point but put old cartridge back in and it printed correctly. I do not suggest buying these cartridges but if you must, check it out ASAP so you don't miss the return window like I did on the two I can't possibly use now.

I do not know what storage conditions promote deterioration. My personal experience is that the older the cartridge, the more I have to increase the contrast in the printer settings. My guidelines are to avoid toner older than 5 years old. I determine the age by requesting the copyright on the lower left hand corner of the back long side of the box. I strongly encourage readers to respond to their agreement or disagreement with this assessment."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUESTIONABLE value","review":"Printed somewhat on the light side when new.

The only complaint, the printing was light. The lightness was consistent but expected more, until recently. For the next 100 copies, the printed page became streaky and lighter in some areas. Finally, blackening appeared on the printed pages, the printing got really light, and I pulled the cartridge.There might be value in paying $35 or $40 with freight for 700 copies, but I expected more and should have known better than to think I had found exceptional value.Returned to H-P Online and paid $83, including tax and 2nd day delivery.Sorry amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, the print seems faded","review":"I am not happy with the quality of printing from this cartridge, it is definitely not crisp and dark (sorta grayish and faded)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!","review":"This cartridge was sealed in the box, so I assumed it would work perfectly.

The ink on this unit is much lighter than we were used to seeing on a \\"new\\" cartridge. This was advertised as \\"new in the box\\", and it was, but the box appeared to be very old when we received it. Although the box was inside another shipping box, it was scuffed up, torn in a few places... looked like it had been in storage somewhere for a long time.

No, we did not like this one for this main reason...kids praying to Santa. Sorry, but that is just flat out blasphemy in the face of any Christian. We had some explaining to do with our kids about this as well as a few other little things that took place in the show, but that was the main one. We didn't have any Santa issues as some of the other commenters have had. We've never done the Santa thing...our kids have always known he just pretend.

And earlier in the movie the dogs talk about how Santa isn't real.I know that in the same movie they show the \\"real Santa\\", but honestly, at ages 4-6 it isn't even a subject as to WHETHER or not Santa is real. I'm so irritated at this movie.

Just a bad movie in general, despite the rest of the franchise being kid-friendly and cute. For children who believe in Santa, watching a movie where the emphasis is on Santa not being real is pretty stupid. Not even sure why this was past of the movie.

I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have to spend any money for this drivel. But, I am not. The movie is terrible. The doggy dialogue is repetitive, insipid, and grating. The doggy singing quite literally hurts your ears. The plot is stupid, at best. I have seen my fair share of children's movies, some better than others, this is absolutley terrible. My husband and I are planning on conveniently \\"losing\\" this as soon as possible. If your child likes dogs, I suggest \\"Hotel for Dogs,\\" or \\"Bolt.\\"Save yourself an hour of your life by NOT buying this. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas & Puppy Movie","review":"After having seen all the other Buddies movies first, this one has a plot line along those lines, it is cute with good values. I put this on my wishlist for my daughters for Christmas, since our grandparent Christmas was snowed out, they will be so surprised to get their own golden puppies. (we rented it until this one comes)My comments below are to 'negate' the comments of other people:I always tell my children that the Santas at stores and stuff are his helpers, just like they do in the movie.The plot line of this buddies movie is actually better than some of the other buddies movies.It is also better than some of the Christmas movies I have seen.Yes, the puppies follow a stereotype, but they show that even with their differences they are good friends and family.My husband & I agree, that George Wendt makes a fine Santa, just remember Norm was just a character."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR ME, BUT THE KIDS MIGHT ENJOY IT?!","review":"Another predictable and silly film with talking animals that just isn't all that good or entertaining. It's aimed towards the little ones, but also takes a little of the magic out of Christmas for the kids. I suggest a rental before buying this one as I think it would get old after one viewing.......Ruff ruff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what you expect from a Buddies movie","review":"You just cannot overthink movies like this one. It's Christmas, it's puppies, it's is pure entertainment. My kids love this one, mainly because they like to watch what the puppies do. And that is what this movie is all about. Very cute movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately we did not enjoy this movie","review":"I love dogs and my kids love dogs. I got this one because it is a mix of favorites of my kids- dogs and Christmas. Unfortunately we found this a bit boring. Its storyline is below the average - it is too plain and simple. I have a feeling that you cannot find a surprise. My kids could not keep watching until the ending and they went to sleep ion the middle of the movie, which I have not seen so often. I think the producers tried to make this a very simple and easy-to-understand movie for almost everyone. However, I think their effort made it a movie without a real drama and an exciting factor - a gravity toward the movie itself in essence. They should have added simple tweaks in the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for little kids","review":"Great for the kids. I would recommend, my kids loved it (but they like all the \\"buddies\\" movies\\"). Now as a grown up who has seen just about all the buddies movies with my kids, this one was a little drawn out. But since it's really for the kids I would highly recommend for any kid who loves puppies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards for the \\"Buddies\\" movies","review":"My grand daughter loves the Buddies movies. She has the 3 previous movies and loves them. She watches them over and over. I enjoy watching them with her. She is 3 1/2 years old. \\"Space Buddies\\", \\"Air Buddies\\", and \\"Snow Buddies\\" are great. The stories are interesting and the dogs are so cute. I was so excited to see the \\"Santa Buddies\\" coming out. I pre purchased it on Amazon and bought 2 copies. Fortunately I only paid about $7.00 each. I was disappointed in this movie. The story was not nearly as cute as the previous 3. My grand daughter like it OK but has only asked to watch it again one time. She constantly asks to watch the other 3 over and over. I would not pay full price for this movie. It is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Praying to Santa and questioning his existence","review":"I have 5 children. I watched this first to make sure I approve. (I hated the part in the Air Buddies movie where the dog gets drunk... Why did they have to add that? Alcohol is against my religion, and to have the dog get drunk was too much) Back to the topic. Santa Buddies has bright beautiful colors and costumes, and I love that. I hated that one of the buddies said, \\"come on dude, we all know Santa is just Dad in a red suit.\\" In another part the boy pulls off Santa's beard (as another reviewer pointed out) etc... What really got me was seeing children all over the world kneeling down, with hands in the praying positions saying, Dear Santa... Amen. Ridiculous. None of this had to be done. This movie was filled with a lot of questioning Santa and I doubt I'll show it to my 8 yr. old, because she's never questioned Santa and I'm not about to ruin Christmas by getting the wheels turning in her head to question his existence! Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie for Kids","review":"My girls liked this movie because it stars the Buddies. Talking animal flicks always grab their interest. The elves added a nice element to it. It is, of course, best watched during the holidays. My five-year-old continues talking about the movie in the days since we've seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing on so many levels","review":"I watched this on ABC Family with my son instead of the DVD -- I imagine the DVD is better because you don't have a movie twice as long as it should be because half of the showtime is ads. Then again, the other half is dogs sitting there with animated mouths. Talking. And god help us, singing. The smaller dogs sing in high falsetto. Basically, a nightmare.The narrative consists of moments when, just when you think it can't get anymore saccharine, the singing dog gets noticed by people who, up till that point were having a glum Christmas, and then discover the singing dog and their lives because extremely happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"These movies need to stop...","review":"Thats all there is to it.

They absolutely loved it and said it is the best movie they ever saw. They have watched it every day since they received it. Anyone who comes to visit, they make them sit down and watch the movie with them. I think I should have bought a copy for each of them, as I think they will wear this one out from so much use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Out here comes the Santa Buddies!","review":"If you or your children are a fan of any of the \\"Buddies\\" movies then Santa Buddies makes a great holiday addition to your collection. However if you haven't seen any of the previous films I would recommend renting one before purchasing this DVD / Blu-Ray Combo.Without giving away the plot Santa Buddies is about a group of lovable talking puppies who are out to help Santa Claus and save Christmas.This is a 4 out of 5 in my opinion, if you are using the Blu-Ray it features full 1080 hd with 5.1 DTS HD and 5.1 Dolby Digital in French and Spanish. It comes with wonderful extras including: Sing Along Christmas Carols with The Buddies and a Special Santa Claus is Coming to Town Music Video.In the end The Buddies are adorable, however this is an average holiday movie. Your children may enjoy watching it but it won't be a \\" Lets watch it Again!!\\" film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santa Buddies","review":"This is a great movie!

We haven't watched any of the other \\"buddies\\" movies, but I heard so many good things about them that I bought the 4 pack. I now regret that decision. While the movie was cute with a \\"feel good\\" feeling, it was disturbing to see the children at the end of the movie praying to Santa Claus. My husband and I are Christians and let our 5 and 3 year olds believe in Santa, BUT they will not watch a movie that prays to Santa instead of God without some serious direction. My God who sent His son as a payment for our sins on that first Christmas, created me, this world, our beautiful family and is healing my husband of cancer is a jealous God, and Disney crossed the line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Likes It, but...","review":"I'm disappointed. We loved Snow Buddies as a family, so thought we'd try Santa Buddies. Not only is it the worst acting I've ever seen George Wendt do, but they have the children PRAYING TO SANTA. What? Not that everyone has to be a Christian...but if you're buying a Christmas movie, you might want it to include something besides children praying to Santa. No other kids movie, that I'm aware of, shows children on their knees, hands folded, praying to Santa to bring their puppies back. Just plain weird. The 4-year-old likes it, but I feel bad letting my kid watch the ending..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in ghetto language","review":"The story was okay and the dogs were cute but I couldn't get over B-Dawg.

I certainly don't want my 2 year old talking like that so she won't be watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents beware","review":"Okay, so my 2 1/2 year old likes this movie. Maybe even loves it. He asks to watch it all the time, but I think the DVD is going to \\"break\\" or \\"get lost\\" very soon. It's a miserable movie for adults to watch. The creators of these movies can make the dogs' mouths move, but they can't give them any real expression in their eyes. Creeps me out a little.Also, George Wendt is the worst -repeat- WORST Santa I have ever seen. My mom made the comment that he's like Santa with a hangover. So, so true. A monkey could have done a better job playing Santa than George Wendt. We have stressed with our son that this Santa is an actor playing Santa, because I don't know what kid would still want to believe in Santa after watching this.This movie has a decent message. Like any children's movie, parents should preview this before letting your child watch it. And RENT it if you must - don't buy it, for the sake of your own sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Disney","review":"This might pass for the Teletubbie crowd, but this is a pitiful showing for Disney movie.

The set list is also very well chosen.I enjoyed it from the first minute until the last. Doug Aldrich's ability on guitar is breathtaking. The guy can really play the tunes the way they were first written. He gives his personal touch to the solos of the old songs, but always within the original structure of the solo.

The problem with the design is that it cannot overcome the physics of electricity. Netgear does not clearly explain that you cannot push the signal past the homes breaker system in their ads and hence the only way this system works is if your router is on the same circuit as the adapter. New homes break up room/equipment loads into smaller circuits for safety virtually stopping the use of a system like this. My complaint for netgear is that this is not put out there as a significant technical consideration. Although I continued to use their router I had to go wireless to make the system work and wasted money and time getting to the solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Think About It","review":"I purchased these in lieu of running a new phone jack to a bedroom.

On the other hand a group of Anthony's solo master performances are breathtaking, but the most impressive is Julianne Baird and her fortepiano accompany. After two measure intro to aria of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice I am plunged in to a depth of emotions. That's fine singing and accompany that I couldn't find even in the best Orfeo ed Euridice, one of the Jean Claude Malgoire and James Bowman interpretation.This CD is awesome throughout.

This attention to detail gives this reading of Charles Avisons'works a wonderful resonance; indeed, Goodman's version had much life to it, as the faster movements are played with great spirit. The drawback of the recording, to some, is that some of the slower movements come across as a quite choppy. I personally do not feel that way, taking into consideration that Avison's linear writing style inherently makes the slower movements not as smooth as the faster movements. It does not detract from the overall feel from this fine recording.Meant more for the purists who would rather hear authentic period instruments, this cd is still highly recommended for those seeking out great Baroque period works. A wonderful disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is the most-boring book I have ever bought and read","review":"I bought this book because my instructor is the worst in her area.So I hoped that this will help me but never saw that help.The book is written in a very boring manner and includes no motivation ,no interest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly recommended as a cure for insomnia.","review":"I purchased this book because it is the prescribed text for the unit I am studying.I could not read it for more than 15 minutes before my eyes turned to lead.

I did have to spend the money for postage to return the broken mug which was to be refunded to me. I have yet to see that refund. It's been approximately 3 weeks since I returned the mug.The other thing I should mention is that somehow I chipped the lip of one of the mugs but I don't how I did it.

The case is pretty flexy even with the dividers in place. Also, the lid does not line up with the front of the case, requiring you to push in the front to get the lid to shut and latch.

It displays the unbelievable potential of two very young musicians, Jason Marsalis and Irvin Mayfield and the abilities of a seasoned veteran (Bill Summers).

The CD expresses more than simply music. It expresses a feeling that can only be inspred by true musicianship and giftedness.

Unfortunately, I should have waited till intermission and saved the money instead. Not knowing anything about Los Hombres Calientes I expected a true Latin Jazz group as advertised in their billing. Unfortunately this group does not have one ounce of Latin blood or spirit among them and it shows in their music. One of the pieces they attempted last night was Mandinga, a great Cuban guaracha/son which they simply botched. Los Hombres Calientes must be trying to capitalize on the current popularity of Latin music, given their name and billing, however they should call themselves The Hot Men and play New Orleans jazz instead, a genre better suited for their style. If you want to listen to a real Mandinga, buy the Ruben Gonzales version on World Circuit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for great price!","review":"I was very glad to recive this book faster then I expected and have the book in great shape!

When Froggy's mom or dad calls his name they say F-R-O-O-O-O-G-G-G-Y-Y-Y and he answers W-W-H-H-A-A-A-T-T. We change that to Maam or Sir depending on who is calling him.

Mr. Hough plays these pieces very nicely. His technique is exceptional (For example, listen to his \\"Finale\\". Martellato playing is astonishing.). Also I heard his deep affection to these pieces. However, the best is \\"Troisieme Chorale\\" by his own transcription. Even though there are many transcriptions for this Franck's swan song, Mr. Hough's transcription seems to be the most well-written. He utilizes a wide range of keyboards in order it to sound like organ, yet plays this really pianistically. In my personal opinion, this can be sitting next to Bach-Busoni's Chacconne in the history of transcriptions for piano, if Mr. Hough allows to publish this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks modern features","review":"This program will not import bit mapped graphics files, or files created by newer versions of AI.

Good commentary, interviews, and great footage give a good overall account of events. As with most documentaries it is a bit shy on maps.

What's the difference between \\"flaunt\\" and \\"flout\\"? Can you end a sentence with a preposition? Is the plural for octopus \\"octopi\\" or \\"octopuses?\\" The list goes on and on.

It does its basic job with panache, but there's so much added linguistic pleasure between these covers.

I liked Mr Williams' training book, Bird Dog (though I agree with most of the reviewers of that book that it was long on enjoyable anecdote and short on actual training advice). So I had high hopes for Winston. But the book reads like Mr Williams' field journal--and not in a good way. Some of us use our field journals not just to record where we went and what we shot but how we felt and what the day looked like and any conclusions we might have drawn about our dogs or our shooting or perhaps even larger issues. None of that here. Mr Williams basically gives us a 'we went here, flushed this many, shot that many, went home, then went out the next day . . .' He never even waxes sentimental about his dog.

But Neighborhood Animals on the other hand keeps him entertained all the way through, not to mention that I too, at 39, can enjoy singing Old McDonald again. This one lists for 1-4 year olds.

It is so colorful and eye catchy to young children. My child is 28-month's old with Autism. She normally does not like to watch videos for more then 10 minutes, but this one captivates her for the entire 30 minutes. Do not let the 101 minutes on the label fool you, that is 30 minutes of video and 61 minutes of music you can listen to like a CD. The animals are: Dogs, Cats, Rabbits, Cows, Turtles, Fish among many others all beautifully filmed in action. It is much like a really good PBS Nature show, but with each animal on the screen for no more then 5 minutes. In-between the animals segments there are puppets playing and some toys to watch- all animals of course. We love this video and it looks incredible on DVD! A must have as well as World Animals. I just bought some more Baby Einstein DVD's and will review those as well, but the animal ones are by far the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I purchased this DVD after my child's enthusastic response to the \\"Baby MacDonald\\" DVD. I was saddened to find that this DVD included the same old MacDonald song from the other DVD. Also, the puppet shows on the Bonus Material menu are just replays of the puppets from the main movie. The \\"Baby MacDonald\\" puppet shows are true bonus material as they are different from the puppet shows in the main movie. I do not feel this was \\"Baby Einstein's\\" best effort. If you are looking for a great Baby Einstein DVD about animals that is worth its get the \\"Baby MacDonald\\" instead of the \\"Neighborhood Animals.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Einstein DVD through Amazon Marketplace","review":"I mistakenly gave this vendor a negative review and I'd like to retract that.

She absolutely loved it! She has always loved animals and so this, along with world animals are her favorites. I've actually caught myself interested in it while doing dishes even! These videos are aimed toward birth to toddler ages, however even our five year old loves this one with all the animal footage. I highly recommend it- a great way to settle down before naps, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"My son received this video as a gift for his first birthday, and it was the perfect time to start watching it. He does not find Pavlov the dog as funny or fascinating as the other puppets in the Baby Einstein videos, but he LOVES the animals and laughs and giggles at the ones familiar to him. I like the fact that they not only say the animal name, but spell it too, connecting letters with language.My experience with Baby Einstein is that the age on the box really is a good guideline. My son would not have been as captivated by this video at 9 months, but at 12 months (now 15 months) loves it. Picking the video that is geared to your child's age is key, and may have a huge impact on whether or not they enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"I thought that my 6 month old daughter would like this movie because she is already an avid tv watcher but this didn't hold her attention much at all. Everytime it switched sceens, the screen goes black for a second. The music was very lame too and did not attract my daughters attention at all. There was not much speaking or much music (especially in the beginning). It did show lots of differnt animals in a variety of their natural outdoor settings but for a baby the graphics wasn't colorful enough to keep her attention. I would think an older children, maybe 3 or so, would be more interested in this type of video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I ordered this video for our grandaughter who is 17 mths old even she held no interest in this video.

It's designed around 4 themes, animals in the house (dog, cat, mouse), yard, (bird, rabbit, bug), farm (cow, horse, pig)and river (frog, otter, duck). My 14 month old daughter enjoys it, especially the children singing \\"Old MacDonald\\" during the farm sequence, and the flying cow marrionette. I didn't give it a full five stars largely because, on the whole, the quality of the puppetry (as opposed to others in the series like Baby Shakespeare and Baby Van Gogh) is not of the same caliber and the toy sequences don't seem to have the same level of wit and humor that sparkles in the other videos. My opinion is that this video is simply following their tried and true formula, granted, it is one that, judging from my child's reaction, works well, but maybe needs some fine tuning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puppies & Kitties!","review":"This DVD is great because it used objects from the real-world along with music and art to captivate a child's attention.

This one also has a DVD-ROM coloring book, so you can print pages for your child to color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loved the puppets","review":"My daughter loved Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals and World Animals from the time she was 14 months to about 22 months. She loved the puppets and the real life pictures really held her attention. Learned a lot about animals and these videos really helped her to recognize a lot of different animals.She didn't seem as interested in this video as much as the Baby Bach and Baby Mozart videos before 14 months. She would get bored with the real life video parts until she was a little older. But as she got closer to 1 and 1/2 she started to lose interest in the Baby Bach and Baby Mozart videos and started to like the Baby Dolittle ones the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves This Dvd","review":"This is a great Dvd, my 19 month old son would watch this all day if I let him. He begs for me to put it on and then he jumps up and down and claps his hands as soon as the little caterpillar appears. We have 5 different Baby Einstein Dvd's and this is by far his favorite. We also have the World Animals, Baby Van Gogh (He doesn't like this one at all), Baby Mozart and then Baby Mac Donald.

She is fascinated by animals in real life, and enjoys Baby MacDonald, but this DVD freaks her out. I think it's the motion picture of all the cows coming towards her.

She loves animals and she especially likes the cat segment. She has a Baby Einstein Cat boardbook and she holds it in one hand and the video case in the other while she watches. Even our cats love to watch, but, they prefer the bird segment. I'm not lying, I have a picture for proof! I've noticed that my daughter will dance to the music and she really likes the puppet routines. No other video or cartoon holds her attention like the Baby Einsteins."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are not a big TV family","review":"I am not into TV too much. I have one or two shows that I am really into, but if something more interesting or demanding comes up, then I am not heart broken about missing out. Maybe that is why my little boy is not at all interested in this video. I didn't want to be a parent that let the TV babysit their child, but I was hoping that this video would give me a few minutes to myself and prove to be stimulating to my baby. I bought it for him at 11 months and he was not interested. I waited a few months a reintroduced it. Nothing. I tried again a few weeks ago. Basically my little boy is too busy and he seems to learn the most when me or my husband point things out to him. I am amazed at all the other parents who say their children are enthralled by this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your kid might like it But it doesn't mean it's a good thing","review":"Although the idea behind \\"Baby Einstein\\" collection is excellent, the implementation (presentation) and execution of the idea are very poor.After reviewing \\"Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals\\", which many people gave it 5 stars, I was quite disappointed...Objectively speaking, this program doesn't deserve 5 stars. It is better to take the idea and implement it in your own ways... See it for yourself! I almost bought it and the entire \\"Baby Einstein\\" when I saw the first few 5 star reviews on Amazon.com!! Until I read couple reviews that actually reviewed the \\"program\\" not \\"the reaction of their children to the program\\". Those reviews gave me more of a objective view on this tape and the \\"Baby Einstein\\" series.Get this program mainly for its entertainment value, not for education one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen Better","review":"This isn't the best video I've seen. I played it for my 8 month old for the first time and I saw things that I personally don't agree with, i'.e. swatting at a fly. My husband & I teach our kids to respect all animals. The repitition is good but I think the dog puppet in the beginning of each segment is confusing to small kids when the background music sounds like a horse or when the dog pretends he's other animals. I'm waiting for our next order of the Bach/Mozart set so I hope it is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately the puppets are often unkind to each other","review":"Most of this series of videos are captivating and engaging. Unfortunately there are many scenes where the puppets are overtly unkind to each other. For example, one puppet will \\"trick\\" another and then laugh at its misfortune. This may be some parent's idea of quality viewing for their child - but it wasn't for me. I wrote Julie Aigner - the creator of the series - to let her know my feelings about it and I threw all the videos away, except for the Santa Baby one which doesn't have any such scenes in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this movie!","review":"Neighborhood Animals is one of my son's (10 1/2 months old) favorite Baby Einstein movies. He loves the part about the dogs and cats. There is good music and lots of action to keep his attention.

Suddenly all her pain was gone and she was as happy as could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 16 month old will watch it to the end!","review":"Now that my little boy is learning about animals I thought this would be a good introduction for him. I was right he will watch it all the way through, he is not one for sitting for very long. The animals scenes are very well shot and it has taught him about bugs and otters as well as his favorites like the dog, ducks and cats. I recommend this video for one year and up. It is fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done it again!","review":"Another great video from the Baby Einstein company. My 10 month old was enchanted with this video.

I am not disappointed and neither is my one-year-old son. He's limited to watching only Baby Einstein DVDs and squeals with excitement when it's his TV time. He loves the puppet show, the catchy music, and the pictures and sounds of the animals. He can't get enough Baby Dolittle."},{"rating":"1","title":"baghhhh.","review":"Somebody gave me this book, since I'm an amateur tracker; I doubt I'd have bought it if I read the reviews. Parts of it were truly delightful, I admit, but I got a stomach-ache everytime I read some sort of pseudo-science or bastardization of actual science. When factual claims are made that contradict what we know is true (I won't repeat the other reviewers' comments), or are made without evidence or reliable references, I can't trust anything else the author says. It's a shame, because, for example I suspect the relation between foot shape and being \\"down to earth\\" is bunk (in lieu of carefully controlled studies to verify this), there *has* been a recent study showing a correlation between index/ring finger length ratio and the subject's sexual orientation or athletic ability. But, as with most pseudo-science, such actual science is disregarded in favor of wishful thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't pass the first chapters","review":"The philosophy and the ideas behind the first few chapters were so silly that I started suspecting that the author was a creationist in disguise.

These guys have a great formula for presenting new words, helping you understand them, then not using them for a bit and then returning to them to see if you remember them. You really get the sense that someone worked out with great care how to best build one concept on the next.My only worry is..what about when I get to the end of Hebrew II?

What a Disappointment. Almost all the songs are only partially played, and the sound quality is mediocre. There is way too much talking by an inane host who talks nonsensically non-stop. If you want a great Abba Concert, I suggest you get Abba, In Concert which features well recorded songs from the 1979 Wembley concert. It is visually stunning with Abba looking and sounding their best. If you want a goofy movie about Abba, then get Abba the Movie. If you want a first rate Abba Concert, get Abba In Concert.

If you are a fan of their music you will almost certainly enjoy this disc because of the concert footage and live recordings. However, if you are simply looking to watch a movie, Abba \\"The Movie\\" won't deliver. There is really not anything close to a plot or storyline in this film, some would call it more of a \\"Rockumentary\\" or in this case (am I coining new terminology here?) a \\"Popumentary\\" because ABBA are certainly the greatest pop act of all time. Mind you I'm not slamming ABBA here, I'm their self professed biggest fan. I just don't think this film was ever intended to impress anyone other than a fan of ABBA, or a would-be fan. If you don't like their music you won't like this film. Even if you like their music there is a small chance you might not like this film.As for me I'm a die hard fan, I'm buying it for the live footage alone.WSCarthage, TX"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte goes pop","review":"Good Charlotte has had alot of songs that leaned towards pop, but this song is by far their most pop-influenced. Its almost got a new-wave sort of vibe about it. The musicianship is simple enough, but still sounds good, especially the riffs in the bridge. The lyrics are exactly how a power-pop song should be- stupid, simple, but memorable. The song does send a message though- its about materialism and how it takes hold of and overpowers relationships. Of course the song has that energetic, explosive, melodic, infectious, uplifting signature GC sound though. Good song, overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"no way!!!","review":"This song is sooo anoyying!

No more wit or insight than you'll find in a ordinary \\"chick-lit\\" novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was 1985 a slow year for novels?","review":"I have read about a quarter of all the books that have won the Pulitzer, and I am attempting to read them all in the next year or so. I think 1985 may have been a slow year for writers. This book is good, yes, but Pulitzer good? No. I never really connected with either character, and felt that some of the writing, for lack of a better word, was cheesy (i.e the entire \\"Fido\\" creation). Compared with the Pulitzer winners from the years before and after, the book is weak. This may be an unfair criticism, and maybe the Pulitzer stamp on the front of the book lead to unfair expectations, but the book just does not do \\"it\\" for me. And that undefineable \\"it\\" is what makes me not recommend this book to other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous Tales of Americans in London","review":"The sometimes overlapping stories of Vinnie Miner and Fred Turner, two Americans conducting literary research in London, prove entertaining, even if a bit contrived. The earlier portions of the stories are much better at communicating the tongue-in-cheek narrative on American perceptions of England (and American perceptions of America) and some of the dialogue and musings that Lurie provides for Miner are down right hysterical.This is very easy and pleasant read. The strength of this book is Lurie's ability to provide satirical and witty commentary on life in general and on life abroad. The power of this is diluted as the focus of the book changes from that commentary to the details of a story which become overdramatized. In doing this, Lurie loses much of the cleverness contained in the first three-quarters of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touches of Amazing Writing With One Unfortunate Flaw","review":"I found this novel confusing. Two distinctly different stories play out side by side and, while the main characters in each story do interact, I see very little relationship between the two stories or the need for Fred's story at all. For me, it was simply a distraction until I could back to Vinnie. Vinnie's story is compelling, witty, heartbreaking, funny, and quite amazingly written. However, Fred's story is boring, silly, unbelievable, and sometimes annoying. Vinnie's character is so well defined, while Fred remained an unclear foggy character throughout the book. I adored Vinnie and her imaginary dog, Fido, (who represents her self pity) so much as to give this book 4 stars. This is clearly her story and should have stood alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Love Affair is with Britain","review":"This is a gem of a novel and I praise the Pulitzer committee for choosing a book that is so witty and fun to read. While the story is about two different \\"odd couples,\\" the real love affair is with Britain and all the possibilities it offers for the traveler. Vinnie is not your typical heroine--you may love or hate her, but she is real and I really cared about her journey. The novel is full of other quirky characters, too, that you will keep you amused throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"LATER DAY FEELGOOD","review":"As the previous review ststes , this line up of Dr. Feelgood is not the classic Wilko Johnson period.

I was really looking forward to reading about this woman engineer in the Southwest. The idea is intriguing and the setting unusual. But Ms. Schumacher is not a good writer, even taking into account that this is her first book. The cliches are abundant and the characters are flat and sterotypical. There is the sexy cop, the bossy secretary, the typical sexists who give the spunky woman a hard time. The author's idea of character development is to give a cop a stutter. The original idea of having a woman engineer as the protagonist gets lost in the worn out devices used by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really contemporary classical music?","review":"Who cannot admire the technical felicity of Liebermann's second piano concerto?

Short-sighted conflict of interest and tunnel vision at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom Vs Security","review":"The book is enlightening. Many people feel that we have to choose between freedom and security for our future. The author argues that we can have both - freedom and security. The author calls this \\"The Open Society Paradox.\\"The driver's license is the identifying card that almost everyone uses to exist and navigate in our society. The driver's license is the ticket to acceptability in our society. Bailey explains that getting a paper driver's license is too easy and therefore it is too easy to switch identities.The author argues for a secure biometric national ID card. He calls this the technologies of openness. He downplays the severe loss of privacy that this would cause. Bailey believes that with this secure national ID card we can be both free and secure. I do not think that he makes his case. He believes that giving up one's privacy does not endanger one's freedom. He is wrong about this. He says openness is coming and we can not stop it.Political Issues (C-Span 354/1)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely & thought provoking!","review":"Bailey has distilled the issues of privacy and security in the 21st century into a very readable and informative work!

This is one of the great paradoxes of our time. Personally, I have grown tired of hearing the same people voicing the same tired banter. When I saw Dennis Bailey's book I thought it would be more of the same played out song. However, after reading Bailey's book, I was pleasantly surprised. Bailey addresses the same debate with new insight and a new perspective. Not only does he provide new ideas, but he presents them in a clear easy to read manner.

I loved most of these actors and I felt that the situation would have the recipe for a fantastic comedy. A guy who can't over his ex and goes on vacation only to be faced with quirky and weird situations that should lead into corny but awesome hilarity.Unfortunately it just falls really flat. I found the acting to be inexcusably poor and the humorous lines were more disturbing and weird than laugh out loud funny. The side characters such as the married couple who doesn't enjoy having sex don't fit in with the plot well and tended to annoy me more than entertain.I loved movies liked Knocked Up and Superbad and was lead to believe that this was on par with that type of comedy and it doesn't even begin to compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Laugh Once","review":"I love comedies. This movie is so unfunny that the writer, director and producer should be sued for false advertising. I bought this movie used for $5 at Blockbuster.

Mila Kunis2. A Hawaiian version of the song \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\"The \\"Who can be the loudest in bed\\" scene was not funny at all. That scene looked as if it was ripped off from \\"The Cooler.\\" By the way, \\"The Cooler\\" is a great drama with a few bits of genuine comedy.

When Brenner decides to go to Hawaii to take his mind off the break-up, he is stunned to find that Snow and Sarah are in the middle of vacationing at the same resort where Brenner books. What follows is pure hilarity, as Snow, Marshall, and Brenner encounter each other throughout the movie, making for awkward encounters as well as entertaining humor with the other side characters. When Segal develops a relationship with the beautiful hotel-worker Rachel, played by Mila Kunis, jealousy is injected into the picture.A laugh-out-loud comedy! Warning: extreme sexual humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"It's kind of a formula movie, but it's still enjoyable. Hey, it's a formula because it works, right? Jason Segel's girlfriend leaves him for Russell Brand's rock star character. He ends up getting away to try and recover and end up...at the same hotel where his ex and her new guy are staying. You can see where this is going, but getting there is pretty dang funny.

I almost gave up on it a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't usually go to extremes on reviews, but I thought it was awful","review":"In order to give some context, I thought The Hangover and Old School were hilarious, but this thing was terrible. They seemed to have followed the philosophy that if you can't come up with real humor, substitute vulgarity into that gaping hole. So that's what they did. I very rarely give below 2 stars or above 4 but this film was pushing it to get a one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical! Love Jason Segel!","review":"This movie I have had to watch over and over! Jason Segel is SO FUNNY! The whole movie kept my attention and it was laugh after laugh! You have to get the unrated version and watch the other version, not the theaterical. This dvd gives 2 versions of the film. I love the scene where he is doing yoga and attempting a head stand! Hysterical! This Jason Segel is a big break out star from this movie and I really look forward to seeing him in more films."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever.","review":"This film is amazing, and that's and understatement. Anyone who gives this less than 5 stars is crazy. so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny movie","review":"I felt that this movie was very funny. It's a good movie to watch with adults but because of the nudity, I wouldn't recommend it for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performances","review":"A surprisingly enchanting film, \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\" is one of the \\"sleeper\\" comedies of 2008.....no pun intended. It has heart, charm and a bundle of sympathetic characters. In short, it's a very good film.Credit must go mostly to writer/star Jason Segel, who weaves a tale of broken dreams and second chances... where love and loyalties change faster than a Hawaiian sunset. Two supporting actors deserve special mention...Mila Kunis, whose direct and passionate involvement with Peter (Segel) is a real hit. But my favorite of the film is Russell Brand, the valium-infused British number two boyfriend of Sarah's. He steals almost every scene he's in. The one disappointment is Paul Rudd, whose character never has much chance to develop. It's too bad, as his talents are underused here.\\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\" is light enough to keep you involved and just deep enough to hold your curiosity. I recommend it for its well-told story and its \\"down to earth\\" fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgetting Sarah...","review":"Love love love this movie! It's hilarious and very entertaining. Kristen Bell plays her role so well you despise her, that British guy is AWESOME. How can I find that song he sings, \\"Inside You\\"?? Is it available?

Indeed it's one of the best comedies. Jason Siegel and russel bran pd were classic themselves.

The package arrived without the insert that contains the activation code, so no digital copy. I went to the Universal Studios support website and sent in a request for support, and got no response. I returned the defective copy to Amazon, got a replacement very quickly (thank you, Amazon support!), and the replacement was identical - no insert, no activation code - no digital copy!! I went to the web and found a large number of posts from people that had the exact same experience. It look like Universal is having big-time quality control issues.Forgetting Sarah Marshall [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny over the top movie","review":"I very much enjoy Jason Segal, so this movie was set to be a hit with me from the start. The gag reel is hilarious and the movie looks GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless","review":"Another crude movie comes out of Hollywood. Not only was it completely tasteless, but the story was poorly written and the film was poorly executed along with terrible acting and even worse sound/music quality. Why are we allowing our brains to be fed this diet of junk? Maybe if we all stop watching such crass movies, the writers will be forced to come up with something wholesome and meaningful as well as entertaining.

There is not a single weak song to be seen. Personal favourites include Man Of Action, Advertising On Police Cars, and Sort Of A Protest Song. This is an essential addition to anyone's CD collection, so buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Strong Effort","review":"Relative to a MGB album, this is a pretty good record. Compared to the rest of rock music today this is a fantastic record. Although I don't find it as satisfying (as a whole) as Beautiful Midnight, there are some great songs here. And please stop with the radiohead comparisons. They don't sound like radiohead. They have a sound that is unique to MGB. Highlights include: \\"Advertising on Police Cars\\", \\"The Rat Who Would Be King\\", and \\"The Fall of Man\\". One of my top 2 records of 2001. The other being Rival Schools-United By Fate. I know you haven't heard of them either but believe me some great rock music. You just have to look hard to find it anymore.PS-if you are afraid to buy this record because of import prices then don't. Go to HMV.com or cd-plus.com, both are Canadian online stores and will reduce your cost significantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but could be better","review":"Matthew Good himself was dissapointed with this cd, and no matter how good it is, it still could have been better... tracks like \\"the fall of man\\" and \\"carmelina\\" are a little too bassy, while others could have been mastered a little better... but in general, this is an awesome cd with great songs, and is worth the pricetag...."},{"rating":"2","title":"not his best, but it's still great","review":"I'll admit that I'm a damn near obsessive MGB fan. I pre-ordered Audio of Being, just so I could have it ASAP.This album isn't quite as good on the whole as Beautiful Midnight, but it's still the best album I've heard this year (not counting Beautiful Midnight US). It has hits like Carmelina, Anti-Pop, and Truffle Pigs. It also has some flat out creative songs (see: Advertising on Police Cars, The Rat Who would Be King, Man Of Action, Tripoli). All in all, a great CD.

Most particulary, the performances of \\"Force Ten\\", \\"Territories\\", and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\". In my opinion, the only downside is that it looks like it was recorded with 70's cameras.

And there's multiple copies on ebay! I just got mine and I have no complaints! Check it out.There's also talk about them releasing a DVD of the Vapor Trails show performed in Brazil. I assume this will be a worldwide release. Truly fantastic show if you missed it. Nearly 3 hours long. The 7th time I saw them in 22 years and easily one of the best.

You can tell that Mark Blanchard is not a true yogi. I have DVD's by Shiva Rhea,Bryan Kest,Erich Shiffman, Richard Freeman, and David Swenson which are great. If you are currently doing yoga and enjoy it, I would recommend buying one of the DVD's from one of the people above."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy sucks","review":"This guy is so into himself and totally misses the point of practicing Yoga. There is no flow to the class and he practically molests the women in his video. Its essentially all about him, how great he thinks he is and how unenlightened he sounds. If those new to Yoga buy this video, they should know that not all Yoga teachers are like this joker.A great instructor is Brian Kest. His voice bothers some people, but at least he generates a positive mental energy that helps all those who take his class go deeper into their Yoga practice.

I bought this for my son, 18 months. I like Corduroy a lot and so does my son. This is a fun book to read as you can do a lot with the child whilst reading it (ie) you can pretend to be a slide with your legs, you can sing \\"rain rain go away\\" and much more.

My son loves is, so do I!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keys are not wooden and not in tune","review":"This is a cute toy, but the one I received has one key way out of tune. I got it for my young son because he loves music and I wanted him to be able to make his own, but teaching young ears with an out-of-tune instrument seems defeating. I will be exchanging this in hopes that it's just a problem with this particular one, since the other keys sound good.Also, this is not a xylophone (with wooden keys), it's a glockenspiel (with metal keys). When the manufacturer says \\"wooden,\\" they only mean the frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A musical instrument should be MUSICAL, even if just a toy!","review":"Bought this item thinking that I was getting a great throwback toy. You know, something we all remember. Well, my Fisher Price xylophone from the '70s was at least IN TUNE. This one sounds pretty crummy all the way around. Too bad, because I really wanted to be able to add this to the set of musical toys my daughter has. Alas, I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly out of tune","review":"I bought this for my two-year-old to play with.

Educational Planet has been helpful to date, and I am hoping to return for a refund and seek out another toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Instrument!","review":"This is a great xylophone. I find that xylophones are a great first instrument for kids. Little ones love to hit things and make noise anyway so this combines those two loves perfectly.

He traces the myriad connections among various activist NGOs and their supporting foundations. Through this very detailed work, Manheim \\"shows you the money\\" and how the leftist agendas of various foundations and individuals fund puppet NGOs and activist organizations who have companies in their protest cross-hairs. By tracing these connections, he demonstrates that modern anti-corporate protest is not always about the issue that the public sees on the surface. It's often about a hidden agenda, an agenda set by the unseen funders, to change the political economy of society by pressuring corporations via puppet organizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The putter is fine.

I realize that he expresses certain views on religion and evolution that are creatively couched in his Discworld novels, but this book seemed to be a more aggressive indoctrination of those ideals, possibly made more so by the co-authors. Also in the paperback form I must say the font type and size were difficult to read. All in all not as enjoyable as his other Discworld works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pratchett Disappointment","review":"I was expecting the tongue-in-cheek humor of Pratchett, and this is predominently a history of Creationism versus Evolution, not very funny at all, huh?

The Diskworld story chapters get shorter and thinner and don't add up to even an Ok short Watch story. I appreciate what this series of books is trying to do, but please Mr. Pratchett, let it go. I've been a Diskworld fan for years and I'm sad to say that I've watched the humor dry out from book to book. Thud! was boring, mostly unfunny, and barely insightful in a politically-correct-why-can't-we-all-just-get-along way, but this one is worse. Even hard-core Pratchett junkies should take a pass on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Globe\\" series","review":"i found the second book in this series by accident and read it first without realising it was part of a series of 3. Now that I have read the other 2, I would advise others to read them in order! Pratchett fans will love the brilliant craziness of the Magicians on Discworld - linking their doings and un-doings to real science is great as this makes it both palatable and (mostly) more understandable. Be warned though that the real sceince bits are not just \\"popular science\\" they are really real and sometimes difficult in the extreme.

This book is an excellent read for people of all ages.Awakenings brought back so many memories for me. The issues that she presented in Awakenings such as intrarace racism was definitely one that I could relate too. You see - the lighter the skin tone, the straighter the hair texture, the more that you were viewed as being better many times in the black community. As a child, I saw this many times, and even now as an adult it is still happening. Ross - Rodgers also brought up other issues such as self esteem and best friend issues. What was interesting was that even though the book is fiction, the issues are real.

Highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Good","review":"The timing for the video content is off and doesn't match the music, the music is good and well-played but arranged to the point that whole movements that are originally 10 minutes long are only like 2 minutes in the video and we foud that frustrating since we listen to Beethoven un-arranged regularly. I also noticed that there was a lot of silent time in this particular video or times at which music is played but it isn't anything I've heard that was composed by Beethoven or, well, maybe it was but edited so to be simplified that it was no longer recognizable. My child may be only 6 mos but he recognizes good music when he hears it having been exposed to it from the time he was in the womb and since and this video didn't catch his interest at all. The BE Mozart music is good though so if you're looking for a video with good music do that one or the Wordsmouth...altogether, though, I recommend just buying the c.d.s and not the composer vids."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I purchased Vol. 1 which is a series of 6 Baby Einstein DVDs (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Neptune, World Animals, Neighborhood Animals)for my baby when she was a newborn. She is now 17 months old, and she has never cared for any of them EXCEPT for the Neighborhood Animals DVD which depicts scenes of familiar animals like cows, horses, cats, dogs, etc. She really loves the part when they sing \\"Old MacDonald\\". Baby Beethoven is boring except for towards the end when they show some scenes with real babies which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. I think overall the Baby Einstein series is overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless content","review":"OK, I'll admit that my 3-month-old son loves this video, but he pretty much loves anything that comes up on the TV (like most babies his age). As a mother, however, I am very disappointed with the content. Sure, the music may be stimulating, but this video teaches my son NOTHING. I prefer other children's videos that incorporate counting and colors and even other languages along with the stimulating music. (The original Baby Einstein does this, but it is very poor in quality). And I'm not the type of mom who uses videos as babysitters - I like to sit with my son and watch with him, pointing out different concepts as we go along. Needless to say, I'm bored stiff watching this video - all I can say to my son is \\"oh - another spinning toy!\\" I'm not impressed, and I'm very surprised what big sellers these videos are. I could make one at home!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Symphony of Dud\\"","review":"This follows the same format as most of the Baby Einstein videos with lots of toys, kids playing, shiny colorful spinning things, puppets making noises, photos of babies, etc. The only thing I even somewhat liked was the magnetic Hide 'n' Seek Doors (that was kind of a cool toy) and the colored oil in water. There are no words spoken. I wouldn't recommend it. Get some good music cd's if you want your baby exposed to symphonies. If you really want to get some Baby Einstein dvd's then the only ones I personally like are Baby Neptune (water), Baby Galileo (sky), Baby Newton (shapes) & Numbers Nursery (1 - 5). All the rest are definitely not worth it, in my opinion. I have written reviews for the ones I like that I just listed and many others. Please read my reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"I can't believe this product would even get a 1 star rating. There are much better learning videos out there that are better than this one. I wouldn't waste my money or my daughter's time watching it. My 20 month old was completely bored!

Seriously. I'm not a fan of babies watching TV, but these movies are the most amazing thing I've ever seen. My 9 month old daughter dances, claps, talks, and laughs out loud to these movies! I introduced her first one (Baby Mozart) at 3 months just to get her listening to classical music, and was so amazed I started buying all that I could find of these movies.I am a music educator and love classical music. It's been proven that this music promotes cognitive development, and the video is exceptional. The movie uses everyday items and toys to accompany the music and my daughter just squeals in delight. I don't believe in using TV to babysit your child, and this definitely does NOT do only that. I enjoy watching it with her, and watching the enjoyment she gets out of it. It's just the right length as well. She not only watches it, she is TRANSFIXED by every second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Excelent conditions. Plays even better than the brand new that I bought. The new ones seems to have a beep or electric noise and this one dosen't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the others","review":"This is my most recent purchase of the Baby Einstein series, we have all of them! I must say, I was a little disappointed in the sound quality of this video. The toys are better and my son seems happy that he recognizes some of the toys that he has at home. However, if you try to turn the volume up, it sounds terrible (and I do not mean turning the volume up high). Maybe I just have a faulty tape, but I was not as happy with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DVD FOR THE LITTLE ONES!","review":"I didn't have much faith that these videos would actually capture the interest my four month old. I was SO wrong. It really grabs his attention and, I hate to say it, allows me at least 27 minutes to get myself ready for the day (or type this review!).My only problem with the video is the advertising at the beginning (about 4 to 5 minutes worth). Advertisements should be left until the very end, NOT the beginning when you just want to pop it in and have your child sit to watch it. Not only are the advertisments LOOOONNNG, you CAN'T FAST FORWARD OR SKIP THEM!!! Disney was very selfish when they shoved their ads on us this way. The same holds true for every other Baby Einstein video I have. ANNOYING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what mom and dad would do","review":"My 2.5 month old son loves this DVD. It's basically a bunch of toys for baby to look at, just like having Mom or Dad use toys in front of baby (and he probably doesn't know the difference at this age). The toys are pretty cool and are not ones that you probably already use with baby at home. My son's favorite part is when they show other babies. My daughter was not as fond of this video when she was his age - I have a feeling whether or not baby likes these shows depend somewhat on baby's personality. She was just not as interested in moving objects, and the music wasn't interesting enough to catch her attention either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Baby Mozart\\"","review":"\\"Baby Beethoven\\" is a better title than \\"Baby Mozart,\\" but my daughter's favorite DVD now is \\"Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time.\\" Classical music is fine, but I wanted my girl to know all the classic nursery rhymes that I grew up knowing. \\"Singing Babies\\" has gotten her making sounds and clapping. I am very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is fun","review":"This whole Baby Einstein line of products are all just great. This DVD is just as fun as the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 month old loves it!!!","review":"My 2 month old will sit in her bouncy seat and watch and smile....its great....our morning routine is that she has her bottle, then I put her in her bouncy seat and put on the dvd so I can eat breakfast and clean...sometimes she even watches it twice!! and then sometimes we also do this so my husband and I can eat dinner :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks into tears???","review":"I have a one year old who LOVES the baby Einstein DVDs. We have Mozart, Bach and Newtown and he loves them all.Then I bought Baby Beethoven.For whatever reason my son will start crying the minute the first scene begins? I have no idea why, but for whatever reason he is frightened out of his wits when this DVD starts playing. I've tried several times to play the DVD but it always turns out the same way. Uncontrollably crying.So just be aware when and if you purchase this DVD. It could bring you kid to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Change","review":"Our 2yr old really enjoyed watching this.Wanted to give her something different to watch besides the usual Elmo,Pooh and others. Great stimulation and imagination involved with this Baby Beethoven. I suggest getting this on DVD for better sound quality...still a must have on VHS or DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The sound quality was awful. The music sounded tinny and full of static. The pictures were not much different from other videos in this series. Unfortunately, I didn't keep the sales receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money and make your own","review":"Why people like Baby Einstein dvds is beyond me. Do yourself a favor, buy a camcorder, a pair of socks for hand puppets and make your own. these were clearly made in someone's basement, horrible horrible dvds. We bought the set and only opened 3, now it just takes up space. there are much better dvds out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is always one in the crowd...","review":"I should start by explaining that in our household have numerous Baby Einstein videos --Mozart, both Dolittle's, Shakespeare, Van Gogh-- which we adore and watch nearly every day. My 2.5 year old and 10 month old both love the music and the whimsical puppets, etc.THAT SAID, my 10 month old (who was 7 at the original time of purchase) can not stand to watch the Baby Beethoven video. He bursts into tears every time I have tried to show it to him. (I've tried different points on the tape.)I have no idea why this should be so (music too somber? puppets too scary?) but I thought I should warn those who were making their first purchase to try any of the other videos.Pam T~"},{"rating":"2","title":"works like a miracle with fussy babies","review":"This DVD is absolutely wonderful! It is one of the only things that will quiet my fussy baby. It is truly a lifesaver, as it occupies him so that I can get work done at home. He watches the DVD for the entire 30 minutes straight! Not even children's shows on TV will hold his attention like that. Contrary to some of the other reviews, I find the video very entertaining and even comical in parts ! The images are perfect for babies, and the music is well orchestrated for little ones, yet entertaining enough for adult ears. If you buy the DVD version, you don't have to listen to any of the advertisements that the reviewers complained about after buying the VHS version. I would definitely recommend this DVD for anyone who has a baby. We will be buying more Baby Einstein products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product and service","review":"Excellent product and service...my grandson and I are thoroughly enjoying watching the DVD! Product in great condition and received in a timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll over, Beethoven! insipid electronica commercial crap","review":"Wow.You're considering paying $15 for a 30-minute long commerical of toys operating (oh, and look, you can order these toys, conveniently, from our website) and some really, really lame puppetry, and some shots of kids banging around on aforementioned toys (oh, and look, you can order these toys, conveniently, from our website--sic), and some of the most passionless, artless music I have ever heard. Please reconsider.Yes, it might keep your small child interested for a while, but there are much better ways to spend your money if that is what you want. (My small children are wildly entertained by ripping up toilet paper, for instance--for this price, you can buy a lot of toilet paper) If you want your kid to like Beethoven, why not buy them an actual CD of an actual orchestra playing actual music? I found this DVD incredibly dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rinky dink video","review":"My child was not interested in this video at all! The way in which the information was disseminated in the video is no better than what I give to my child just sitting in front of him with flash cards or a book. And the silly theatrics of the video are horrible, my point, this video is garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast & Affordable","review":"100% satisfied. I was able to find what I wanted quickly, the vendor emailed me a confirmation of my order right away, it came on time, and was in perfect condition.

It is by far my favorite to listen to and watch, good music and the baby loves it! Can't go wrong with beethoven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!","review":"My 6 week old just LOVES this!! We have been showing him the DVD since he was born and now he will watch the whole thing sitting in his bouncy seat. Today I actually played it all the way through - TWICE!! We bough the whole set and just adore all of them but Baby Beethoven is the best by far!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video!","review":"My son received this video for Christmas when he was 9 mos. He is now 1 and we love this video!! On many occasions, it's been a lifesaver. We've used it when he's upset and nothing else calms him down. He likes \\"talking\\" to the video and often laughs at it. However, I think I've recently discovered the best thing about this video - it's a great time to trim his fingernails!! I don't like having to fast forward through the ads at the beginning but it's not a huge issue. This is our only Baby Einstein video but we are planning on getting more - we have several of the board books which are also excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 minutes of preview on every dvd you can't fast forward through","review":"Don't buy their crap. There is 10 minutes on every video that you have to watch that you can't fast forward through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared my son!!!","review":"My son loved Baby Mozart right from the start, but he is 8 months old and Baby Bethoven really scared him. At several points in the video, something pops out of nowhere with a scary sound- like a toy spider- and he actually screamed and started crying! It was awful. I am saving the video for when he is hopefully older but just wanted to pass this along for other parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"best product ever","review":"I can't tell you how wonderful this product is! I have fussy 5 month old twin boys and nothing calms them other than the Baby Einstein videos. These videos will save your sanity if you have a fussy infant. You'll kick yourself that you did not invent this product when you see how simple the images are, but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Video Quality","review":"I am a parent of 2 small girls and I also own the Baby Mozart, Baby Einstein, and Baby Bach DVD's. Out of all of these Baby Mozart is the better video. The problem I have with this title is the video quality is poor. For example, in one scene there is this toy train that goes around and around, when the Camera pans a certain way, the entire image jiggles as if there was a problem with the camera. I can't believe that Disney would allow a distribution of a product that is so second rate. The poor video quality is not on the other DVDs. I wished I had returned the product. The puppet work in this title is also several notches down in quality compared to the Baby Mozart DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype?","review":"These videos get rave reviews and I just don't understand it. It is your basic toys videotaped with music. My son watches them but there are better things out there. And I would NOT buy them again or any other videos for the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son loves it!","review":"I caught my 5 week old son staring at the saints game on tv and was thinking \\"no way he is actually watching this\\", so we popped in this baby beethoven dvd someone bought us before he was born to see if he really would watch it this early. He loves it! We watched this morning and I dont think he turned his head away from the tv once. I even turned him around and he turned his head with the tv. It works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tis never too early!","review":"I love these products for babies -- the music is soothing, babies are soaking up culture and by the time they are 3 months old, they are also watching the videos on the TV that go with the music, thereby learning more! Terrific baby shower gifts, also!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK video, terrible sound quality","review":"I have 8-month old triplets who love to watch Baby Mozart and Baby Bach each afternoon before bed. Thinking it would be good to expand our collection, I ordered Baby Beethoven (VHS) and was very disappointed to discover the sound quality was horrendous - very distorted, crackles, etc. The images look great ... but the whole point of the tape is the music with images. Just beware if you are considering this purchase. The Baby Einstein ads in the beginning of the tape are annoying too - very commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waaay Too Long Intro","review":"First I must say that my daughter just LOVES this video! But we must fastforward through about 15 minutes of advertisments to finaly be able to watch it. Otherwise though, this is one of our favorites in the collection. My 4 mounth old will watch it over and over and that is why the long intro is so anoying. But I guess thats what DVD's for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really 1800 mAh","review":"From a few weeks testing - this battery holds about half of what the original (NP-95 1800mAh) holds. With a Fujifilm x100 - I can get probably half the shots I would get with the original. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubts... only Convinctions.....FIVE STARS","review":"A real masterpiece of this France Group.Acid jazz, r&b, funk and groove all togheter for an atomic bomb of sound.Time after time each time that i'am listening to this album i discovered new sounds, new influence.Energy in a dark side, shadow in the sun...the music it's coming out from voices (french,english,italian?) and became a funky-groove or r&b and even a jazz track.Too old to die (already present in a HI-FI LOUNGE collection), Fatigue Universelle,Chez Roger Boite Funk and Grover is Back are the real top but also all others are very near to be perfect.Don't miss something really different and special.Another Guidance records wiyh 5 stars....congratulations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"XLR8R Magiazine","review":"The debut long player from Marseille production trio Fred Berthet, Arnaud Tallefair and Dj Oil is an accomplished affair. Though the street preacher intro and the Travis Bickle comments that trawl the sprawling string of \\"Black City\\" act as ominous parentheses for an album, like DJ Food's Kaleidoscope, the material isn't all doom and gloom with the it's two years in the studio showing in the nuances and subtleties of the production. Lively percussion and cinematic orchestration really define the LP and though neither are too far away - both are used across a breadth of styles-stretching from the occasional disco strikes that break through the sonar of \\"Hum Hum\\" and the bossa breaks of \\"Fatigue Universelle.\\" For this listener, however, it's \\"Get Misunderstood\\" which really stands out, it's French conversation and confused rhythm section making for a tense intro before stretching out to a full string accompaniment. A three-dimensional listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Understand the High Reviews","review":"I purchased this book based on the customer reviews here on Amazon.com. I do not understand the high reviews. I am still reading the book, but am having trouble continuing. It is boring and confusing--somewhat rambling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good review for reader","review":"The individual who read Reversible Errors did an excellent job. His character voices added significantly to my enjoyment of the book. The story itself is only worth 3 1/2 or 4 stars, but the reader increased my enjoyment of the book so i offer a solid recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time to read.","review":"This book is full of characters you don't care about,a slow tedious plot that is so overburdened with useless person dating relationships that add absolutely nothing to the story other than preventing the reader from enjoying it and getting involved in it. And if you don't like foul language in books don't bother with this one, it's laced with it for no other reason than Scot trying to get street cred! This book was so bad that I started skipping skimming & skipping pages and even that didn't help the trudging pace. It was like a two hour movie that was stretched into a two week mini-season. If your time is valuable save it for a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOUR AROUND MY LIVING ROOM","review":"Ever had a force guided tour around your own living room? It's boring and difficult, but not as bad as this book. Normally I love ST but this was a plot that lost it's way.I dont think that I'm especially dim but I simply lost the plot on so many occassions..who was who? And what was going on? I had to put the book down and read something else..I read two other books whilst I had my breather from this one.The characters were very believable but it was an insult to let them live their lives around such a convoluted and tangled plot. The romance was a relief from the tedium.Better luck next time Scott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Having read and enjoyed Presumed Innocent and Burden of Proof, I was looking forward to reading Reversible Errors while I was on vacation. To be succinct, and not waste your time as mine was in reading this book, it stinks. I found myself not caring one way or the other about the characters. They were not developed to the point where I gave a hoot about them. Unlike his other books, the plot was dull and even contrived. From page to page and chapter to chapter I kept waiting for something to grab my interest, but vacation hours later, nothing did. I feel I got cheated out of precious vacation reading time.I'm left with one question, \\"Did I spend more time struggling to read this book than he spent writing it?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the ususal legal thriller","review":"If you're looking for a John Grisham style legal thriller, this is not it. However, if you like complex characters that may not always be especially likable, but are always human, then Scott Turow delivers. Yes, the plot may seem slow for the reader looking for the usual legal roller coaster, but I found the human drama more compelling than the usual courtroom confrontations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Unsatisfying","review":"I found this book to be lacking in many respects- the story of a man wrongly accused and about to be executed has been done enough and there was nothing in this one that justified telling it again. The characters were all either unlikable, depressing or boring. The pace was slow and the writing sub par, and confusing when it didn't have to be. I also found the sex scenes bordering on gross- I'm not really averse to sex in novels (and Turow is more graphic than many writers), but I really didn't want to hear about one of the characters menstruating....it just did nothing for the story.I plodded through this one, but have concluded the only Turow book worth reading is Presumed Innocent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated and technical","review":"This book, unlike his peer novelists, is terribly difficult to get into. I found myself constantly referring to the characters outlined on the first page. After 110 pages I found myself totally bored and quit....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Expectations","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel,which struck me as falling well short of the author's previous efforts. Although there are some pockets of suspense and bits of compelling narrative, the overall plot seems hackneyed, and the characters underdeveloped. We find none of the intensity, sublety or nuance we've come to expect from Turow. In short, this a potboiler that was truly an effort to read. In fact, my interest faltered, and I didn't care enough about the outcome to read it to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was disappointing","review":"Scott is trying to be John Grisham. It reads like one of Grishams slow courtroom dramas. Only slower. It seems that everyone must have an affair. Thats what authors do when they don't have substance. This was like a grocery store paperback. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A walk in the desert.","review":"After having read the masterful Presumed Innocent, I was looking were much foreward to getting my teeth into this new novel, but my expectations were, alas, somewhat disappointed. Knowing the writer's oppinion concerning the death penalty - it is not difficult to guess the outcome of the plot. To fill up the pages of the novel, the author throws in the love story of the defender as well as the love story of the procecutor in addition to the defender's mentally ill sister without much relation to the plot at all. After a while it feels like a walk in the desert. You are not much concerned about the characters and you are just waiting to turn the last page of this quite boring story. The best plus to the novel is that the main character is no he-man but only a normal person with faults and errors. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This is an example of a \\"writer\\" going through the motions. Weakly plotted, one dimensional characters and insipid writing are the highlights of this novel. Not up to the standards of a bad episode of Law and Order. Turow seems bored with the book, and his writing shows it. And when he describes the sexual activities of the characters, he adopts the breathless prose of a Harlequin novel (\\"...her orgasm was off the Richter Scale...\\"). Aargh! Do not waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Sad World","review":"This is the first Scott Turow book I've read, and while I marveled at his ability to write (he has a wonderful way with words), I was amazed at how bleak the world of Scott Turow is. The book is populated with truly unattractive characters...I cannot remember a single really positive one. Reading, one feels sorry for many of the characters, but one is hard-pressed to find a character to really root for--the pages, the scenes, the characters are all filled with cynicism and hopelessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtrooms, Drama & Twists!","review":"This was the first book I have read by Scott Turow, and it definitely won't be my last. While it was a little tough to get into at first (you know it's a complex story when a diagram of the cast and characters is included at the beginning of the book), I was well-rewarded for sticking with it, as the book developed into an engrossing one that I had trouble putting down.There was lots of actual courtroom drama which was so well done, I felt like I was there. Plus, so many twists and turns as it all came together. Scott Turow and John Grisham can certainly be compared becasue of the genre, but Turow's characters are grittier, more street-savvy and sexual. Overall, a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!","review":"Well, in my many long years of reading almost any book, I have seldom found one I just couldn't get interested in. This was slow, tedious and difficult to follow. I finally started jumping 50-75 pages at a time and couldn't even tell I had jumped!! Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"I love Scott Turow ... have loved everything he has written. What happened on this one? I'm a veracious reader; read everything in this genre. This is, perhaps, the worst book I've ever read. I threw it out after I finished to be sure nobody else picked it up and wasted their time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More a \\"relationship\\" book than a legal thriller...","review":"The focus of this book seems to be on the relationsips between the 2 couples (Muriel and Larry, Arthur and Gillian) brought together as a result of the last-ditch death sentence appeal by the convicted killer. The book basically plods along as the 2 couples struggle with their relationships, while breaks in the case gradually unfold. I didn't find the book to be \\"riveting\\" or \\"suspenseful,\\" as some other reviewers have claimed. I wouldn't call this a \\"bad\\" book, but I wouldn't recommend it, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"THIS BOOK WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF READING TIME.

Mastercool told me they don't warranty wear even when i told the girl it was one cars worth of flares. The holding dies are chipping where they grab the tube. They appear to be made out of pot metal. This in turn causes the tube to oval and so the flare nut can't slide up to the flare without a hammer!!! Also,the pump handle leaks fluid when under pressure. Almost all the flares LEAK.

That's probably of interest to the hard core Plymptomaniac, but I'm not in that category. I found them missable.Some of the later pieces are outstanding, though. \\"Your Face\\" is a twisted classic, an non-stop exercise in transformation. \\"How to Kiss\\" (especially the 'nibbling kiss') and \\"25 ways to stop smoking\\" are among the more memorable.Plympton's usual style is spare, simple scenes on a blank white background, drawn in colored pencil. Given the amount of computer-generated japanimation around, it's an enoyable change of pace.Don't come to this animation looking for \\"Bugs Bunny\\" or \\"Fantasia.\\" It's in a different class altogether. If you're ready for a different look, and for some mind-bending takes on everyday events, give it a shot. You might find yourself hooked.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's greater than great","review":"Being a young animator. I look up to Bill Plymtom because he is original. He shows that animation is so much more than just cartoon network and Disney. In this short film he definitely takes you thtough an experience that you will never forget because this work stands out from all the rest. I was amazed watching what you could really do with a face till you aren't even sure it's a face anymore! I recommend this to anyone that you should watch it at least once. I personally loved it and i think anyone reading this will too.Having met him at the World Animation Celebration in Hollywood was a treasure. I even got an autograph from him in my sketch book. After you watch it you will know why and you'll want his autograph too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Other than Creature Comforts and Balance the items in this collection are instantly forgettable. This is definitely NOT the world's greatest animation - far from it. I watched many Canadian Film Board animations a long time ago when I was a child, and I still remember being impressed by their creativity and originality. That isn't reflected in this DVD.Also, with a title of The World's Greatest Animation, I'd expect maybe just one piece from a music video or a TV commercial, something technologically dazzling, something that makes you go wow and call someone else into the room to see it, or maybe some internet-available stuff like L'Amour by Don Hertzfeldt or Video Computer System by Golden Shower. What I got instead was mostly tedious, unimpressive and uninspiring cartoons.I'd suggest you don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"tonka truck","review":"This toy is not loud.

When i phoned customer support a guy told me that it was faulty batteries and that i had to replace them - funnily enough - when i replaced them i still got the error!I tried emailing again and again - and i would never get an answer from anyone in the company. However, when i emailed them about where i could purchase some batteries they replied instantly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice-to-have but not worth the money","review":"I purchased this product in November. Its performance/price ratio is not good. Here is why:1) Customer service is horrible. The phone line is always busy. They don't reply emails.2) The AC adapter can only be used as a charger. i.e. you always have to use the battery3) In my case, the battery can only last about three hours. The manual claims \\"up to 10 hours\\". Customer service ignored my inquiry.4) When it is recording using the built-in mic, an annoying hard-drive-accessing noise gets recorded every two minutes. In addition, you can not attach a non-powered external mic.5) The FM radio can not give clear sound no matter how hard you tune.What this product is good is it can record voice directly into MP3.I would not recommend the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of equipment I ever had....","review":"Horrible...Pros:1.

Second, it tends to lock up from time to time, and the only way to get it back to normal is to pop the battery hatch... but if you do that or run the batteries down all the way, it loses all of the radio station presets you've stored. In addition, it only properly recognizes 128 kbps MP3s... if they are recorded at any other bit rate, it can still play them, but the info (length timeplayed, time remaining, etc.) is all wrong. It also takes some learning, as the user guide does not match the product... for example, to make a new directory or delete a file, you have to do an entirely different set of actions than the instruction manual states.This has the potential to be a good product, if Archos fixes a lot of these problems. Most of them can (and probably will) be fixed via firmware updates. But the battery life is a major issue with this player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Player","review":"I say this is well worth the money.

If yes then this gadget is for you.Functions are great but it runs of juice unbeleivably quickly.

It can also play WMA files as well and is all round fab.I have relegated my Archos to using as a back up hard drive for my important PC files.I suggest you do not buy an archos.If you are thinking of buying one, at least try them out by sending a query to the helpdesk and see if you get a reply.... think that may be enough to give you a clear idea of what you are (not) getting for your money.PG"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont do business with JR Music World","review":"Don't do business with JR Music World, they sent me a crap product.

Mompou, like Reynaldo Hahn, might be dismissed as a \\"salon\\" composer but let's try to dig a little deeper before we disregard. He certainly isn't anywhere near the level of a Debussy or Satie. A rather ordinary imagination, not so unique. For something more challenging you might try the piano music of Charles Tomlinson Griffes if Debussy and/or Scriabin suit you.

When I listened to this one, I was sorely disappointed. It doesn't match the style of the later albums at all. They sound like a knockoff of an early Green Day album. The only track on the CD that is really good is Belgium, which can be found on several of their other albums, so you don't need to buy this one to get it.If you want to hear something that sounds like a Green Day album, buy a Green Day album.

I listened to almost the whole cd and was surprised by all the yelling and metal like music. I was going to sell it, but then i listened to the whole thing. I loved it!!!!!! It sort of altered my music taste to like more metal like music. The only song that reallty threw it off was A.N.I.C.. It must be the worst song i have heard in my life. After track 7 the songs start to sound a little repetitive. Hooch, the hell song, over my head, still waiting, my direction, no brains, billy spleen, and all messed up are the best songs on the album.

The new style is similar and recongizable in the new style. There's a song for everybody! Each song is uniquely and inspringly written by the Canadian boys themselves. The Four Jack ...

New fans of Sum 41 should be advised that they aren't in for the normal punk riffs and vocals, but wont be let down.

You should definatley pick this up before the stores run out and belive me, they will! Rock on sum"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Sound For Sum 41","review":"Sum 41 is one of my favorite bands. I bought thia album the day it came out. I put it in and began to listen to it and I notcied how much the sound has changed. It is heavier rock album. It sounds really good though. I was used to their more upbeat albums All Killer No Filler and Half Hour of power but i really like this one. Some of my friends have always told me that Sum 41 was a bunch of sell-outs but now after i got them to listen to this they are beginning to like them. I would highly recomend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its still in my stero!","review":"This is gotta be my favorite CD that sum41 has ever made!

If you think they're just another Group of guys that are blink wannabe's your wrong. Sum41 is rock'n on the MTV hit Show TRL. With their song \\"Still waiting\\" its obvious people can't get enough of them. The guys keep it real as JLo would say with their humor and practical jokes. So my advice is go get the new SUM41 Cd \\"Does This Look Infected\\" or you haven't really Lived yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the best punk rock album of this year","review":"Since hearing about this album on their official website i have never stopped playing it, it rulz!!...Still waiting is a fab tune with sum great riffs and shows that the band have realyy grown up in the past year or so. The video to the track is really kewl too cos it [is so much better than] bands like the hives,,, which is always good!!...i recomend evry1 gettin a copy. or at leasdt visiting the site to hear a sneek preview or the hole thing of ya like"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"This is one of Sum 41's best CDs.

If you get one cd this holiday season let it be this cd!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD In Way Too Long","review":"I was reluctant to buy this CD at first, because Sum 41 is more pop-like than my usual tastes, but I when I heard \\"Still Waiting\\", I knew I had to have it. I definitely don't regret it. This is literally the best CD I've heard in a REALLY long time, if not ever. I got this CD a week ago, and I haven't taken it out of my player since. I've been listening to it non-stop. My favorite tracks are \\"Thanks For Nothing\\" and \\"Over My Head(Better Off Dead)\\". But every song is much better than any other music that has come out in quite some time. This CD has even inspired me to get the Sum 41 logo as my first tattoo...it's the one on the front of the In Too Deep single. Yeah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sum 41 album yet, but not incredible music","review":"Unfortunately, Kevin is right about a lot of things. Punk is supposed to be all about being different, lashing out at society's ills, all that stuff. It just doesn't work when every song is about not conforming (a line I love is from Thanks for Nothing, \\"I wont....waste my time with further education\\".. yeah, being able to earn more than minimum wage when you grow up is a real waste of time.. heh)While I'm a fan of thrashy music and all.. Sum 41 keeps trying too hard to be \\"punk\\". If you're \\"punk\\", you are punk from the moment your band is formed. Not after your third album from a major label. They're just grasping for straws now.Anyway, this is the first album thats really made me take notice of them. Its a decent album, but the politics of the situation make it seem slightly tarnished."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word to kevin","review":"So To Kevin its kinda obvious that u havent actually listend to this cd cuz when u listen to it u can tell that their is a HUGE difference between this record and their previous ones. their music is a lot heavier and it doesnt even sound remotely pop. also when it comes to blink 182 they r not a bunch of ppl who make records that sound the same cuz on their new self titled record they dont make stupid catchy dating stories and stuff about losing a girl. their videos dont have them running aroung naked and they put alot of thought into it. they did something new with their new record. and as for GC...their cool. on their upcoming CD (chronicles of life and death) i hear they r having some hip hop collabs and thats original...i dont no why u even bother to say that these bands r the same when they clearly arent. so to you all i have to say is BUy THE F*CKING RECORD."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars - too close to major influences","review":"an -oki- CD too much of it is ripped off however, and regurgated into this album repeatedly. it is very unoriginal, they dont stray very much from their influences at all. throughout this CD you can hear riffs taken from the likes of Metallica, Iron Maiden, a bit NOFX sounding too, and even Def Leppard.So if you were to compliment the guitar work, well alot of the riffs weren't even theirs, let alone their guitar skill is below par.However including a DVD was a nice thing for them to do, so that bumps my score up a bit, but alot of the stuff on the DVD was a bit poor, but it being included for free was something nice and only can add to my score.Not -too- bad of a CD, but totally unoriginal. and many blatant rip-offs of riffs. We all know sum 41 really like Iron Maiden, Metallica and such, but ripping riffs straight from them isn't doing them justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than all filler no killer","review":"does this look infected is much better and less poppier than all filler no killer. theres still not a song as good as fat lip, but they're still really good. the only reason its parental advisory is because of the cover and the inside pictures though, because they hardly ever swear in this cd. and mines cool because it came with a bonus dvd. so u should get it too if u liked all filler no killer because you will like this one more"},{"rating":"2","title":"does this look infected","review":"this cd is great. i've had it for about four days, and i must say, this is a lot different from All Killer No Filler. Sum 41 has successfully reached a new sound, and its more mature than the AKNF sound. However, like AKNF, every song on the album is a good song. When you listen to it, you won't want to skip over any songs.the hell song is the perfect starter. Over my head is good, but not one of my favorites. My direction shows the band's punk pop side, but the lyrics are just as mature as any of the songs. Still Waiting has brilliant lyrics. I could explain every song, but I won't.Bottom line: Very good CD. Any Sum 41 fan must get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow this cd is nice","review":"This new sum41 cd is pretty cool.

Out of 12 songs, you are most likely going to like at least 10. I can only remember 2 songs that were sort of \\"screamo\\". I'm not sure what those songs are though. But it is very good CD and is a very worth buying. Songs that stuck out to me the most were : The Hell Song - one of my favorite guitars. Over My Head (Better Off Dead) - how the lyrics are sung make this song great. Still Waiting - very fast paced and neat listening to.But what I like most about this CD is the bonus DVD. One of the funniest things I have ever saw!!! But keep out of reach of parents...It's not music videos or anything, It's just the band fooling around and screwing with people.Very worth buying. 10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"BetterYet","review":"This new Sum41 CD is even better than their last one!!

All the songs sound the same. If you like the first song I guess you will probably like the rest. My suggestion is if you are into this sound try bands like \\"Taking back Sunday\\", \\"The Beautiful Mistake\\". Sum41 just doesn't have the lyrical impact that these bands do and as a guy who likes lyrics more then some guys crunching on a guitar i really can't give this album anything more then one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome CD","review":"This Alubm frikin Rawks. They are definatly not album fillers. This alubm is what punk is ment to be, a short period of leting out all your energy spontainiously into music. All the songs sound pretty much the same but since all the songs are good, its like one big 30 minute song that you can rock out to besides skiping the songs you enjoy and the ones you dont enjoy. You also feel a sort of a classical rock influence in this album cuz of the many guitar solos. Overall this is like the greatest Sum 41 album besides half hour of power since ive never heard it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"....","review":"Amazon's Editorial Review: Why does it say 'All Killer No Filler' is their debut album? Sorry, but it wasn't.

Awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Disappointing","review":"Let me start off by saying I am a Sum 41 fan, so don't think I'm trying to bash them or anything. But I honestly think their was their weakest CD. It doesn't have the same flow of their last two albums. Unlike All Killer No Filler, not every song holds your attention until the end. The musicianship is better, but whats the use if the songs themselves aren't as infectious? There are some great songs though, I really only listen to the first 5 then I turn it off. I dont know what kind of vibe they were going for here but its definetly not working. Its almost like their trying to un-sell out or something, their trading in their pop, TRL-cred and trying to gain metal cred or something. Thats great, but I'm not for it if it drags down the quality of the songs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it really Infected??","review":"About 3 years ago, i was introduced to Sum 41.

But the cd has the best guitar riffs and awesome lyrics you can't help but sing out loud. especially their first single, \\"Still Waiting\\" it's awesome!!! \\"The Hell Song\\" is my favorite song on the album.

They cover everything from world problems(so am i still waiting, for this world to stop hating) to a**holes(A.N.I.C.) in the short 31 minutes they use. They have a new style that is similar enough to keep their old fans and to bring in new ones. They still have there punk sound but they have added a metal touch to it in just the right way so it sounds great. They're whole CD 'does this look infected' has pictures of them where they all look demented and very cool. They once again show that they are just teens trying to have fun and do what they love.

With twelve dominating tracks it'll be sure to top the charts. Harder than ever before (in more ways than one) Sum 41 throw out their old punk style to add a more metal tone. Same awesome lyric style, enhanced rockin guitar notes driving the legend-worthy songs. If you haven't already bought this CD you better cause Sum 41 guides you to a new way of life.

Usually its the other way around. Like Blink-182 that have kindda done just the oppisite. My favorite part of this CD is the free DVD that comes with it. The first track is Sum41 playing a hard rock band. That was so hilarious. But the real suprise was all the tracks after. Home videos of the band! How cool is that! It includes pranks, so many pranks.

During the first five minutes of the film, one begins to realize what a mistake it was to even take the trouble of putting it into the DVD player at all. Although I must say that the acting was definitely not average. It was so far below average that it makes Van Damme look Oscar worthy. The highlight of the film is the house sequence, where it becomes obvious that the director actually has some friends that will loan him their home for a movie that with any luck they will never have to watch.

I dont watch horor films for the acting, I watch them for the gore and the gore in this film is amazing an very well done. I think I understand the ending. It was all in her head, right?

I'm actually glad I bought it. I throw it in when I'm having parties - just for laughs. I don't think any time was spent on story, structure, continuity, dialogue, set design, and FX. It was probably written in less than a month. Low budget or not, the story and lines were so weak, it makes absolutely everything laughable. There are more holes in this plot than all the cheese in Wisconsin. In fact, there's more cheese in this plot than... you get the idea. Buy it for a good laugh. Perhaps this might become a cult classic just due to its absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Listin to these reviews","review":"After reviewing the DVD version of this film, i thought i would have to review this version as well. This film was poorly put together the odd gore special effects were nothing special, they just had a large cringe factor.

I was wrong.She did love Baby Mozart, but she was a baby and basically it helped me get her to sleep. This one is just too slow, and doesn't teach much. Maybe its good for the infant stage, but doesn't work with toddlers. I was disappointed with it, and wish that they would change their format even more. It's too similar to all the others, and who needs 10 of the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching about animals","review":"My child loves the Baby Einstein series of videos. They captivate her. When this video arrived, I could not wait to see her reaction to the video. She loves it! Her attention is on the Baby Dolittle video when played in the VCR. I watched the video with her. This video is a wonderful way to introduce a child to animals and the spelling of the animals' names. It is also a way to introduce a child to an animal that he or she may never see on a regular basis if the parents do not own the animals. My compliments on an excellent video go to the Baby Einstein Company."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This video was lent to us by a friend of my wife's. Thank god we didn't waste our money on it. This video has way too much very [poor] puppetry, interspersed with a very little stock nature footage (probably cost them nothing) and a couple of scenes of kids in costumes ([inepensive]labour?). Our 18 month old daughter enjoyed (or, anyways, watched) the video once, but now only wants to see the actual nature footage. I don't blame her as the other parts are horrible. If you want some nature footage though, this video is not the way to go. Get something from PBS or the BBC, something that actually has educational value, not this piece of***."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS used tape","review":"Average quality.

Rather, it is a chronicle of Elizabethan times in England. We learn more about his contemporaries, e.g. Johnson, than we do about Shakespeare.

It's amazing how many friends and family members start lining up once they know you've been attuned! Thanks to the books and DVD's I was able to channel the energy. I even gave myself the Reiki Aura Attunement for smoking and I'm happy to say that I've been able to drastically cut back! The Master Attunement was the icing on the cake. Steve's attunements are GREAT and I highly recommend that anyone interested in persuing reiki healing read his books and take his attunements.

The most concise information in one place I have read (and I've read alot).The DVDs are truly profound. They work! The blessings you receive from them will make you want to see them over and over again.

No, this book is filled with specific information regarding Reiki Aura Attunements. This is new information that can be used by all Reiki students and Reiki Masters alike. I feel like this book helped to complete my Master skill set. All of the books in this series build upon each other and provide a specific roadmap for Reiki students and practitioners alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"great knowledge","review":"I have read the book and I am amazed that Mr. Murray is able to use simple and effective language to deliver the Reiki message.

There lacks any main theme, aside from the man himself. It contains several articles regarding different aspects of his life and inventions, jumps haphazardly from one subject to the next, but its greatest failing is it's quality. It has the appearance of biography thrown together by an uninterested sixth-grader.

An excellent production along: Very colourful costumes and scenery and excellent audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I was astounded by the musicianship and ballet artistry. You get to really see and hear the orchestra during all the preludes and overtures. I am a musician and I had listened to these pieces many times but never seen the ballet. Now it all makes sense! I thought the camera work was just fine. In my opinion the people running the cameras did.a.very good job capturing just the right details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a music professor, and for almost 25 years, I have relied on bootleg reproductions of PBS's Great Performances' airing of the Joffrey Ballet's reconstruction of the Rite (now available on UTube) for my classes. Naturally, I leapt at the opportunity to obtain a commercially released (LEGAL!) video. I tried to remain open minded, but from the first trembling strokes of the conductor's baton this DVD disappointed. The tempos in the music were disjointed (listen to the ostinato which radically changes tempos when the curtain opens), the dancers were imprecise and lethargic, the fist pumps at the end of the first section looked like half-hearted black power gestures at the 1968 Olympics, and the sacrificial virgin's final death actually made me laugh/cry with frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The dancing lacks any sinister element and is mechanical to the degree that I wonder if the dancers understand what they are dancing.The dancers are slow and struggle to complete the hand movements and footwork in the allotted musical time.When the chosen one fell to the floor I wondered what she was doing as she was so lacking in drama yet know and love the ballet. Please Paris, Kirov or Bolshoi make a DVD of the Right of Spring. Many years ago I saw a performance on television from Paris that I recorded and recently lost.If only that could be found and reproduced on DVD. Come on Kirov and Bolshoi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"About Stravinsky's music--what is there to say? This is a good orchestra with good sound in St. Petersburg's magnificent Mariinsky Theatre. The dancing is great and it's fascinating to see a recreation of Nijinsky's original choreography of Sacre du Printemps from 1913, with Roerich's backdrops. My only complaint is the cinematography. During the orchestral sections, too many shots of the conductor and too few of the musicians. In the ballets, too many close-ups of the dancers and too few of the whole stage--as if you were watching most of the performance through binoculars. Then there are overhead shots of the dancers that make little sense. That said, this is a wonderful performance, and if you aren't lucky enough to see it live, I highly recommend the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Camera Work on Rite of Spring","review":"The camera work on Rite of Spring was dreadful. There were too many pointless close-ups of the virgin's face. The feet and legs of the dancers were cut off most of the time and the groupings of dancers that make this ballet so effective were cut out. You really miss 60% of the ballet in this DVD. The dancing is much too pretty and the female dancers are all far too elegant and restrained in their movements. Nijinsky would be horrified to see what they did to his Sacre. If you are interested in seeing something far, far better than this, something much closer to the original, watch the Joffrey Ballet's version on YouTube.The sound was amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review a calendar? Why not!","review":"Well, I have had this calendar since Christmas 2003, and I love it. It features great little scenes, covers, and other artwork from my favorite comic character/series.

Each has it's pluses and minuses, and I would not catagorize any of them as \\"The Perfect Book on Poker\\". The thing I like the most about \\"The Complete Book of Hold'em Poker\\" over the Sklansky book is it's readability. There is a lot of info in Sklansky's book and I would recommend it, but it is just plain hard to read. Overall, if I had to choose amongst the three books I have I would take this book by Gary Carson. Phil Helmuth's book is also well written, but the content was lacking a bit. Carson and Sklansky covered more territory in their books and focused only on Hold'em.Thoughts are only valuable if they are communicated clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thinking Man's Holdem Book","review":"This book offers more insights into the way you should approach the game of Holdem Poker than any other I have seen.

I expected the same quality from this one, but I'm ready to toss it and try something else.

I am sure it will be viewed many times in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate song included","review":"The box states that the video includes holiday songs from other countries, including Isreal. I couldn't believe my ears when the first song on the video was the dreidel song with a dancing Santa and Mrs. Claus in front of a Christmas tree. This was offensive and inconsiderate to the Jewish religion. Yes, the box said \\"holiday\\" songs from other countries, but the title of the video certainly gives the impression that this will be Christmas music. To include this song was highly inappropriate. In any case, the setting for this song should NOT be Santa and a Christmas tree. I think there is enough confusion with Christmas and Hannukah often occuring at the same time, without this video adding to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My Triplet 2 year olds have been watching videos from the Baby Einstein series since they were 6 months old. The quality of this one does not measure up to the rest. It seems almost like a 'home-movie'. The sound quality and music selecions are not as good and the visuals are slow. There is not much action, and for infants and young toddlers it is difficult to have much reference to what it is they are seeing (ie. that the puppets are reindeer, etc). I think the video should be more self-explanatory in some way so that the 'Christmas-uninitiated' will have more understanding of it. The boys will watch it but are not as captivated by this one as by the others. They seem to get more out of it now though than they did when they were 17 months (at Christmas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of potential wasted","review":"What a waste! This could have been a great video, but it is not. What a perfect chance to identify objects of the season (like the animal ones that identify the animals), show the kids giving gifts to older people, the puppets preparing for santa, etc. This is what we were expecting but this BE does not deliver. The music is poor, the scenes are choppy and the kids are not doing anything interesting. The kids are in front of a blue or green screen like they were going to add a background but then decided not to. Very annoying! We own every BE in the series and this is the only one my daugthers will not sit through. Hopefully future BEs are not this bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is not up to par with Baby Mozart, Bach, & Beethoven. The scenery and music that make the previous three so enjoyable are simply not part of Santa's Music Box. As highlighted by many other reviewers, scenes with children do not hold the interest of my now 7 mo old daughter, and there are far too many scenes of this nature. The brightly colored toys and silly puppets are far more captivating, and unfortunately are lacking. Baby Mozart is by far the star, followed by Beethoven and then Bach. Julie Clark includes her daughters in the Bach version, and that can be a bit annoying (trying TOO hard to be cutesy), but I prefer Bach to Baby Santa anyday.

My daughter highly recommends this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the same as the others","review":"Unfortunately, Baby Santa's Music Box does not appeal to my nine month old son. He loves Baby Mozart, Baby Einstein and Baby Bach, and has even taken to Baby Shakespeare despite its claim to be for toddlers. With Baby Santa, the formula has changed slightly. It contains more children shots, and less of the repetitive action shots that keep babies entranced. The video may be appealing to adults because the children bits are very cute and the music nostalgic (traditional tunes and parts of the Nutcracker!), but these concepts are lost on the infant because he does not have the context in which to place them. Although I applaud the concept and the attempt, I would have to say I cannot recommend this video, at least for childen under one year. Perhaps an older child might see more merit in it. Beyond this, I would still recommend any of the other Baby Einstein Company videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of the Baby Einstein series. My nine month old son has been captivated by Baby Mozart and Baby Bach since he was about 3 months old and more recently, by Baby Van Gogh. I was really looking forward to the Baby Santa video, but was SO disappointed when it arrived! My son (who gets excited as soon as he sees the copyright notice!) watched for about 3 minutes and then crawled away. I, too, found it very boring. The problem seems to be the music. It is the very lively music that most keeps his attention, but this is completely lacking in this video. The music is slow and flat, and doesn't \\"go\\" with the pictures as is the case in the other videos. You get the sense from watching this video that it was done in a hurry, perhaps to get it out for the holiday season.

Even my three months old twins didn't pay any attention to it (they love Baby Mozart). The music is tiresome, the images don't go with the music.

Our son has been watching Baby Einstein movies since he was 5 months old (he's now 11 months) and he was completely bored with Baby Santa. It spends entirely too much time showing spinning ornaments - there are so many enticing images that could have been displayed to capture the theme of Christmas. There's maybe two images of Santa (I was hoping the movie would help alleviate fears of Santa by showing him as a nice guy...), and there's a few great snow images... but the good images are few and it seems like it's just ornament after ornament.

It has stayed with me for some thirty years--the homeless boy, nameless, finding an identity, a family, and a home. Boss was a powerful complex character, whose grief and loneliness I understand even then--and it is a tough book, in which David earns his right to be a part of a family and a community. Why has the sparse, touching book never been filmed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT'S IN A NAME?","review":"A homeless, friendless, nameless young boy travels the country as a migrant worker, with the vague idea of reaching California. He prides himself on being able to look out for himself--relying on absolutely no one else for anything. When he reaches Montana sheep country, he meets some people who actually come to care about him. Can he overcome his natural (or acquired) suspicion and enforced independence to allow human emotions to enter and flow from his embittered heart?He learns more than the responsibilities of a shepherd during the rough winter, when he battles his own reckless impulses and a growing jealousy of a young man he never met. This unlikely hero determines to settle down and win the respect of the Boss. Many of the characters are driven (like Captain Ahab in MOBY DICK) to hunt down and destroy the Bear that killed Boss' son. A thoughtful book that will challenge the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite childhood book.","review":"This book is out of print, so I was excited to get a used library copy.

Some are better than others, some worst. Tuszynska's great knowledge of Singer is unquestionable but her observations reflect deep anti-Polonizm.

I was standing there with her hand in the gel for WELL over 2 minutes. The gel would not harden. I finally got frustrated and took her hand out and the gel was still runny and was all stuck to her hand. The whole project was ruined and ended up throwing everything in the trash.

Watching the film, you learn from many of the announcers and radio station employees how working at the station allowed them to learn and grow...how, together they were part of some grand experiment bigger then each individual. It is like taking a step back in time, to see how a radio station in a small rural community helped to connect not only those that worked at the station but those who listened.

The I Know My Shapes song is awful they should have stayed with the classical music as background to the video. My son who usually loves the videos lost interest right away in this one.

Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing experiment by the BE Folks!","review":"Forget the plush puppets, enticing visuals, and enchanting classical music of the other Baby Einstein videos. This one does not follow the BE formula. Instead, it is an animated presentation with an original song that is played repeatedly, assuring the viewer that the (albeit untalented) singer \\"knows his shapes.\\" Computer generated crayons draw a clown out of shapes, and he becomes a more dimensional computer graphic.What's the problem? I noticed that my son did not enjoy this show as much as the others. He prefers the more engaging BE vidoes with puppets, changing scenes, and classical music. (E.g., Baby Galileo). I purposely buy BE videos because they are NOT flatly animated with uninteresting music. Other than the fact that baby didn't care for the video, I found the visuals uninteresting and the song about shapes very annoying.I recommend Baby Shakespeare or Baby Van Gogh instead of this one & hope that the BE people learn from this mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary and Weird","review":"We have the Baby Mozart and Baby Van Gogh (the best) from this series, and I was interested to see how Disney would make it better.

I was surprised to see that Disney released it instead of FHE, like the others. Anyway, it was awful and my son screamed for me to turn it off after 10 minutes. What happened to the kids? The music was loud and annoying. The animated crayons and shapes were so unfriendly and uninviting. I am really dissapointed! I only saw one familiar puppet, the horse from Doolittle's neighborhood animals. The rest all looked new to me.

I'm giving it away, but part of me is afraid of terrifying some other poor unexpecting soul. I don't think he's just disappointed in the poor quality. He's truly upset. So am I. What's up with that?

While most of the Baby Einstein series has a format that's simple and more appropriate for the youngest kids (0-3 yrs), Baby Newton is just another computerized cartoon like everything else out there on television or video/DVD.

My 15 month old daughter has all the other Baby Einstein videos/DVDs and loves them. They're simple--and yet she's really learned a lot from them. Baby Newton was so disappointing and I returned it. The computer animation wasn't even good quality, and who wanted these videos to have computer animation anyway? Julie Clark's comments on the other tapes that familiar real-life objects are what engages the young viewers was so true. And then they went and messed with a good formula.One of the most shocking things was that the video is supposed to teach shapes. But then because they were using 3-D animation, they called a sphere a circle; a cube a square, etc. So, the information being imparted isn't even accurate. I hope they learn from this mistake, and if there other any others in the works that they return to the original format."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Child Cried Also!","review":"I previously posted this video as a 3 star rating by mistake.

I think that is so because it is different from the rest and there is a catchy tune that my three year old can actually sing along with. Sometimes when he is playing by himself, I hear him singing this song...\\"I love my shapes, oh yes I do......\\"). He has learned his shapes and his colors quite easily from this video which means it has done its job, and very well I might add. I would much rather him what this video every other day than perhaps the violent Spiderman movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same \\"baby einstein\\" format","review":"The \\"shapes\\" dvd is not like the other einstein dvds - it has a big chunk animated with dancing shapes and crayons... this is okay, but most younger kids (under 10 months) won't like it - mine only liked the puppet shows, and there aren't as many in this dvd. skip for younger kids - pretty good for older (1+ year olds) babies... Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes it's different - but she likes it!","review":"Yes, this is a different format. But it is still the same concept - teaching children basic ideas. And my daughter loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm usually not resistent to change...however, after viewing this video I'm reminded of the old saying \\"if ain't broke, don't fix it\\". This video mainly consist of animations and fast paced lyrics that are almost unintelligible--clearly a departure from Mrs. Clark's previous productions. The puppets and classical music appeared to have added as an afterthought...perhaps to appease long time fans. If Baby Newton is going to be the new standard, then I will not be purchasing future products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"My daughter, who loves the other (pre-Disney) Baby Einstein videos, cried (16 months). We put it away for a few months and tried again (at 20 months) -- and she cried again (at the same spot). It's scary, moves much more quickly than the other videos, and seems like a ... knock-off of the real thing (even the toys and puppets look cheesy). The \\"original\\" song is dumb, and even the classical portion of the sound track sounds bad (as in, poor quality recording and mixing). Don't waste your money. This is Baby Einstein sells out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed!","review":"The old adage of \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" applies. I had this DVD pre-ordered for months. I was so eager to share it with my little one, but what a dissapointment. Disney's involvement took Julie Clark's amazing idea and design and changed it for the worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the others","review":"We really enjoy Baby Einstien's videos but the newest, Baby Newton is very different from past productions. There are too many computer graphics and the main \\"character\\" scares our baby. It seems very inpersonal and uncreative. I think they \\"sold out\\" to Walt disney and did not retain their charm and innocence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Stinker!","review":"My 14 month old has all of the Baby Einstein videos, so I was excited when I learned a new one was being released. My son really liked all the other videos because of the soothing classical music, the children, the toys and the puppets. I was a little wary when I found out that Disney had bought the company, but decided to buy the video anyway. I should have listened to my hunch, because the video turned out to be awful! Instead of children, there is this awful computer animation of dancing crayons and a creepy clown made of shapes. There are not as many toys and very few puppets. They also added this bad song about shapes which is very loud and jarring, unlike the classical music I have come to enjoy when watching the other videos. Do yourself a favor - don't buy this video if you expect to see the cute kids, toys and puppets that we all have come to expect from this video series. I wish I had read some reviews before I bought the video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the Baby Einstein Title","review":"My 18 month old enjoys all of the B.E. Videos. They are one series that we felt confident in allowing our daughter to watch because of the classical music, gentle visuals and real world charm of the children, puppets and toys. Baby Newton is a huge departure from their format and is unwatchable. The computer animation is soulless, the music is horrible and the stock footage is pure filler. It is my opinion that people who care passionately about what images their children are digesting will find this DISNEY version of Baby Newton unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared!","review":"This video scared my two year old grandson. The clown and the crayons had him holding on to me and he wouldn't let go. The scene with the dog being bombarded with the balls had him in tears! This is not the Baby Einstein series he has grown to love. Disney has ruined it. I will not buy any more of the videos with the Disney influence. I'll stick with the old ones he loves and adores."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I own Baby Bach, Shakespeare, Doolittle, and Van Gogh and my 15-month-old has always loved them. This video is VERY DIFFERENT. It is not of the quality that Einstein video owners have come to expect. There is a lot of blurry animation and the host, a creepy animated clown, leaves me feeling cold. My son, who is usually mesmerized by the videos, did not even look over. Maybe this has something to do with Disney buying the company, but I don't recognize it. I'm truly disappointed because after personally having to view my other tapes hundreds of times, I still enjoyed them. The other videos are wonderful - simple, clever, playful, and use real objects, children, and classical music. Newton is not well-made and a true disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Baby Newton is nothing like the original series (i.e., Baby Bach, Baby Mozart, etc.) ... My 21-month absolutely loves the Baby Einstein series. We bought her the Baby Newton, and she could care less. She doesn't giggle, she doesn't dance and she doesn't sing to this one. In fact, she'll pop it out of the VHS and grab a different tape! I'm very disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like the rest","review":"My 1 year old son loves this video -- even though it's been 'disney-ized'. With the exception of the crayon and clown animation it's the same type of stuff from the other baby einstein videos that's kept your child busy for that precious 30 minutes while you're eating dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby's favorite","review":"My son adores everything from baby einstein, and this is his new favorite. The shapes song is very James Brown-ish, and a nice diversion from the classical music, which is also great. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with the others...","review":"We own all Baby Einstein videos and my daughter loves them all except this one. I agree with the other review - the clown was creepy and the music wasn't great. I wish I had skipped this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed","review":"...I wasted my money on this video. My daughter just absolutely loves all of the other Baby Einstein videos and does not care for Baby Newton at all. I felt that the animation did not personalize the video and really did not connect with the child...My daughter will not even sit through this one once."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same old thing just got worse","review":"I quite enjoy a few from the Einstein selection with both of my children, 18 months and almost 4. We don't watch them as often as Blue's Clue's or Baby Know-It-All, but the mesmerizing images are sometimes great for bedtime, especially Van Gogh, and Mozart.When we saw this one we were absolutely disappointed. Up until now, we've come to expect more of the same thing just done a little differently from Baby Einstein. That was fine, because we tend to get sick of watching one of the series to much. but, Newton is different, and in this case, we would have preferred more of the same. The animation is not really interesting, even to the over 2 years crowd, which it is too slow for. That something that this series had is no longer there. We gave it away 2 weeks after buying it. With videos like Baby KNow-It-All, you get solid edu-tainment, and blues Clues you get creative edu-tainment through cartoons. With Mozart you get a quiet baby, with Newton you get nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"My son and I love all the Baby Einstein videos (with the exception of Baby Bach) and we were really looking forward to the release of Baby Newton. This video does not follow the same format as the other videos in this series. There is an animated \\"clown\\" as the main character as well as animated dancing crayons. There is very little classical music ,a few puppet shows, and no children. This video did not hold my son's attention and I really wish I would have previewed it before I invested my money in it! What a dissapointment!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Disney","review":"Julie Clark has allowed Disney's style to overpower her original concept. The music is loud and dopey, the crayon character is frightening and the real children's faces are missing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one!","review":"Lacks the classical magic of the original series. It's been replaced with computer animation and made up songs about shapes. The puppets are still nice, but it's missing the original concepts for baby einstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney-fied fun","review":"The main difference between this video and its predecessors is that Baby Newton is much more similar to any other Disney product: faster cuts, computer generated animation, and more pop-oriented music. My 16 month old son seems to like it, but it seems less educational than the earlier titles in the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My 20 mo daughter likes this better than any of the other Baby EInstein's to date. She wants to watch it repeatedly. Was leary after mixed reviews so we rented it from Netflix and she watched it three times in a single day. She seemed more engaged and captivated by it than others. Think it must just depend on each child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for infants!","review":"We have ten of the Baby Einstein DVDs ang generally love them, but this one scares my 5 mo. old daughter. We have tried it four different times and it makes her cry without fail. The computer generated crayons and clown (especially in 3-D) freak her out. This one is for older babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this one","review":"My daughter loves her 5 other Baby Einstein DVDs and would probably sit for hours and watch them if I'd let her. However, she will not sit for longer than 5 minutes for this one. She loves the puppets on the other DVDs, but the format on Baby Newton is different. There are not many puppets and there is a lot of animation, which is not the case with the others. The music is terrible. Maybe she's just not old enough for this video (she's one). I wish I had read the reviews before I picked this one up. If you like the other Baby Einsteins, such as Neigborhood Animals, Baby MacDonald, Baby Neptune, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Video in a Stellar Series","review":"From the cheap special effects to the uninspired music, this is a low point in an otherwise wonderful series. And the powers that be must have realized that because they never repeated the style of this video in subsequent ones. My son watched it once and now it collects dust on our shelf. Avoid at all costs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Newton - Very \\"Un-Einstein\\" like","review":"This Baby Einstein differs greatly from all the other Baby Einstein DVDs that we own. I also like it the least. The video had few puppets and only 2 babies in it. It was filled with cheesy animation of crayons and a clown which both added little to the video. I just finished watching the counting video and I can't understand why they didn't to the shape video similiar to that. I would not recommend this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to captivate child's attention","review":"My two daughters (2.5 years and 9 months old) have enjoyed every previous release of the Baby Einstein collection. As soon as the video starts playing, they are hypnotised and remain fixed in the presentation, frequently laughing and describing what they see.However, the latest release of Baby Newton has not captivated their attention at all. It seems like the old formula of using everyday objects was far more successful. The special effects in the new version failed the viewers test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves it!","review":"My one year old daughter loves this new addition. We have three others from the collection and yes this is a departure from Julie's original approach but I don't think that's bad. My daughter squeals with delight everytime the crayons pop onto the screen. Educational DVD's are the only thing that keep her busy while my husband and I try to have dinner in 30 minutes or less and this one does an outstanding job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty","review":"When item arrived the the was damaged and it belonged to a library it looked as it should have been garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the others","review":"I too have all the Baby Einstien DVDs and was so excited to have a new one. I was greatly disappointed to see the departure form the usual format including a loud shape song and less puppetry. I had thought the animation would be a plus but it sure wasn't my 2 1/2 year old, 18 month old and 8 month old were quickly bored and went on to other toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son cried!","review":"We own and love ALL the Einstein videos EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE! My 14-month old son watched this one and wouldn't even crack a smile, even when I pointed out things on the video and made silly faces and gestures to encourage him. He just stared at the screen and at one point, even starting crying because something scared him! My husband watched it with him one more time later to see if it was maybe just his mood, but he acted the same way and cried again at the same spot! Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unnecessary quibbling on great infant/toddler entertainment","review":"My son has been watching this from when it came out, and while he is now three, he still enjoys the video. He totally loves the animated clown, just as he enjoyed the toy commercials of the rest of the videos :-) Isaac the lion is totally adorable, and I much prefer that he watch this rather than grow up too quickly and watch Toy Story et. al.He learned all of his shapes and COLORs too from watching this video after just a couple of times watching. We watch all DVDs together always, and about those complaints on 2D tags for 3D images, watch with your child! fold laundry near them, and ask them questions and talk about what you watch. And its a good thing to recognize that a pyramid is made up of triangles and so on. After watching the video, he was able to recognize the 2D shapes underlying objects in our 3D world. This video IS a great addition to the series. This is teaching a toddler simple concepts, NOT teaching a 7 year old geometry."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAPES SONG IS NOT THE SAME-ENDLESS ADVERTS-DISNEY FAIL","review":"I was very disappointed in this-VERY DISAPPOINTED. Unlike many Amazon buyers and parents here, I did not mind the ORIGINAL Baby Newton on vhs as my son loves the shapes song;however, the song is now been turned into a dreary country western number with a sappy vocal delivery! Where is the original song that was such campy fun? To top it off, I am literally clicking through half a dozne times to get past ads-EVEN AFTER YOU PRESS PLAY ON THE MAIN FEATURE. Total fail and waste of money, should have just bought VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's a WASTE- Is this even from Baby Einstein?","review":"First let me say--my son LOVES the baby einstein videos--all of them--but this one. This doesn't come close--different format, weird animation and songs? it is totally random and doesn't have a good flow. It def. does not keep his attention (or mine). Save your money or buy Baby Neptune, MacDonald, Shakespear or any other one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"As other reviewers have said, why mess with what works; and the real world items chosen were terrible and too few. The abstract animation used to show the shapes was awful. The dancing crayons were lame. My son kept turning away from the TV during the show...and he's a huge Baby E fan. This is simply painful to watch after the other Baby E successes. The Baby E creators should be embarassed by this production."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"Why people are so critical about this new format of the video? It's still fun, educational and entertaining. My son actually loved it and was glued to the TV. If those changes came to lack of an educational part or something- I would complain. Puppets are as cute as ever, colours are bright and kids love it. What is wrong with the animation? Kids should be used to anything that can help them learn. I would highly recommend to buy this DVD. Thank you, Baby Einstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry-inducing","review":"As someone else said, this DVD has terrified my 17-mo. old daughter. I know children will react differently, but we can't even put it in anymore -- the scene with the dog being pelted by balls terrifes her and has scared her for DAYS now. She will not stop walking around saying, \\"bye, bye, doggie\\" while crying. I concur with others, too, about the low-rent quality of this DVD. It's boring and not as interesting as many of the others. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY AT OWN RISK- not like the baby einstein series","review":"I bought this for my 15 month old daughter even though I saw on the baby einstein website that there was a stupid-looking 2D clown in it. I thought it might still offer a good way to teach her shapes. It was so much worse than I had anticipated. It was like those cheesy, uninspired episodes of Sesame Street they show nowadays- nothing like the humorous, well-done stuff of the past. My daughter wouldn't even watch it at first. When she finally did start to watch it (she loves Pavlov and Charlie the duck), she was scared of the clown and I had to skip the parts with him in it. They should have kept to their original format with more puppets and saved the experimentation for another animals movie. There weren't even any kids in this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's Favorite","review":"I bought this video for my 7 month old son and he absolutely loves it. He could be playing with his other toys and as soon as I put in this video, he stops what he is doing to watch. Baby Newton will hold his attention until the end. I highly recommend this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The crayon characters frighten my toddlers.","review":"I have always been a big loyal fan of the Baby Einstein Company. We have all of the videos, and my twin toddlers never tire of them. So I couldn't wait to bring this one home. There is far too much computer animation, and very little puppets and children, and \\"real world objects\\", which are the signatures of their videos. The computer animated crayons (the main characters if you will) frighten my toddlers, especially when the blue crayon does his Tarzan impression. Heck...he scares me a bit too! I hope that the Baby Einstein Company will learn from the overall negative opinion of this release, and bring back their old style on their next endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite, but kids like some of it.","review":"I bought this without checking the reviews and regret it. As many people have commented, this is very different from the other Baby Einstein videos. There is WAY too much computer animation and are very few images of shapes. The photos they do have of shapes are vague, e.g. walking suitcases for rectangles. I'm sure there are far better examples of rectangles out there! Also, the song is unbelievably annoying. I prefer the classical music of the other BE videos.What drives me most crazy about this video is the behavior of the puppets. The lion has crayons in his mouth (a habit I'm trying to break my twins of) and the dog gets bowled over by a ton of balls (my kids cry every time this happens).This is a complete bust in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared my son!","review":"Having loved the Baby Einstein DVD's that we had seen, we expected our kids to love this one but we were mistaken. Our son started crying when the first scene started and didn't stop until we turned it off. We tried skipping ahead but he hated the whole thing. Where the other DVD's had been at a slower pace with little or no animation, this was almost frantic and all animation.Although I found them pretty boring, my kids really liked Baby Mozart and Neighborhood Animals. They were very simple with just pictures of animals or toys to classical music. This show, in sharp contrast was original (and originally BAD) music and, as I said, at an almost frantic pace.If you're looking for something for your kids, steer clear of the Baby Einstein series after they were bought by Disney. It all went South at that time. Stick to the original ones and you'll be much happier (and won't have to comfort freaked out little ones!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Baby Einstein Standards","review":"We, and our 18-month old, are big fans of the Baby Einstein series. However, Baby Newton is by far the poorest-quality selection of the bunch. The video aims to teach toddlers shapes, but the stock-footage examples of shapes are downright confusing. For example, the video shows a simple drawing of an oval and then provides as a real-world example an image of a bicycle back-lit by an oval lamp. I had a hard time figuring out that I was supposed to spot the oval shape in the background instead of focusing my attention on the large, circular wheels of the bicycle, and I have a PhD. from Harvard (really -- I swear.)Don't waste you time with this one; spend your hard-earned dollars on any of the other fine selections in the series. Might I suggest Baby Beethoven, World Animals (my son's favorite), or Baby Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended - one of the worst in the series !","review":"Baby Newton is about shapes. However, this DVD is not able to sustain my 15 mth old son's interest. My boy would probably just glance for couple of seconds when this dvd is playing and then do something else. Compared to the other dvds in the series, Baby Newton has got one of the slowest paced music in the background (which i consider boring) and the dvd is mostly about animated crayons that dance and form shapes.If you are wondering which ones in the series to get, I would recommend world animals, neighbourhood animals and van gogh as these 3 have very lively music and are very entertaining to watch - at least they are able to sustain my 15 mth old son's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am glad not the first one","review":"My son seems to likes parts of this video but not nearly like any of the others. Baby Mozart is by far the best one of the series. Any of the other DVD's work to keep my sons attention. If Baby Newton were the first one we had purchased we never would not have bought anymore. Maybe when my son is older he will like this one better. But at 1 year he has no interest. I would not waste my money on this one for a younger baby. You are better off getting Baby Mozart or one of the Baby Dolittles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Agree with the other reviewers. This one fails to engage my daughter, and I found it lacking charm. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"My child loves all the other Baby Einsteins.","review":"My child has greatly enjoyed watching the Baby Einstein videos since he was slightly over 3 months old (he is just over a year now), starting with Baby Mozart and Baby Bach and progressing to Baby Shakespeare and Van Gogh. We bought Baby Newton just before his first birthday. I find it far less engaging and creative than the others, and it contains a computer-generated image that terrified him and made him scream. We watched it twice and I will never play it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Baby Einstein any more","review":"Personally, I was mildly excited about Disney buying the BabyEinstien company. They had more resources to develop moreproducts and bring them to market, perhaps faster. AFamily-oriented entertainment company buying an infant-orientedentertainment company. It made sense.Unfortunately, they have effectively killed Baby Einstein.Instead of a video of \\"real world objects\\" they have gonecomputer-generated. Ok, the intro is classic Baby Einsteinstuff, but that's where it ends. It is not recognizable as aBaby Einstein DVD after the intro.Get Baby Mozart & Baby Bach for your very young infant. Theywill love it and you have a built-in 20 minute baby sitter soyou can eat dinner. Both of my twins LOVE these.Add Baby Shakespeare, Baby Santa and the Baby Doolittles whenyour baby reaches 6 to 10 months. I used-to consider the BabyEinstein tape the dog of the bunch, but that distinction isnow reserved for Baby Newton."},{"rating":"1","title":"They changed the format. Why mess with what works?","review":"They decided to add animation and lyrical music that is just regular music and not classical. Basically they decided to mess with the format that works for them. The whole point of Baby Einstein is that it is DIFFERENT from the million other things out there. Animation and \\"kid rock\\" music.....gee there's an original idea.....so original that you can find that in every video already out there. The whole point of Baby Einstein is that it is NOT animated and they play classical music. I am sorely dissapointed that they marketed this as a Baby Einstein product when it by no means follows the same format AT ALL. There is a lot of talking in this, a lot of singing with lyrics, a lot of animation. If they wanted to make this video they should have made it a seperate video with its own title and NOT marketed as part of the Baby Einstein series. This one was definitely a return (and I am a HUGE baby einstein fan)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm really disappointed","review":"We too are a family who has really enjoyed Baby Einstein's previous offerings. My daughter loves Baby Bach and the Baby Dolittle DVDs. But this one is nothing but junk... Gone are the cute interactions between the puppets and real-life items.

Expecting similar high standards in the selections of classical music, we were mortified when we were greeted by digitally created 'rapping' crayons.We only made it through 5 minutes of the film before we turned it off and started looking for the receipt.Our children LOVE the other videos in the series, but showed little interest (thank heavens) in this particular video.Do yourself a favor, buy the new \\"Baby Beethoven\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much help from Big Ol' Disney-","review":"What a major disappointment- I felt cheated for my triplets- they are 18 months and afraid of most of the animation and characters.

There is no story line really to speak of..it's more like 70's softcore with poorly edited together scenes of school girl rape. Not interesting, not entertaining, and I feel that they are just throwing these films out under Pinky Violence because it sells. I wish I hadn't been sold.

Most people do not know that infant products are full of harmful chemicals in the form of PVC, fire retardants, stain repellents, etc., including in most infant play mats. This one is made of wood, is VERY cute with the same kinds of educational toys as on the more commercial products, but without the plastics and fire retardants. We use a natural sheepskin rug under the arch and our baby is very happy with it.

Three of the ten manipulatives are tabs, which are more difficult for young children, but any adult would be eager to help out with this beautiful book.Our two-year old eagerly yells out each number and then counts the revealed objects. With this gorgeous teaching aid, learning is not only painless, but a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big mountains","review":"The Himalaya Mountains are majestic, to say the least.

Harriet Schecthter's inspirational book \\"Conquering Chaos at Work\\" is here and it's a gem, providing practical, no nonsense solutions to those organizational challenges that frustrate us daily at work.\\"Conquering Chaos at Work\\" fills a gaping void in previous organizational literature by not only addressing and resolving where our personal attempts to get organized may have failed, but also providing vital suggestions and systems to encourage and help the organizationally impaired people around us who may impact negatively on our own effectivess.\\"Conquering Chaos at Work\\" is a must for anyone who aspires to becoming more effective at work and at life.Do yourself and your organization a big favour and pop one in your shopping trolley now!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to insult the reader, is there?","review":"The book is an easy read. The case studies in Part III are very helpful. Unfortunately, it takes 179 pages to get to them.The main problem, in my opinion, is Part I, where the author breaks the rule she later spells out on page 173: \\"Nobody likes to be treated like an idiot. A patronizing air or condescending tone will get you resentment instead of cooperation.\\" Part I is rife with instances where the author (playfully?) injects snide comments about the reader.Reading this book will not be a waste of your time, but you may want to read just Part III. If you are looking to solve problems with coworkers, other books that may help are \\"Dealing With People You Can't Stand\\", and \\"Working With You is Killing Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good essay on Napoleon","review":"This is not strictly speaking a biography. It is more an essay on the imact of Napolean. It is an attempt to place Napoleon in context of world events. Johnson's conclusions that he was the developer of the authoritarian state are absolutely correct. Napoleon was a fantastic military leader, and great self promoter and opportunitst who led France and Europe into disaster.Johnson puts forward a compelling case that Napoleon's memory should be scorned. It is hard to see how the French regard him as a national hero after his actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleon a short history","review":"This is a very readable brief history of Napoleon that provides useful insight to those of us who are not Napoleonic scholars. I do not share the bias expressed by some reviewers that Johnson is too negative in his portrayal of Napoleon. I think he rightly points out Napoleon's brilliance as a tactician in war. He also acknowledges the artful manner in which Napoleon established subservient regimes (usually headed by one of his relatives) as a way to control large areas of Europe without leaving behind massive standing armies.Napoleon loved war and power. In spite of his rise to leadership as a byproduct of the French Revolution, to try to paint him as an enlightened ruler and not as a dictator would deny the historical record of his behavior.I recommend this book as a fun and informative read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliff Notes For Napoleon Dummies","review":"I wanted to learn more about one of the most influential people of all time, but I didn't want to be intimidated by the subject either. A lot of the books on Napoleon looked long and dry. I found Paul Johnson's short (180 pages) accounting of Napoleon's extraordinary life just the thing. I was fascinated by all he'd accomplished, good and bad, and left wanting more. I look at this book as an appitizer for the larger subject ahead, should I feel like gorging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely biased and unorganized","review":"The book from the beginning is absolutely biased. I read through the first few chapters, thinking it would stop soon, or thinking that I had misinterpretted the authors intentions. However, it does not stop! Curious, I looked at the author's information and sure enough he is British. He is writing a book about a person who, to him, is no more of an asset to humanity than the plague. How can he be considered a historian?Furthermore, the book was extremely unorganized. Instead of proceeding in a chronological order, the author narrates haphazardly, skipping from one subject to the other as he fancies. Just because he though of a new reason why he hates Napoleon does not mean he can just write whatever he wants in a historical record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Members of the Napoleon cult will loathe this book","review":"Paul Johnson has written a readable and interesting biography of Napoleon. It is obvious from the first page, that Johnson holds the French emperor in contempt. But, what is fascinating is that the writer does such a great job of establishing the case against Bonaparte. Any of the \\"great\\"(and short-lived) achievements of Napoleon pale in comparison to the destruction he brought to Europe. Indeed, during his pathetic exile, Europe returned to the political systems of the past. Johnson's book will encourage readers to further explore Bonaparte's life. Indeed, I am currently reading Will and Ariel Durant's The Age of Napoleon and beginning to agree with the shrewd insights contained in Johnson's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skimpy, sloppy, disappointing","review":"I am reading War and Peace and sorely need to know something more about Napoleon, an important figure in the story. This book is little help, only reinforcing my superficial notion of the man as a pint-sized, peculiar megalomaniac. Other disappointed reviewers offer passages that get their points across; I'll add the one in which the author describes a scene from Napoleon's marriage to princess Marie-Louise. \\"She was slow. Impatient as ever, he would hustle her along, slapping her broad rump and saying, 'Get a move on!'\\" An author who can cook up that sort of unsupported nonsense isn't to be trusted with the history of great nations. And his hyper-nationalistic disregard for the French people is odious, saying that the entire population are \\"amateurs d'art, intellectuals, or at least pseudo-intellectuals.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"Paul Johson's book is too biased to be considered serious scholarship.

Why??? It is hilarious! The writer talks about 1790's just as if he lived in 1790's! This plus the vivid descriptions of Napoleon's sex life makes this book too funny to take it seriously or use it as a historical study.If I have bought this book from Fiction shelves I would have definitely rate it 5 stars because it's a great work of fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can never judge a book by its cover.","review":"I learned this the hard way.The hard cover's exterior is impressive and when you read Paul Johnson's quote at the back, you get the feeling that the author is writing about a subject he was tremendously impressed with. Read the book and it seems like Wellington's own secretary decided to spare a few words on Europe's greatest conqueror.A defining tragedy in a book lovers life is falling for an expensive hardcover on a very good subject and finding out that the book is absolutely pathetic. Even if i wanted to resell it, i would be cheating the person up front if i asked for more than a buck on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lost balance","review":"If you hate Napoleon you will love this book. If you love Napoleon you will hate this book. If you are looking for unbiased writing, you won't find it in Mr. Johnsons offering. The vituperative character assaults start in the introduction, and are laced throughout. This is a simplistic rehash of contemporary negative propoganda from Napoleons enemies, and in no way should be taken as a serious historical study. There is no sense of a balanced viewpoint. Every negative inuendo and rumour finds its way into this book, and are presented as fact. The title should have read \\"I Hate Napoleon\\", and is an example of slander at its nastiest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple design, works well.","review":"It does what it says. Nothing exceptionally good or bad.The unit I got has a removable plastic grill at the bottom to prevent things from going in from outside. The product description doesn't show the grill. I think it is a useful feature to prevent squirrels or other critters from going in.The spring loaded door works fine. There is a a slight air gap (very slight) when closed. Perhaps a stronger spring would have held it down a bit better.Other than that minor point, I like the wall cap. I use it with a 6-inch inline duct fan to exhaust soldering smoke from my garage lab setup. I would give it a 4.49 rating :-) if I could.

Although fiction, it will not be surprising to hear stories like this from that era. I for one don't believe that german wives and other german civvies were not aware of what was happening in the camps. They just chose to ignore it out of fear or whatever.

It is written in easy to read prose, but the reader is still able to feel the crippling pain the author experiences. Not being a sufferer of chronic pain, this book gave me a fresher perspective in how to deal with the physical torments of others. I now have a deeper compassion than previously. And yet, this book doesn't necessarily limit itself to physical misery; it can also pertain to mental or emotional anguishes that we feel discouraged about.

Maybe if I had paid... like most videos of this quality cost, I wouldn't be so negative but the cost of this set was way overpriced on the good. Pick up some puppets and interact with your child yourself. Buy some flashcards if you wish as well. Your child will enjoy that time more than having some faceless voice speaking to them on TV.

Of course he is supervised while watching, but I admit it gives me a change to make a phone call or fold laundry. Many people are disturbed by Julie Clark's high pitched voice.

It migrated my data fine and runs without crashing but I am still in search of new functionality. I don't download account data from banks so if functional improvements were made in this area I am oblivious to them. I do know that the screen jumps when entering transactions in the portfolio summary - maybe something that can be patched by Microsoft before it is offered as a \\"feature\\" in Money 2007.

The effect is unnecessary pause, after unnecessary pause, after unnecessary pause. There is a setting that is supposed to turn this off, but it doesn't! Calls and e-mails to technical support will get you anything except an answer. So, if you have a large financial database that has grown for several years, stick with Money 2004.

I have to say I am VERY impressed with the level of craftsmanship this album has. It has some of their most melodic, and beautiful songs to date. Songs like Perish and Hung Up are just beautiful in their construction. Not to say they have softened their approach to music. Songs like Chainmail and Hell Above the Water are quite the aural assault that they are famous for. They experiment more with electronic dancey beats, like in Fly With the High, and ambient sounds (Polaroid, Bleeding Heart). This is just a great album, from a most underated band.

Excellent music from a great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight","review":"Curve's fifth release, Gift, is their most compelling blend of techno and dreampop yet. Vocalist Toni Halliday throws her fierce, filtered vocals up against Dean Garcia's abrasive staccato guitars and the clash is mesmerizing. At times, Gift is as sensual as Kate Bush at a rave (\\"Want More, Need Less\\"). Then, it's Madonna if she were a true Goth and not just playing one on TV (\\"Perish\\"). Then, it sounds like the album Garbage fans were expecting from Shirley Manson and Co., all petulant attitude and harsh dance beats. In whatever form, after the harsh dead end of Come Clean, Gift is a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"No better time for a 'Gift'","review":"Never one to rest on their haunches, Curve has once again produced one of the most lush, energetic albums of the year. Forgoing their 'shoegazing' roots again for more electronica, 'Gift' offers fans 10 perfectly crafted songs of depression, desire, lust, and greed that are wrapped around borderline cacophony guitars that somehow translate into danceable beats and melodies that makes you feel like nothing else in the world. Toni's vocals have never been so clear and chilling as on this album, not to metion her superb lyric cababilites that sometimes rivals the best poets of the world (possibly channeling the spirit of Edgar Alan Poe sometimes).

The first 50 pages were ok, but after that it went down hill. I was in Hokkaido Japan over Xmas with this book, hoping to read it near the fire at night.

A blizzard has the group snowbound and the Boys are almost lost in the storm when they run the Morton's dune buggy into a pond while chasing the suspects! \\"Farming Fear\\" is very reminiscent of the original Hardy Boys stories (particularly \\"The Mystery Of Cabin Island\\") and is sure to please older fans of the series as well as younger ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Working....","review":"Received my remanufactured iRiver on time.

However if you do not have that kind of time, this work by Jane Smiley is excellent. Whoever marries the authors to the subjects should be commended. Jane Smiley is a best-selling author. Who better to write on the foremost novelist during the high noon of the novel as a medium?This book provided an excellent overview not only of the life of Dickens, which can be summed up as \\"poor boy makes good,\\" but also the novels themselves. I do not agree with some of Jane Smiley's criticism (\\"Pickwick Papers\\" is a good read, despite what she says), but by and large she is on target with a great deal of what she has to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Overview","review":"This lively book provides an overview of the literary achievements and personal life of Charles Dickens. For those Amazon.com customers who, like me, don't know how to approach this writer's vast achievements, I provide this advice from Smiley, who is an intelligent, charming, and enthusiastic biographer: \\"But a newcomer to Dickens can do no better than to begin with a novel-my suggestions are David Copperfield, to be followed by Great Expectations, Dombey and Son, A Tale of Two Cities, and Our Mutual Friend, in that order, light, dark, light, dark, light, a wonderful chiaroscuro of Dickens's most characteristic and accessible work.\\" Bravo for Jane and her fun and concise treatment of an enormous subject!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Steps for Little Feet","review":"Smiley is a true scholar of Dickens, but this chatty, elementary book is a piece of condescension (or a greedy publisher), and was not immediately useful for my paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"friends, relatives. no mention of how they are connected","review":"for somebody who just rolled out from under the stone, i dont see how all these people that she mentions in the book, are connected to mr, dickens. i didnt live in england in the nineteenth century. i dont know who he is. and lucky, or maybe unlucky for me, the author doesnt help me finding out who are all the other people in his life. names are listed, but not their relation to him.here is a quote from the first paragraph. dickens, born on february 7, 1812, was only twenty-one, but because....it took me a few minutes before i decided to ignore it, and not to try to understand this sentence. maybe i am dum, i dont know?i would look for another biography if i was looking today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Man-Bag but Also Works as an Everything Bag for Women","review":"Although listed as a man's utility clutch, I purchased it as a way to downsize my purse.

However, you can hook the shoulder strap to the main wrist strap ring, and a coordinating heavy ring on the opposite side.The leather is soft and the construction appears to be very well made.

Mine misfeeds paper regularly, so you must be prepared to manually adjust it. That's fine for printing 3 pages but time consuming for 20 pages. The color quality is marginally acceptable: soon after loading a new cartridge the color will have striped effects and no amount of coaxing with the recommended methods has an effect. The speed is slow. If you abandon printing with it for a while you will find that the nozzles of the not-inexpensive ink cartridges have dried irredeemably, requiring replacement of both the black and the color toner although both cartridge reports may read as nearly full. Passable for regular very light use, not suitable for production use."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Dell is still selling this printer? Amazing. I got one of these three years ago for $20 as a special offer with a Dell laptop that I purchased. Twenty bucks is about what it's worth. It consistently misfeeds paper, so your prints come out crooked half the time or the printer just jams. The print quality is barely adequate in either color or black and white. It's OK to have around as a scanner and copier, provided you don't need top quality. But buy something else if you're going to be doing any real printing.

This book requires effort. You will do the work of understanding its metaphors through your own experiences and developments.

Such is the case with \\"The Hatha Yoga Pradipika.\\" This 15th Century manuscript gives a clear description of the austerities the ancient yogis observed in their search for wisdom. While many of their practices would not be done today, the text is worth reading, even to those who have studied Ayurveda and are somewhat adept in practicing its principles. Brian Akers' translation from the original Sanskrit is concise and easy to follow, a real plus when the subject is so far from today's norm.

After a label change and a one-year delay, \\"Egodram\\" arrived with a few problems. The over-all fantastic feel of Das Ich is here, but the original feel has been slightly replaced with more traditonal acts like NIN. Some songs shine with classic Das Ich brilliance, like \\"Blutquell\\" and \\"Egodram\\", while others are dulled with too many abbrasive sounds and, gasp, distorted vocals; Stefan's vocals are far too unique to ever need distortion. I do not wish to imply too much negativity, this is a great CD most especialy one to dance to, but Das Ich's prior releases, the horrific soundtrack \\"Das Innere Ich\\" for example, are pure in their uniqueness and better represent the talent of Bruno's musical talent. Still, it is a must buy for all Das Ich fans, of which, I most certainly am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated theories posed as facts","review":"If you are looking for a book that will explain the uses, and the effects of certain sports supplements and or drugs this is not the book.

Mainly because they didnt have anything new out and because a lot of good stuff like the Killers, The Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand came out. But I was pretty pumped for the new DM cd and i wasnt let down. I actually was afraid that they were moving away from their synth roots since the last album was so mellow and let electronic. But this album opens up in your face. Its rockin and dancin at the same time. It reminds me a lot of Violator but even back before Black Celebration when they were all synths all the time. I dont know why some people are giving this a bad review when this is clearly such an awesome production. It wont be leaving my cd player anytime soon. This is actually the first DM album i liked straight up in the first listen. All the others take a few listens and then they become your favorite. This just caught me from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Depeche Mode fan could only appreciate...","review":"So, when did it become against the law to change? If a band or solo artist tries anything outside of what was once commercially acceptable, people hate. But if they re-run the same beat over and over again, people hate.As a DM fan for over 15 years, I can say that yes, originally, I wasn't feeling this CD. I had high expectations and was hoping for yet another Violator or possibly Music for the Masses, but Playing the Angel is great on its own merits.I think the people who are writing negative reviews are those that were only into DM based on their singles, on not on their albums as a whole.Playing the Angel is more along the lines of Songs of Faith and Devotion for me with the same dark undertones and creative lyrics.For those true DM fans out there... buy this CD. You'll enjoy it's sound and by the way, Dave Gahan's voice has never sounded better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete... DM should do it better ...","review":"Ihave been waiting for a new DM production. When I heard Precious, I think it was a return to paths a la Violator, but is most a mix from Song of Faith and Devotion with no guitars and a minimalistic approach without and objetive. The disc is indeed the darkest production, but not the better You have to listen the songs many times before you start to like them. The disc is incomplete and the production is full of mediocrity, I concur with the ones that miss Alan Wilder.Definitely DM should do it better if they want to stay fresh, actually they are not what they used to, and I doubt they would be again what they were in Music for the Masses, or Violator (the best albums). Playing the Angel lacks of the power of those productions both in the production and in tempo. DM missed the chance to recover their site as an influential and innovative band they once were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Violator and any of the old Depeche Mode albums...","review":"Please listen to this new album very carefully. Playing the Angel is not as good as Violator and any of the old Depeche Mode albums. The new hit song, \\"Precious,\\" does not seem to end very well.

If I wanted a Nine Inch Nails album, I would have bought one. Not only would a NIN album have actually BEEN Nine Inch Nails, it would have SOUNDED heaps better than this DM crap also. For a band that gave us so many fantastic songs, this is pathetic. Go back to bringing up kids and mowing the lawns or whatever it is you old farts normally do. Leave the NIN albums to Trent. They are heaps better at it than you old smelly tools. Geez, what a stink from the this album. I want my money back. I waited years for this? And as for you Martin Gore, what's with your hair? You look stupid, buddy. Stay indoors. Don't come out ever again. You suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like Ultra all over again","review":"When Depeche Mode dissapeared in the 90s I feared they would never release a new album and I think I can all say we were all blown away by Ultra, which many consider to be DM's top 3 albums of all time easily.Then I questioned DM's ability to survive after I heard the mixed bag that was known as Exciter, it was DM, but it was a bit too dancy.Then David Gahan releases his solo album and I truly feared DM might stop playing as a band.Well true synthpop fans rejoice, everything you liked about Ultra is back again, 'Playing the Angel' is a very mature and complex album. The beats are interesting and the singing is rich, if you like DM at all, this is an album to buy. Every song is really good (no particular song is their best ever, but they're all really good!). The synth work can be very dark and slow and sometimes touches on the complex styles of IDM (without the dancy aspects)."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the precious single instead","review":"There is just one good track on this album, and it is Precious, which is a new depeche mode classic in the vein of Enjoy the Silence. But even this standout is nearly sunk by an absurd lyric about silver wings. The Depeche Mode rhyming scheme, once so charming, has kind of worn out its welcome.Most of these songs are tuneless. The striving gospel numbers seem forced. The lyrics are laughable pop-psychobabble. The overfiltered and dirtied vocals don't suit the songs half of the time. Not nearly as good as Exciter, which had several good tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough of the 80's synthesizer!","review":"I love depeche mode and I really think they struck a nerve and found their souls in Songs of Faith & Devotion and Ultra.Think back for a minute and realize what made those 2 albums so powerful. For one, the band was bouncing back from depression and drug use. Second, they used (for the most part) natural instruments. When those drums (from a real drum set) came crashing down, you felt it right through your spine. The synthesizer just doesn't provide that reality...cause it is what it is....synthesized music...yuk.Sorry, but I'm sooo over their 80's sound.

The kindly gentlmen from various production houses who want to add something 'impressive' and 'original' to their resumes. It's no accident that Flood will not have anything to do with them.I will state it, bluntly, this band should have stopped when Alan Wilder left. There is no other way to view it; ignore all the talk of analogue equipment being brought back in for the making of this album.Depeche Mode have obviously been listening to bands who sound like them, there is no other explanation for such a banal and derivative clunker like 'playing the angel' (or perhaps it should have been titled 'playing the angle' as it is quite calculated).If this one isn't the end god help us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish lyrics, rubbish songs.","review":"This terrible album you must ridthe lyrics have been written by an 8 year old kidThis DM album really sucksdon't give them your hard earned bucksAll the lyrics try hard to rhymeso anything goes, dime, lime, crimeDoesn't matter if it doesn't make sensetheir ageing fat fans spring to it's defence4 years for this?

The only bearable song on the entire album is Precious. DM fans seem to be deaf and blind to the fact that this band gets worse with each album release. Since Alan Wilder left the group the rhythm parts and even the catchy melodies are just GONE and now it seems never to return either.This entire album is even worse than \\"exiter\\" which was their tragedy in music making. All sounds very a tonal, no melodies , nothing catchy which you at least would expect of such great songwriters. The worst is that we know they can , but simply they refuse to use their talent in any productive way. This is not a new road to take surely. I appreciate a band experimenting but this one definately is an experiment gone wrong.Of course this album will sell shiploads and see if they care, but to me this album is the Depeche Mode's (fans )emperors clothes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never be the same...","review":"I am 35, father of two who was a die hard DM fan in the 80's. What a wonderful ride that was! Then they changed after the \\"Violator\\". Started exploring some weird sounds a lot of noise but no catchy tunes. This album is one of them. Precious is a good song, reminds me \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" but not a song that I would wanna listen over and over again. Lilian is a catchy tune but again it will never be a hit.They say a band should adapt to new times and generations (i.e Rolling Stones). Call me boring or old fashioned but never wanted DM change or explore new sounds. I think if they stuck with their original new wave style they would have sold more records thanks to their loyal fans. I buy every new DM album anyway with some hope that they would take me back to those days again, even though I know it will never be the same..."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Playing the angel' has to be one of DM's best work","review":"Absolutely superb CD! I've always been a fan of Depeche Mode, but was very disappointed with their last album (Exciter). This has some spunk to it and makes you want to dance! I just love this CD and continue to play it over and over. I enjoyed it right off the bat, but it grows on you more and more as you listen to it. 'Precious' is one of my favorite tracks from the CD, but altogether I can't find one song on this CD that I don't like. Great job my fellow guys from Basildon, Essex (that's England, you know)! I highly recommend this CD to any Depeche Mode fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A steaming pile of manure","review":"If you have heard the track \\"Precious\\" and thought that this was a taste of things to come on this album, YOU WERE WRONG.This is so bad, it doesn't even sound like DM. It sounds like REO Speedwagon or The Eagles with a few plinky-plonky synth sounds thrown in. A self-indulgent journey that fits the description of Banal Rock rather than any other genre. Structure-less songs a wash with the most childishly written lyrics. It's a shame there isn't a way to give it MINUS 5 stars, because that's what I'd give it. IGNORE ALL THE OBVIOUS PLANTS BY THE RECORD COMPANY IN THIS REVIEW SECTION SAYING IT'S GREAT AND COMPARING IT TO OTHER DM WORKS. IT HAS ****NOTHING**** TO DO WITH OTHER DEPECHE MODE RELEASES. Do yourself a favour and buy a Pink Floyd or Emerson, Lake & Palmer record if you want some crappy 70's rock with a smattering of synth sounds. It doesn't deserve to have the DM name on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype - wait to buy it used or download Precious","review":"I am shocked, not by this album but by the positive reviews people have left for it here. PTA is a bit of boring noise with bad lyrics tossed in - except for Precious. Isn't it interesting that the first single, Precious, is like nothing else on the album? Guess someone realised it was best to release the only remotely catchy song to sell the otherwise boring cd.My suggestion - buy the single. If you are a huge fan then wait to get the album used. Bet all you positive reviewers will find many copies of this album in the used cd bins.As a side note, I love Industrial, noise and effects in songs, but they all seem so phoney here. Not my DM anymore. Sorry guys it's a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing broken here.","review":"After all these years, Depeche Mode prove that they've still got it.

I find quite a few number of songs in this album remarkable, and as good examples of this evolution. There a couple ones though, that would have been better left out..

The darkest album by Depeche Mode BY FAR is Black Celebration, a musical tour de force by a group that knew what they were doing. This album is just so so. Neither great, neither good, neither unlistenable. It' just kind of \\"there\\". it has the big emotional hit that sounds like Depeche Mode still has it (Precious), but that's it. I loved almost everything DM did up to their so so album Ultra. In retrospect, I even liked that album more than I thought I did. But Exciter (just awful) and this thing....just not doing it for me. I want DM to be great again. They deserve it. They have been around for THIRTY YEARS (which shows how long I've been a fan). And I want to like the new album Sounds of the Universe and give it a try, but from what I can tell by the singles and the samples, I might be dissapointed. I think I'll go into my time capsule now, close the door, and listen to Violater, Music for the Masses, and 101."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depeche Mode continues to rock","review":"First of all, the editor who wrote the first review is incorrect--Martin did not write every song on the album. For the first time, there are three tracks written by Dave Gahan (\\"I Want it All,\\" \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" and \\"Suffer Well\\"), whose song-writing abilities were demonstrated on Paper Monsters. In fact, \\"Suffer Well\\" is one of the best tracks, along with \\"John the Revelator\\" and \\"Precious.\\" The album is a wonderful listen. Sadly, DM often is incorrectly labeled as an 80's band. Some of their best albums, including Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion were released in the 90's. The songs are a natural development for DM and you can hear some of the experimental work Martin has been perfecting. For example, \\"Lilian\\" is remniscent of \\"I Cast A Lonely Shadow from Martin's Counterfeit 2 ep.

Playing the Angel was long overdue but sooo worth the wait. Right now Im loving Tracks 3 and 7 best. No one sings like Gahan. No one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album is their worse yet. I love DM and really think that they are trying too hard to reinvent themselves and their music and are going the wrong route. Let's face it, an old 80's band like DM is a love it or hate it band and will NOT attract new fans. All they can do is maintain the loyal ones like myself. I thought Exciter wasn't all that great, but it was ok..if..you are a loyal fan. But this new album is simply boring and awful with the exception of 2-3 songs. Still I bought it and am going to their concert as a true fan. I think that this maybe their very last DM album. Atleast if they make a new album, make it like the old electronic DM classics we all know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"another brilliant recording...","review":"i've exhausted myself in an attempt to dispelsome of the negative reviews of this album...then, i realized i've been doing damage control ever since violator came out..so, i'm done with it.this is another brilliant recording from depeche mode...if you're already a fan, embrace it.if not, that's just unfortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Love it.

Dave wrote three and generally you can tell. They are a bit trite for my tastes. As for pretentiousness cropping up in MArtin's vocally led songs, that's bogus for anyone who is a fan of Depeche. The appeal of MArtin is exactly the effect these songs give off.In short, not their greatest, but enough highlights to continue to be relevant.

Depeche Mode is my favourite group in the world- they are just awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't just brooding - it's boring","review":"Listen, I'm a big Depeche Mode fan and I don't know what these people praising this album are talking about. Every song is either slow or very slow, filled with lots of weird synth noises and distortion. There's so much distortion in the first track I thought that I bought a defective CD. These guys are quite capable of writing great songs and there isn't any here. But hey, if you like dreary songs that lack melody with lots of weird noises in them, then by all means, who'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"respectable but a bit over-hyped too","review":"At least half of the Cd is worth listening to.

Im dissapointed to say this cd sounds sad and old like the bands picture.If you are unsure of what to buy of them I would recomend 'Speak and Spell' from their early years. A more modern suggestion would be Violator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi Precious","review":"Depeche Mode has always been my favorite band. However, I have noticed a gradual decline in song quality since Exciter. Exciter had some really good tracks, but it had some notably bad tracks such as the biblically slow \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Comatose\\". If you enjoyed the slow and uninspiring \\"Breathe\\" along with some of the slower selections from Martin's 2004 \\"Counterfeit2\\" lp, then you should buy this release.Precious is the strongest track this time out, but the rest pale in comparison. It feels as though Martin is \\"hanging by a rope of mediocrity\\". I advise bringing back either Tim Simenon or Alan Wilder. Andrew Fletcher was right when he said that this was their best work since \\"Speak & Spell\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as advertised. Nowhere near Violator.","review":"....or Music For the Masses....or Black celebration....Is it a bad album? No. Not at all. It is just an example of an older band making music that doesn't really hit the mark. It's normal to make comparisons to older classic albums, but those are often heights that just can't be reached again.The songs on Playing The Angel are filled to the brim with pretentious vocals. Gahan still wallows in his own misery, which is pretty typical. The music doesn't really catch your ear though. It's slow and even jarring at times. Basically, it's boring. If you're a huge DM fan, you'll want it. Just don't get your hopes up too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Depeche Mode Album since Violator","review":"I've only listened to this album twice, yet the music and words already stick.The album has a really good sound to it. The songs are full of memorable harmonies and melodies, and the engineering/production is top notch. Much of the synthesis is done using high-end synthesis and effect software, mostly Native Instrument's \\"Reaktor\\". The advances of synthesis techonology has clearly affected DM's sound in a very positive way. After 25 years of electronic based music, Depeche mode is clearly still at the cutting edge.The first single \\"Precious\\", by the way, was written by Martin as he went through a recent divorce. The song was written for his children.This is the best Depeche Mode album since violator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Depeche Album post-Alan Wilder","review":"This is their return to dark-brooding electronic rock. The synths are great, production is top-notch. Gahan's vocals are second to none, and Gore's guitar seems to be a rift machine.5/5 songs : A Pain That I'm Used to, John the Revelator, Precious, I Want It All, The Darkest Star, The Sinner In Me,Nothing's Impossible4/5 songs : Suffer Well, Macrovision, Lilian3/5 songs : Damaged People, Introspectre(instrumental)overall- their strongest album since SOFAD and since Alan Wilder left in 1995."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Violater : Version 2005\\"","review":"The industrial 80's are BACK!!! The subtitle on the back cover says it all: \\"PAIN AND SUFFERING IN VARIOUS TEMPOS\\" Each song on the album builds on the other, mixing Dave Gahan's achingly poweful vocals over a soundscape of budding synthesizers. Singled out, \\"John the Revelator\\" is probably the best song on the CD. Other notable songs include current single \\"Precious\\", \\"The Sinner in Me\\" and \\"Lilian.\\" Disappointed there are no songs on here resembling \\"Dream On\\" or \\"I Feel Loved\\" from 'Exciter', at first listen the CD will immediately take you back to days of masterpiece 'Violater'. Though the change is welcome, I am looking forward to the massive remixes DJ's should be coming out with to these lush songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Return To Form...","review":"Exciter never excited but the Angel seems dark and brooding, which is to say that Depeche Mode (DM) are back at doing what they do best, write songs that linger in your mind long after you heard them, causing mild pain and slight trauma...I love that stuff.Playing The Angel is a good return to form for DM since I almost gave up on this band with Exciter. That album had 2 good songs and a pathetic rest. On the contrary, I found only two tracks on Angel irritating and out of place. Damaged People and Macro, which when deleted from this CD make it good from first to last.I like almost all the songs, although I should confess a greater liking for A Pain that I am Used To, Lillian, Suffer Wll and Darkest Star..very sad, very dark and sometimes very depressing. This is exactly why I love DM. A good CD to buy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Pain and Suffering","review":"\\"Playing the Angel\\", Depeche Mode's most recent music effort is a lyrical journey filled with \\"pain and suffering in various tempos\\". Despite the fact that a majority of this record seems to be suspended in a state of wretched melancholy, there are quite a few songs that deserve recongition as truly inspirational standout tracks. High points include: \\"a pain that i'm used to\\", \\"john the revelator\\", \\"suffer well\\", \\"precious\\", \\"i want it all\\", and \\"lilian\\". Now...this is not to say that the rest of the album is undeserving of any praise; to the contrary, all of the songs thrive in riveting sounds and beautifully haunting vocals...this is a must have for all Depeche Mode fans and an obvious departure from the group's previous work with \\"Exciter\\"..... After a few careful listens I must say I recommend it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damm good album.","review":"I am a huge DM fan so it's hard to dissapoint me.

Love this band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectations too high?","review":"After looking at the latest BILLBOARD top 40 list and seeing that I do not like any of the artists, I have to say I'm simply glad to have a new album from DM. Thanks guys!! I may have had my expectations too high for this one, because I just can't get into it. All the pre-release reviews I read said it was pure DM, but I don't think this sounds like anything they've released before, sans the track DEAD OF NIGHT on EXCITER.Tracks I listen to: SINNER IN ME, PRECIOUS, I WANT IT ALL, LILLIAN, and DARKEST STARThese tracks are good, but I feel that all of them have so much more potential. The remaining seven tracks? Too much production on them (beeps, chirps, etc...). This record sounds like someone took a blender and poured in MODE, MASSIVE ATTACK, and NIN, but left that blender on WAY TOO LONG!Again, I'm very happy to get a new DM album. Unfortunately I'm already looking forward to the next one.KB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT their best work","review":"I was hoping for a better album than ULTRA because they are due for one but sadly, this is not that album.

This is not an inter-faith dialogue, as is suggested, but an examination of what the author believes is false and what the author believes is true.

It is cleary written from a Muslim perspective which the reader would be advised to keep in mind. He doesn't offer the Christian perspective at all, the title is a joke. If you are picking up this book for religious understanding, I would suggest you not waste your time.

On the other hand, it ignores the inconsistencies present in Islam, the morally ambiguous questions that arise from the life of Muhammad and his succesors, and otherfacts.If it had included these things, then it might have had some balance. For, to question these things about Islam is similar in offensiveness to the way the author attacks Christianity. But this is not the case.

It's a shame, because I think she has a better voice than Faith, it's just not properly used. 5 of the 11 full length tracks list Kelly Price as a producer. Maybe next time she should leave the producing to someone more qualified, and stick to the vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE !!!","review":"Kelly has a very big voice but no idea how to use it to maximum advantage. If she'd sung half the notes she sings on this cd it would have been too many - after one listening I'm completely melismatized.People think Mariah Carey defines over-singing. Not any more. Welcome to the new undisputed world champion. Just listen to the sample of \\"Your Love\\" (track 10) and get a taste of what you will find towards the end of all the other songs.On a good note, \\"Friend Of Mine\\" is a good tune and a great vocal arrangement, and if Kelly had sung a few notes less on this, I would have kept the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"Kelly Price is a alright vocalist even though she sounds alot like Faith&Mary.she is a alright song-writer but the music here is flat.very predictable.only the remix of Friend of mine stands out.with Ronald Soulful\\" Isley &R.Kelly.and mainly because it sounds alot like his Down Low song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly speaks the truth about men","review":"I think kelly is a lovely young woman and she should not worry about what other people(animals) think about her weight the world does nto revolve on weight aand apperience she has a lovely voice and she should countinue to sing because she has a lovely voice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirring The Spirit","review":"I am an African-American 32 year old woman. My idea of good music is to go back to old school music where good music stayed--in the old days! UNTIL I heard this CD! Absolutely magnificent! I miss the days of Aretha and Patty sanging not singing, but SANGING! Just like my title says, it stirs your spirit. Even though the topics are worldly, you feel like you are listening to one of the sisters in church. You just don't want to go home. Kelly girl, keep up the good work. Don't let me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middel school music","review":"I loved this album in middel school! Secret Love and its remix made me buy the album and after that I was hooked, the only song i didn't care for we will just blame on lil' Cease or whatever his name was. Take me to a dream is my champion cut from this album, and the studio work she put into the album makes it truely personel, and her voice is so ruch and full. The titel track is another stand out cut that alot of people can probably relate alot to..about that special person in your life that you sometimes let down. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys soul aand r&b..I miss the times of these albums..before Ciara and Lil Jon(no disrespect)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will never find another CD like that, never ever!","review":"Everyone know that she's got the greatest voice in the world.

The stories range from Bulgakov-like surrealist fables to visions of apocalyptic meltdown, with a good deal of vividly- described dissolute behavior by the inhabitants of these curious demimondes. Tough, scary, and funny, and an early taste of what may well be the next literary hotbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"This book helped me make my two children a part of a funeral and grieving experience that will help them the rest of their lives. Their grandfather died and I didn't have a clue what to do. A friend gave me this book and it was perfect. They drew pictures to go in the casket, helped me pick out what he wore and even wrote a poem together to be read at the service. They were so happy to be part of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book stinks","review":"This book provided NO insight after the death of my youngest son to my other children. I purchased this thinking it would help in some way, but it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. It is a VERY small book. It should be listed under \\"PAMPLETS\\". Definitely NOT recommended- not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful, but not the best","review":"I was excited to read this book after hearing so much talk about nonviolent communication in my local parents group, but I was really dissappointed by some of it.I think that the book is worth reading, and the exercises are worth reading through, but I don't think this is the ultimate way to communicate.In the interest of being practical, solutions can be worked out that honor the childs feelings and desires and respect the kid completely, but don't turn into these drawn out episodes, like the nightmare on the slide.I wish that this book was peppered with a healthy dose of humor, humility and playful parenting and also more practical and adaptive in the situations in which these conflicts would arise.Not every situation or every child should be treated the same, but the book does provide some good starting points, many of which I believe are better sold in books like \\"How to talk so your kids will listen\\", etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Postonove","review":"As always the Favela Chic Postonove collection brings us quality music with great artists that, in my case, it was the first time I've heard them.This compilation is really nice to hear with a really good introduction, one of my favourites, and it really flows from them on, with great songs for all the tastes, one of them Balanca Pema, is really a gem and really hard to find.I advice you to purchase this album, it will open many doors you didn't knew they existed in brazilian music.Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Cultures Revisited","review":"This is a superb collection of essays by leading contemporary philosophers of religion reflecting on the great divide between philosophers of religion and theologians. As one author notes, philosophers writing on issues in philosophy of religion take theism seriously; scholars in religious studies often do not. Philosophers considering religious claims consider arguments and ask whether the claims are true; religious studies folks are more inclined to see them as cultural artifacts and treat religious belief as a social phenomenon, often dismissing the question of truth value.Philosophers will be delighted with this book; theologians will be irritated. Readers who are neither philosophers nor theologians will be tickled to get a look into the arcane worlds of academic philosophy and theology and may be surprised.All the essays are accesible--nothing heavy. A good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The new control configurations kill the game","review":"Madden 2005 was a 10/10 star game, but even thou it has better graphics, updated rosters, super star mode, but the problem is that i can't make the control configurations the way it was in Madden 2005, because if i change one letter than it will change the other one. And also Madden 06 is very slow, not because of the hardware but because of the way it's done. It also has problems on Windows 64-bit acording to every user that has this game on Win64.I really don't recomend buying this game to others, better spend your money on other game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Issues-Cannot Play","review":"I am having the same issues as the below reviews. I would love to be able to rate this game, however I cannot because I have not yet been able to play. It locks up on the initial load screen, and as below the only way to remedy is to reboot. I've given up on a solution until an update from EA is available.P.S.-I have gotten the game to work, though not correctly. By renaming the \\"music\\" folder to \\"music1\\" the game will play, but without the in-game music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superstar mode... big deal!","review":"After I purchased the game and loaded it on my computer I became very upset and disappointed. Aside from a few gameplay additions, nothing had changed with the game, and its roster management. The superstar thing is a waste of time for me as well as it seems as though Madden is catering to the growing TO problem. You know... Me Me Me... I I I... I wanted the game to be more diverse and user friendly on the roster screens. And what happened to the draftees coming from your NCAA game into the Madden game. This was a feature I enjoyed. I was completely disappointed with the game and if you are like me, use Madden 2005 and find the updated rosters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This is an awesome game. Don't listen to the people who give it 1 star or less; this is definitely worth every cent you pay for it. The graphics are awesome, and it is easy to learn. However, in the game, it is pretty much impossible to return a punt. That may mean I'm doing something wrong, or the game's just designed that way. Another point- I am a Patriots fan and am in the midlle of playing out their unimpressive 2005 season in \\"Franchise mode.\\" After steamrolling the Saints 84-0, I noticed that Tedy Bruschi was playing for them. What the heck is he doing on their roster? Oh well. The actual game more than makes up for that. 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"This is a great game.

It is going on week 6 of the NFL season, and a roster update has yet to be released, and moderators of EA forums have said that Tiburon expects it to be \\"a few more weeks\\" until any patch or roster update is released. There are starters on teams that didn't even make it to the pre-season. Don't ever expect to return a punt, as it is almost impossible due to buggy AI. If you MUST buy this game, buy a console to play it on. They've had patches and two roster updates so far.Visit the player forums at EA for these issues and more. When EA bought the exclusive rights to the NFL trademarks, and the NFLPA rights last year, they made sure that PC purchasers had nowhere to go but to consoles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worse with age","review":"For whatever reason, EA elected to strip out features this year. Most notably, you can no longer use custom play books with your franchise. For some reason, you can still make a custom playbook -- I did, spending several hours putting together plays -- but you can't actually use it, except in a practice match. This obviously takes away from the strategy element of the game. In fact, Madden has stripped out most of the strategy, focusing instead on the bells-and-whistles like creating fictional players and choosing their parents' DNA. The coaching aspect of the game is now non-existent... it's become an FPS for sports fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"krackle","review":"Beautiful Harvest faucet.

The title might conjure up dangerous psychotics on the loose. Or patients treated brutally by psychotic staff, gone berserk on neuroleptic drugs. Instead, the author simply finds the best in people in very difficult circumstances. He finds the humanity and decency in each of the lost souls who turn up on an LA city hospital ward. One of the most touching and haunting tales is that of the janitor on the ward.There is a need to take a highly critical look of psychiatric--especially psychopharmocologic--treatment, and I think we have such a book in Robert Whitaker's Mad in America (2002).

There is only one thing that keeps me from giving this album 5 stars. That is the fact that I have had the privilege of hearing their newest work. It is so phenomenal that everything they did before it now seems to pale when placed next to it. With that said, when I listen to this album now, I am more cognizant of little things that are more fully realized now that these guys have seasoned. Do yourself a favor and check out this album as well as Hot Feet and THEN let their newest album wash over you. It is one of those albums that one experiences rather than hears.

A great primer for those who would like to know what Jesus is reported to have said, the context in which he said it and what it meant at the time to his listeners. Topics include his styles of argument, epistemology, ethics, worldview and views on women. A cogent analysis. The author's premise is Jesus as an intellectual who reasoned with the best of them. After reading this little book, I agree Jesus warrants recognition in this way. Seeing the logic of Jesus' positions, it is much easier to understand why he has been so influential to so many intellectuals over the centuries"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST SEE","review":"Of all the books on Philosophy, Religion, Science, and their parts in the Big Picture, I have found this book by Steve Hagen the most helpful. Why? Because it puts into language I can understand--simple and to the point--the essence of Buddhism as exemplified in the story of the Eighty-Three Problems (qv) which is resolved by Gautama saying we all have all kinds of problems which he cannot help us with. But he can help us with the 84th problem: that we do not want problems in our lives. Everything depends on how you see things. That is the solution. Just see clearly. This book shows how. Not a slick and easy read, because it deals with the ultimate. But even at a first reading you can taste the truth in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the other sleep sacks, but hate this material","review":"I love the other sleep sacks, you can see my full review of them on their web pages. But this sack has different fabric which I really, really don't like. It isn't actually quilted. It is woven to look like it is. The material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off. It also catches on any hang nails or rough skin. When it is warm I use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold I use the fleece (polyester) ones. Great sacks, just annoying fabric with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, decent fit","review":"This T-shirt is sold as heavyweight, but the fabric is so thin, skin color shows through. The contrasting hems are smaller than the main body, so it looks somewhat bunched up around the arms and neck. Not sure if that will change after washing, because the T-shirt is supposed to be pre-shrunk. Most disappointing is the hemming on the neckband, as it's done with white thread on the back of the neck, and looks cheap and sloppy.Overall, a serviceable underlayer, but not heavy enough or well-made enough to wear on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting Company","review":"I personally own a few pieces of Anvil garments. All of them are bad quality and the colors faded after one wash!

I think it is not the same as what I was buying before, as in- this may be a knockoff. On top of this, twice now I have ordered the ultra rich formula and received the rich formula.

The 60 failed and destroyed my images in almost exactly the same way. If I could give negative stars for this piece of junk, I would. Avoid this at all cost. Trust me.Fool me once, shame on you.

They were priceless to me. I lost probably a hundred or so out of several hundered that I took. Buy something more expensive or just get more cards. There are other options. I would smash this unit to bits with a hammer if I didn't think I could return it. Bottom line: DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much Pang in this","review":"Contrary to the hype on the packaging, there isn't much Pang in these \\"Pang Brothers\\" discs. If you're expecting to get 3 hours of the same quality and frights as you would from a viewing of \\"The Eye\\", then move on.\\"The Omen\\" was written by a Pang, but directed and edited by someone completely different. \\"Bangkok Haunted\\" is a three-story anthology, only one of which is directed by Oxide Pang... which is good. But that's all the Pang this 2-movie \\"Pang Brothers\\" really only has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wang yu not all that bad in this one, but god, what a crappy movie","review":"I got this movie as a four pack for $2. I definitely wasn't dissapointed, while snake crane secret is the only one I like in this, screaming ninja isn't the worst movie ever. This is kinda like wang yu's rage of the master(which is in the four-paCK), meaning they both costed about $10,000 to make. They actually could have costed $10 and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. Overall Screaming tiger has a ton of non-realistic fights, but the final fight did nothing special. The fact they were fighting on a moving train was cool, but they should have done some really cool stunts. The final fight is just sloppy and you start to wonder if you are gonna make it through to the end. Hard movie to watch, but if you are a HUGE, MonSTROUS Wang Yu fan, I think you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Good","review":"It was hard to find a t'meter with this high of a range w/o going digital.

Not exactly what I expected, but I still like Jody Watleys older songs. Amazon delivered this one on time with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"what???????","review":"I just did not feel anything from this effort. I was wondering where is jodi coming from?

This lady is so talented. Sadly, she has not received the label support she deserves in recent years. I lost track of Jody after \\"Off The Hook\\" only to reconnect with her masterpiece \\"Midnight Lounge\\".(If you do not have it buy it now) After such a wonderful project I was abit nervous about this project. I should have known Jody knew exactly what she was doing. This is not a covers CD. This will show you some old favorites in totally new ways. The highlight would have to me The Carpenters Medley. WOW is all I can say. Actually, there are no low points on this album. I just discovered Jody's blog last week and she is everybit the class act that I always pictured. If you are still thinking this is just an 80s act please check out her new music.(I love 80s music but Jody is so much more) This is the work of a true artist that continues to grow. I can't wait to see where she takes us next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a thrill after all these years","review":"It's not easy to defy the Grammy-Best-Newcomer curse. And Watley has certainly paid for it - her best work have been cruelly ignored just as she matured into a true artist. One can only hope that the early buzz of this release will not slip through the faultly cracks of the fickle media fortress. Don't You Want Me remains a gem after all these years. Her reading of Waiting In Vain and Love Hangover is nothing short of outstanding. The new cuts also prove to be more than engaging. Definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty & the Beat","review":"With each release of every album, I always say that Jody cannot top the last and just like the last time I have to retract the statement. Jody is an artist that has establishes her career with music she has written. This time she takes a delightful perspective on 4 previously tunes (as well as 2 of her own) and place a new spin on a couple of them. The result is \\"The Makeover\\". The album is like nothing on the radio now...and that is a good thing! The disc contains unsullied organic tunes with infectious beats, sonic grooves as well as sensual, meaningful ballads. A beautiful life she had to be on her 9th album and has yet to repeat or run into a creative brick wall!

Best tracks are: Waiting in Vain, A Beautiful Life, A bed of Roses, I want your Love, Love Hangover, Boderline, Close to you, honestly, the only two songs I don't like are her older songs Friendz and Don't you Want me. Dead horses!, she needs to give up remaking these songs over and over again, this is my only complaint, truly the best of the best are the songs she wrote for this CD. The voice is still excellent, it is a shame that she does not get more attention these days. We love you Jody and please keep releasing excellent material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Jody Watley music for 2006! So hip and hot!","review":"I have loved Jody Watley for almost 20 years. She is stylish, she is soulful, and she is an incredible singer. She has evolved with music styles and has come up with the hippest album of her career. A collection of \\"makeovers,\\" re-worked Jody songs, and a few new gems, the new disc shows off Jody's still-stellar instrument in all of it's creamy, soulful glory. Both soft and husky, crystalline and earthy, Jody's voice cuts right to the heart. The production is flawless--this is an album for the dance floor, the dinner party, and the bedroom. Favorites include new song \\"Bed of Roses,\\" a remake of the Chic classic \\"I Want Your Love,\\" Jody's re-do of her own \\"Midnight Lounge,\\" and the phenomenally beautiful \\"Borderline,\\" which I just heard on LOGO's \\"Noah's Arc.\\" I saw Jody sing at the Virgin Megastore last week, and girls and boys, does she look phenomenal!! 2006 is Jody's year. Long live the hottest diva in music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find!!","review":"This is a really great CD from a very talented artist. The music is pop, but with funky bluesy grooves and a rock and roll edge. Even though he was the guitarist from Hanson, his music is very much his own. I like the covers he does of Imagine and Little Wing, but it is his own songs (and voice) that make this CD really worth it. \\"Walk On By\\" rocks, and \\"Sunflower in the Shade\\" is fun to party and dance to. Also, his ballads like \\"Shadow\\" are beautiful. The whole CD has a nice variety of music performed by Ravi and his top notch band, and it really gives you the feeling that you are listening to a very complete musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Not a bad book, but there are many better, more comprehensive books on the subject.

This not only has a ton of useful information for writers of all levels, it is also beautifully structured and presented.

Good reference book, but becoming a bit outdated. It still ranks as a classic on the art of writing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Writing","review":"I have read at least a dozen books on writing, and Stein on Writing stands out as easily the best of the bunch. It's not like any of the other books were bad--some in fact were very good--it's just that Stein's book is on its own level as a guide to the art of professional writing. Teeming with helpful tips, craft techniques, and pertinent examples, this classic text is 300 pages of non-stop, filler-free insights, solutions, and general information.I have to laugh at the idiots who dismiss Stein because of his \\"know-it-all arrogance.\\" As the spiritual master Adi Da pithily put it, \\"Humility is a small penis.\\" What matters to me is the knowledge a teacher can provide, not his ability to mask his ego. And speaking of ego, the second-best books on writing I've encountered are Ayn Rand's The Art of Fiction and The Art of Nonfiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Great as The Hype","review":"I think the advice is basically sound. But it is not new or different from anyone else's advice. He has a tendency to beat a subject to death, taking 40 pages to make a statement that could easily be communicated in a single paragraph. He may know a lot about writing but his style is tedious, redundant and awkward. The examples are good except the examples from his own work seem to be the worst. I say he should stick to editing and forget about writing about writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource and entertaining","review":"This book was recommended to me by published authors and professors and it has lived up to their praise. Stein respects his reader's intelligence in a lively and engaging discussion of the keys to writing creative, marketable books. The chapters are neatly structured and the writing is tight, as one would expect from this type of book, and the book is very enjoyable to read - not the usual experience of a how-to-guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every writer should read this book","review":"I have always considered myself a good writer, but like most first-time authors, have found it difficult to draw the attention of the publishing world.

If you want to get published, buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must for the aspirant writer","review":"A well organized how-to for even the experienced writer.

This book is the one I keep beside me while editing and writing. Its pages are worn. Its jacket is torn. While I devour books about writing, Stein's book brings the often abstract concepts surrounding writing a good book down to earth. An essential book for both published authors and those who want to join the ranks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuggets of Writing Wisdom","review":"I combed through just about every book on writing, searching for writing truths, myths, and the publishing industry. When I came to this book, it spoke to me like no other book has; I could not put it down. Sol Stein has expertly written a book that is not only informative, but superbly entertaining. He engages the reader by writing a nonfiction book in a storytelling manner.From the first page, he shares many secrets of the writing trade, using his own experiences as well as other writers' works. I particularly like the examples he gave, and the theatrical angle. For example, he includes Elia Kazan's theatrical presence and advice, and thus enriches the story and the reader's imagination.As an author searching to perfect my craft, I have already begun incorporating some of his sage advice on writing. I hope he keeps writing more books on this topic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better, much better!","review":"I was really hoping this book would be THE E2K BOOK!

The speakers were really easy to set up - it took me 2 min. from the point of getting the box open to playing music off my mp3 player ( I have the Dell pocket DJ). The Zip Connect is a brilliant feature. I got the speakers to listen to music at work. There was plenty of volume, even when I cranked it up after hours. I was annoyed that I could not control the base or the tremble. There certainly was not enough base to the speakers. This item is way overpriced at $150. I think you can do a lot better for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting to know.","review":"The Butterworth is a somewhat disjointed symphony, and not played particularly well on this disc, but repeated listening will reveal more to enjoy. The Gipps, on the other hand, is a delightful work with immediate appeal, full of catchy tunes, and expresses subdued joy after a major distaster, in this instance WW2. The playing here is more assured. A disc worth acquiring then, for those interested in neglected, conservative, middle 20th ceentury British music. though neither of these symphonies approach the epic proportions found in the symphony of E.J. Moeran, for example, or any of the symphonies of Arnold Bax, to name just two other relatively neglected composers of an earlier and similar period.

This just like the first plug and play Ms Pacman (which I also bought) and has a joy stick issue. If the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating. While playing Ms Pacman which is the ONLY reason I bought these plug and plays Ms Pacman has a mind of her own, turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own. It's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you're out of control. It's extremely frustrating.

The third thing wrong was that the sound is so faint on this, that i had to turn the TV on full blast to hear the tiniest sound.

It is difficult to care about characters that sound identical to each other, with no redeeming qualities or unique identities of their own. At times DeLillo presents wonderful images and prose, but the bulk of this book features rambling prose and pointless dialogue. One wonders if DeLillo is writing to the public or for himself.Without question, I will continue to read DeLillo. He has much to say and one of the best writers we have, but readers new to DeLillo would do well to read \\"Underworld\\" and \\"White Noise\\" and avoid \\"Mao II.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I like Don DeLillo. \\"White Noise\\" is among my favorite books of the 1980s. But he really drops the ball here. This book reads like an unrevised first draft. The diamond-hard sentences of \\"White Noise\\" have now given way to flaccid stream-of-consciousness mumbling. The plot is similarly unfocused; I kept expecting all these threads to tie together more neatly, but they never do. And the flimsy scenario DeLillo has contrived here can hardly support all these grandiose meditations on contemporary society, which seem forced into the texture of the novel. One soon tires of lengthy scenes in which the characters dilate endlessly upon the social importance of the evening news, while saying things like \\"I have my own cosmology of pain.\\" Give DeLillo credit: he has important things to say. The problem is that he's said everything here more memorably in previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrical but hollow","review":"Mao II has some wonderful descriptive scenes - for example, the mass wedding with which it opens. But the book lacks three dimensional, human characters, and in the end DeLillo's snazzy writing and imagery fall flat. I read it in stops and starts, because it just didn't compel me. However, I bought Underworld recently, and I'm going to give DeLillo a second try."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one actually thinks and talks like these characters","review":"It took some doing to get through this novel. The main question that kept hitting me as I carefully read this book was: What kind of people actually think and speak in the kind of overdone, conflagration of semi-metaphysical adjectives that Delillo puts into his character's minds and mouths? The different threads of the story do not come together in the end, so there's a great sense of randomness in this novel. Further, Delillo repeats ideas, I assume, in order to make his point; but I felt a bit belittled intellectually by this. For example, in his brief section about how the crowds are going crazy trying to keep Khomeini's body out of the grave, Delillo keeps telling us over and over again what the purpose is for these people acting the way they do. It just seems like Delillo was trying too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort after the brilliance of \\"Libra\\"","review":"I looked forward to reading this book after reading Libra, but I found it too pushy in it's imagery. It seemed DeLillo felt he had to dazzle the reader with his ability to string metaphors together, but all he really did was to create an empty string of random thoughts that never really come together as a cohesive picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"DeLillo takes advantage of his brilliant style of writing by with explaining a numerous of faults in our society and others, while still expressing his personal views on writers and other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in focus and clarity","review":"I really enjoyed \\"White Noise.\\" I found the characters and the story interesting. \\"Mao II\\" falls way short of the level of \\"White Noise.\\" The story seems to lack focus.

This reader ultimately had very little concern for the characters or curiousity over the eventual outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent","review":"I was impressed by the writer's skill in creating beautiful prose. However, I did not get anything else out of the book. Forgettable characters, thin plot, endless descriptions, and ultimately dull.

Please correct me if my subjective opinion isn't \\"qualified\\".This is easily the most boring book I've read in my life. I've read an A+ certification textbook that had more character than all the people combined in this \\"story\\". All the characters speak with the same voice and have the same drab view of life. The theme of the book, which constantly describes the contrast between crowds and individual writers never leads anywhere. It's just mentioned over and over in the same boring dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it","review":"The first hundred or so pages of the novel are fairly interesting and easy to get through but from there the book seams to go nowhere. I had a very hard time trying to get through the rest of the novel as it meanders towards its anticlimactic ending. Yes there is some beautiful writing and keen social observations but all and all it was quite dull. It was disappointed after reading the previous reviews and hearing good things about this book I found myself trying to like but it was just too slow paced for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for your life","review":"DeLillo has ripped off Andy Warhol. This book is the perfect example of how many writers today lack imagination and originality. DeLillo steals Warhol's ideas to add interest and depth to his drab and boring story.

It is what it is. I personally found it well built, heavy, and most importantly, it cranked out some awesome pasta. I had never used one before (nor made pasta), and the first time I tried it I had one of those \\"Wow, I made that????\\" moments. It came out great (use plenty of flour!), and I look forward to many more uses. I've only used it 3X, so I can't speak to it's durability, but it appears to be well built and designed well.The spaghetti was incredible, and not sure I can eat dried again. Not to mention how much cheaper it is. I'm looking for other attachments now. Glad I didn't spend the $100+ for the pasta attachment for my Kitchenaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roma Pasta Machine","review":"I bought this for my brother and his fiance. After looking at some that cost $150-$200, I decided to ask one of my Italian friends for advice. He told me that he uses one like this; I was sold! My brother and his fiance have used it a couple of times so far and like it. It was delivered within the expected time frame and was in great shape when it arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, it's a pasta machine","review":"This works exactly like it is supposed to work. It is a pasta machine. So, you insert a chunk of dough, turn the crank, and out comes a thinner piece of pasta. I've used this twice now, both times to make ravioli in partner with a separately purchased ravioli press and once I fed the leftover dough from the ravioli through the fettuccine cutter just for fun. All the items have boiled up just fine and I've gotten rave reviews. These are the first times I have attempted to make pasta, so any of the problems I've had with the finished product have been more on my inexperience that anything. As far as the pasta machine goes, the crank does come out occasionally and the clamp has fallen on the floor a few times. Watch your feet. For the price, though, these are not big problems and this thing is basically perfect for my extremely infrequent pasta making needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good product","review":"WHEN I DECIDED TO BUY A PASTA MACHINE, I READ OTHER REVIEWS FROM CUSTOMERS, THIS PRODUCT SEEMEDTO BE THE ONE I NEEDED TO TRY, I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED, IT WORKS WONDERFULLY, SO GLAD I CHOSETHIS PASTA MAKER.

Not as fun a gift as I would have chosen for her myself, but she asked for it, and so here we are. So far, this little unit has exceeded expectations, which were lowered by some of the other reviews here. I realized during setup that a user would really have to herp out in order to strip this unit's gears. Basically, I would not attempt to make poi pasta with this unit, nor feed it fist-sized lumps of glutenous dough. Otherwise, it seems to do its job, and makes mothers happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight forward and easy to use","review":"Ths pasta machine is very straight forward and easy to use. I did spend the extra time to clean it thoroughly as directed before I made my first 'batch' of fettucini. I had no problems at all.

Big Mistake, after using this the first time I returned it. First off while using this black oil got on the pasta, which I would have over looked on the first use if it wasn't the other problems. Even with clap fully installed on my counter top that hangs over I could not keep this machine from flying up while I was rolling the pasta. Next on the thickest setting the gears gave out. So three strikes and I boxed it back up and returned to Amazon. Next one I buy will be a more pricey model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snapped on fifth use","review":"What a shame. We are avid foodies and love to make pasta. We treated our machine with respect and truly enjoyed using it. As we were rolling a modest amount of egg dough (from the recipe in the manual) the thickness gage snapped off in my hands. We have had the machine less than six months and sincerely regret not buying the Atlas pasta machine for twice the price and probably ten times the reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Engineering Mistake","review":"The engineers who designed this product really messed up. They situated the shallow C-clamp on the same side as the roller crank which makes the opposite end flap up off the board or table every time you turn the crank. You need to use both hands in the rolling process. Unless you have a helper, the flapping must be tolerated. It's irritating and severe enough to loosen the clamp. That was rather dingy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality product","review":"It broke at my third use. the quality is poor and don't recommend it.

Bottom line, this looks good on the outside but look under the cover and you will find that it is no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made, poorly designed piece of junk","review":"First problem, the C-clamp was too small to clamp on to any counter in my house (by about 1/4 of an inch). Looking at how the c-clamp was designed to attach to the machine looks very flaky and unreliable anyway. So I used one of my own c-clamps.Next problem, the gear jammed almost immediately on the first use. I took the device apart and found two gear teeth bent together forming a single gear tooth, lots of scoring all around the gears and metal filing everywhere. I'm pretty sure it was broken out of the box, and just became more unusable as it went along. The gear design has very loose, wide gaps between the teeth, definitely not a precision machine design. I would guess even if this was working out of the box, it wouldn't last very long.Also, the handle falls out very easily, and the upward part of the rotation tends to slide the pasta cutter out of it's mount.Save your money, don't buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"I am thrilled with my new pasta maker.

Also, the crank constantly falls out. no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, dependable and wish I had other attachments","review":"This product is quite nice. I used it as directed and made fettucine with absolute success. It would be lovely to have semolina flour but in my town no one carries it (and I am NOT ordering that via the Internet - freight is higher than the flour!). So, I used all-purpose (AP) flour. It workes lovely. Used the egg as well. I was sort of \\"Mr. Fumble Fingers\\" but it got easier as time went by. Hardest part was catching the cut fettucine.If you are pondering buying this Italian made unit, go ahead. It is great value for the money. You should not regret the purchase. Makes lovely fettucine.

I know how to make pasta and use a pasta machine, if wimpy arms like mine can strip the gears, so can you. In good faith I called Pragotrade/ Weston to see if I could order new a gear but they will not sell them separately (I like fixing things instead of throwing them out).Lesson: save the receipt or buy a more reputable brand, these are cheaply constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good for the home chef","review":"This machine works well. The price is GREAT (compared to the Atlas). Most important thing to remember, no matter what machine you are using, the dough must not be sticky.

I bought this one after I forgot the old one when I moved cross country. This one arrived and I made some pasta with it right away. You can tell its a bit cheap. Heaviness does not equal quality! It worked well the first time. Today I went to use it, rolled out my first sheet of pasta and it started to stick. After it stuck some of it got lodged under one of the small knives that scrapes the rollers. This small piece then bent this little knife which then just snowballed and bent it more when I rolled the pasta out. I managed to get the little metal knife out to try and bend it back, no go, it looks like unless it's perfectly straight it will just get more and more dough caught in it. Let me finish by saying I am a professional chef, I have used so many other machines and this one is by far the cheapest!

This move just sucks. It starts like the first 10 minutes of the movie are missing. Who are these people and what is the relationship? Never really addressed. Hardly any humor in this. Too little Christmas references. Did they forget this was a Christmas theme? It does get a little better in the second half, but the end disappoints too. In summary: storyline horrible, dialog bad, acting fair, cinematography fair. Don't waste your money on this.

I know they are not usually the highest of quality but this is the worst. The story line has nothing to it and the main characters are horrible.

In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.

What a great CD. Beautiful recording featuring wonderful vocals, in English and Spanish! I found Meciendo to be poignant and the guitar work on St. Augustine is of the highest performance artistry.Ms. Del Rey's original adaptations are refreshing and her Spanish is true International that reaches across provincial, regional accents and pronounciations. The original arrangments are very creative and far exceed the quality and interest I've heard in so-called \\"authentic\\" recordings.Our little boy goes to sleep often with this CD and we can listen to it over and over without 'parent' fatigue. Also, it's great to hear a man's voice on a nurturing CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misinterepretation of beloved Latin classics","review":"There is no doubt the artist's voice is beautiful. However, the interpretation of certain songs by a man and child are way off. For example, \\"Tengo Una Muneca\\" is NOT a lullaby, but an upbeat children's song and to have a child drone it out debases such a Mexican classic. One of many aweful and inacurate musical interpretations on this misguided CD. For the best and most classic Spanish children's songs turn to the tender and playful \\"Cri-Cri.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Armenian Genocide DVD","review":"The DVD came in plenty of time for me to review it before my documentary dinner group.

Some of it is topical, of its time and now seems irrelevant, but it is more interesting to see what persists as truth. Worth the quick read, especially if you are a Feynman fan. The third talk is particularly interesting, as Feynman gets out of his core expertise and wonders about the basics of life, politics, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feynman at his best as teacher, scientist, citizen.","review":"This is Richard Feynman for the concerned layman. These three lectures, given in 1963, are Feynman's attempt to elucidate the proper role of science in the issues of the day. The first lecture discusses the value of skepticism and uncertainty in the field of science itself. The second lecture concerns what light the scientific method might shine on religious and political thought. The third, and most interesting, lecture is an extemporaneous talk on the 'unscientific age' of the 1960s. You may be surprised to discover how little things have changed since then. If you are a Feynman fan, or if you are concerned about the proper role of science and critical thinking in society, you will love this book. Well-written, non-technical, entertaining. A brilliant scientist displays a deep and abiding concern for social issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"He thinks this way too","review":"I was so comforted by Feynman's genuine and open discussion on some major life issues -- science, religion, and politics. We all ask the same questions and yet, most of time, we withdrew from the process of obtaining the answers or getting closer to the final answers. His reflections encouraged me to discover more because there seems to be a \\"harmony\\" somewhere down the road for those three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I love Richard Feynman. He is one of the most amazing people who ever existed. With that said I can say that you should not waste your money on this book. The really cool quotes from these lectures were already used in \\"Genius\\" by James Gleick and if you really are into Feynman I suggest reading that book. It is so much more useful than this one which I read in one night and walked away feeling robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below his other books and overrated by its title","review":"The book lacks the charm and tidiness of his other better thought out books. The publisher gave it a title to sell the book- the book does not deliver the \\"meaning of it all\\". Needs editing and shortening and retitling by Feynman himself.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland essays which at times border on blabbering.","review":"Feynman should stick to physics, a subject about which he actually knew a thing or two. It's clear from reading the book that Feynman did not give much thought to subjects outside of physics. Given the amount of flattering reviews of this book, I am once again reminded of the fact that people (Americans in particular) are inveterate hero worshippers. For some, everything Feynman touched is gold. I am dismayed to find that Feynman's understanding of non-physics was no deeper than that of an average college kid, yet in the book he rambles on and on without making much of a point on anything. A complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feynmaniacs should read this review","review":"David Goodstein reviewed this book in \\"Feynmaniacs Should Read this Review, Skip Lecture Collection, Save 22 Simoleons\\" in the American Scientist, where he says it all. Not even Feynman himself wanted his John Danz Lectures to be published; they were published only after his death and against his will. As Dr. Goodstein put it, there is clearly a \\"take the money and run\\" attitude from Addison-Wesley in publishing this book. The lectures were inaptly edited, do not capture the flavor of the live lectures (however terse they might have been), and are badly dated. Save your simoleons.The mentioned review by D. Goostein is available on the internet -- just type its title in your favorite search engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of doubt","review":"I picked up this book expecting it to give me interesting insights into the thoughts of Feynman in fields other than physics. The subtitle, \\"Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist,\\" is enough to make one expect greatness from this series of lectures. In the end, there just wasn't any substantial substance in this book; nothing to make one think and wonder about the place of a \\"Citizen Scientist\\" in our society. And worst of all, nothing to really indicate where Feynman thought his place in society was, as a Citizen Scientist."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential guide for the antiquers reference library!","review":"This is an absolute sensational book!

When a murder occurs in the small town, Henry is suffering from an allergic reaction and is unable to work so Trudy takes over the investigation. There are the usual red herrings and multiple suspects, but Trudy perserveres and eventually comes up with a suspect.

It said it was a short movie but for some reason it actually did last way longer than it said on the DVD or online.I had to take it back that very night because I didn't even want to see the stupid dogs face in my house anymore.There are just no words to describe how horrible it is.

Forget making this on a PC or Mac, I think I could make something with better CGI on my iphone in less than a day.There are some movies that are so bad, they are awesome to watch and you can have fun with it. Like some Bravo show or something. Well this is NOT that. Both my wife and I were just angry from watching this. Nothing in my life ever made me hate my kids as much as this movie.

Dialogue and plot (lack of?) makes NO sense. Nonsensical. And just weird. Not to mention the terrible lessons it's teaching. Hmm... Bully the cat and pull it's tail.

But it was an inspirational place, a quiet and beautiful place, and it was unforgettable. And I saw Sting at a concert in 2000 and was fascinated by his live performance; he has perfect pitch. And so this DVD is the perfect marriage of a place I remember well and a musician whose work I respect enormously. Sting is not afraid to explore the roots of our musical heritage and CD's/DVD's such as this are splendid in their introduction of those roots to a generation that might not otherwise have the opportunity to hear them. I am making a point of giving either this DVD or just the CD to friends this Christmas because they are so worthy of being heard. And as much as I dislike winter, I'm rethinking its purpose, thanks to some thoughtful words by Sting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Sting","review":"My wife loves Sting. Bought this for a gifts.

It's not too big, and for traveling you don't need to carry around the USB cable - it has its own short USB connector to plug into a laptop. It plugged into my Windows XP system with no trouble and simply appeared as four removable drives. The speed is excellent, much faster than the USB 1.1 device I had tried earlier. Though it's more expensive than some of the other 6-in-1 memory card readers, I think it's worth it.Note that an insert in the manual warns of a problem writing MMC cards, and suggests checking the web site for driver updates. I haven't done this yet, as I don't have any MMC cards, so I can't vouch for whether or not there is a fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads fine but DON'T format","review":"yes this is a handy little card reader but don't even think about formating your flash media in this device.

However, they completely and totally over reacted and simply became pridefull (isn't pride a sin?) gratifiers of their own egos.All protestants are \\"crypto-paptist.\\" Any protestant that disagrees is rejecting the fact of the truth that \\"the Reformation did not put an end to the medievil papacy or its pretensions, it merely democratized it and made everyone Pope.\\" Saying the Pope is the anti-christ is like saying Ronald Wilson Reagan was the 666.

So I am perhaps not the most judicious critic.But this latest installment is very well done, I think. Don't want to give the plot away, so I'll just say that the combination of professional problems and personal issues are well defined and work together to make a fascinating story.My only criticism (which is not new) is that Roarke seems too perfect, almost a cardboard cut-out of a hero. And Dallas seems to always be apologizing to him for who she is, while he goes along merrily interferring in her cases and buying everything in sight.I'd highly recommend this book to all J.D. Robb fans. To those who are new to the series, this is a good book, but to really enjoy it, you should start reading at the beginning of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Eve Dallas book","review":"I'm an Eve Dallas fan.

The pace was fast and the content of the action from Eve's work to her personal life was full on. I couldn't put it down, and have to say that these books do just get better & better. Rourke really surprised the heck out of me, I knew how he could be, but wow, his actions and reactions blew my mind. I don't know how Nora Roberts comes up with this stuff but I hope she keeps it up. My only complaint was that there was no excerpt, title or release date of the next book. I have to say I think that really stinks. By the comments of the others I think that they would agree with me, as the excerpt at least gives us something to look forward to as we know we have to wait for ages for the next one.

It is just hands down one of my favorites in the \\"In Death\\" series, along with \\"Naked in Death.\\" I think it is not the murder mystery that grabs me here, it's Roarke and his relationship with Eve. It is just so multi-layered and sizzzzzlin' HOT! This book just makes it clear that these two were meant to be together and why they are totally the heart of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book from a Series!","review":"JD Robb, or in her other incarnation Nora Roberts is a great writer. These books are a futuristic series, Eve Dallas and Roarke are an odd couple, both stong and alpha but able to bend and blend into a couple.These are great books and stand alone or as a series, I have them all so far, and look forward to the next in the series. I have just re-read the whole lot and find them as good the second and third time around as the first.I like the growth exhibited by the characters, all of them including the secondary ones, Peabody and McNab, and the dilemas and daring do the whole book has from the first page just keep you on the edge of the chair. Its not one you want to read alone if you are the least bit a fraidy cat! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up","review":"I loved it. Fast reading and, as usual, over too soon.

I read two or three others and loved every word.This is really vivid writing, a great story line, a great romance angle, exciting and unremittingly entertaining.A must read if you haven't enjoyed a J.D.

Robb series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming perilously close to only 3 stars.","review":"While I distictly enjoyed this book and it's characters, I am starting to feel that J.D. Robb is settling for formulae instead of originality. I found that ending of too similar to the previous \\"Witness in Death\\" and that it was too easy for me to figure out who the murderer was. Also, I belive that Roarke departed from his usual characterization at least once in this novel. I sincerely hope that the next book will go back to \\"outstanding\\" instead of merely \\"a good read\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"For R and E fans","review":"There is not much chemistry btwn them any characters in the book. The mystery was quite predictable. Of course, Roarke would be connected to the case again. Hello! He DOES own 28% of the planet! Well, I find the book is saved by the new depth to Roarke's character and the new layer of Roarke's and Eve's relationship. That things are not unrealistically happily ever after, this gives the series a high degree of vasimilitude. And it is nice to see R show a bit of jealousy... I find that this book does approach Roarke's and Eve's relationship in another light which is interesting and intriguing to me. I have always liked R and E, so if you are like me, read it. However, if you are for a good mystery, brain straining type, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"not more","review":"i am very angry at j.d. robb for this book. not only did she leave out one of the only decent characters - the sleek, slick, sexy charles monroe - but she also developed roarke's already over the top arrogant character into a thug. how can he beat up his wife's ex-lover and friend for...dun dun dah! touching her arms! and then to have webster to apologise. his posessiveness is disgusting and he comes across as a chauvinstic pig. i wouldn't want him for a husband no matter how impossibly attractive he is - also stupid. nobody can be as perfect as j.d. robb makes him out to be and that is why i feel these books are becoming more and more shallow and 2-d."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I have read worse novels than this one, but it was baaaad just the same. I guess going by the reviews I am ne of the few people who didnt like this one and I really don't understand what's there to like in this one.I didn't even know that J.D Robb was Nora Roberts! Thank God I got this book from the library and didn't buy it!The main characters were irritating to their core, or maybe I found them irritating because I haven't red the previous 10 or so books written before this one(and now I will not read them)I just finished this absurd piece of tale because I hate to give back any bok unread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story line","review":"I like that she had Eve and Roarke have a fight.

Robb's books and this is one of my favorites for the In Death Series. If you haven't read any of them I would suggest you start at the beggining (Naked in Death) and make your way from there. I'm sure you won't be able to get enough. All the books are absolutely amazing and you just fall in love with Eve and Roarke and everything they go through together."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER WINNER!!","review":"This whole \\"In Death\\" series by Robb was terrific, I bought the whole 12 books (including the \\"In Death\\" story in the \\"Silent Night\\" anthology) from good old Amazon and read the books one after the other from the first book to the last one. I got to \\"Holiday in Death\\" at Christmas time, I sure was looking at Santa in a different way! Needless to say, I am sorry to see the series end.

I guess that is the essence of a rocking swing band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound","review":"I bought this item because it looked like fun, but the sound is awful - very little bass, muddy highs, very boxy sounding. As my wife very aptly put it, \\"it sounds worse than my laptop\\". We have a Bose SoundDock as well, and if its sound quality is a 10, this one is barely a 1. We've heard some pretty awful-sounding audio gear designed by Sharper Image, but we were fooled by the marketing hype they have about their new aluminum cone speakers. These speakers do little to overcome Sharper Image's lack of audio engineering prowess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster!","review":"This product was horrible! The first day I got it, it sounded different, but I didn't think much about it. After a few weeks,the volume would not go louder than the voice of someone whispering to me.

I highly DO NOT recommend this product for anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Design But...","review":"I have been using it for about a month and was very happy with the sound and the compact design. Unfortunately, yesterday it started giving me problems by cutting in and out.

Apparently, the \\"Michael\\" amazon had in mind was a \\"Michael Danna.\\" Where the rest of the cast list came from is a mystery.If you're a Bruce Li fan, you probably already are familiar with this title.

Not mainly I like their albums, but they are a very good live-act. They can put on a no-nonsense show, where one knows what to expect. Great rock songs and brilliant ballads.I do have to admit, not all their songs are equally good, but when you listen to songs like \\"Stil in mij\\" you can really feel some depserate feel to it. Or \\"Dromendief\\" about - I believe - a very difficult relationship...The guys know how to write a decent song and they also know how to do it live; as you can tell by the second disc, which contains some live tracks!

Published in Italy in 1957, it was very successful at the time, and has since become a classic, taught in schools and widely read.Arturo's initiation to the tragedies and mediocrities of adulthood is contained within the geographical space of a beautiful Southern island, Procida, where he is born and raised. His wayward (in more than one meaning) father appears and disappears from the son's world. Each time he returns to Procida, he brings back from the continent fables, news of the 'real world', and, in one instance, a new wife (Arturo's mother died giving birth to him). \\"Arturo's island\\" is a cruel, yet spell-binding, fable on the enchantment of childhood and on the moment in which our life tips into adulthood. By the time you get to the end of the book, you'll wish you could go back to the beginning and start Arturo's - and your own- life all over again. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its about time!","review":"With so much of the music in the media being so similar....its so fresh to hear this young lady sing this material.

Generally this book is not much more revealing than numerous articles available on the persons concerned. Also stories on specialist dealmakers, like Forstmann, are intermingled with stories on corporate dealmakers, like McColl. Corporate M&As is a rather different subject from LBO maneuvering, in my view, and shouldn't have been combined in one book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I must admit to being utterly disappointed with this book. So much so, that I skipped most of it and ultimately decided it to be a waste of time. Spelling errors, repetitive language and uninteresting commentary seem to be a consistent theme in this book. I would neither recommend its purchase, nor borrowing it from a friend.

The author is a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and, as such, spends chapter after chapter trying to exonerate Israeli foreign policy which has often been condemned by several UN Security Council resolutions.However, this book is a useful guide to showing you how politicians create a 'camouflage of confusion' and how the many UN splinter organisations have consistently aided genocide in Africa by handing out free guns.Not really essential reading - and has no information at all about the founding of the UN, the Meditation Temple in the basement and the UN's links to the Alice Bailey Lucis (Lucifer Publishing) organisation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's With Revisionism These Days","review":"Someone should ask the author how much more successful the UN would be in it's role if the US and Israel weren't always vetoing it's resolutions to act. If the single most powerful nation on earth and it's little buddy completely ignore the UN, veto it's every attempt to act, and directly undermine it's authority in the world for 50 years, who's fault is it that the UN is unsuccessful?I firmly believe the US has a moral and ethical obligation to lead the world, and I firmly believe we can do it morally and ethically. However, writing history in such a way that the sins of the US and Israel aren't there won't make that happen.

Worst mistake I ever made, because I can't find the same one in any store here. I LOVED that it didn't make an obnoxious \\"DING\\" sound when toast was done. I LOVED that the toast was a push button and not a dial type.

Yesterday, the top timer knob fell off while I was heating something in the oven. Upon inspecting the plastic knob, the back part that pushes on to the metal shaft of the timer switch was partially melted and broken. I touched the metal shaft that holds the knob and it was extremely hot. Over time, I assume this heat made the plastic knob brittle and weak. These components should be adequately shielded from the heat to prevent this from happening. Besides this obvious design flaw, the oven has worked fine up to this point. One other thing - there is no bell sound when the toaster switch pops up, so you have to be standing very near by to know that your toast is done.Jan. 31, 2009 UPDATE: I just wanted to add that the top burner/element on this oven only works sporadically. Usually it doesn't, leaving the top of whatever your cooking under-cooked. I'll probably never buy another Black & Decker product.

I hope there will be another one by this talented artist very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"From the editorial reviews, I expected to love this book. As a total book lover, I found Sixpence House to be depressing. The authors attitute towards books in general, as well as his own, are a downer and the descriptions of Hay and it's surrounds were totally uninspiring. I found completing the book a chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull memoir","review":"I hoped to love this book, because I love books in general. While Collins has a nice writing style, the story line just never clicked with me. American man goes to the UK, wanders around in a town of bookstores, looking for a house which he never buys, then returns home. I read the bookstore parts, which were alright, but only skimmed the final half. I was just bored. Even the most interesting character (bookseller Booth), wasn't really that interesting. No 84 Charing Cross Road here, sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Light Reading","review":"There is enough material in this book - nice set pieces, and some interesting and humorous quotes - for a great magazine article. But after a while I got bored by its two themes: 1) the cuteness of the baby, the town, and the author; and 2) fodder for trivial pursuits. There is not enough substance here for a whole book, and the prose, vague, and a little trendy, does not compensate. A potboiler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I was very disappointed with this \\"memoir.\\" The author can't tell the reader often enough how very smart and cool he is compared to every other illiterate back in America. You can be quite sure that plays well overseas with all the \\"playwrights on the dole.\\" I guess I'm just not cool enough to snidely agree with his alarmingly shallow view of the wonderful and diverse population we have in all corners of this wildly beautiful place. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a lot more than sixpence","review":"Paul Collins takes us with him as he relocates his family from San Francisco to the Welsh town of Hay-on-Wye, the little burg known for a bazillion used book stores. When he buys a 500-year-old house, he of course suspected he might encounter a problem or two, buy yikes! He faces problems, however, not just with his home but also with his editors, his publishers, family adjustments to village mentality, etc. but the whole is more than the sum of its parts in Collins' book. It can be read and enjoyed as memoir, travelogue, history, and adventure.Altogether, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Bryson meets Nicholson Baker","review":"Sixpence House is a wonderful, strange, unclassifiable classic. The basic story is a travelogue, from San Francisco to London to a medieval town on the Welsh border. But the pastoral scenery and odd locals are really just Collins' jumping-off point, into the mysterious hidden worlds within long-forgotten books. The result is the literary equivalent of the kind of dinner party guest everyone wants to sit next to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A special find","review":"This book is a pure delight. Yes, for all the reasons that many other reviewers have put forth, but also for this one: It shows that the true value of reading books is how it makes one observant, well-rounded and introspective. Paul peppers his story with asides and very funny digressions that highlight what one might ordinarily miss while tramping through life and that actually serve to connect things more than any straight forward story could. His sense of humor is self-effacing as much as it is directed at anyone or any culture so even when biting, it is never less than beguiling. Like Abe Lincoln, he cannot but see the ludicrous in life and distills his observations into quips and anecdotes that enlighten and entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad it wwas only $1 .99","review":"Yes, Collins is a good writer, but I grew tired of his bashing of the American Intellect. Yes his prose is good, but I will not finish the book and will delete it off my Kindle.

He needed a bag that would hold at least three suits without wrinkling them. According to the description, this bag would expand to accomodate the clothing.This bag could not possibly hold even one suit. There is no bracket for hangers, so whatever you're packing has to be folded, not hung up.If you need space, do not buy this bag.To add insult to injury, eBags charges $4.95 to return an incorrectly advertised item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a solid bag","review":"I was a bit nervous about buying the bag because of its price. It was less than 100 dollars which typically means it'll last about a month before coming apart at the seams. I went ahead with it anyway and after a month I can say its a great bag. I travel every week and it still looks like I took it out of the box. It fits perfectly into airplane overhead cabins and yet expands to fit everything I need. Its no tumi, but works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit smaller","review":"It's a bit smaller than my previous Delsey trolley carry-on suitcase.

The leather is good quality and sturdy.There's an outside pocked for quick access, and on the inside a window-pocket for an ID or driver's license. The other inside pocket is divided into two internal areas, handy for separating types of cards, and it expands to hold probably 20 cards at least, if needed (probably more!).But I like to carry around the minimum number of items in my wallet, and this one works perfectly, with room to spare.It's always great to find quality workmanship, and this wallet has it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Exactly as described by seller.

Expandable too for when my wife uses me as a human wallet for her cards and cash. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE","review":"This is a nice little wallet/card holder. It is just big enough for the amount of credit cards I carry and my license. It's just a little small to fit folded bills perfectly on the other side which causes the wallet not to fold in half exactly, but its good enough. Nice color, nice leather and nice size. Its my new wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and a good value","review":"This wallet does what it is supposed to do - it uses minimal space to hold credit cards and other cards needed. It forced me to get rid of unnecessary items that were overloading my old wallet. Hard to imagine that most of us need more space than this little wallet provides. It is a good value and thus far after one month of use it appears durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Workmanship, Great Price","review":"I'm really impressed with the wallets I received. They are quality leather and nicely crafted. I wanted something to hold my business cards, and although these are called wallets or credit card holders, they are perfect for my purpose. Each will hold 20-30 cards in the center pocket alone, and they are small enough so as not to be bulky or awkward. These will undoubtedly last a long time which makes them a great value at this low price. My compliments to Gem Avenue for providing an inexpensive convenient carrier that could easily sell for much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice quality","review":"Love the look and feel of it looks to be of very high quality, has four slots two of them are big for multiple cards.

Aimee Mann's opener is beuatiful, & closing the CD with a Bing Crosby/David Bowie classic is the perfect way to end it. This must be one of the few Christmas compilations that includes a real oldie (but goldie) by Bessie Smith.

Everybody is contamined except our hero: Ken Fairchild. Why? because he have a cold...I don't tell you the end because it's too creepy. And there's lot of directing errors like when a car, for no apparent reason, explode in the air not one, but two times. I tell you that you should see this movie once in your life.

There's nothing psychoanalytical here regardless of what another reviewer says. Instead you get great stories and clear, concise analyses. The questions the author tries to answer are difficult ones, and there's no one single interpretation that fits all.

It seems like a good resource for someone running for school board or a small town's council. However, if you're looking for pointers on running/managing a campaign, you may be better served by another book, perhaps Daniel Shea's \\"Campaign Craft.\\" The book also fails to address the increasingly important technological aspect of modern campaigning, recommending that you keep track of your supporters via index cards.

It is well-written, with a constant eye towards the philosophical side of the emerging discipline of \\"artificial life\\". Crucial to this discipline is the idea that \\"form\\"--a self-organized pattern in space--takes precedence over the material substrate of which it is made. As Emmeche emphasizes throughout his narrative, computer scientists have gained better results at modeling artificial life with the \\"bottom-up\\" approach (in contrast to \\"top-down\\" attempts to legislate global behavior of these systems). This is a good book for those who might want to study the amazing work of Chris Langton and Stuart Kaufmann. Those chapters in particular are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put the postmodern waffle on the side, please.","review":"Perhaps it's the translation, but the author comes off as overly dubious about the field he claims to want to introduce to us. The book might be useful to philosophers who want to pick fights with a-life enthusiasts, but it's very unsatisfying if you want to learn anything. Some philosophy of science books are much more than cursory glances at the science (Cartwright's How the Laws of Physics Lie or Mayo's Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge come to mind), but this isn't one of them. There are so many facinating paths that you can explore starting from the idea of a-life that Emmeches' attempts to fence-in the field come across as premature and pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best website in the world","review":"My son loves Amazone.com... \\"The best website in the world, because it has so many Dinosaurs DVD!\\" He says... :0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was so excited until we got to the second disc and it didn't work.

Its a Gauntlet rip-off. It put it in...played for about 5 mins, and knew it was a trade-in. Haven't played it since. This game is great if you need something to catch the dust on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to play, But alot better with multi player","review":"With out a doubt, this is a great x-box game. I know that a lot of people say it's \\"boring\\" or \\"to easy\\", And yea i agree it is a little easy, but why don't you just turn the difficulty on hard in the pause menu. I'm sure that will make it a little more challenging.Second, This is a very loooooonnnnnngggggg game. But when you think about it. Those are the games you like. i don't know about everybody else, but for me, as soon as you beat it, you don't feel like playing it anymore. This game for some reason i don't mind playing over. And when you play with four people you get almost three times the amount of gold out of chests than just one.Overall, i think this is going to be a classic game, especially to play with your friends, and i would recommend it to anybody who like these type of games."},{"rating":"2","title":"D&D back on the rise...on the Xbox!","review":"I really enjoyed playing D&D: Heroes. If you loved Baldur's Gate on the Xbox as much as I did, you will love this one as well. The gaming is simple and the story is right out of a D&D Module, so any die-hard AD&D or D&D fan should enjoy playing this game. I like the fact that the controls are really easy to learn and the gaming is quick. The battles are many and ongoing. I cannot wait until they go beyond the fighting and create a D&D game that involves puzzles to solve as well. I also recommend Baldur's Gate II (of course), and if you are a PSII player, get Champions of Norrath to try some online gaming. Awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"20 hours of fun","review":"This game, while worth the 20 hours my brother and I spent on it disappointed us in the end. Perhaps if we had played on the toughest skill level it would have been more challenging. The objective was reached without much trouble in a \\"hack and slash\\" style. Disappointing ending for a pretty good game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mix of video game action/graffics/d&d rules","review":"Heroes has a Gauntlet feel with spells, abilities, equipment, characters, monsters, and damage/expeierience rules taken from the Dungeons and Dragons role playing game. The game does an excellent job of giving players enough options without taking away from gameplay. Best is the ability to pause to make adjustments(good for sinlge player) or make changes in realtime(great for multiplayer). Graphics are superb and the cut scenes enhance the gameplay. The main weakness are the storyline and the senarios (limited to kill monster/find object/open door)and character interaction is nonexistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Dont buy too short unless you are the type of person that likes short games not recommended waste of 50.00 unless your a hardcore dungeons and dragons fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bestest Game Ever","review":"Graphics: I've never seen a cover with such bright red texture before.

The product I received is a cheap wrap with a gel pack. The wrap does not completely cover the gel pack , which would leave a frozen (or hot) gel pack directly pressed against your skin. It also does not fit around my knee without using the extension, and by the time you add a cloth to stop freezer burn the whole thing falls apart. I could add a cloth around the gel pack, but surely when you order a wrap like this it should do the job completely without having to add anything. I am returning this product as it's a cheap useless waste of time. Don't bother, you would be better off with a compression sleeve and an ice pack, or taking a bag of ice, wrapping it a cloth and taping it to your skin, it's cheaper and more effective than this.I rarely review or return items but I'm SO disappointed in this product I felt I had to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"The gel pack is fine, does not freeze and works as it should, but the blue wrap sucks, terrible product, not Practical, still need to use a towel to protect de skin from the ice burns and it does not strach...End up buying another one, truefit brand that works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap built - Cold does not last long at all.","review":"I bought two of this item and I do not recommend it to anyone.

I wanted something that I culd fit on my knee while sitting, thought this was the thing. First it is just a strip, it is shaped in anyway to fit the knee. The gel which you put in the fridge to cool is oblong and not long enough to be held down properly by the blue wrap, oh and please what is that blue strip that is sent with it, I think to ensure the thing holds to your knee, it is useless too skinny. Finally, and I accept the safety element but it is awkward, you have to put a towel between your skin and the gel pack, and there in lies the challenge you do that and you have a hard time with wrapping the outer piece around your knee. In short do not buy this product for your knee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knee wrap!","review":"I recently increased my running significantly and experienced left knee pain. I bought this with the intent of wearing it at work and still being mobile. I can't seem to get it to stay up when walking but I haven't tried very hard either. It works great sitting and laying down though and I love how it encompasses my entire knee. It stays cold for over a hour too. I haven't tried the heat yet so can't comment on that.

While not nearly as inexpensive as some of the other generic ones available through Amazon, it is clearly well-built and is around half the price of the standard ones you find at retail stores such as Wal-mart, Radio Shack and Best Buy. The cable provides a solid (well-fitted) connection to my Toshiba Vista notebook and the WD MyBook external hard drives I use, and playback of the recorded video on these hard drives through Windows Media Center and Media Player is super-smooth.

It has a nice fresh smell, not overly powerful. After applying and rinsing, the conditioner rinsed out easily with no residue. My hair felt soft and healthy and smelled great too!

The pioneer works OK, but looses lock easier, and the database is not as up-to-date as the Garmin. I recommend carrying a phone book with you, since the database doesn't have many newer stores and locations. It also doesn't take you as close to your destination. Sometimes, it stops directing you about a half mile away. Finding stores and points of interest is difficult without the address. It does do a good job of navigating on freeways, with very nice diagrams of each intersection. It also has XM Nav-traffic as an option, and I do like how it informs me when traffic is backed up. If you really need the XM radio, and traffic, I would consider this GPS. If navigation is your primary function, you will be much happier with a garmin. The data for the pioneer is still 1.0, and the replacement data disks are $250. I can only hope the updates will be more affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does this game get such a bad rap?","review":"Honestly.

After well balanced and innovative games such as Marvel vs. Capcom, Street Fighter Alpha 3, 3rd Strike, and Capcom vs. SNK 2, Capcom has given us crap for years. This title is no different. It is a bunch of recycled sprites, mismatched systems, and poor hit detection.Seriously, if you want to a fun, new, 2D fighter these days, play something by Arc Systems such as Guilty Gear or the Rumble Fish. Leave Capcom's trash alone until they stop recycling and give us something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're just on cruise control now...","review":"The only good thing you can say about this game is that the fighting isn't broken. But then, that's because they could do it in their sleep. And that's just what they did. Zero effort into making this the real exhibition of the greatness of their fighting game series that it could have been. Four characters each from five different games (plus two boring new ones) is not even an adequate cross-section of the variety of play-styles these games fostered.(...)You'll never find anyone to play this game online with, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Dictionary","review":"Explains clearly the importance of Quantum Physics as it applies to life in general.

The next day I went out and bought 512MB of PC3200. I installed the chip and my system now tells me I have 896MB. My e-machine is now perfect. I like how the recovery disk is built in, and also the speakers are pretty decent, especially with the 5.1 sound. I also liked how I took my flash media out of my digital camera, and was able to insert it into one of the multi-media slots and was able to view my photos instantly, without any software. The DVD burner is a plus also. The memory cost me about $40.00. This is a pretty fast machine at 2.2 Ghz. I'm using Wi-Fi Dsl and it flys on the internet.

THe tape holds up fine.The wrist pad is very thick but not too soft. The faux leather does not stick to skin or clothing.

I wanted to hear more and more about her addiction to celebrities! I was extremely disappointed...you think you're buying a book about one thing and then there's this whole boring plot about something else. It was nothing but a big let down to me.

Sensa started out making high-quality pens, and has transitioned to making low-end pens like this one that might appeal to a larger consumer audience. But the weight and feel is completely different from their earlier pens. If you want a cheap plastic throwaway pen, go for this one.

(Actually 4.5 stars)","review":"This book was the one that unlocked the \\"mystery\\" of COM for me. I find that it and other WROX beginner books are good when you've read the technobabble of others and still need more of a feel (and examples!). After reading this book, one can go back to the theoretical, intentionally intellectually impressive books for the rest of the story.The only downside was that there were no really detailed C++ examples (e.g., a COM object using another COM object)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sure there are better.","review":"Chapter 2 was just way too intense. It threw way too much at you, way too fast. I was left feeling overwhelmed, and frustrated. After reading chaps. 2 and 3 four times, I was able to proceed, but chapter 7 proved a disappointment when the example wouldn't work. I even downloaded the code off the site, and checked the errata online, to no avail. When the samples don't even work...well that's never happened to me before. It just didn't work.I was sticking with the book, because although it wasn't ideal, it was getting the job done. But I am fed up. I am shelving the book, and looking for something else now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is misleading","review":"This is a reference manual for COM programmers who already know how to program with the Active Template Library. Hoping to learn ATL from simple concepts to advanced techniques, I quickly found this book disappointing, because the advanced material begins at around page 20.Incidentally, I found the synopsis of the book description here on Amazon rather amusing: \\"The Active Template Library (ATL) is the part of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) used to build reusable and very efficient components in C++.\\" From what I can tell, ATL was designed as a lightweight ALTERNATIVE to MFC, not a PART of it!Summary: Difficult book to read. Not at all for beginners. More of a technical reference manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for an updated version","review":"This book was targeting VC5.0/ATL2.0. Some examples badly work with VC6.0/ATL3.0 : especially creating - and destroying ! - a modeless dialog box in an exe server, and connection points implementations when client and server are ATL based.I also agree with other readers about the rather convoluted organization of this book, and the strange mix of simple explanations and deep thoughts on ATL that keep me confused about its usability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners to COM","review":"This book might be appropriate for someone who already is very familiar with COM, but it is by no means good for beginners. I bought it thinking that it would get me started, but it only made things seem more complicated. Once I had read another book on COM, I began to understand some of the contents of this book. Of course, then I realized how poorly organized and written it is, so my opinion didn't improve much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples are terrible","review":"The examples are interleaved throughout the book and it is very difficult to know if you should type something in or just view the code. The object/application/project names used in the examples, make the examples extremely confusing.

I almost give up from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a jump start into the Worl of ATL...","review":"This book really did help me to gear up for the ATL/COM project. It took a while, but gave a solid insight of the ATL architecture. I had a few questions which were difficult to find in other books which were revealed pretty neatly in this book. If you are an experienced C++/Windows programmer and want to start of ATL-COM, this book is the best bet. Just with this book alone, you will reach from the beginner to the Intermediate level in a jiffy. Of course you are better off buying other books, but this one is highly recommended if are about to embark into the world of ATL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginner","review":"This book is not for a beginner who wants to learn ATL Com programming. It is badly organized. Sometimes a reader will not know what the author is talking about. Especially for a beginner. If someone wants to learn something about programming Atl Com, read other books instead this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reasonable COM reference but too technical for beginners","review":"This book fails in its task to be for 'Beginners'. I actually found the more advanced 'COM Applications with ATL' book a much easier read.Way too much hard technical facts and not enough simple explanations or higher level concepts.The first Professional Series book I found a disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan. Obtuse, obscure, incoherent definitions","review":"I found the book obtuse. I still don't know what COM is or what it's good for or what ATL is or what it is good for. I found it amazing that I could work through the examples, compile and execute the example code, and still be mystified. The lack of useful definitions of the obtuse terminology doesn't help either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing!","review":"The book is presenting a lot of stuff, but the way the information is organized, is very confusing.

Few examples, too much talk about obtuse data structures that even after the description I was left wondering if it was important. Just not enough teaching.

If you are new to COM or ATL try another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized and realized","review":"To much digging needed to find the few jewels here. The organization of the material is what hurts this book most. In chapter 2, after a brief intro into ATL and COM, they launch into the implementation of an ATL client, which consists (I'm not making this up) of running the ATL wizard and then deleting most of the output! It doesn't get any better further along, either. I recommend reading another title.

My husband owns the other 2-disk sets, and if you listened or own any of them, you'll immediately realize this one is different. With the Fashion Week name on it, I expected to hear rare tracks and music I have never heard before. Although I have never heard any of the music on this album, except the track from \\"Earth, Wind & Fire\\" nothing felt 'new', 'fresh' or like I hadn't heard it all before. At least with the first 3 sets, you could imagine models strutting down the runway being hip and cool!

Yes.","review":"There are a lot of things to like about Sam Kashner's coming-of-age memoir, \\"When I Was Cool.\\" First: Mr. Kashner wasn't cool and probably knows it. Second: he doesn't go through detox or recovery. Halleluia! A memoir without a recovery center or AA meeting. Third: his affection for these old lions, of whom only Peter Orlovsky is still with us. Fourth: the look at their everyday lives, from hemorrhoids to the keystone cops comedy of The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics. Fifth: Mr. Kashner's long suffering, very cool, and funny parents. And Sixth: Mr. Kashner's teenaged, wide-eyed, intimidated, growing-up self.Its not the last book that will be written about Naropa or any of the characters, but it's the only book written by the first (and for a long time only) student of the Kerouac school, and is sometimes lovely, often funny, and very easy - it's \\"a report of an intimate nature,\\" i.e., gossip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cool","review":"I set out to read this book because I am very interested in the school itself, which I still maintain, but I was sorely disappointed with the book itself. It should have been divided into two seperate stories, one about Kashner and one about the school--but how could he write a memoir and not include how \\"cool\\" he was--hanging out with the beats?I most certainly agree with Chris Jansen's list of problem's with this book. The obscure literary references were incredibly frustrating, it just led to me feeling alienated and uneducated. At one point Kashner refers to Ginsberg as a \\"jambon\\" for no reason but to, apparently, demonstrate his talent at remembering French words for food.Don't waste your money on this one, wait till your library gets it, or, if you're desperate to own it, until it comes to paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typing, not writing","review":"The topic is fascinating, but this book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's a wonder it was published at all. The author has few insights, writes repetitively, and seems to have forgotten details that occurred in his life almost 30 years ago when the events described are said to have taken place. I love the Beats and find both Ginsberg and Burroughs inspiring; it's a shame Kashner fails utterly to capture their importance as writers and people. Better to read them in the original than this shlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into Mobile Enterprise Applications","review":"The landscape of mobile enterprise applications is covered extremely well in this book.

No text of this size can possibly promise to cover the entirety of the world's history this century, and so in order to get more than a laundry list of events out of it, I think some sacrifices were rightfully made. Gilbert seems to have chosen a Euro-centric point of view, probably because this is where his expertise lie. And what he has chosen to focus on is very well covered and written. In reading these volumes I have a much greater appreciation of (some of) the events of this century. And when I want to round out this history with a more Asian or African or South American focus, I will do so by reading another author whose expertise lie in those areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancun Unchained?....More like Cancun Flop!","review":"I guess you could say I was a victim of not knowing enough about the DVD 'Cancun Unchained' prior to buying it, there was no info about it on the Amazon site prior to me buying it, but it really was a poor choice on my part.For those that have seen the DVD 'Luke's Freak Show - Cancun', well Cancun unchained is basically cut down from that and is shorter, but with similar content.The film quality is poor, the sound quality is poor, the soundtrack is poor.....what can I say other than I really don't recommend this DVD to anyone!

It was a bit difficult, starting to read this book thinking it's for everyone and then realising that it has an enormous bio slant and that you have to weed out 'irrelevant for physicists' bits all the time.

This book is easy to read and FULL of useful tips. However the overwhelming majority of these nuggets of gold come from past PhD students in the medical/biological sciences. This began to get really annoying. I was constantly having to decide which comments to take onboard and which to leave behind (because I thought they wouldn't apply to me).

He also shows how the blowhards make stuff up.Even if you are a right wing blowhard, you'll still want to read the book so you can yell, \\"Oh that's crap!\\"I would have given the book five stars, but I thought it could have been funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant!","review":"The only thing I'm not sure of is whether the lying liars are too afraid to really read it or just too damned stupid to get it.Wake up America! O'Reilly, Limbaugh, Coulter, that incrediible idiot, Sean Hannity and the rest are trying to sell you down the river. The sad thing is that they are all too successful.Read the book and just try to ignore the facts. The only truth you'll get out of the conservative media is the first 3 letters of their label... it's quite a CON job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Funny!... The Truth Hurts!","review":"This is the first book I've read by humorist Al Franken, but I am most certainly planning on reading the rest. Tired of all the Democrat bashing being done by uninformed Bible fanatics like Ann Coulter, Al has taken the war to the White House in this well-written side splitter. With a crew of Harvard Lefties to back him up, Franken has unmasked the truth behind how Right Wing Fundamentalists keep getting elected-- lies, lies, and more lies! A must read for anyone interested in hearing from the Left (trust me, you won't find it on prime time) or for any Right Wingers and Moderates out there who want to get the rest of the story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Already the lying is exposed!","review":"I'm on the 2nd chapter, and already Al Franken has shown the lies, outright lies, of Anne Coulter. Her shoddy research and propensity to make sh*t up is appalling. Can't wait to read the rest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"With a book this brilliant, you'd think Al went to Harvard","review":"This is a must read for all enlightened people. The Faux news crowd will not be into this one bit. Franken tells it like it is as he makes hamburger out of Faux News' sacred cows. This is not a slanderous book, each accusation is thouroughly fact checked. Like him or not, Franken is an honest and thoughtful human being who doesn't like what is being done to our country. His book is a call to arms, a call to action. Check it out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC BOOK--AND FINALLY SOME TRUTH...","review":"about this miserable administration and the buffoon at the top. Also these pompous asses like limbaugh and O'reilly. Just because they have the forum doesn't make their opinions any more important than when they were spouting them off drunk at the bar. Thanks Al Franken for having the guts to expose the hypocrisy and lies of the right-wing. It's about time someone spoke up!That idiot bush has to go...I'll probably be visited now by the \\"department of homeland security\\"....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and balanced is right!","review":"I don't always agree with him, but he does the research and finds the truth.

Hooray, for Al Franken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some truth","review":"Al Franken is kicking butt and taking names in this book. The right wing media machine is torn to shreds by simple facts. Facts that have been unreported by an intimidated media. Franken is unrelenting in his dissection of others who have graced the #1 booksellers spot and those who run our country. Now say it with Franken and me - \\"George Bush is a liar and has been lying the whole time\\". Also, Franken is always funny. Al, get a tv show of your own why don't you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"If you haven't read a book this year (and the stats say most Americans haven't)... read this one! Please! Brilliant and funny and, for once, the truth. No way Al didn't check his facts on this one. But watch your back, Al. There's a lot of truly nasty people out there who deserve to be exposed for what they are and what they're doing to this country. You did good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on Al!","review":"This is fantastic. What can I say? We need more people to follow suit. This is a prime example of people who are unafraid of critisizing what needs to be critisized in order to make people aware and encourage them to have more of an opinion of what is going on in our country today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to 'Reader'","review":"This is only in response to 'Reader' below. He obviously didn't read the book. The very point of the book is to dispel the myths that this obvious non-reader is claiming in his review. This is a book that any left-leaning person who is sick of Republicans saying \\"support the troops\\" while at the same time trying to cut pay for \\"the troops\\" in Iraq (don't believe that, look it up). If you are a right-wing fanatic, you should read the book as well. At the very least you can learn a little about how to use footnotes (or endnotes to anyone who has taken high school writing classes). Hopefully people will also take the time to learn how to use a LexisNexis or Google search.One major point of this book, as Franken makes clear from the onset, is to force readers to independently verify claims - whether it's right-wing Ann Coulter or Franken himself. Don't take my word for it, read for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last someone shooting down the conservative jerks","review":"Its good to see that someone with a brain (and a sense of humor) took up the challenge to show how moronic these conservative spim masters are.

Promise. No high profile conservative escapes a tongue lashing from Franken. From Ann Coulter to Bill O'Reilly and on to the president himself. If there is a lie-Franken will reveal it. I highly recommend this book for any open-minded person. It's worth the time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Franken Is A Genius","review":"Pretty much the only guy who has the guts to say what he says in the inimitable way in which he says it, Al has a strong and consistent message, couched in biting satire. Organized and moderate conservatives fear him, because they have no viable means to neutralize his arguments...so they resort to baseless lawsuits and slander. Crackpot and extremist conservatives fear him, because even though they don't completely get his jokes, they know he has their number - and that he speaks the truth. In fact, it's a shame more people don't get it, but that's the reason this country is in this mess to begin with..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for liberals, bad for conservatives!","review":"God told Al Franken to write this book. Granted it didn't arrive on clay tablets, but Franken does recount his conversation with God to write the book, which is a pretty funny bit.Whether or not you find the rest of the book funny will obviously depend on 1) your political views 2) your level of humor (i.e. do you like Al Franken or not?) and 3) your religious views.Nice to see that Al Franken won the lawsuit brought against him by Fox News over the usage of \\"Fair and Balanced\\" in the book's subtitle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real wake up call for moderates.","review":"I consider myself a moderate. Therefore, when I read this book I was expecting a funny book more so than a eye-opening experience. Franken's wit is razor sharp and I was rolling within minutes of starting. However, the overall effect on me was to reveal some of the more despicable and underhanded \\"loose interpretations\\" of the truth employed by the conservative media. I am a frequent listener of several of the radio personalities named by Franken. On the whole, I used to find them entertaining more than enlightening. Now, I cast a more critical eye to these folks and their vitriolic brand of dialogue with the American public. While Franken appears somewhat vengeful in one particular dramatic chapter, this book is remarkably even-handed actually supporting factual allegations with sources. What a concept! A real pleasure and a real motivator."},{"rating":"1","title":"narcissism at best..","review":"Besides the fact that this guy is completely full of himself, and perhaps narcissistic, he is an ignorant hypocrite. A more appropriate title and cover page for this book is to change the pictures to Pelosi, Obama, Dodd and himself, and title it \\"Insight into the mental disorder of liberals.\\" This guy is a sad joke. What's ironic is his attacks on Rush Limbaugh, who has flourished at everything Al failed at. And there is a reason this book is selling for a PENNY and his others as well, because they're not even worth the cost of paper to print this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Franken is a relatively funny guy, but he's at his funniest when he's not at his angriest; in this particular book he's up against folks who disagree with him politically, and his writing degenerates to name-calling a fair bit of the time...and name-calling doesn't require wit, just flippancy.It's a shame: There ARE good arguments against \\"the right,\\" but this book suggests that Franken doesn't actually know them. I think his earlier Limbaugh book was a better effort (Limbaugh's a bigger target; or at least, he was before he lost weight)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Guy is a Complete Idiot","review":"This is an absolute piece of garbage. Al and friends are getting upset and have taken to name calling (you know that wonderful thing liberals do.) They are upset because the new conservative movement is unstoppable.Al, face it.

If you want information and facts, look somewhere else.Bookstores need to display this book in their fiction area. Al Franken presents an accurate depiction of reality as about as well as Michael Mooredoes. Factless opinions are fictions, and this book is full of fictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"This book is absolutely horrible! I though I was getting a \\"fair and balanced\\" view of the true liberal side and all I read was wicked nasty horrible one-sided fanatic nonsense from someone who cannot write.

What a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"next time break the prozac in half.","review":"Here is a book that is based on the observations of a mental patient. As the title states, this book is based on lies of the left liberal socialists. Al should have got someone with cred to assist in the writing of this so called book.

If you feel that there is no such thing as being sacreligious (or blasphemous) you'll think he's funny. If, however, your political views are from the center or anywhere right of center, you'll view this as the ramblings of someone who couldn't make it in television or the movies, but found that he could make a buck by hurling insults at people who are far smarter than he is.

Franken wasn't funny on SNL, and he is not funny here, no matter how desperately he tries. He obviously considers himself a political pundit, but he only comes across as a fool. Since he considers himself to be so erudite, he should run for office, get himself elected, and fix everything...he would likely fare as well as Gary Coleman did in our California recall..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies By A Liar Who Tells Them Over And Over","review":"Al Franken's book is a load of tripe sure to please the libs for whom it is targeted. Franken and those of his ilk can't get over the fact that they no longer have a media monopoly for their point of view.I certainly found myself laughing when I read this book, but not at the condescending \\"humor\\" of Franken's diatribe. Rather,I laughed at the ludicrous distortions (i.e. LIES) used by AL to \\"prove\\" his points. Franken takes the usual implicit approach that liberalism is morally and ethically superior to consevatism (or any other competing viewpoint!). Those espousing a conservative viewpoint must be duplicitous, and just a little bit stupid (hee hee). Hence it is OK for Franken to tell whatever lie he needs to prove his point because he is on the side of VIRTUE. It's hard for me to believe that everything can be as one-sided as Franken would have us believe.Yep, there was quite a lot of unintended irony, and believe me, I was laughing at Al, not with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"No liberal bias in the media? You haven't proved anything.","review":"Using jargon, shallow arguments, and multiple relentless insults, Al Franken believes he has proven that Republicans are always wrong and that Liberals can do nothing wrong. Well, Mr. Franken has little solid to prove his points and make his case. He paints with a wide brush, generalizing about the republican party and about the usual jargon. Nothing more than propaganda with little to back it up. No liberal bias in the media? Please, for God Sakes. Look at The LA Times and how they handled the California Recall Election and tell me that there's no liberal bias in the media. I've read many books that have valid points conclusively proving that Bush is a bad president or that Republican social policy is messed up. However, this book is far from that and has no proof to back up anything he says whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Redeeming Entertainment Value","review":"The reason I gave the book 2 stars instead of one is because it does offer some entertainment value. Most of it came from laughing each time Franken's supposed evidence vs. Ann Coulter or some other conservative crumbled in the face of a little fact checking. Case in point: Franken is 100% wrong on the Even/Norman Thomas issue. Coulter said Norman Thomas was the GRANDfather of Evan and indeed he is. In fact all of the 'evidence' Franken, and his crack team of Harvard self-admitted activists, presented in his attack on Coulter's \\"Slander\\" was either dead wrong or just a product of his inability to take a joke or understand sarcasm, irony, and hyperbole. And Al Franken is a comedian? I suppose he is but only if you consider a Circus clown a comedian since I find myself laughing at them in much the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al's Big Lies and the lies he tells...","review":"There is not much to say about Al Franken except that he is a in his own little universe.

If Mr. Franken is trying to brand himself as the new voice of the political left, then he should invest in singing lessons. I read this looking for a few laughs at the expense of the right. What I got was a smug rant by a limousine liberal.

Where he left off in schoolyard name calling in his first book, he picks up here. He picks and chooses parts of facts, combines them with other partial facts and comes up with a whole new truth. He doesn't just try to set his side of an argument, he has to insult and degrade those who believe differently (Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity, etc.).

Al Franken shows how many politicians and some members of the media are busy making up events, facts, etc. while the 'mainstream media' passes on misinformation because they are too lazy to check facts or think critically.The book has two flaws: Franken has blinders on when it comes to the Clintons and he lets himself wander into diatribes. He is at his best when he reveals the incredible lies that have been foisted on us and cleverly uses the same tactics against those he has caught lying.You also have to love the fact that the guy will admit his mistakes. He is too impulsive on a regular basis but he will readily fess up when he realizes he has gone too far.The fact that the book has been catapulted to the best-seller list by an ill-conceived lawsuit is icing on the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"More libreal spin! Al Franken is a politcal hack. He is just like the rest of the Democrats who are bitter over the fact that the American people like President Bush.

Does Franken really have so much hate inside of him? With its unabashed racism (\\"Irish ape-man\\",), distortions(\\"funny bias\\") and savage personal attacks on people in the news and politics we've grown to love, despite their faults, the book really disturbs the reader's inner soul. It has totally bad vibes. I had to meditate for much time to calm the Great Spirit Within after reading. O.K., maybe not everything everybody has said in the news is true. But life's too short for it to really make a difference. Wake up, read a book, see a painting, take a walk in the park-just enjoy life. Things aren't as bleak as Franken makes them out to be.

But that's the essence of this book. Democrats are compelled to say things they don't really believe, or in most cases just make it up, as in Franken's analysis of the Wellstone memorial. You'll never hear Republicans say they \\"support the troops\\" because you KNOW they do.Al Franken and friends are the whiners in the peanut gallery, petty armchair quarterbacks who have nothing constructive to say.

Most conservatives I know do not feel that these people represent them. It's sad that they get so much attention.Franken does a great job of pointing how the mainstream media has basically become lazy and largely unreliable.

Just make sure to read the next book pointing out the \\"lies\\" in Franken's book: after all, Franken says he put pictures of the liars on the cover of his book . . . and look who's picture is the biggest.But hey, 2 stars for successfully baiting O'Reilly and Fox into suing, and a successful marketing campaign to the faithful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locker room humor but not much else","review":"I enjoy Al Franken's (frankness) as much as the next person but am sadly disappointed in his latest offering. After expecting some factual hits to the right from an otherwise comedic player, Franken has lost the thrust of the title and has compiled what can best be described as a hateful op-ed devoid of supporting evidence and peppered throughout with vulgarities in locker-room fashion, aimed at ghost figures. If you enjoy dark humor at the expense of facts then this is the book for you. If you are looking for example ammunition for left-right debate I would not reccomend this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why","review":"A nasty little book by a vile, bitter little man.

I've read other reviews on this book, and I have made some conclusions. That most of the people who hated this book are people who had different opinions than Al does (thats no surprise) Then they make a big deal that content in this book not hundred percent true. So what, its nothing different than what crap Bill O'Reily, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh put out. And lastly, If you knew that Al Franken was a liberal, and you the reader is a conservative and you know that both your and Franken's opinions are gonna be different, WHY READ THE DAMN BOOK? Overall, I loved the book, my father is a huge fan of his and I just got into reading his books with Why Not Me, and Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot. This book totally tells its reader what it needs to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"O my god this is a great book!","review":"I need to by a vowel because O my god this is a great book! It's as funny as Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot (which he is) and is very well researched. It's about time somebody called these unethical blowhards on their slanderous, hateful behavior.

I just can't believe he slept with that horrible Ann Coulter. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Franken is a weiner","review":"I didn't read this book, but Al Franken is a liberal weiner who has no logical bones in his body.

May God have mercy on you Al.Franken presents unsubstantiated claims in what amounts to nothing more than personal attacks on anyone who disagrees with his wacko viewpoints. When the \\"other side\\" presents viewpoints in this fashion they are called intolerant, racist, hate mongors, and oh yeah... \\"liars\\"... yet because Franken is a liberal, the liberal press and editorialists eat up this garbage.Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for this kindling...

The San Francisco Chronicle has his book as #1, and I consider the SF Chronicle to be an unbiased newspaper, yeah, right!!! They are as liberal as they come.

As a comedic writer for SNL he was marginally better. As a political activist, he fails miserably. Though maybe I am biased. I don't agree with basically anything that is in this book and I am grateful he has no say whatsoever in the policies of this nation.Just the fact that he thinks the idea of a \\"Liberal media\\" is a lie started by the right who actually own the media speaks volumes for how deep his hatred and ignorance of the \\"right\\" is.My advice,Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and the Comedian that told them","review":"Al Franken has no view on politics he does not know politicts he was on Third Rock the one time he was good at politics.My dad hated him on SNL but I thought he was okay as Stuart Smalleybut he does not know anything at all no experience what so ever at all is necessary for these books.Hes not like General Brokaw who has tons of experience.I say this book is a disgrace to politics and the only thing worse is Micheal Moore I will pass.Everyone knows that the real racist are the Liberals they pick everyone out as just being black.My grandpa is a Liberal and he is 79 and he hates Black people me and my dad and my other grandpa who is deceased were not liberal and not Racist.My Grandpa said the words I like Gonzaga because they are white I said Grandpa black people are cool don't diss them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Informative","review":"What does it mean when a comedian does a better job investigating the politics and tatics of the right than does the media?

I highly recommend it. This book is not only informative but will make you laugh. Amazon's 30% discount price is great, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you want fact, not fiction","review":"Like a fresh breeze, facts are documented, with clear and concise statments exposing the right wing lies and how the right wing lies are not documented.No fact distortion as found in right wind(yes wind) publications.This book was impossible to stop reading cover to cover once picked up. The book is full of humor and devoid of attack.Franken does a great job of explaining the meaning of morals, and the right wing's lack of morals, distortion of morals(morals have to do with more than sex).I highly recommend this book to all right wing conservatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive.","review":"Franken tries to point out the lies made by the Right by showing some examples. The problem is that the \\"lies\\" aren't a big deal. So what if Bill O'Reilly lied (or made a mistake) about the name of an award he received many years ago? Is that going to destroy the country or something? I know that's not Franken's argument, but he makes it seem like the balance of America is at stake.Some of the \\"lies\\" that Franken points are either mistakes made or lies that are irrelevant in our lives anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish....ok for bathroom reading....good fabricator!!!","review":"Don't waste your time. He proves himself to be the Liar, and the Liar that tells them. A totally typical left wing title...completely without class...Another left wing entertainer that shouldn't be taken seriously by mainstream Americans. (I don't care where he went to college, he needs therapy)...Definately has his own agenda. He is clever at twisting truths but I much prefer him on Saturday Night live as Stewart.....Sorry....not worth the read!!! On the other hand...Bill O'Reilly's books are right on the mark. I highly recommend \\"The No Spin Factor\\" and \\"Fair and Balanced\\"....I can't wait to read the new book he has out. I'm sure Al Franken will write some garbage about that book.

There are many conservative books on the market but only a few for liberals.However, after about half way through, I found it difficult to continue reading the book.Al Franken is one angry man. His hatred for Fox News Network and its hosts, especially Bill O'Reilly, makes for a boring read. A book full of hate speach is not entertaining.Al Franken is the one who lies in his own book! For example he faults Bill O'Reilly over the issue of the Peabody award. Al's account of this story is incorrect.If you like hate speach ... pages and pages of it ... READ THIS BOOK. If you want a fair review of Fox News Network, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just look at his titles","review":"No need to read his books just read the titles, and you have covered the \\"depths\\" of not only the whole book but his intelligence as well.

And a fellow Aussie loving the book because it was easy to just slot in Aussie 'baddies' into the place of the American ones! Of course it's easy to slot cardboard cut-outs into tasteless, partisan rants! Which prophet do you want people? The religous zeal of the reviews is funnier than the book itself, and comes cheap! Then we have all the unhelpful votes for reviews against the party line, the terror of dissent in a projected utopia? If that's how you do business as a human being, then go ahead and click, click, click... hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided","review":"Since unfortunately the colleges are mostly liberal (for fear of not being politically correct), our poor college kids are getting brainwashed. They need to quit reading the strange thoughts of Al Franken. I recommend no one read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a work from a humorist","review":"I have been a fan of Franken's since work on the original SNL. While I enjoy his political satire, the true worth of this book is in the fact checking. It is simply amazing how many lies, distortions and sheer oversights the political right has gotten away with. The only bigger shame is that most people will write off this book as the work of a liberal humorist and pay no attention to the facts that Franken and his team of researchers unearthed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Pro-Democratic, but all too true","review":"I didn't find it particularly fair and balanced as far as the way it presented Clinton and Gore, but it's presentation of the right was pretty much bullet proof and irrefutable. Clinton was a lying lyar too, and although Franken acknowledges this, I think he presents a prettier picture of him than he deserves. There are plenty of negative reviews in this thread, which amount to little more than the whining they accuse Franken of. Not one has anything resembling a scholarly refutation. Michael Moore is biased for sure and shouldn't really be grouped with Al Franken. It's a good light read and well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to Al Franken! I KNEW THEY WERE LYING!!!","review":"Thanks go out to Al Franken, who has the nerve (and the student TeamFranken) to find the truth about the lying liars!

It is tremendously entertaining, well written and a real eye opener. Franken does get a little annoying and petty at a couple of points, but overall the book is very informative and funny. The chapter (in cartoon form) \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" contrasting a Jesus who believes in Supply Side Economics with the real Jesus of Nazareth was my favorite part, and should be required reading for every person who beleive that being a Christian means supporting Bush-style economics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franken Has Gone Over the Edge","review":"A.F. does not represent the left any better than O.J. represented African Americans. Don't waste your time reading his inane (or should I say insane) banter."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Once again I have TRIED to understand the hatred the Frankens of this world have towards the republicans and even our own nation. Once again I was disappointed in the emotional attacks from the left. Al Franken was worthless on Saturday night life in the 70's and the 80's...he is even more worthless after reading this \\"book.\\" He offers NOTHING in the way of solutions in any problems this nation faces, yet he is the first to jump on the anti-US bandwagon. He is trying to find another career and he may have found one being a \\"mouthpiece\\" of the vast LEFT wing media. I watched him on TV giving an anti-bush speech and all he said was 4-letter words and vemon. What a non-talented blowhard. If you want NON-factual, emotion-filled drivel...this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"Zero stars are not an option.This book is worthy of no more than that. The title alone \\"Lying Liars\\" should give anyone who hopes to obtain anything they can trust some pause.It is well known Franken used some rather dubious methods and he himself committed a series of lies to gather quotes for this misereable piece of fluff.Save your money and buy a good fiction. This may be fiction but it is FAR from good. If you want a good laugh, try Seinfeld.He's a good comedian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah...","review":"A man whose entire research team consists of only white men shouldn't criticize the GOP or \\"big business\\" of slighting affirmative action or being racist. This accusation and others like it in Franken's book are merely bits of uneducated and unaware heckling desperately attempting to pass as well-researched political commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"It changed my mind","review":"As a longtime liberal, from a multigenerational liberal family, I chuckled when a friend gave me this book as a gag gift. I read the first chapter, and though I agreed with the contents, it was quite unhumorous and not entertaining, but I continued with the rest.By the end of the book, I felt disillusioned, and began questioning the moral superiority I had always assumed liberalism had. Through a soul-searching process that extended over several months, I began realizing that most of my true values are closer to conservatism, and it has only been the constant, deadening rhetoric of the left that had kept me from this realization.In short, while I approached this book with a snort, it ended up transforming my political views. I was expecting just a pleasant read backed up with evidence, but instead I found a nasty polemic, positions backed up with no evidence, and embarassing revelations of liberal moral hypocrisy, and a really unfunny read."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"That's all I can say. Wow. What a horrible book. I mean I know its Al Franken who authored it, but be serious .Who actually thinks any of this stuff is true? Liberals I have to hand it to you. You guys are living in a world that is completely unreal. Well guess what this lunatic is now in the US senate! Does that scare anyone? It should and not just conservatives.

This his humor can occasionally be off the mark (Cheerleaders in chadors? What the hell was he thinking?!?!), more often tan not it is as on-target as a laser-guided missile, and I found myself laughing out loud at something in almost every chapter. As good as the book is, though, I did have some reservations: 1) the Operation Chickenhawk chapter was way too obvious and heavy-handed, 2) unless you're really up on your current events, it may be hard at times to tell when he is joking and when he is relating a true incident, 3) there is no index, making it difficult to locate specific points in the book. However, the chapter on the memorial to Paul Wellstone is deeply moving and more than makes up for it. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not a lie!","review":"Al Franken does a great job debunking two of the biggest liars of the conservative slant--Coulter and O'Reilly. Two of the biggest character assassins who scream 'murder' when their own inconsistencies are pointed out. The only chapter I didn't really find ironically funny was the truely fictional chapter where he puts several right-wing characters in Viet Nam. The book would have been better without it.Still, rates 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"I'm not surprised that so many of the conservatives couldn't finish the book. It was far too painful an introduction to truth. The one clunky part is the awful chapter where he fantasizes about how various right wing chickenhawks would do in Vietnam. Other than that misstep, this is genius, sheer genius.Jerry Mayer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opener ...","review":"Kudos to Al Franken for taking on the right-of-John-Birch wingnut talking heads and politicos.

Hiding behind the words like \\"satire\\", Mr. Frankin still is right in this country. Politics used to be civil in this great country where people could debate issues and find common ground. Jerks like Frankin that have no ideas to share, only the words of hate and disrespect. They are given a stage by the liberal media to distroy the very institution that gives them the right to speak. I hated Clinton and every thing he stood for. But, I never showed disrespect for the office of the President.

Who does he think he is calling conservative pundits liars when Franken is a liar too! The Smoking Gun exposed him when he lied to Ashcroft (you can read the letter in Franken's book but he doesn't include his letter of apology). Hey Al, admit it... YOU LIED! Furthermore, if you think that ALAN COLMES is the only liberal pundit on fox news, think again. Apparently you haven't been watching this news program as closely as you claim, because Geraldo (a liberal) also has a show on fox news! Anyway, excuse me as I buy a copy of Bill O'Reilly's new book \\"WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR YOU?\\" .

Like Limbaugh, he's part of the problem. Satire is a useful tool, but Franken doesn't use it well. He's as one-sided as his opponents on the right.Of course, it's rather pointless to bother writing any truthful comments about a book such as this. Who the hell shows up at this page except Franken's fans? They probably own the book already, but come here to give a poor rating to any review that suggests Franken is anything less than a genius.

Since when did dumb over the hill commedians become sources for political information and representatives of liberals? I agree with a lot of the information but the format is just nausiating. For example, I read \\"Treason\\" by Ann Coulter and was ready to throw up. I disagree with just about everything she says. But I would never stoop to that level of name calling and smearing. The best way is to not dignify it with response. I know Ann Coulter is wrong but there is no need to be as bad as she is.

His left wing rantings are always couched as \\"humour\\" when, in fact, they are simply the same old liberal clap trap parroted by a guy whose career ended when Stuart Smalley left SNL. Franken is pretty much just what he looks like -- a puppet -- . If the press weren't dominated by left wing ideologues like the New York Times and network television news talking heads, this guy would be little more than a pimple on the underside of show biz.

Everyone in this country should be g.d. glad that someone is. (I seem to recall Iraq not too long ago holding an \\"election\\" in which Saddam got 99.9% of the vote.

And he basically hates everything america is all about, he hates open debate, he hates people with differnt political views then him and he hates religioins like christianity. This is a hateful intolerant book.Mr. Franken should not be purchased, it only feeds his ego and feeds his hatred towards america.

Yet, leftists such as Al Franken seem to think that writing books like this will help them regain the political highground. No such luck. This book is little more than leftist disinformation and drivel, and poorly written and unentertaining at that.

Come on readers defend your man share with us the world according to Al."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair and Balanced Look - or Unfounded Emotion?!?!","review":"For someone who is so \\"loved\\" in his circuit, I was appalled by his book. Rather than stating the facts that he so stubbornly insists are being hidden, he turns his writing into a full on bash of people he disagrees with. Franken writes with his emotion rather than his intellect. It's unfortunate that people will believe his \\"lies\\" and be decieved simply because they are looking for the truth. And how about that hypocritical title - A fair and balanced look MY EYE! Don't waste your money...It seems to me that the author is so concerned about getting his EMOTION across that he forgets that America is who it is because we stand behind eachother and don't try to tear down our fortress from the inside.

It uses misrepresentations and goes on and on about what is so bad about the right when in fact all it really does is prove that Al Frankin is a complete moron devoid of any common sense or sense of decency. The Left is angry because America has rejected them outright. Al sounds like a spoiled little brat who didn't get his way. This book isn't worth the paper it is printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It","review":"Al Franken's book is just slightly hypocritical. Polotics as a whole is hypocritical. He calls out a lot of conservatives and bashes them and calls them out on issues, but you don't see him doing it to liberals. All poloticans are liars and it's kind of funny to watch one guy call others liars and not bash others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good research, and funny too.","review":"This book is a combination of humor and research regarding many of the heated political issues of our day. Parts of the book were hilarious, others enlightening, others depressing. Should you laugh or cry when you read that Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Tom DeLay, Bill Kristol, Rush Limbaugh and many others avoided military service in Vietnam based on flimsy excuses?The chapter on the Bush administration's complete indifference to the al Qaeda threat prior to 9/11 is mind-boggling. While plans for taking out Bin Laden (developed by the Clinton administration) were shuffled between desks at the White House, President Bush took the longest presidential vacation in 32 years. The write-up is humorous, the subject is sad.This book covers some major issues about our government and the media, in a way that true patriotic Americans might find enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know your left from your right","review":"Al Franken places the cards on the table. He points out how Fox News and people such as Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly manipulate the truth and use their media methods to spread lies. Any intelligent person would see that Al points out their lies in a precise and well researched manner. From the lies told to us by our the Bush Administration, to the controlled media outlets like Fox News. (Fair and Balanced my butt)Read this book. Educate yourself to what is really happening. See how the media is trying to control you and your thinking. See how people like Bill O'Reilly prey on the weak minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell It Like It Is!","review":"Al Franken did a very good job on this book. It is interesting, helpful and worth the price. He is not afraid to name names and say what he thinks. Many of the ultra right wing conservatives are the choices for his book on liars. I enjoyed reading the words of someone who is not afraid to call out some of the most outspoken of the ultra conservative right.Good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"I detest the right wing and admire the way Al takes them down a few pegs to their \\"right\\"-ful subhuman level. He takes actual facts and applies his considerable wit to expose truth. I liked this book better than Dude, Where's My Country by Michael Moore; though I agreed with MM's message I didn't like the way the book was one long rant. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars only because I think parts of it went on too long, just like a Saturday Night Live skit that doesn't know where to end. However, I'd recommend this to anyone as a solid and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Franken tells the truth...","review":"...which is why he'll never get a job at Fox News!!! After brilliantly harpooning Rush Limbaugh, Al Franken has taken on the larger and more important task of lampooning the Bush Administration and Bush's attack dogs -- the Hannitys, Coulters, and O'Reillys of the world. And he sets himself apart from the ultraconservative media ranters by actually telling the truth and backing it up with facts. Franken also manages to make us laugh out loud in the process of exposing those lies that are so harmful to America and her citizens. Great job, Al!!!P.S. -- It's obvious to see that \\"Lies and the Lyiang Liars Who Tell Them\\" has frightened many hard-core conservatives. However, I recommend to them that they read the book with an open mind and actually check out the facts that Al Franken sets out in his book. They may come away with a more balanced view of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a liberal who can hit back!","review":"Just for balance, this book was necessary. It's tiring to hear about the liberal-dominated media when there's a conservative-dominated best-seller list. Not only is Franken hilarious, but he knows how to get his facts straight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thank you al franken!","review":"with all of the business going on with Bush and Co.'s LIES about IRAQ and the phantom WMD, I needed a good laugh and Al Franken gave me just that.

We need more people like you who speak up and speak out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them","review":"This is the first book I've read by Al Franken but it will notbe the last! It is absolutely, fabulously interesting. I started reading it at bedtime, tried to sleep but couldn't so read half the night! Republican DIRTY TRICKS are as low as they can go -- they even smeared John McCain to steal So. Carolina for \\"that thing\\" who has made a MESS of the USA and the world! I will not soon forget chapter 25 concerning the death of Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone and how the Republicans distorted the memorial service. Disgusting! But what can we expect from any Republican anyway? They don't know the meaning of honesty and decency now; never did; never will. Thank you, Al Franken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!","review":"Don't miss the chapters on Bill O'Rielly, Ann Coulter, Barbara Bush and...my favorite....the Bob Jones University visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"No evidence of lying on Franklin's part","review":"I'm not a big fan of Franklin, but since the future over our country depends on how we vote and how we vote depends on who we believe, I think it rather important that we get to the bottom of things.A couple of the reviews below said that Franklin was lying. Well, I couldn't find a single case where he said something untrue (when he was being serious), but maybe I just didn't look hard enough. So for the edification of all of us, I propose that anyone who thinks he is lying should:1. Quote exactly what he said that was false.2. Give the page number(s) on which he said it.3. Give the information that indicates what he said was false.4. Give a VERIFIABLE source of your information, like a URL or something that anyone could look up.If you can do that, you have done us all a public service.If you can't, then you should reevaluate your belief system."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent and entertaining read","review":"This is a great book for those that want to hear about politics from a different angle than the Ann Coulter and Fox News garbage that has become so prevalent. Franken does a great job with most of the book, and is pretty factually sound on what his statements are. In fact, I've researched a lot of the information that I thought was not true, and was able to find out that the bare truth is even more shocking than what Franken wrote about.There were a few boring parts of the book, but overall I liked it. I'd reccomend it to anyone with an open mind and a desire for more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Franken Successfully combines information with Satire.","review":"Lies mixes biting satire with plenty of factual insights into the flaws of many of the popular leaders of the right. Mr. Franken is most successful with the chapters that combine this satire with insights into either the facts neglected by the Right Wing Commentators or the errors in their logic. The factual portions of the book are well documented and appear to be carefully checked --generally consistent with information from other sources and the failure of any of Mr. Franken's critics to rebut more than the most trivial issues.The one weakness of lies is the regression into somewhat juvenille humor in a couple of chapters -- particularly the \\"Operation ChickenHawk.\\" This chapter creates a hypothetical wartime scenario with John Kerry and several right wingers who had never served in the military (\\"hawks\\" who were chicken)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"Finally liberals have a champion wordsmith to voice the mounting frustration built from the pile of distortions and outright lies of radical Republicans gone amok. Franken has taken great pains to carefully document his source material for each claim and counterclaim. His intent is solid. Let's get the facts straight. Shine some light into the murky, slimy darkness of hate media.It is telling that opponents are unable to dispute a single fact in the book. Attacks on the book drop to the lowest form of character assasination. The volume of screaming coming from his targets demonstrates how precisely he has truly hit them where it hurts.This is a must read for the Liberal Democrats everywhere. It might just begin to stiffen their backbones for the coming political season. Way to go Al!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time","review":"Al Franken dissects the lies of the conservative \\"literati\\" in ways that left me shaking my head wondering who the heck are these people? With an attention to detail and documentation that clearly shows the delusional world in which Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and other \\"fair and balanced\\" right-wingers live, Franken has also used his trenchant wit to make this a fast, incredibly funny read that will make you want to give all the spineless Democrats out there a swift kick in the butt for putting up with this drivel. Isn't about time for liberals to start fighting back? Go Al!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read, then vote in 2004.","review":"After receiving my copy yesterday I couldn't put Franken's brilliant new fair and balanced book down. Oh if only the Democrats in Congress had the guts to call the right on their deceits. Franken cuts straight to the heart of the problem using facts that ought to make us all afraid...very afraid, particularly the exerpts from O'Reilly's novel. Living through years of endless vituprative attacks on the left from Limbaugh to O'Reilly and Coulter, it's clear that the hard right are a humorless lot when the jokes on them. Sadly enough, this book is not so funny as it is scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Franken, new voice of freedom","review":"This book is an eye-opener. I'm glad he's writing to the general public, who are often spoon fed the news and have not much choice in believing what they see. I give him 5 stars for standing up to the bullies in the media."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Stuart Mill and Al Franken Are Right","review":"Franken shows in this book that John Stuart Mill was right when he said that although not \\"all conservatives are stupid people . . . it is true that most stupid people are conservative.\\" And they all seem to watch Fox News and lap it up.I am growing a long beard, waiting for anyone connected with Fox to counter just one of Franken's arguments in this book. I guess Fox is still fuming after the judge spanked them for that frivolous lawsuit.Hope Franken sells a gazillion books, and writes a gazillion more (a gazillion, by the way, is exactly what the deficit is now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, witty, and true.","review":"I love this book don't get me wrong.It's about people that lie and how they do it.Famous people, common people, everyone lies is basically what the theme is here, but this book shows us this in a witty and funny way.I found it amusing and charming at the same time, but one thing that this book lacks is a point.What is the endning to this? What is the forecloser?I can't figure that out, but besides that, it's a good interesting read, I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke!","review":"As a gay american, im apalled at this guy's vitriol!

Thank you Al for doing such a brilliant job of leading the mindless sheep that have praised your book over the clif! You have thoroughly proved the point, that members of the Democratic party would rather be lead by morons from Hollywood rather than real leaders that are capable of making real SERIOUS decisions. You keep it right up Al! I just love watching you fools squirm, moan and groan so ineffectually!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Spite of the Cheap Shot Title","review":"It turns out that there are quite a few lies and distortions in this book. Unfortunately for Mr. Franken, nearly all are his. I imagine he'll sell quite a few of these books to bitter people who have been trained to feed off of the government or to ease their consciences by letting the government take their money and throw it at problems for which they have no other solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"I take pride in trying to see both sides of opinion","review":"(...)I recently purchased this book on audio. I generally can see the logic in both sides of the Conservative/Liberal debate.Sadly, I found this book very difficult to listen to. The facade of satire was too thin to hide the mean-spirited attitude of the author.I say this and I LIKE Al as a comedian.I was expecting a passionate book that was logically re-enforced by thoughtful argument. I found that it was more on a nit-pick exercise of Mr. Franken's perceived enemies.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for People Like Al Franken","review":"I think it's evident what this book is about and to whom it will appeal. You either love it or hate it for the most part.For those of us who loathe the current administration and the endless manipulation of information, this book will serve as a reminder that not everyone in this country is sitting back quietly.To the author of the immediately preceding review, I assume the title \\"Neither fair, nor balanced, nor well-written\\" is describing your review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining.","review":"This book is an 'easy' read and very funny. However, the further I got into it, the more angry I became. I am familiar with how the right wing manipulates the government and the media through its vast wealth, but Franken uses a multitude of facts to clearly show how this is perpetrated. From the environment, to civil liberties, to tax breaks for the rich, we (the lower 90%) are getting screwed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fair and balanced review of the BOOK OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Way to go, Al. You have outdone yourself. Not only do you expose the lying liars for what they are, you do it in such a clever way that some conservatives don't even get the irony of the subtitle, even as they are being unfair and biased (see the following cretinous review). Don't get me wrong, this book is for conservatives. You've got to buy this book if you like Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter or President Bush; all your favorite Republican stars and politicos are quoted heavily, and you find out all kinds of interesting background and anecdotes about them. Honest, I haven't read anything with such relish in I can't remember when. I don't know what a \\"WRITTING STYLE\\" is (see Taymyr's review), but if that's a cross between witty and writing, Al has it in spades. As for intellectual content, the truth has always been an intellectual pursuit and, Mr. Franken, I'm happy that someone is standing up against throwing the truth in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-researched, informative, and entertaining","review":"Al Franken's book is enjoyable and informative on many levels. I appreciated how he researched the book. His journalistic skills are impeccable and his \\"paper trail\\" leaves no doubt to the credibility of his arguments. My teenage daughter, who is discovering the fascinating world of politics, was drawn to the book by its humor, but then couldn't put it down because of Franken's style. The book is a page-turner because Franken dices it up -- there are lists, mock tests, comic strips -- all quite funny, but all alarmingly accurate. Satire at its best! Mark Twain and Jonathan Swift would love Al Franken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth and Humor - How Refreshing!","review":"I enjoyed this book because it presented such accurate information in such a humorous way. During a time when the lies of our government and our right-winged media has brought on such dire consequences, this is very refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book - Funny, Factual and Intelligent","review":"I have enjoyed all of Al Franken's books. I just wish he would crank them out more often. I am ready for the next one. This book is somewhere in the middle of his other biggies. It is not as angry as \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" and not quite as funny as \\"Why Not Me\\"(which is hysterically funny). If you are going to call people on their lies, you had better be ready to back it up. Al does just that. I even checked a few of his references since he is such a stickler. You may not agree with all of his opinions, and his opinions are quite clear, but you can absolutely count on the veracity of the lies he has uncovered. By the way, note the number of reviews and the average rating of this book as compared to O'Liely's newest large print book. Hurry up with the next on Al, I'm waiting..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get some new material","review":"This should be listed as fiction.How funny that in a book about liars Al Franken himself tells so many lies. I'm glad that I borrowed this book and didn't spend money on it.Oh, and get over the O'Reilly thing! Bill O'Reilly once misspoke on the name of an award that \\"Inside Edition\\" had won and, although O'Reilly has corrected the mistake numerous times, Franken keeps using that example as \\"proof\\" that O'Reilly is a liar-never acknowledging that he corrected himself.Franken is, in fact, so desperate to attract attention that he has not only named his radio show to mimic \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\"but he has recently gone on \\"The Howard Stern Show\\" which I was a fan of for years until Stern became a pathetic old man who no longer thinks for himself.Anyways, I'm sure that this review won't be helpful to most ofthe sad people who are blindly believing Al Franken's lies.He almost makes me ashamed to be a democrat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining...","review":"Al Franken is a talented comedy writer, so it's no surprise that this book is laughably one-sided. His writing style is good and should even evoke a chuckle from conservatives who don't take themselves too seriously. Don't pretend this book is any more than what it is: a humor piece with a political agenda. The title alone (and that of his Limbaugh book) should tell anyone that they're not getting a serious read here. I shake my head at people who want to attach too much importance to celebrity tomes. It reminds me of some acquaintances who considered the movie \\"Dogma\\" to be a valid reference on religion. Franken IS funny, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"funny but erroneous","review":"Franken tells his tale with plenty of wit and sarcasm, but those looking for actual facts will find few clearcut ones here.

Franken is obsessed with giving the extreme left a voice to equal Limbaugh and Fox News for the right. What comes out is shrill and tired old liberal adages for conservative views. It's ironic that the title of the book leads you to believe that the conservatives only tell you half the story, the whole time Franken only tells you half the story. Present the other side next time Al....maybe you'll accomplish something.Get it at the library...it's worth a few laughs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irrefutable","review":"I almost wish that Franken had not narrowed his topics here to deceits he could controvert through his teams thourough research, as there are insidious acts of The Administration that make much more telling. (Anybody remember \\"If you are not with us, you are against us\\"? Not exactly right in line with \\"E Pluribus Unum,\\" is it?) Nevertheless, if there were that many folks who weren't quite ready to pull the trigger on Iraq, they all need to get inspired by TeamFranken's indignation, and get started with their local voter registration campaigns.

Amazon's review credits him for being a Harvard fellow....therein \\"lies\\" the problem. It is so easy to sit on the sidelines and poke fun at leaders.

He spends a chapter on how Bill O'Reilly mistook a Poke for a Peabody award several years back and you cant help to think with O'Reilly being on the news and all over the media if thats the best he could come up with.

Isn't there some sort of legal penalty for unleashing that much untruth on such uncritical minds as her fold?). My problem wasn't with the factual (which I checked on Nexis/Lexis; pretty much every quote was verbatim and the facts check out).While I realize Al Franken's job is to entertain, I wasn't fond of some of the tone of voice. I think Joe Conason's book was a bit...well...classier. Yes, he's a comedian. Still, the opposition is so meanspirited and ugly that I find I'm particularly critical of that type of tone of voice.That said, I do not give four stars lightly. The Wellstone chapter alone was heartbreaking. Al, look me up and we can go flog some of the deserving."},{"rating":"2","title":"For great entertainment...","review":"For great entertainment, read the negative, one star, reviews of this book. Is it just a coincidence that most seem to come from borderline retarded, half illiterate people? Incomprehensible sentence structures, misspelled words, and just plain silly misuse of words abound.

It's all fun and yet quite scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great read, hysterical and truly accurate!","review":"I loved this book! Al Franken is so funny, his humor is dry, extremely witty and right on the mark. Sometimes I would read something he said and think he was serious and then realize he was making a very clever joke. It is honestly extremely funny and entertaining!His chapters on Anne Coutler and Bill O'Reilly were my favorite. They are both nuts and he goes after them with vigor. He points out about a zillion errors in Anne's books and can back them up with proof. He gives many examples on how O'Reilly is nothing more than a bully with a big mouth.His book is EXTREMELY well researched, well written, easy to understand and everything he claims can be proven to be true. He does not throw around statements that have no merit, he proves others to be liars while keeping his book 100% truthful and yes I even looked into some of his claims out of curiousity and found them to be true.A really,really good read and highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it a 10 if I could","review":"Way to go Al!

Well written, and genuinely funny (depending on your sense of humor).The most enjoyable passages were not the spot on attacks of these liars, but rather the well written assertions and defences of Left leaning values. That members of the Left are in fact patriotic, that we love our country as \\"grown-ups\\", able to apply critisicm and discourse when we feel our leaders have taken us down the wrong path.It's also nice to read that Al actually had a research team that knew how to properly use Lexis/Nexis (as opposed to Ann Coulter).

Well, unfortunately for Mr. Franken former President Bill Clinton has admitted that this is the absolute truth and that he regretted this over any thing else that happened in his administration. It appears he asked Janet Reno if we should accept the offer's from the Sudan and Reno's opinion was that we did not have the evidence to try him yet.

He looked like a cross-eyed toad with diaper rash.But I heartily recommend this book for pathetic liberals. I can't help but feeling sorry for a group in such disarray.

Apparently Mr. Franken fancies himself as some sort of Ann Coulter wannabe, only representing the liberal slant. Politics aside, Franken falls far short of Ms. Coulter's works. The writing is pathetic, the so-called facts are loose at best, and the self-promotion is sickening. Rather than promote the agenda of the left, Franken manages to twist the message into nothing but a hate fest of the right. A disgusting piece of drivel.

It is reprehensible that a book would be published on the lies committed by politicians on the right when it has been the left, namely Hitlary and Bill Clinton, that made it mainstream. But what do you expect - it is a completely socialist, Anti-Bush, Anti-War, left wing broadcasting media that give the Democrats a pass on integrity and honesty. All of that does not matter as long as you subscribe to their left wing pink communist beliefs. It has been said on so many occasions, Liberalism is a mental decease.

It was public knowledge he did this to John Ashcroft, amongst others.Look, Franken, unable to get his information legally, and finding no truthful information that will advance his Leninist agenda, will lie and make it up. Franken already issued an apology for doing this to Ashcroft and others. Like Linus Pauling said: I am not interested in your fantasies about experiments, I am interested in only one thing: What would the data lead us to believe?And the data tells us Franken is the liar.

Franken supplies a long list of details about this. It's pretty shocking.The Bushies dropped the ball in a major way, and have been trying to put the blame on Clinton ever since. If fact, as shown by Franken, Clinton had succesfully thwarted several major terrorist attacks, and was taking the Al Queda threat very seriously. It was Bush and his cronies who decided there was no threat (or even worse, who decided to let it happen for whatever self-serving reasons they might have had)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Would Be Even Funnier If It Weren't So Serious","review":"Al Franken is one of the funniest political commentators of our time, and he is also one of the most astute. Here he does a great job of what should have been done for years: skewering the pretensions and hypocrisies of the Radical Right machine which has seized control of the Republican Party and threatens to stage another coup d'etat in the guise of an election in 2004. Franken pulls no punches. His targets, whether the repellent Limbaugh or harpy Coulter or even the disgraceful W. himself, are skillfully dissected and revealed for the hypocrites and miserable worms that they are. And Franken does this with the most effective weapon there is, laughter. Not to be missed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lIes and the lying liars who tell them","review":"Al Franken is a master of satire. He exposes the vulgarity and pseudo-patriotism of Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. Most surprising is the reaction to the book from the right. This is a political satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is funny, but it will make you angry!","review":"Recently, Dubyah make a video where he goes around the White House looking for WMD. \\"Under here? Nope! Over there there? Nope!\\" He should take a comedy lesson from Al. Over 500 US soilders and countless others have lost their lives in Iraq, and he thinks it's funny. My theory is that he thought it was funny before the war even started. He is a child, a moron who had no business running for the presidency. Hopefully, this book and others like it will encourage people to get rid of this guy,and his cronies in the media! Thanks, Al!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...Like lambs to the slaughter","review":"I bought this book the morning it hit the shelves and finished about 100 pages in the first night. Other than being a well-researched, honest account of the endangered species known as 'fair and balanced' U.S. media, Al Franken's \\"Lies\\" exposes how many of us are easily led. The lies repeatedly spewed by Coulter, O'Reilly and the Fox News ilk (shamelessly headed by Aussie Rupert Murdoch and right-winger Roger Ailes) should be ridiculed and shamed, not bought into blindly. Once most Americans wise up and begin thinking critically, we can start the long overdue boycot of everything Fox and take our country back."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Can You Resist?","review":"Why would any sane person hesitate to purchase a book that exposes the jackals of fox news as what they really are! Franken has been a corner stone in comical social commentary for years, and hasn't failed to entertain and educate with every stroke of his pen. Its been too long since an author has managed to hack at the rotting core of politically biased media. I've found this book to be useful in reducing the dizziness caused by over spun press. For the good of the human race as a whole, BUY THIS BOOK!! and learn from it damn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is only good for fireplace kindling","review":"I stopped reading this lie-fest (lies told BY Franken and his \\"team\\") in the \\"Bush can't lose with Clinton's military\\" chapter, where Franken and his \\"team\\" lost all credibility with me when they called Reagan a \\"draft dodger who hated the military.\\" Reagan was not a draft dodger, he was a Second Lieutenant in the Officer's Reserve Corps who was declared ineligible to serve overseas due to near-sightedness. And hated the military? I'm actually surprised that Franken would be dumb enough to put THAT in his book. The person who dodged the draft, who used trickery and deception to avoid the draft, was none other than William Jefferson Clinton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent expose","review":"I really liked this book, at least the first two-thirds of it. Franken exposes much of the faulty research, misleading statements and agressive-yet-often-off-base argument style of the right - in a humorous way. My big criticism is that Franken went off the deep end in the last third of the book, venturing far, far left and destroying some of his credibility. He in fact starts to sound like some of the fanatical people he so enjoys tearing apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For Al","review":"I haven't finished the book, but I am enjoying every page thus far. It is a breath of fresh air to finally read something that I have been craving for over two years. The truth! While Al's satire sometimes gets tiresome, the content of his book is excellent and humorous. It doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator, which most people who enjoy reading, both conservative and liberal, are not.As an aside, the fox tag line 'We Report You Decide' turns out to be a lie. No mention of the dropped lawsuit on their web page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I truly loved Franken's latest book on righr-wing liars. As I read, I realized I had fallen for some of the lies he exposes and was happy to be disabused of my false ideas. His book combines solidly researched, well-documented content with his hilarious comic style--lots of biting irony peppered with occasional silliness. He takes down these liars in a methodical manner that just leaves no room for debate: Rush Limbaugh may be the big, fat, idiot, but Anne Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and even George Bush clearly think the rest of us are bigger idiots for listening to a word they say. I always took them with a grain of salt--now I won't take them at all. Franken has shown me what sneaky, pushy, lying, hypocrits they are and kept me chuckling along the way. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Funny book. I don't feel you can get an accurate look at a politic issue from the far left or right. This book is more for laughs. I'm glad to see another comedian bring humor to politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why doesn't Al Franken have his own show?","review":"Al Franken is more mature, honest, and tolerant than most representing the right. He's a proven good entertainer and has a great sense of humor. As you can see by the bestsellers list in books, he's consistently above books such as O'Riley's and his book has a higher rating. So, why hasn't any network asked him to do a show? I'll tell you why, because CEO's and corporations are conservative by nature and people like Franken pose a threat to their agenda. It's sad.By the way, one of the liars posted on the cover, Bill O'Riley happened to get caught lying about the Fox News lawsuit. First he denied having anything to do with the suit and then later stated that he didn't regret pressuring Fox to sue Al. How ironic that he lied about suing for being called a liar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, the truth FINALLY!!!!!!","review":"Loved this book and he had alot of support for what he wrote, not the lies like in Treason or O'Reilly. loved this book and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"I agree this book is very entertaining, but I'd much rather spend my time reading a more uplifting book like The Dittohead Guide To Adult Beverages. Franken makes some good points and the book itself is wrought with a number of one-liners and witty retorts. But Franken's outlook is too pessimistic. He lets republicans get under his skin. He should be more confident. The world will not come to an end if George Bush wins re-election."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth will set us free","review":"Funny, engaging, pointed and - importantly - meticulously researched, Franken's book exposes the Bush Administration and its fringe-right-wing supporters in the media (Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity and the whole gang at Fox News, the Washington Times and the WSJ Editorial staff) for the cycnical liars they are. While entertained, I was also frankly frightened by the clear threat to our civil liberties and our livelihood that Bush and his big-business cronies represent.Whether you are Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative or moderate... I believe it is our responsibility as Americans to read this book and learn the truth!Al Franken has made a valuable contribution to the protection of American democracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stick to comedy gags Al.","review":"In my honest opinion, Al Franken reached his intellectual zenith as the stoned, bumbling baggage handler in Trading Places. It's been a steep descent since, and this latest book of his only makes this fact more obvious and sad. A few paragraphs were mildly humorous, but nothing that'll cause spontaneous coffee discharge from your favorite orifice. If you want humor, pass this one over and read Dave Barry. If you want incessant, hate-charged ranting from a kooky leftist who still believes the 21st century began on 1/1/2000, then this is your book.He's NOT good enough...he's NOT smart enough, and DOGGONIT, people are starting to DISLIKE him."},{"rating":"1","title":"stuff","review":"I am not surprised. There are a number of typical problems with this tome. First, Franken does not provide an indepth and insightful review of the issues. Franken does not offer any keen solutions. Rather, he writes a polemic that reads more like a raving mad speech from Hitler than a scientific, philosphical or political review. Second, Franken relies on insult and name calling when referring to his political opponents. The reader clearly can tell he not only disagrees with his political opponents but he also hates them, and this enrages his soul. Finally, because the vast majority of his general topics are stated in platitudinal form and the vast majority of his particular comments ring of demogoguery rather than logical argument, Franken fails to present a persuasive argument.In conclusion, this book fails to make any substantial or even trivial contribution to the liberal cause and for that reason I strongly recommend avoiding it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Stinks!","review":"Garbage, pure garbage. The only thing that was good about this book is that I did not have to pay for it. I borrowed it from the library...and promply returned it. I am sure this will keep landfills in business for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"look at the idiots who recommend this garbage","review":"Big Al Franken..lousey writer..4rth rate comedian, and homosexual icon.the further rantings of a prissy, angry, homosexual...look at some of the books recommended by people who enjoy Franken's drivel...books on militant homosexuality and anti- God bombast."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money and time","review":"I don't care about right or left wing. I like Al Franken because he is a funny comedian. But this book is just a total junk! There is no useful material or even funny material in this book. He just writes about his experiences about different events like meeting Barbara Bush in a plane or writing to people about premarital sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franken's Folly","review":"It only gets 2 stars for a couple of good one-liners. Everyone likes a good joke. The problem is there are only a couple of good one-liners. The rest of the time you will spend laughing at this book not along with it.Al Franken leans so far to the left he can't tie his right shoe. Any validity to his points is overwhelmed by his obvious bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrite with a capital H","review":"Apparently, Al Franken thinks that it is ridiculous for anyone else to \\"mud-sling\\" or focus on the negatives rather than the positives, except for himself. Every fact in his book comes from a biased source or no source at all. I bought this book as a wavering independent eager to hear about the so called \\"right-wing conspiracy.\\" All that I learned by reading it was that whoever gave Al Franken an occupation where he could rant about his pompous liberal views lacks some very necessary intelligence. This novel is simply two hundred pages for Franken to complain about people who do much less to belittle our country's justice system than he."},{"rating":"2","title":"its about time someone stuck it to the cable news channels","review":"In the last ten years the cable news channels have manufactured scandals during the clinton years(whitewater,\\"travelgate\\",mark rich and even monica)while ignoring more serious matters during the dubya years(the stealing of election 2000, the saudi connections,haliburton,enron ties to bush,energy task force,etc.)Most glaring among the biased media outlets has been the so called fair and balanced FNC, although other newa outlets have also been biased.Thus it comes as a relief to see that someone to the left of the Republican National Committee is finally willing to fight back,albeit in a humorous way. Since liberals are routinely portrayed, even in the New York Times as down on their knees and out for the count, it is good to see the fiesty Al Franken take his shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but......","review":"I love Al Franken and his humor but like the people he rips in his book he avoids some very real facts about the economy, job losses etc...(the times make the man, the man never makes the times) some items are just a waste of time like Bill O'Reilly growing up in Levittown ( I know O'Reilly plays games with facts), the reality is he grew up in the Levitt section of Westbury an area with comparable demographics etc...seems hardly worth even addressing let alone writing about. Left/Right its all slanted. This is a funny read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good comic relief","review":"Mr. Franken is foremost a comedian, and his credentials are more closely aligned with comedy than fiction, although this is moderately well written.His arguments are very baseless, and I actually had to fight off putting the book down for good.The real target market for this book, in my opinion, is any left-wing reader who wants a little reinforcement for his views, and K-3rd graders.I enjoyed Mr. Franken on Saturday Night Live; he \\"left\\" me with this tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"why would anyone read this leftist book put out by a low-end entertainer? too many of the hypocrites think we care about what they say. he should give away most of his belongings to the poor and move to sweden."},{"rating":"1","title":"More pablum from an amateur","review":"Regardless of your political leanings, this book is not worth your money. I was lured in because of all the press the book got from the law suit. Do not make the same mistake. Absolutely nothing of worth contained within the covers. If you are thinking of buying this book for the laughs, think again. Fox's lawsuit was silly, but they got one thing right. Franken is never, ever funny. Really, he has never, ever been funny.He's not good enough, he's not smart enough and gosh darnit, his book is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to read","review":"Too few people would read a book that did nothing but expose some of the shamelessly dishonest liars in the right-wing media and the current administration. But a lot of people are going to read this one because it is funny, too. The book does nothing major, just takes the time to examine statements, compare them to facts, and demonstrate falsehoods in the author's relentlessly amusing fashion. My appreciation to Al Franken and I wish we had more like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and a Liar Who Tells Them: Franken","review":"This book is the biggest lie in the world, written by a liar who has no life and no character. Don't buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fair and balanced","review":"This is a great book for anyone who has been actively following politics in the last 5-10 years, whether they are liberal, like Franken, moderate or conservative. It lives up to the claim of being well reserched and completely fact, however Franken interjects jokes throughout the book that make you wonder what is fact and what is just a joke. Although that softens his punch some, you cant deny that he pokes large holes through many of the conservative arguments and just plainly makes some conservative's policies and actions look downright stupid.An absolute must read for anyone at all interested in todays politics"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly funny look at right-wing propagandists","review":"Why am I laughing so hard at a book that points out how Americans are being lied to every day by performers/propagandists posing as journalists or otherwise as purveyors of the truth. The fact is that Al Franken has a keen eye and wry humor in reporting and refuting the ridiculous effusions emanating from the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Anne Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and other right-wing propagandists, including the current administration. It is disquieting to realize, though, that important issues may be decided on the basis of votes guided by these lies.The effectiveness of the book is indicated by the number of semiliterate and inarticulate yawps and fulminations it has attracted from what are, I assume, conservatives of some stripe. None of these offers much to refute any specific points in the book, which is the usual sort of response one gets from people who apparently don't read what they attack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please give this book a chance.","review":"I knoew you all have been proagandized by Rush Limbaw and The Twentieth \\"Centrury Fox NEws Channel, but we need to give this book a chance.t hear Al Franken out.THis book is well reasearched, sicen he write it while he was a fellow at HArvard John F.

Funny and seems to be well researched, (By a team of Harvard Grads and Undergrads). It really puts the conservative spin on the \\"liberal media\\" into perspective. Being a die hard liberal, I hate the media and since it's supposedly so far on the left, I'm not too impressed with the bleeding hearts that seem to be making the neo-conservatives ears bleed. Too many \\"moderate\\" pundits use yelling and bullying as a debate device to push their conservative agenda across, it's nice to see Franken use actual stats, and research rather than he said she said nonsense and second hand information. I can see how exposing the great right lie, will get so many Republicans screaming for his head. It's entertaining, informative, and makes you realize the media is truly on the left, I mean your other left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious and informative","review":"It is truly shocking to learn how much lying goes on in our media. I hope more books like this one come out and expose even more.

If nothing else, it does encourage readers to check his sources. It's not unlike the difference between science and religion -- if you allow me to doublecheck your reasoning and the results are reproduceable, it's science. If I'm supposed to take your proclamations on faith alone, it's religion. Both will have their converts, usually equally vociferous. The only difference will be the average level of intelligence -- which is evident in reading the reviews for this book, as well as Ms. Coulter's.I'm not saying he's right in every instance. I merely ask you to convince me otherwise, with proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I'm Important too.","review":"Instead of wretching at this title, I feel a bit of pity at this man. Stealing both the background and the \\"fair and balanced\\", it's clear seriousness isn't his biggest trait.

For example when he says that Coulter would phrase something this way. He says what he wants to say but doesn't document it in the guise of humor.

Al Fanken attacks the right for a majority of reasons that have no meaning and are stupid, like Ann Coulter calling someone a son and not grandson. While at the same time defend Gore for inventing the internet. The most moving chapter in the book is the one about Paul Wellstone denouncing smear campaigns and the evil involved with them. But the book is a smear campaign, hence the irony. The overwhelming message is not that the right is a lying machine, but that politics should not be about berating and lying about your contenders but about the people you represent.

What I found was a multitude of lies and cheap shots. Al Franken even failed at being funny, as his jokes mainly consist of swearing at people.I tried to give this a fair chance; I really did. However, a man who finds the New York Times to be 100% objective and finds Fox News to be so right-wing that it's fascist has some serious issues. His writing is on the level of Michael Moore's (that is to say, horrible and full of lies and slander).You would think a book that pruportes to be a \\"Fair and balanced look at the right\\" would do more than just insult everyone with whom he does not agree.If you wish to read a liberal who knows how to write and actually is funny, check out Bill Maher.

At times his material is crass, and questionable, but I do enjoy his sense of humor (some of the times)His visit to Bob Jones university just seemed out of place, and really depicted him as something of a bully looking for a fight. Ironically, hearing his treatment of BJU caused me to look into them more, research, then their homeschool curriculum and actually start using it, so in an indirect way I'm thankful to Franklin, but again, I don't understand why he included Bob Jones unless he was using mockery of people of faith for \\"laughs\\" in his book. Not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny At All","review":"I am so glad I chose not to attend Harvard University.Team Franken, Al's group of young and ambitious Harvard students, lacks actual research skills. In there attempt to rebuke Ann Coulter they only site one error from her latest book and call her a B**CH. Had they been taught research skills, they would have dug-up enough information to burry Ann. Instead they chose to throw a few ad-hominems at her.The book is not a hard read. At least it is not meant to be. However, one easily finds oneself rereading certain lines in an attempt to get the punch line of a joke. There were too many that were almost funny, but not quite. Al, at least on paper, is loosing his comedic touch.Overall, if you are a liberal who hates Bush and Coulter, you are bound to at least like this title.

There is little if any evidence to back up the Lies that franking mentions, probably less that in \\"Treason\\" Also, it is most assuradly not a fair and balanced look at the right, but a slanderous attackon it.

He assembles a group of willing Harvard students with his same agenda and seeks to ridicule everything and everyone with whom he disagrees. Childish and sophomoric. Read his piece on Bob Jones University. After our sophomore year in high school most of us learn to stop ridiculing and teasing people we don't understand.

Liberals like Franken refuse to confront their own dark sides.

The same kind of thing happens when you show Democrats a videotape of the Ron Brown funeral where Clinton is yukking it up, catches the camera, and feigns tears. Democrats will swear up and down that's not what happened even when confronted with reality. The problem with Al Franken and most Democrats is that they're not thinkers, more like emotional reactionaries. They just want to \\"do something\\" for \\"the children\\". Any decent conservative can dismantle Franken's arguments in about five minutes because like most Democrats, he is afraid of facts. I think Franken did better work as one of the worst Saturday Night Live performers ever. The most hilarious outcome of this book is the \\"liberals get tough\\" act.

As his liberalism has become increasingly strident and increasingly left wing, it seems that his charm, wit, and appeal have diminished to the level of a sledgehammer. What a tragedy. This book collects some of Franken's more vitriolic rants in one handy-dandy collection for the wild-eyed, frothy-mouthed, zombie-like Bush-bashers to enjoy. If Al Franken wants to see a lying liar, he only needs to look in the mirror...Stewart Smalley he is not.

It certainly was not to inform or offer any positive solution. Like so many new books today by name recognized people, only a few come to mind that truly inform and offer solutions to some of the problems America faces. Catherine Crier is one of those authors. Nothing against you personally, Mr. Franken, but your book needs to be dumped in favor of Ms. Crier's.

I rarely laugh out loud when reading a book, but Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them had me in stitches. In fact, I don't think I've laughed this hard since Franken's Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot. His beginning chapters on Ann Coulter are incredulous and hilarious. It's amazing how that woman ever got any air time nor a book deal. His chapter on Fox News Network's stranglehold of the conservative media is downright disturbing. In truth, this book should be required reading for liberals as well as ultra-conservatives. It will make you think. I admit that I'm more of a liberal though I do support conservative issues. However, after reading this book, i'm ready to jump headfirst towards the left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conservatives, take note!","review":"Another gem from Al Franken! Possibly even better than \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot\\"!...I can't believe that I'm the first person reviewing it.A couple observations:1. Unlike recent works by Conservative zealots, this book's actually funny. Likewise, it's not just diatribe, preaching to the choir (which is the ONLY possible reason for reading books by the likes of Hannity, Limbaugh, Coulter et al.--right wing wackos praise what these people have to say because it's exactly what they already \\"knew\\"). No, there's actually verifiable facts here, with sources. I think anyone reading this (Conservative or Liberal) will laugh out loud throughout the entire read!2. CONSERVATIVES TAKE NOTE: I repeat, there's verifiable facts here (which is how Conservative books should be written), exposing the liars for what they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cons are Running the Prison","review":"I had never heard of Al Franken before I picked this book up on a whim while waiting for a flight to Tokyo. The language is a bit strong, but the work is excellent and thorough.I read it back to back with Paul Krugman'sThe Great Unraveling: Losing Our Way in the New Century (Updated and Expanded). The two read like chapters of the same book, The Enron Presidency.Economists and forensic accountants will make careers over the next few decades unraveling the fraud Franken describes. The brilliance of using the government itself to run a trillion dollar sting is breath-taking. Having been in the fraud detection business myself, I was deeply impressed by Team Franken's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Left strikes back","review":"I have been an admirer of Franken for some time, so I went into this book with high expectations. He and his team of researchers met those expectations. His book seems very well researched, although I honestly did not bother to do any further research to check out his footnotes. His book is even funnier than Bushwacked. I sincerely hope his book and the Ivin's Dubose book begin the avalanche that results in the defeat of Dubya come November '04"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to SNL","review":"Al Franken is a gifted comedy writer.

Sure enough, hes' right...there are no footnotes....they're actually endnotes. She misspoke......so he calls her a liar! And, of course, that makes everything that she says and writes a lie!

North Korea may not be practical some of the time and maybe some unbridled individuals must be sacrificed for the common good, but North Korea sure is moral! I also think they have a right to have nuclear weapons and even use them if Bush and his cronies threaten them.Here's another lie!

I think he could have omited the Chickenhawk chapter. Unlike most of the people who gave it bad reviews, I have actually read this book. I have also read Coulter and O'Reilly. This one is much better and more entertaining. I think the chapter on the Wellstone memorial was very well done and is an excellent illustration of how the Republican Ministry of Propaganda and its cult of dittoheads will use any means to gain and keep power.

The author primarily explores the myth of \\"liberal media bias\\" and concludes that any bias in the media is one of generally laziness, in its frequent failure to report facts, verify stories, and agressively explore issues in depth. Only gets four stars for being too short! (Check out Greg Palast's \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy\\" for a meatier examination of the corporate-led, anit-democractic global domination of conservative elites. )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep in mind what you are reading.","review":"This is an exceptionally funny book. It is entertaining, well written, and a fairly light read. Even though it is fairly well documented, and although one may not always agree with his particular views, Frankin does a good job of supporting most of what he says. However, it is NOT an academic monograph on the state of political discourse in the United States. It is meant as satire, and it clearly is, just as Jonathan Swift was clearly writing satirically in A Modest Proposal in 1729. Keep some perspective and you'll proably learn more from this book than you will from spending the 6 hours it will take to read it watching CNN or, God forbid, Fox News."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't feel alone anymore","review":"This is a fantastic book! His chapter on \\"Loving America the Al Franken Way\\" put to words how I have been feeing since September 11. I love America.

I'm sending a copy to my sister in the Peace Corps, and a friend in Denver.Although, I might have done without the \\"Operation Chickhawk\\" chapter.

He is sharp and quick. Read it and lend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure he's biased, but he does his homework","review":"Fans of Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and Bernie Goldberg NEED to read this book instead of simply dismissing it as a \\"smear book\\" (that's how they refer to it on The Factor---I guess they don't want to aid his sales by saying the name). If I were a fan of any of them, I'd like to think that I admired their points of view because it was based on fact, not lies and distortions. This book points out where these people are often wrong. One of my favorites was reading Ann Coulter's attack on the New York Times for failing to mention Dale Earnhard's death. Franken reproduces the front page of the NYT from the day after he died where, suprise!, there's an article about his life and death. It's blatant lies like that that make me wonder why people engage in intellectual dishonesty. Why not base your opinion on fact instead of distortions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and revealing","review":"Some of Al Franken's television humor does not appeal to me.

I thought the title was a bit biased, however I read the book. If you are into left wing propaganda and lies, without any evidence this is the book for you. I think Franken is far worse than anyone that he reviews in his book. For instance his chapter on Ann Coulter is entitled Ann Coulter: Nutcase. And then he proceeds to tell you that she is a liar since she used end notes instead of footnotes, and she had so many of them that she was obviously lying.If you can find humor in a very poorly documented book that calls everyone else a liar without producing any evidence, this book full of useless diatribe is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a Joke!","review":"Typical \\"lefty\\" book....all bashing and no solutions.

Al successfully disputes many of the basic arguments of the conservative media. Argues several good points that credit liberals / Clinton administration. Critics accuse Al of name calling but he is only doing what Rush, Hannity, Ann and others have done for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor With A Bite","review":"Why does it take a humorist to reveal truths about ourselves and society? This investigation into the perverse manner by which extremists have hijacked public discourse is a bit sad because Al Franken lampoons behaviors that clearly illuminate the destructive impulses of the so-called conservatives. Hmm...I guess my age is showing when I think of Republican conservatives as people like Rockefeller, Weichert or those in the Ripon Society.When one looks beyond the humor that Al Franken brings to the subject, what he discusses is alarming. More than that, once awakened to the mendacious (aka lying) ways of the people who seem to believe that they have the pipeline to the truth, I feel that they have stolen our democracy. After reading this book I am more aware of how Son of Bushlips distorts the truth and brandishes the flag to conceal his shortcomings and those of the conservatives who support him.Al Franken's book is a real page turner with biting humor that doesn't let up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Republicans Stipped Naked and Exposed","review":"for all of America to see. And it isn't pretty. Imagine Rush Limbaugh naked. Now, imagine Rush Limbaugh naked, attempting to come at you from behind. That's what he and other Neocons have been doing, giving you the Bum's Rush. From Rupert Murdoch's cleaning out of liberals at Fox News (save one wimp doormat, hand picked by his loudmouth and obnoxious Neocon co-host as just the man to be the lone \\"liberal\\" at Fox) to the truth about how they twisted a funeral into a political talking point, the facts in this book can't be argued nor denied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pitiful","review":"A more clueless lib may never be found. & the fact that he keeps a straight face is to his DETRIMENT. =P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly funny.","review":"This book is already very dated. Mildy amusing, very insular view on American political to-ing and fro-ing as to why the Democrats and liberal types are the civilised choice and why the Republicans and right wing media types are full of it and homourless....supposedly. He targets Bill O'Reilly, Bush and Rush Limbaugh, hardly very difficult. If you don't read the American media and watch Fox constantly you'll be left high and dry. Lots of stunts and gags throughout, like when Franken sends his son to hassle people in a Christian college who believe different things than he does. He includes his own Liberal lies and myths eg: Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. Ultimately it's all partisan politics regardless of which side you're on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Leftist Spin Doctors Fantasy","review":"If you were looking for a book that tells the \\"truth\\" about the lies of the right, well all I can say is this book isn't where you'll find them.

A great book for the uneducated, mind numb robots on the left who believe anything written as long as it fits their agenda. The author was better and more believeable as Stuart Smally on SNL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Political viewpoints of the writer","review":"Great book to read during the political election process yjay is as comical as the process itself. Almost like a required reading to keep one's composure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Frivolous Junk","review":"Hypocrisy is never attractive, and Franken leads the mob in unhumorous attacks on anything vaguely anti-Democratic Party or anti-Left Wing. He would be better served, for example, if he used extensive footnotes ala Ann Coulter, or if he indicated where her sources and quotes were either fictional or incorrect. Obviuosly, Franken would rather attempt to be cute instead of utilizing reseach and quoting his sources. And the snippet on Vietnam??? That was 30 years ago and initiated by a Democratic president. Best feature of the book is that it was given to me, and I didn't have to contribute money to either Franken or his publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get RENEWED!!","review":"This was an interesting concept but unfortunately the ideas offer little insight and no action plans for positive solutions.

How hilarious is it that left wing liberal morons in this country actually take this book serious?He \\"documents\\" his \\"facts\\" in the book with a whopping 5 pages of notes.

Check out www.frankenlies.com to see a long list of factual inaccuracies in this joke of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and informative, admit it!","review":"Reminder to all conservative readers. This book serves two main purposes: to entertain, and to inform. Don't confuse the two in your responses.The entertainment value is extremely high, but of course extremely biased. If you're a conservative, you're supposed to hate it. So, because he has successfully produced the response he wanted from you, you owe Al better reviews.The information however, is fact-based, and so far has not been contested. What better way to debunk Al's claims (and insults for that matter) than to contest his facts and information? It's admittedly hard to get past the insults if you're a fan of Al's victims, but for those of you who can, how about a review of the other half of the book? There are major points made on pratically every page. So are they true, or aren't they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The proof is in the reviews","review":"This book is a devastating inditement of the right wing. The important point is that the book as well as being funny takes great care to stick to the facts and argument to make it points - rather than innuendo, assumption and slander. No doubt that in a book full of thousands of facts, one or two mistakes will slip through, but he makes astute and logical analyses of many of the most pressing issues of our political times. As if to prove his point, the 1 starred reviews on this site display the same hysterical rants as his targets. If you are a right-winger who believes everything Ann Coulter says then you will not enjoy this book, on the other hand if you are a patriot of intelligence(right wing or left wing) who cares about this country, then you must read this book and then you can make up your own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have you actually read the book?","review":"I've just gone through reading 8 pages of the reviews, just to see what people are saying. In 96% of all the negative reviews, there is no mention of specific discrepancies toward Franken's allegations, just vague comments. It leads me to believe that it's not even being read by those who have chosen to take the time to log on and write a negative review on something they've never read. Come on be honest. There's no way you could walk into a Barnes and Noble and even hold that book for more than a minute, much less fork over your hard earned money. I bought it and I was just waiting for the cashier to look at me odd or have someone in line spit on me. It never happened, I bought it late at night when the crowds were lighter. Anyway, Good Book! I recommend. How's that for a review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Although not quite as funny as \\"Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot\\" Al Franken's newest book is another example of hysterical writing backed up with well researched political commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I'm not old enough to vote yet, but old enough to read the book. Mr. Franken is bitter man. I never read so much hate. There is not much in this book that I liked, and there isn't really much evidence that all the people he hates are liars. I think people need to support the President."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fitting Title","review":"After purchasing this book, I found it odd that Franken LIED to Ashcroft in an attempt to obtain material for the book itself, then formally apologized for his LIES. In an easily found-on-the-net letter, Al apologizes for fraudulently claiming he had received abstinence stories from people like Condi Rice for his book (a simple google search will turn it up if you're really interested in TRUTH). Somehow now I find it difficult to take anything Franken says as gospel after that. In fact, the title of the book is a perfect description of the author. Consider this carefully before reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More cheese with your whine, sir?","review":"Just another in a series of whinings from the left. Al Franken takes small points and blows them into major issues. Anyone with a brain knows that in order to maintain the views held by the average liberal, lying is vital. Yet, Mr. Franken feels that pointing fingers at conservatives is the best way to cover his own tracks. Maybe it works with some people, but hopefully most will see him for what he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shocked Liberal","review":"Wow ... I sit here shocked and dismayed. This book and its author is the central reason the progressive movement in this country is faltering. I was hoping to see some glimmer of sense and humor from Mr Franken in this book (call me naive), but all I was subjected to was an endless barrage of closed-minded political drivel, blatant half truths, and hate-filled rhetoric. There is enough repulsion in this book to drive away any thinking person from our cherished left. It serves only to tear down whatever moral and ethical advantage we held, and will certainly do nothing to convince those in the middle to join our causes - in fact, the vast middle will most likely begin marching right immediately after putting down this book. Many thanks Mr Franken, for making us all look like biased, hateful, ignorant ideological drones instead of the enlighted, caring citizens we are - well, most of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Negative reviews from rightwing ostriches no surprise","review":"As has been pointed out, the difference between Al Franken and the likes of Ann Coulter is simple: facts which can be verified (Al), and lies which can be verified (Ann). Those who hate this book simply hate hearing the truth; when you build your thinking around lies, it's very unpleasant to have the rug pulled out from under you. Unfortunately, instead of doing the smart thing by joining in the criticism of the hacks on the right who have destroyed true political discourse, these misguided folks choose to perpetuate their irrational bile. I've never had a problem having a good argument with a thoughtful, intelligent conservative. Unfortunately, such folks appear to be verging on extinction.As far as the book goes, it is extremely informative (facts), extremely entertaining (deflation of lying pompous blowhards) and extremely sad and frightening (how willing people are to accept lies as truth)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Often silly, and terrific","review":"Yeah, it's brimming with sarcasm and that uniquely Frankenish quasi-self-regard. It's also impressively well-researched, convincing, and compelling. Most of all it spills over with an impassioned indignation that's a balm to the soul of anyone who agrees that our nation is up to its nostrils in mesquite-flavored mendacity.Great book. Buy six. Helluva stocking stuffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This is a good read for those of us in political middle. Al Franken is a liberal and he is bashing the far right. The best parts are when he shows how the right lies. The worst parts are his reports on some confrontations because you know it was an ambush and they were unprepared.The story about how we believed that Al Gore said he invented the internet makes me feel gullible. (He said he helped create it -- by sponsoring the funding)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Defining Career Moment","review":"I'll admit it. Franken isn't as funny as he was in his SNL prime. But laugh out-loud humor isn't what this book is about. We liberals are really lucky to have our Al Frankens and people of that ilk to keep hope alive in the last 4 years. I agree with some other people on here. Franken for president, absolutely. He should at least help campaign for whoever the democratic nominee is. And yes, I do live in Texas. Amazing, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Franken Masterpiece","review":"Good Job Al. In the age of misinformation by rupert murdoch's fake news channel, rev. moon's washington time, and chalabi's briefings of bush white house of horror, this work is as informative as it is entertaining. As right wing fascists like Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh chose to be Nazi propagandists, it is refreshing to see a different voice, a voice of reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth your time","review":"This book points out the lies of conservative pundits. It pays special attention to Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and Bill O'Reilly. O'Reilly once violently threatened a man who lost his father in 9-11 because the man didn't support the war in Iraq. He then went on to spread lies about the man. This book has a transcript of Hannity lying about Al Gore. This book was not as funny as Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot. It has a more serious tone. It does have alot of funny parts though. I especially liked the cartoon Supply Side Jesus. Some reviewers don't seem to understand that Franken's subtitle A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right was meant to be ironic. The Fox news network uses the slogan Fair and Balanced. They then go on to be blatantly biased against democrats. Fox tries to make democrats look as dumb as they can. Franken doesn't mean for this book to be fair. He was making a joke and giving conservatives a taste of their own medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty stale book","review":"I was hugely disappointed by this book. It just isn't that funny. Franken has a smug mannerism and his constant reference to his army of fact checkers was annoying. Well, the fact checkers didn't do that great of a job - he listed the Sanyo company as Korean. I bet they were surprised to hear that at the company head office in Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!

The cartoon alone is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO FUNNY!","review":"I have always thought Al Franken was pretty funny but he has outdone himself here. He blows the lid off of FAUX news channel and all of the right wingers that lie. I was reading this book in a coffee shop and kept laughing so loudly and randomly that evryone kept glancing at me like I was crazy. I finally had to go home and finish reading because I couldn't stop laughing out loud. The chapter on Paul Wellstone is really very moving, too. Not to sound cheesy but it actually made me cry. Thats pretty impressive when a comedian has that much control over his readers, prompting moments of great joy and laughter as well as some really moving moments. WAY TO GO AL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SNL meets NPR...","review":"Even though the book attempts to be a political thesis, it comes out more like a comedy sketch.

The only problem with this book is that the people who could benefit from it the most -- i.e., people who get their news from Rush Limbaugh and Fox News -- will never read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franken exposes the Bushies for what they are!","review":"I loved this book and greatly appreciate the alternate view of things, that Mr. Franken posits. Heaven knows that our conservative-slanted media won't do anything but stick behind the boy they allowed to quietly assume the role he was never elected for. After all, it took his brother (governor's) help and the support of his daddy-appointed, supreme court justices to sneak him into office. This administration and the fools who back it are all LIARS who don't follow what's really going on. Great job Al Franken and the team from Harvard! I salute you as a true American. Only we true Americans know what's really going on! For you Bush backers, WAKE UP from your Walmart-shopping stupor! He's only using you for votes whilst he erodes our tax base and environmental and domestic policies to help out the super rich. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job at discrediting liars, but...","review":"While Al Franken is doing what the title implies- picking apart lies and propaganda from particular right wing figures- he's great. Showing Ann Coulter is a liar may not take a genius to do, but few people can do it with Franken's level of wit. But when he commentates on the larger political picture, and issues not tied to individual people, Franken is just another partisan. It's not that he's a Michael Moore style, sensationalism-over-sense jerk. He's more reasonable than that. But he usually fails to rise above or add much unique perspective to the common complaints and positions of the left. And speaking of Moore, I would really like a book that discredits lies through satire but includes a few left-wing extremists in the crossfire as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced","review":"Was this book written by an adult? I watch a lot of news for a 12 year old and I know I could have done a better job than the author of this book. There are no facts, just a lot of whining. I think the author needs to find another type of job. Maybe working in a circus. It might cheer him up and give the rest of us a good laugh. I definitely do not recommend this book to anyone. Child or adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better have a strong stomach to take this book...","review":"I found this book to be a little too droning for my taste. I liked Al's book on Rush Limbaugh. And the first few chapters of this book concerning Fox News and Bill O'Reilly are enjoyable, but the later 2/3 of the book are just hard to read. Al's shrill anti-conservative rant comes across as anything but fair and balanced. Liberal inaccuracies and falsehoods are downplayed as everyone is human and can make mistakes, and who could remember those arcane statistics anyway. While any minor mis-quote or inaccuracy on the part of a conservative is labelled as a LIE and a calculated campaign to discredit the left and deceive the American public. I find it very hard to believe that every Democrat and every liberal is pure and altruistic while every Republican and conservative are an evil horde bent on the total destruction of mankind. Give me a break. There are very few books that I put down and never finish.

I couldn't put it down. First of all, I was laughing harder than I've ever laughed for political satire, and I had at least two good laughs on every page. Secondly, Franken blows big gaping holes in the arguements and even the ideas of modern day neo-conservative icons such as Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reily, Bernie Goldberg, Sean Hannity and the rest of those Media Elite who are constantly screaming and griping about the Media Elite. Really, if every hard core republican would read this book, and check the facts, they would undoubtably at least have to abandon their party (if not their ideals). A good laugh for liberals, a good education for conservatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book","review":"I finally stopped watching the Fox News Channel in 2004. I just couldn't take it anymore, I would listen to these people spouting off this ridiculous awful stuff and get so angry. Sometimes it seems like the world has gone crazy - can't people see what is really happening here? Do the people at the Fox News Channel think all Americans are stupid? Do people look at the Fox News Channel from other countries and think it means all Americans are like that? Franken's book was like a vindication. I laughed and laughed and got a huge kick out of it.One point remains clear - politicians and journalists and voters and even Amazon reviewers are human beings. Dig long and hard enough, and you can make anybody out to be an idiot or a liar or worse. (Some people can do this to themselves without any help from anyone.) As soon as people start slinging mud, it detracts from the issues. Most of us basically want the same things, like freedom and security, so let's focus on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franken tells it like it is","review":"Absolutely the best book I've read in years.I couldn't put it down! Franken exposes the hate & hypocrisy of the rabid-right disinformation machine and manages to do so with biting humor and wit.Meticulously researched. If your politics lean to the Left you'll LOVE it! Should be required reading for right-wingers - it just might open their eyes (of course they'd have to open their minds a little first)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I always wonder why we see one Al Franken book for every two or three from someone like Sean Hannity or Ann Coulter. Now I know why! It takes longer to actually do research rather than just mis-speak, mis-quote and mis-represent!Al Franken unravels some of the myths and downright lies that others continue to repeat. How any person who considers themselves a journalist can NOT do the same is amazing to me.Al's book is an enjoyable read, but tended to depress me all the same, because it is not a hopeful sign when we see that the people that get the most airtime in the media show no social conscience about what information they spread to the masses.If you want to know the truth about how the 'right' operates, then read this book. If you just want to hide your head in the sand and let life happen then don't bother - it would probably be above you anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could read this over and over again!","review":"There are too many ignorant people who don't want to listen to the real facts about the right-wing conspiracy that is going on in this country (you know who you are). Instead, they prefer to live in their own fantasyland, where conservatives are the good guys and those who are against their views are the enemy. I'm glad Al Franken came out with this book just to shut them the hell up and for those morons to face FACTS!! Bush is a horrible President, Cheney is evil, Rove is malicious, and the right-wing brown-noses that do his bidding, plus the nutcases that support his actions, are the ones that deserve to be detained in Guantanamo Bay (I know it sounds extreme, but I can't help it). Great job, Al. Keep exposing these sociopaths for the frauds they really are. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enlightening and humorous look at the right","review":"As much as I love the wit and writing of Al Franken, He owes the success fo this book to the right-wing lunatics who cannot keep their lies straight and perpetuate them over and over without one shred of evidence. As a independent voter for the most part I was amazed that more of these points haven't been exposed before by the \\"liberal\\" media. After reading this book I did a lot of web surfing and reading of manuscripts on the sites that were cited in the book. I found the book was supported by the transcripts and Franken didn't just excerpt parts to make it look bad for the \\"bushies\\". Great work by a admittedly liberal to print the truth as well as some admitted funny lies. Great book!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposing the Hypocrites of the Right--Like Bill O'Reilly","review":"The best thing about this book is exposing Bill O'Reilly as a total hypocrite. O'Reilly attacks rap music and popular culture for being too vulgar when he has written a book (as Franken reveals) called \\"None Shall Trespass\\"--a fiction written by Bill about a TV journalist (!) who is a serial killer. The book has graphic violence and graphic sexual situations as well. It seems O'Reilly doesn't follow his own rules--so much for \\"No Spin\\". The book also exposes Fox News, Ann Coulter, Bill \\"Vegas\\" Bennett, and our own commander in chief Dubya to be the mean spirited right wingers that they are. Funny funny stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny AND Smart","review":"I confess that I prefer Franken's \\"Limbaugh\\" book, because that was funnier, and there are a lot of darker essays here--but I suppose that's because we live in darker days. Still, Franken brilliantly combines the intelligent if pedantic style of Joe Conason (\\"Big Lies\\") and the in-your-face ad hominems of Jason Johnson (\\"I Hate Bush and So Do You\\"). Republicans who criticize the book for not being even-handed apparently overlook the fact that Al Franken backs up his statements with FACTS, which, I also noticed, the Bush defenders don't deny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Al","review":"Thank you Al for speaking for the vast majority of Americans. Thank you for exposing Bush, Coulter, Limbaugh, Cheney and all the rest of the liars for who they really are. Thank you for educating the public on how the right wants to keep the poor out of the gated communities, and make the rich even richer. Who would Jesus bomb? If Bush is a Christian has he not read the ten commandments? The world has not seen this sort of Nationalistic propoganda from the right since the days of Hitler. Thank you Al for giving us hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Fresh Air","review":"A witty and poignant answer to the extreme right wing propoganda of people like Coulter, O'Reilly, Limbaugh, and Hannity. Franken's sense of humor is what makes him so much more palatable than the aforementioned ranters and ravers. When he gets into some name calling he descends to their level, but for the most part the book is brilliant, funny, and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop being brainwashed by people","review":"This book shows you that believing everything that you see or read, without questioning it or investigating it makes you part of the problem.Most news and talk shows are boiled down snip-its which result in a pied-piper mentality.

In the end I feel the Franken played me for a fool and now I look sillier then ever. This book is like an emotional drug.

I found it laugh out loud funny, at times insightful and overall very refreshing. It is not a scholarly work and it is not intended to be. Its Franken's retort to the shrill right wing idealogues that seem to be dominating the airwaves more and more. He lambasts Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, \\"Ann Coulter (what is wrong with her!)\\", and \\"Hannity and colmes\\", among others in a way that is both funny and at least informative. Still, with all of the hype in the media, don't believe everything you read.

He's pretty funny(I laughed out loud every couple pages), if a bit self-aggrandizing. Hence 4 instead of 5 stars. And it gives some great come-backs for the next time you're at a party and someone starts talking about the \\"liberal bias in the media.\\" Franken tells it like it is, and I only wish that the mainstream media would have the guts to do the same.

I know that Franken and his team wrote this book, but I kept glancing at the bookcover expecting to see Groucho Marx's picture.

This is an important book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Funny Cuz It's True","review":"This book, first and foremost, is hillarious. A solid portion of my favor towards this book is due to the fact that it made me laugh out loud about two times a page. The other reason why I enjoyed this book so much was because finally somebody exposed the truth about the true media biases in this country. Although pretty harsh at times, someone had to counter attack Bill O'Riely and Sean Hannity. He does a good job of poking fun at some of our President's policies that don't even help the people who need help, and makes a great point at saying that criticizing the government is patriotic. I also enjoyed how Al writes about the truth of W.'s abominable environmental track record. Mr. Franken also impresses me with his method of proving the truth to the readers. There are a few kinda extraneous conservative bashing parts that he got carried away with, but overall, I recomend it.

His book is devoid of fact, full of hate and unfunny.Franken has perfected the art of namecalling as a substitute for political commentary. Grow up Al!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a \\"1\\" cause there ain't Zero.","review":"Just makes you glad that idiots like this don't run the country. He is yesterday's news, living in memory of Monica, Bill and Hillary, An era where all respect went out the door with the White House china and silverware. It has one redeeming value -makes good fuel for the cabin cookstove next winter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Good and what is not.","review":"If you want something funny with a Liberal and anti-conservative point of view this book is a great read. Although it is not likely to change anyones mind, it does provide insight and another point of view.What makes this a bad book is that Franken again takes a conservative and uses them to sell his book. First with \\"Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot\\" using Limbaughs name to sell books, and now using Democrats and Fox News' Bill O'riellys distorted picture on the cover. Lets face it, the vast majority of those who will read this are not learning anything new, and Franken even admits that he took the work of Alterman, then added humor and called it his own. No objective sources makes it Ideological... so to add the tagline \\"A fair and balanced look at the right\\" isn't satire, its Propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat hypocritical","review":"Yes, Franken \\"proves\\" that many of today's conservative voices have \\"lied.\\" But the problem is that he picks out just 2-5 examples for each person (i.e. Coulter, Hannity, Bush, etc.). When someone writes a whole book, or speaks on the radio for 3 hours every day, a handful of mistakes doesn't neccessarily make them \\"liars.\\" I'm sure someone could carefully go through Franken's books, and find \\"lies\\" as well. It was clear that he had a political agenda in writing this book, and the transparency of this agenda inspires only skepticism for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too serious for a funny man","review":"We all need Al Franken to keep the Right honest or, as Al would say, to MAKE them honest. The big problem I have with this book is that Al, a genuinely funny man, starts to take himself too seriously and gets kind of angry at times. Too bad. His earlier book, \\"Rush Limbough is a Big Fat Idiot\\", was much funnier and less angry. As an aside, if you've seen Al Franken on TV lately you'll notice that, while Rush has slimmed down, Al has become a really fat guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A left wing hit job, but better than most!","review":"This is better than most of the trash from the left, but that is not saying much. Al Franken is funny and intelligent, but hopelessly biased and over his head on many of the issues in the book. And, it would be nice if he could be funny without making the personal (and false) attacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lying Liberals are Sore Losers","review":"The funniest thing on the planet is a liberal who is completely powerless and inconsequential. Well known is Franken's fiasco with making up lies to promote this book. This is the type of drivel that exposes liberals for the pathetic losers that they are.Now that liberal Democrats are reduced to sniveling unpatriotic cowards, their primary concern seems to be with doing anything to get back the power, even tearing down their own country!Their mantra seems to be \\"If we can't have it then nobody will.\\"Hopefully the vast majority of Americans will see right through this smokescreen, but I'm sure there are still plenty of ...liberals who'll eat this up like a dog returning to his vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"When to Laugh When to Cry","review":"This book was at times very amusing. If it wasn't for 9-11 I suppose it would have been funnier. It's just the image of those poor people falling to their death and the non-visible ones crushed and/or burned under the World Trade Center collapse that keeps coming in my mind when I read political discourse like this.Making light of \\"wacky\\" liberal hijinks would be funny if the end result didn't end up hurting so many many people. Mr Franken needs to distinguish between entertainment and governance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rantings of a deranged mind","review":"My true rating would have been negative five stars, but it wasn't a choice. Franken missed his calling. He should have written for Pravda. Maybe North Korea or China could use a spokesperson. Franken is just the left's version of Baghdad Bob. His hypocrisy knows no bounds. If any of the previous reviewers are actually conservatives, I'll leave the county. I'll even go on the same boat with Baldwin and company."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smart and Funny read","review":"I love all kinds of political commentary and this is one of the best. All too often books on serious topics are either too dry or too serious. This book tackles a serious issue with a light touch.One of the best aspects of this book is that it is so well researched. I wanted to check out the authors research to see if it was accurate and not only did I find the information to be accurate, I also found I easy to double check the information because of the thorough way the data was presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Coulter's Antithesis","review":"Al Franken is Ann Coulter's antithesis. When I say that I mean it in every sense of the word. I do not only mean that they lie on opposite sides of the political spectrum. Unlike Coulter and the many other hysterical writers who are ripped apart in this book, Franken respects his audience and does not lie to us(he has FOOTNOTES and everything!). The book is humorous and informative instead of polemical and obnoxious like some books I could mention coughcoughslandercoughcough. As an interesting side note, I probably would never have read this book had Fox News not sued Franken over its title, thus peaking my interest. I say Al Franken is indebted to Fox News for the free publicity, and on his behalf, I thank the right-wing propaganda channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and full of facts, but too much is too questionable.","review":"This book backs what it says about the twisted and wrong things that the Bush administration has and hasn't done with factual references that are important for every American blinded by a propaganda laden, and sensationalist Fox News (The ultimate in Jerry Springer type media.), but Bill Clinton wasn't exactly the Prince that he describes him to be, and his personal stories are a tad questionable as well. An important book for any American who isn't a lock step lemming, and who wants to improve their great nation in 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desert Island","review":"Is there anybody else out there who just wishes Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Michael Moore, and Al Franken would go to a deserted island somewhere and wait for our phone call to return?Anybody else weary of the political discourse being cheapened, compelling debates being marginalized, and bi-polar views of Left vs. Right being promoted? The trouble with a book like Franken's (and Coulter's) is that it preaches to the choir of those who live out their political lives through bumper stickers and mind-numbing, sound-bite driven cable TV political shows that invite extreme or bombastic guests just for the spectacle of it all. Is it any surprise that Americans are apathetic toward the political process when it's presented like this? Franken, like Michael Moore, is probably not a big fan of American-style global capitalism, but his first royalty check should remind him that he is not above sharing its spoils."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Right Review","review":"Maybe Al should stick to comedy but I guess that tougher than just being a finger pointing cry baby.Lets talk about ideas! Ideas are what matters. The best ideas win."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO IS THE MEAN-SPIRITED ONE HERE?","review":"Just the titles alone of Franken's book indicate how ready he is to make cheap shots (\\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat Idiot,\\" and this one.) I found the book surprisingly not funny. It was written as a reaction to all the conservative books. I really got restless near the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Political Bible","review":"This book, written by my best friend Art Franklin, has been very helpful to me. During my campaign to become the Governor of California, I have met many liars. Before I started, I had no friends. Now everyone wants to be my friend, even my enemies. Clint Eastwood wants to be my friend and so does Sylvester Stallone. And Jerry Springer. He keeps calling me at 2 in the morning asking if I want to go get a drink and a couple of broads. I always say no and give him Bill Clinton's number. I admire Bill Clinton. He lied but then he confessed. That took guts. Then he confessed that his confession was a lie. That took guts too. I give my constituents in California this solemn promise; I will never lie. And when I do, I will confess. Teddy Kennedy once told me that the truth will set you free. Tell that to Nelson Mandela."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intelligent?","review":"Al Franken is not best described as intelligent. Oftentimes, his arguments fall by the wayside with lack of evidence much like Michael Moore's so often do. Liberal entertainers have not yet mastered the art of fact finding.I'd prefer reading Bill Maher any day"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Objective Comedy","review":"Franken does it again and exposes various right wing republicans for who they truely are, liars. Franken combines satire with sarcasm to present an honest account of conservative SOBs. Franken may be one sided in his account of the right wing media, but never the less remains honest and completely factual in his account. Franken makes me proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't know to laugh or to cry","review":"Franken takes a fairly straightforward approach to dissecting and refuting the right wing's attacks on moderates and centrists (c'mon, there aren't any true liberals left in washington). He exposes Hannity, Coulter and others for their blatant lack of honesty and sloppy techniques.Thanks to Fox, he's riding this one to the bank.BTW - If Fox is so concerned about trademark protection, how come every friday I hear Hannity say \\"if it's friday, it must be Miller Time...\\". Seems to me, the beer folks have the TM on that phrase.Only criticism is that some of the points he makes are nitpicks. There are enough compelling arguments in the book that he could have left out the more ambiguous ones, which will just leave the right a place for their arguments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franken did his homework.","review":"Franken hilariously cuts down pompous blowhards of the far right in the opening chapters of this book. What makes it screamingly funny in places is the way he ingeniously uses their own words to skewer them. (I'd be embarrassed to show my face in public if I were a certain Mr. O'Lie-ly . . . and I'm not referring to splotches, either.) Don't get the impression that the book is all humor, however. There are some gripping and saddening chapters which left me depressed and enraged. What one comes away with in the end however, is a remarkable analysis of how the game of political and media manipulation is being carried out in this country by those who seek to hide facts and distort truth. This book rings true in all its facts. What it makes most clear of all is Franken's passion about this country and its true ideals. An entertaining and eye-opening must read for anyone truly concerned for the future of the country and our \\"phantoms\\" of freedom."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],F={key:0},C={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",F,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(M,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-22efb9d3"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/54.md","filePath":"glossary/54.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/54.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
