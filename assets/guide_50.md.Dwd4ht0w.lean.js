With ASU, you get a broad coverage of political theories, ethical theories, theories about argument, economics, government and more. Highly recommended for anyone who is doing philosophy at an undergraduate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another professor's book","review":"I elected to read this for two reasons: First, it was said to be the seminal work on Libertarian philosophy; and, second, it was supposedly the intellectual response to John Rawls, for whose writings I have very negative views. I was able to get through a very few pages when it became apparent that Nozick and Rawls are a matched set--they just have a philosophical difference. But both of them write only to impress, as do far too many Harvard professors.I try to think of the reader who might like this book. So far I can't come up with one, with the possible exception of someone trying to understand Rawls. It's easier, and just as educational, to just give up on Rawls and look elsewhere for Libertarian material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it from someone who knows","review":"this is, of course, a great work. I have to agree with the writer who suggested that it should be read in tandem with Rawls�� work.Although Nozick has in some ways amended his views since this publication (and moreover, stayed away from the subject) this work, imho, can stand alone. I think it��s important, especially in light of the atmosphere on college campuses today, for young minds to be subjected to the viewpoint that ��rights matter�� and that they should be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elitist reviews show why reading AS&U is important","review":"After reading AS&U twice, as well as, A Theory of Justice, I find it interesting how people's opinions are suppose to carry weight by their philosophical backgrounds. Personally, I think the combo of AS&U along with A Theory of Justice is intellectually stimulating. I would NOT recommend reading one without the other unless you are looking for a famous philosopher to quote therefore building credit for your own views. I lean more towards the libertarian views but I do not let that get in the way of a quality book like Rawl's. I also find it amusing that reviewers that are students of philosophy actually suggest that one author is right and one is wrong. The real argument is about the basis for Nozick's and Rawl's views. An argument is easily won if the author defines the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I watched Harvard professor Michael Sandel's series--Justice. In it he mentions libertarian ideas, and that Mr. Nozick is libertarian. After a little research into overarching libertarian views, I hoped to find detailed arguments supporting my strong feelings for individual freedom. But Mr. Nozick's overriding concern seems only to be, a fitting fee agreement. A violation of such an arrangement is what he feels is impermissible. Making the importance of rights, their trade value.On my kindle I've left off on page 137, I will not read any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Nozick cannot write at all. It isn't that I am confused by his arguments; rather, he appears to be confused himself. His arguments are entirely unpersuasive and the holes in them are glaringly obvious. I can't understand how anyone in academia has ever taken him seriously. If you want to read a strong framework of social justice, check out John Rawls."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review","review":"I think it rather humorous that the August 13th reviewer has the gumption to ground his authority on AS&U on a college course s/he took as a junior. In the words of the August 9th reviewer, \\"Ooh, convincing.\\" Take it from someone who has a degree in philosophy from UC Berkeley: the critical assessments by the Aug. 9th reviewer are for the most part accurate, though by no means a complete list of the faults of Nozick. The reason I give the book two stars instead of one is that the Aug. 13th reviewer was right about one thing. AS&U is a very necessary book in the ongoing debates of political philosophy. It shows us what not to believe and why."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a Master's Degree...","review":"I have read many books on philosophy and political science and this is the first I had to give up on completing. It was written as a textbook for someone working on their doctorate and not the average layman.

Very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"This book is beautifully written. It creates wonder and humor in each tale that appeals to adults and childern.

Scott Richardson's review of this set is helpful, but he's still too generous, I think. Money should not be given to a company that apparently doesn't even watch the final DVD image of a film before releasing shoddy goods in order to make a quick buck.

With 21 tracks you know that there are gonna be many pointless skits and bad songs. I almost gave this album 3 stars, but it isnt worth that.

Why must rappers be so mean to each other and think they're so cool? It seems that every other word is a swear word. There must be a different way to express themselves. And who is the guy with that whiny voice that brags about himself on song number 6? I've never heard that song before, but I thought it was absolutely terrible. And why were they singing so fast?

This is a must for a true lover of rap, there are many songs that are very good on it, and if you actually listened to many of Eminems cds you realize that D12 was in a number of his songs.

D12 came into the scene strong in 2001 releasing their debut album, \\"Devil's Night\\" a strong, uptempo, hearty CD from start to finish with good lyrics. Expecting a strong come back with D12 World, The popular singles, \\"How Come\\" and \\"My Band\\" came out showing some good examples of what was to come of the CD. \\"My Band\\" got old in about 3 days thanks to over playing it on MTV and TRL and the only good part that i found in \\"How Come\\" was the chorus, everything to expect from the genius in Eminem. Don't buy the CD, wait for Eminem's new CD to drop and buy that or get something new coming out this summer. Lots of better stuff out there coming out now then D12 World, don't waste your money and time listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up to Devils Night","review":"D-12 is one of the most slept on groups out in the game now.

And that was a mistake on my part. After listening to the album the past 2 days I've really been feeling it now. Much love D12!!!!Stand out songs are Loyalty, 6 In The Morning, How Come, Get My Gun, B****, 40 oz., American Psycho II, Good Die Young, and Keep Talkin. I'm still not to sure what I think about Git Up... some people have seemed to love it or hate it.All I can say on this album is don't have any expectations for this album before you listen to it.

Now there are a few funny tracks (Em's verse of \`Get My Gun') and D12 does what it didn't do on its debut release: get serious. And when they do the Dirty Dozen actually produces pretty solid tracks with \`How Come' and \`Good Die Young'. However, Eminem is barely featured on the CD (unlike \`Devil's Night') and that leaves the other five members to struggle their way through a full-length album. Though members like Proof and Kuniva have some talent on the mic, the CD is a disappointment and D12 continues to prove to be filler for hardcore Eminem fans.(2/5 mics)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to D12's World","review":"Yea, alot of people are giving this cd bad reviews because their women who don't appreciate what em raps about, but they're not the ones to rate a cd for its lyrics and beats.

The lyrics are funny when their suppose to be funny, and serious when its suppose to be serious. The beats are great. Check out 1. Git up 3. Just like U 8. 6 in the Morning 9.

The facts are that Eminem is a LESS then spectuclar producer and that the members of D-12 (outside of Proof) are average/below average at best (Bizaar has NO BUSINESS on a mic). The fact that Eminem is TRYING to be gangster really tarnishes him. I believe he is too talented to TRY to come off like a 50 Cent wannabe.\\"Devils Night\\" only sold 2 million copies (low considering Eminem is in the group) and I do not expect this cd do to much better. There is not one song on this cd I would consider a hit. \\"My Band\\" is a stupid god awful song. The BEST song on this cd is \\"Good Die Young\\".

Most of them are like, \\"big deal\\". I was bored by the time my band came on and it isn't even that good of a song.

In eminems old song called white america he says that the only reason he has fame and fortune is because he's white. What he doesn't tell you is that he is proud of that.

Who were Priam and Jocasta - or Andromache and Astianax ?While Susan Graham and Gregory Kunde were floating beautifully through their parts, I happen to prefer the weightier voices of Troyanos and Domingo and also the judicious cuts that James Levine obviously made in the 1984 recording.

Tramer, editor of \\"The Catholic Extension Magazine\\" from the year 1954, although the same letter referenced on a couple adventist websites has a date 20 years earlier...and a quick google reveals no references to said magazine or editor except for one very cryptic ref in a wyoming parish newsletter from the 30's.There is a part of me that is just wondering if someone played \\"fast and loose\\" with the truth in order to present \\"the truth\\".Even if true (for sake of argument), it seems that the authors could have done a bit more homework to find Catholic sources a bit more current than over 50-70 years ago.

I have a problem with his sometimes coercive methods, and the nature of some of the 'tricks' (like teaching your dog to snarl and growl over an object). Not that you can't teach your dog to do anything you want, but he needs to be a whole lot clearer that any behavior that is rewarded will increase exponentially in frequency once it's been rewarded. Teaching your dog to object guard is not a safe thing to do in the hands of the average person. Aside from that, it seems quickly written and as if he tried to make it cover EVERYTHING. It is hard to do that well and he hasn't succeeded. His blurb on clicker training is silly, recommending (against the advice of every clicker trainer and those who invented the method) to click sometimes without treating. In short, head for a more concise, better written book if you'd like to have fun teaching your dog tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog-Gone Good!","review":"What a book...every family DOG should buy this for his/her owner!

But it does give some insight into the humor and the emotion of the vibrant and shockingly colorful paintings. It also serves as a decent introduction not only to the artist's work, but also to the cultural and artistic life of modern India. This would be a nice gift for any lover of modern art or anyone interested in India, for that matter. Gay men would especially appreciate this book, I think, as Khakhar \\"came out\\" in middle age (after the death of his mother) and many of his works are blissfully homoerotic.

I highly recommend this for those considering taking on a managing role in kids development through Little League."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Has Time To Write?","review":"Just finished this book and man this guy gets it dead on.This book is for everyone who wonders what it's like to live in New York trying to be a writer when there ain't no time for writing what with all the hours slaving for tips at the restaurant and all the TV shows that have to be watched while you lounge on the couch talkin on the phone and all the cigarettes and all the sittin in coffeeshops and takin care of your cancer ridden roommate. Who has time to write? Time's running out and you're getting too old to be the enfant terrible of the literary world. I love his honesty about not feeling hot enough to really be gay and also how the restaurant days really aren't that bad. This is a book about the chase and admitting that's usually the best part. If only you knew it at the time. I hope he's working on a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Are Here...or at least you should be.","review":"\\"You Are Here\\" was definitely an enjoyable read, as it tells a brief moment in history of a gay man coming to terms with moving to New York City from a town in Virginia. This is not to say that it is directed solely toward gay readers; anyone can enjoy this book, as its lessons and learnings apply to people of all genders and sexual orientations. It was a quick, enjoyable read, and Gibson's descriptions about certain events are dead-on. Some make you laugh, some make you cry.

Who would of ever thought a Friday night at home reading movie reviews on Amazon.com could be so fun. Read them all - you'll see my point. Ok now why I am writing the review.My son appeared to like the movie however my husband and I thought it looked like a first time producer shot the film. The plots jumped around, the acting was rather poor, and it appeared to be filmed using a home video camera. It was enough to have to watch it once and is certainly not worth the asking price. Sorry, I don't like to give bad reviews but this one asked for it especially after I saw the price - spend your money on something better. The laugh was worth the price though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flyin Ryan","review":"I can't believe how bad this home movie was, bad acting, bad script, bad bad bad.

Your kids will absolutely love this movie (assuming of course they were born without any conception of reality). I really can't believe that this movie didn't win the academy award for special effects (which rival movies like Lord of the Rings and the Matrix). Like the scene where he's flying above the factory. You can almost imagine that he's acting! The brilliant screenplay will tug at your heartstrings with such profound quotes as \\"Mom...are we there yet?

After destruction of private property, vandalism, and assault, nobody calls the police, only 911 to have the aunt taken to the hospital.

They jump about two inches off the ground. Their energy attacks look nothing like they should and are impossible to do.About the only good thing in this game, as far as I can reckon, is the cover art, the opening movie, the music and the fact that you can play Kid Goku and SSJ3 Goku... which doesn't really matter, because by the time the battle begins, I've already fallen asleep.Lousy game.

The energy attacks are murder to pull off (hence the four star rating) but can be very devastating to your opponent if you can use them. It took me a while to learn how to block and recharge my energy but once I did the game became very easy to play. You should spend alot of time in the build up mode so you can beat the other modes or else you won't stand a ghost of a chance.

I was positively impressed with Paul in his HR role and I was curious to read what he had to say about \\"Snakes in Suits\\". Snakes is in my opinion is too kind a world for the kind of individuals one may have the misfortune to meet in some corporations. I was not disappointed and I would strongly recommend this book to anyone finishing college and preparing to enter the corporate world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popular subject, easy to read.","review":"Popular Psychology approach to a subject we find out about too late in life! Easy to read, and written for the average person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Read","review":"I'm about half-way through the book and I may not finish it. I find that that authors jump around an awful lot - there is no coherent \\"plot\\" and that makes it really difficult to absorb what it is that they are trying to say. I find the \\"sidebars\\" really annoying - they are not sidebars in the conventional sense, since they are in the middle of the page and not on the side, where they could be more easily ignored. So far, I have met Frank, John, Dave, Sam, Deborah, Todd and a couple of other characters and nothing hangs together very well. Quite frankly, I'm disappointed in the book and I wouldn't recommend it. I'm quite sure that Babiak and Hare have a lot of valuable information to share, but the way they've done it in this book just doesn't cut it. If I were a reader looking for more information on corporate psychopathy, I'd look for a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I expected more of this book. Much of it was devoted to identifying whether certain characteristics of individuals whom you encounter at work, can properly be defined as psychopaths.Frankly, this is unimportant to the non-clinical person. The bigger question is what to do about such encounters, however the person is defined.The answer came late in the book, namely, kiss-up if such a person is your supervisor, and find another job as soon as possible. And don't fight them; they are very skillful, and you will lose.I did not need to read the book to know that this was the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work","review":"General assessment: after reading the ending to this book, I threw it a way in disgust.My two purposes in reading this book were: (1)to learn about psychopaths (2)to learn strategies for defending myself from psychopaths at work. The first purpose was achieved with good details and examples. The second purpose was addressed with several concluding chapters. I found these ideas made sense and were helpful. These chapter made feel that it was possible to protest myself at work and lifted up my confidence. The final three pages of the book basically said that if you think that you can do anything to defeat a psychopath, you are a dam fool! If the authors do not think that their ideas work, why should I."},{"rating":"1","title":"A puzzler","review":"I find this book a puzzler; can't tell who it's aimed at.

I have noticed everyone mentioning the value of this book for HR in their reviews. Within the organization I worked the HR Director was (still is) the psychopath! She has gotten rid of everyone who posed a threat to her through lies and manipulation and she sucks up to executive management who continue to promote her and give her raises. Just don't know if we should automatically exclude the HR department in the potential for psychopathic chaos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guidebook to a Strange World","review":"Except for one brief, horrible period, I've spent most of my lifeavoiding bureaucratic organizations of the sort where Snakes in Suits thrive. So I read this book with a fascination like you might bring to a National Geographic special about the grisly customs of some group on the other side of the world.Apart from the sheer shock and porn value of the stories, the authors have done a great service. We need to bring an awareness of Psycopaths and Sociopaths into the foreground of public discussion. It would be especially important as we see the rise of the class known as 'political operatives'-a whole profession that seems rooted in mercenary immorality.The book could have been better written and one wishes there were an editor more actively involved, but this is gripping non-fiction and very likely to change the way you think about things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You'd Expect","review":"If you were seeking anecdotes and interesting real life accounts of psychopaths or psychopathic behavior in the workplace you'll be very disappointed. This reads as a psychology major's study guide to a niche - how to maybe-but-not-really identify the rare and elusive psychopath in the workplace. Boring technical analysis and VERY repetitive information flow.It contains an easter egg however: a useful guide for the hiring process in corporations, although other books that directly tackle that subject might do a more thorough job, and you wouldn't have to sift through pages of sand to find the gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"In our Uber-Corporate society, Everyone should be aware of this dynamic/paradigm.","review":"I would put this subject near the Top of reading lists; not all psychopaths are serial (or cereal) killers.Also, see 'social manipulation' in wiki for other sources POVs.think about the self-centered, narcissist people in society; They don't have labels on, do they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"All that Glitters isn't Gold","review":"In a world of ego and image ... illusions are rampant everywhere ... and no more deceptive or blinding than those corporate superstars who are lethal in the lengths they go to serve their own needs.

It's mildy entertaining, at best, because there are very few fighting moves and other options. Also the action is very slow as opposed to other great fighting games like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. As in most games, I find the announcers annoying and time consuming, however the one good thing about it is the celebrity personalities. The idea of the game has great potential, but the makers have fallen short of my standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for the bored.","review":"This game was played a lot during my childhood. Since I recently acquired a working Xbox from GameStop's garbage, I had to buy some games for it. Of course this was one of them. The game itself is okay; would be better if it involved some real wrestling moves such as grappling and throwing etc just like the Smackdown/RAW games.

One disappointment, however: the editors seem to disply the usual academic prejudices against the more \\"wayward\\" Hellenistic thinkers, such as those who gave serious consideration to astrology and magic. One would expect a fuller accounting of Hellenistic astronomy, at least, if the astrology is too much for them.

My answer to this retorical question has to do with my \\"adult\\" 46 year old recognition that New York was a fascinating place to be growing up in in the 1970s. Reading either of these histories will almost bring you back to the days when Times Square was not a safe place to visit and there was no sense that anything was going to get better.

But be warned--if you thought Experiencing God by Blackaby was the greatest book to come along, this will highly upset you. I've taught this book, and never fail to attract heated discussions because it contradicts many previously unchallenged beliefs and assumptions. Not only will it give you a solid Biblical understanding of God's will for your life and making choices in general, it is a good lesson on how to interpret the Bible. I read it several times.However, the book is not thorough enough on discussing \\"Now what?\\" After sacrificing some sacred cows of traditional beliefs and learning how to identify the will of God, I think the author should write a follow-up book with more emphasis on how to live your life in light of this teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word ---- Life-changing","review":"This is probably the best book I've ever read. Friesen accurately presents the biblical basis for knowing God's will, which we are commanded to do (Eph 5:17). He tells how you can definitively know the will of God for your life.

You'll need to read the book to find out.There is a revised 25th anniversary edition, which includes critiques of other books on how to find the will of God and other new features, too.The one bad review that I read of this totally misunderstood what Friesen was saying.

Most books that challenge me make me feel like I need to grow spiritually or something of that nature. This book was different and made me look at how I see God. I want a God of a traditional view who wants me to pursue a specific path. I want the God that is happy with me because as long as I am in close fellowship with him and doing what he leads me to do; I will be in his will. The traditional God makes me feel secure. Unfortunately after reading this book I have questioned that view. I wonder what if about past issues and what now about future ones. It has challenged me to make sure that I am truly pursuing a relationship with God and not just using him as a simple road map."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Landmark Practical-Living Book","review":"This book should be on the shelf of every sincere Christian believer. I too once struggled with a superstitious-like attempt to follow inner impressions presumably leading me to the \\"will of God.\\" I too never knew which of these inner impressions came from God, and which just originated from within myself. This eye-opening book shows how nowhere in Scripture is the \\"inner impressions\\" doctrine taught. Also, when God gave specific instructions as to who to marry, those were exceptional situations and certainly are not normative for people living today. And, as has been often said, God is far more interested that we become more Christlike than the particular choice we make for a career, marriage partner, etc. THAT is the essence of God's will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only the televangelists would read this book.","review":"Actually, if the people who watch the televangelists would read this book the televangelists would be out of business.

I suppose it would be interesting to someone who was curious about Alexander's thought processes which led him to the development of his method.

Stories from the early native Americans are presented here as well as more modern accounts of local legends.I borrowed my copy from the local library, and I'll be picking up a copy for the bookshelf here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Langenscheidts pocket italian dictionary","review":"It has great bolded words that are common in conversation and also contains a fairly wide breath of vocabulary considering it is a pocket dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stess indications!","review":"I really like my Langenscheidt Spanish dictionary, so when I started learning Italian I got a copy of this dictionary.I liked the size, layout, easy to read typeface, and durable cover. However, I quickly found it to be inadequate because it does not indicate the stressed syllable of the italian words. The stress in italian isn't always obvious, so this was a big problem when trying to determine the proper pronunciation of new words. Oddly, other sizes of the Langenscheidt Italian dictionaries do indicate stress, but I couldn't find one that was both compact and complete enough for me. So, I ended up returning this book and going with the Oxford Minidictionary instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pronounciations","review":"Not only does this dictionary not have stress indications for Italian words, but it has NO PRONOUNCIATIONS!!! Well, that's not entirely true -- the dictionary contains pronounciations of English in the English --> Italian section. Not very helpful for English speakers! This would've been the ideal dictionary for me in size and durability, but without pronounciations, this English speaker is returning the dictionary and looking for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This dvd was so amateur!

It is well researched and follows events from Great Britian's past in acturate detail, while still allowing the reader to see the historical characters portrayed as very human.

It was quite enjoyable except, I felt that they could have expanded a little more on the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley since, Dudley was supposedly the one true love of Elizabeth's life. Thanks to Philippa Gregory's \\"The Virgin's Lover\\", we get what PBS missed.I read the book in two days and went back to the book store looking for more books by Phillippa. I am currently reading \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and loving it just as much as I did \\"The Virgin's Lover\\". If your into historical romance, Phillippa is one of the best writers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"you will lose sleep","review":"This is a really good book that i did lose sleep over because i could not put it down so read it when u have the time to have no life or work for a while. Great author"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Had to Keep Checking this was not Harlequin Romance","review":"A story about Queen Elizabeth's early days on the throne. This version focuses on the romantic relationship she allegedly had with Sir Robert Dudley. He was a married man when she became Queen, but his lust for power drove him to try and manipulate her to grant him a divorce so that he could be King and fulfill a family destiny. We see the envy and hatred he inspired in others and the despair of his wife - both of which lead to his downfall.Although well-written and researched, the author makes Elizabeth into a flighty, lust-driven girl instead of what history has shown us to have been a very calculating and powerful Queen. the sections on Lady Amy Dudley are so whiny you almost hope she WILL die and release Robert - which is not what the author probably wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good work of FICTION","review":"\\"Fiction\\" is the key word here. Gregory takes a few liberties with the story of Elizabeth I. For example, as Gregory tells it, Elizabeth meets young Lettice Knollys (also spelled Knowles) at court. Actually, in real life, Lettice and Elizabeth knew each other long before Elizabeth ascended to the throne. Lettice - along with Kat Ashley - was imprisoned with Elizabeth in the Tower while Queen Mary was alive.Other than a few inaccuracies here and there, this book was fun and easy to read. Gregory's prose is wonderfully appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Liz, we hardly know ye","review":"This book is too long! I grew weary of this Elizabeth and her co-dependent love relationship with Dudley. Such a simpering and sick romance. Where is the Elizabeth of courage, of strong will and true wit, of courage and character, of one who kept her head when many others lost theirs. She certainly is not in this book. although I enjoyed the setting, the background characters, the political intriques, the plotting and re-plotting, I did not enjoy the main event. Too much of the book was romance; I wanted a historical novel with fresh and exciting insights on Elizabeth and her times. Gregory has a great writing style and can tell a good story. I did finish the book because there was sufficient background interest. But I hope to find a meatier main event in Gregory's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome chapter of an epic in the making!","review":"The story picks up where The Queen's Fool left off - with Elizabeth on the throne and her struggle between her heart and her duty.I don't know what it is about the author's writing style, but, from the very first sentence I just couldn't put this book down until I finished it. Perhaps it is the thoughtful and emotional depth of her characters or her ability to pick out fascinating historical details upon which to base the storyline. She brings the characters and the time peiod to life - in such a way that I feel I am right there, witnessing the story unfold first hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"a philippa gregory fan","review":"This is the second book I've read by this author - The Other Boleyn Girl being the first - and I loved both. I found the book mesmerizing. The author's style is spare and smart, and her characters deeply flawed, like humans are. I have no difficulty imagining a young Elizabeth as much less formed than an older Elizabeth - more needy of the opinions of others, less sure of her own mind, much more driven by sexuality and desire for love. I have no trouble imagining Robert Dudley as driven by a potent combination of lust and ambition, with a dose of love thrown in in his nobler moments. The least credible character, IMO, was Amy Robsart, who was alternately cloying, resolute, innocent, and wily. No, I am not a scholar of the period, but I am not seeking a scholarly work in historical fiction, either. I am seeking a page-turning read based on, but not limited to, real events. This achieves that goal beautifully. Kudos to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen Elizabeth Fans Beware","review":"While I have enjoyed several of Gregory's other works, including The Constant Princess, The Queen's Fool, and The Other Boleyn Girl, I couldn't even make it through this book. I am an avid reader of historical fiction and non-fiction and never have I been so disgusted with a portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I. Gregory writes about an immature, one-dimensional girl unable to make the simplest decisions without her lover, more focused on lust and adolescent games than running a country. Despite the fact that Queen Elizabeth I was fluent in English, Latin, Greek and had studied War, Science, Mathematics and was a model pupil throughout her schooling, Gregory expects you to view the Virgin Queen as little more than a village idiot who has the crown thrust upon her. While Gregory's works are on the whole fulfilling this left me completely dissatisfied and unimpressed with her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't even finish it","review":"I usually really like Philippa Gregory, but this book is awful. Like other reviewers, I can't tell who the main character is supposed to be. Elizabeth is remarkably silly and immature (a few times, her eyes have \\"filled with tears\\" during official meetings), and she keeps getting swept away by Robert Dudley for no identifiable reason except that he walks up to her and makes sexual innuendos. His wife Amy is one-dimensional and annoying. I'm very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another story from the GREATEST WRITER EVER! .","review":"Philippa Greggory does NOT disappoint. just as riveting and exciting as her other books.

I've ventured out for other writers who can do justice to the Tudor story line or other writers who focus on Monarchs and i've always been disappointed... like ALison Weir. She has let me down twice....i won't buy a 3rd book. but i own 5 novels by Philippa Gregory and no one catches me like she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I have read all of the books by Gregory based on the Tudor Dynasty and this would be one of my favourites. TOBG and The Constant Princess are my other two favourites. This author I find is very good at developing romantic stories that are highly addictive and engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read and enjoyed others of Philippa Gregory's novels, but was disappointed by \\"The Virgin's Lover\\". It was repetitious, and the characters were ultimately boring in their depiction. This is one of my favourite periods for historical fiction, and I have read dozens of novels set in the period. So it isn't the facts/the plot that matter as I read; it is how the story is told.\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is excellent, and \\"The Constant Princess\\" and \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" are good reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gregory has done better","review":"I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I. Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship. And the writing isn't so hot, either. If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad. The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst fictionalized account of Elizabeth I have read","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this book, having heard from several people how good it was. Unlike most of the nonfiction work I have read, Queen Elizabeth is made out in this story to be an indecisive romantic simpleton who had to be lead to every important decision she made by the men surrounding her. Instead of masterfully playing the field to keep alliances as most historians feel she did, she is portrayed as whining and indecisive about her lovelife as well, controlled totally by Robert Dudley and William Cecil. I found this book almost insulting in it's lack of strong feminine characters - and here is one of the strongest, most heroic female characters of her age. If you are looking for a hot romance book - this is it. If you want a good piece of historical fiction about Queen Elizabeth I then read Alison Weir."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!","review":"I am only about 3/4th into the book, and boy am I glad I didn't actually pay anything for it! I can't believe that Ms Gregory portrayed Elizabeth this way... I am going to keep reading because I want to at least get to the part when Amy Robsart falls down the stairs and see how the author handles that ... I am really surprised that a female author would portray all her women characters this way, including even Elizabeth. It sounds like a mysogenist wrote this book - the female characters are all so unlikable and even pathetic! It's really too bad because Philippa Gregory is a popular author (although for the life of me I really can't figure out why) and many people think that her stories are historically accurate...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"If you love Historical fiction about British Royalty like I do, then you'll love this book. While I doubt Philippa Gregory could ever replace Jean Plaidy as my favorite historical fiction author, she could definitely come a close second.

I will find a book priced for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summary on Back Ruins Book!","review":"Taken from the back cover of the paper back: As the young couple falls in love, a question hangs in the air: can he really set aside his wife and marry the queen? When Amy is found dead, Elizabeth and Dudley are suddenly plunged into a struggle for survival.Nice summary, however, Amy Dudley doesn't die until page 410 (of 438). You will read 94% of the book with Amy alive, knowing that she will die. Whoever wrote the summary on the back is an idiot because it definitely ruined the book for me. I would have read it completely different if I had not known Amy would die - and that fact could have been an actual surprise. I also would not have been waiting for it for 410 pages!Overall a good book, I just feel like I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I usually love Philipa Gregory books, but this one I am struggling to get through. With her other Tudor series books, it seemed that I would finish them in a matter of days. This one has taken me much longer to finish - mostly because I just don't care about the characters. It's fine to take liberties with history and paint Elizabeth as a younger, less confident queen at the beginning of her reign, but please give her some redeeming quality for me, as a reader, to care about! I ended up going to Wikipedia just to find out what actually happened to the characters because I couldn't wait any longer for this long, plodding book to tell me. Honestly, I found the Wikipedia account more interesting. I just don't understand how you can fill hundreds of pages with text and still have a story that doesn't go anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I would have given a 5 but I wish the ending gave me a bit more. Other then that I loved this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I hate to say this, but I did NOT like this book. I suppose it's a must read if one is interested in following the whole Boleyn story, but this book is not as good as the other works of Gregory's I have read. I wouldn't call it a waste of time, but it's taken me forever to get through a simple 400 page book. I kept trying to chalk it off to the story itself not being as riveting as the other books, but for whatever reason, I didn't like it.The only thing I liked was when Gregory flipped from the passion of Elizabeth and Lord Dudley to the dismal life of the cheated on wife, Amy, in some kind of parallel universe.I'd recommend this book only for those who wish for the continuity of the Boleyn saga. But then, so many books, so little time......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Finale","review":"The Virgin's Lover is definitely an excellent closing novel to read after the other four in this \\"series.\\" I found it to be bittersweet and true to the true nature of the characters. The ending in particular will break your heart; Gregory's treatment of Amy is so gentle and yet honest that you cannot help but hurt for her.For reference, the order to read these books is:The Constant PrincessThe Other Boleyn GirlThe Boleyn InheritanceThe Queen's FoolThe Virgin's Lover"},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat boring","review":"I have read all the books in this series re: Henry 8th and enjoyed all of them except this one. In spite of the history during this period of time, the reign of Elizabeth I, this book concentrates far too much on the sexual relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley as well as his whining wife, Amy. In terms of a synopsis, other reviewers have gone into depth but, again, the book is somewhat devoid of historical value. Gregory's theory about how Amy died is somewhat interesting but so much more could have been done with this time period. I actually came to despise the characters Dudley and Elizabeth. She is being portrayed as weak, Dudley obsessed, dumb and easily manipulated. As one of the greatest rulers in England, I found this characterization of her unbelievable and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read of historical fiction","review":"This was my first Philippa Gregory book. It was a very enjoyable read, and I especially liked how she integrated historical events into the narrative. If you enjoy Elizabethan era history and movies like \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, God, it burns!","review":"When this book came out, I was excited. I heartily enjoyed Philippa Gregory's other Tudor novels, and I'm fascinated by Elizabeth I. I wish I had never read it.The characterizations of Elizabeth and Dudley and all the rest--blech! I was halfway through and I wanted to do nothing more than smack Elizabeth around for being a weak, empty headed IDIOT. The only thing she could do competently in this \\"novel\\" was bang Dudley. And don't get me started on Dudley. Oh please please PLEASE don't get me started.This was such a disappointment. I expected Gregory to be a bit hazy on the historical accuracy (hell, that's why it's called fiction) but to come up with this? It's absolute drivel. I'm so glad that all Gregory's other Tudor novels were better written and so much more engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major dissapointment","review":"What a disappointment this book was. The author portrays Elizabeth as a mindless pawn in the hands of the traiterous Robert Dudley. Anyone who has done much reading about Queen Elizabeth I knows that she was a brilliant linguist and astute politician and was extrememly wise in her choice of advisors. No one put words or ideas in her head that were not her own. To portray her as an emptly headed, mindless individual with no thought beyond what Robert Dudley wanted does a great disservice to one of the most successful and brilliant historical figures ever. She was way ahead of her times in her thoughts on politics and religion. I would not have finished the book except I was hoping to see some redemption somewhere in the final pages. Shame on you Phillipa Gregory for your unfounded and false portrayal of Elizabeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got through it....","review":"This book was not horrible. (When a review starts out with that it is not a good sign) I found it to be sided against Elizabeth or at least I found it to contradict a lot of what I have previously heard about Elizabeth. This book represented her as a woman completely dependant on men. Overall, I found myself mostly bored, but half interested in what was going on. I felt like there was way too much back story for what the book was supposed to be about (Amy Dudley's murder). By the time the climax happens the book is almost over and I found I liked the ending mostly because I was happy to finally be finished. I did learn some interesting things from this book, but overall I would have to say that I do not recommend it. I was hoping for more, but this book did not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for feminists!","review":"This reworking of the story of Elizabeth I and her relationship with Robert Dudley will be thoroughly enjoyed by those looking for an Aga saga, but if you want true history, leave it alone. Gregory's portrayal of the young Elizabeth paralysed by lust and unable to make a decision without a man at her side will cause feminists (or even just capable women!) to throw the book at the nearest wall. This is a woman who is acknowledged to be one of the greatest monarchs, male or female, that England has ever had, yet Gregory has reduced her to a lovesick fool. The portrayal of Cecil the schemer is the most accurate characterisation in the book; for the rest, if you want to know what really happened, stick to David Starkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and shrill","review":"I loved \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" so I was very excited to see this book when it came out. What a disappointment! Elizabeth is a shrill, narcissistic, and totally unbelievable character; Amy Dudley is a brainless, insipid whiner. While the facts are more or less true, the characterizations are dull, repetitious, and finally boring....this is one of the few books I've ever failed to finish. I just couldn't slog my way through page after page of the same dull dialogue. If you are interested in learning more about Elizabeth, I would highly recommend Alison Weir's book; although it is nonfiction, it is much more interesting than this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as her other books, but still interesting","review":"I so enjoy the writing style of Phillipa Gregory. This book was interesting, I just don't think she had as much \\"drama\\" to work with in this story as in the others, such as The Other Boleyn Girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Fiction","review":"I've become addicted to historical fiction thanks to Philipa Gregory. Her stories are well written and the characters are so vibrant. Her knowledge of history makes the story feel very plausible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your Time","review":"This book isn't worth the money. It's not even worth the time to take it out of the library. Having read (and loved) her other books, I was really disappointed in this one. It's boring, petty and whiney. It reads more like a Barbara Cartland novel, than informative, historical fiction. I'm glad that I waited to get it at the local library because I would have been pretty ticked off if I had paid money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite of the series........","review":"I wanted to finish the series, so I forced myself to finish this one. The good news is there is a twist at the end. The bad news is, it's pretty slow before that. I'm guessing Philippa was trying to cover the whole era, and this part is a yawner. There is really only 2 main characters, with three minor characters. Without all the twist and turns of her other books with a large cast of characters, there isn't much intrigue here. In Philippa's other books, I've become attached to at least one character, and can't wait to find out what happens to them. I didn't have any favorites here. I got lost in discussions about French, Scottish and English alliances--it turned into a history lesson. You could probably skip this one without losing your place in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"not there","review":"I loved \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and \\"The Queen's Fool\\" finding them, actually two of the most wonderful, fascinating, gripping books I've ever read. The best! Then went to the early trilogy and was so disgusted I threw them in the garbage. Now there's \\"The Virgin's Lover.\\" I paid lots of money to buy this in hardcover, expecting to be transported, and I'm on page 53 and still plugging away, trying to get into it. Seems likely I'll chuck it. It just doesn't flow like TQF and TOBG, feels \\"made-up\\" and stilted where those came totally to life. When I read TQF and TOBG I thought they were the result of an artist finally coming into her own, so complete they felt almost channeled. This, on the other hand, seems more like someone trying to cobble something together, forcing it rather than feeling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the standard we have come to expect from Ms.Gregory","review":"I could not put The Other Boleyn Girl down, it was a real page turner, history mixed with romance and intrigue, even though we knew the outcome. It was so fascinating that I went out and read everything there was to know about Henry VIII. However, Ms. Gregory seems to have run out of steam, if not subject matter. I could hardly bring myself to pick up this dreary book. Elizabeth is portrayed as weak and unlikeable,(infact there are no likeable characters in this novel), and not the queen we know her to be. The constant description of her long flowing red hair and black eyes and Dudley's smoldering good looks was unbearable. It reads like a cheap romance novel with a slice of English history thrown in for good measure. Ms. Gregory should choose herself another English monarch, I have read her three books about the Tudors, enough is enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbingly biased","review":"I have read all of Ms. Gregory's books. This one was a shock to my sense of expectation from this normally breathtaking author.Her portrayal of Elizabeth I was rediculously biased and slanted. It was much closer to reading a trashy romance novel than a 'fictional',historical portrayal of a woman such as Elizabeth I.Ms. Gregory did all she could to give readers the sense that Elizabeth was nothing more than a manipulative, weak, immoral and oversexed vixen. I was disappointed in such a depiction. As a successful woman herself, Ms. Gregory was off her game to deliberately portray Elizabeth in such a manner. Perhaps the author's depiction of catty Elizabeth is instead a self portrait? This book would not be suitable enough to be used as kindling in my fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a lover...","review":"of this book. It doesn't compare in entertainment value to The Other Boleyn Girl (the best) or The Queens Fool. It drags and then abruptly ends when the last 70 pages finally start to really move the plot. Oddly, the Authors Note at the end is more interesting than the book - although it runs right into her footnotes - be sure not to miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"I am quite distressed about the portrayal of Queen Elizabeth the First in this novel. Yes, she is a fallable human being like the rest of us. But as an amateur British historian, I cannot believe that she could have been nearly as shallow and self centered as this book shows her to be. Every history I have ever read regarding her reign portrayed her to be a remarkable, strong woman, whose dedication to her country and it's best interests was always paramount. I found I had to force myself to finish the book.However, I was intrigued by the theory of the true nature of Lady Dudley's demise. It seems plausable and and worthy of the statecraft of William Cecil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Luster","review":"I have read The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen's Fool and loved both of those novels. However, this novel just did not impress me at all. There was no likeable character throughout the whole book. They took Queen Elizabeth, who is usually considered one of the greatest ruler's of England and turned her into an insecure whinny girl. Robert and Amy Dudley's characters were very stagnant. Robert seemed focused on being the King the entire time and Amy was just sad and crazed half the time. The books is really boring all it talks about is who Elizabeth is flirting with or how she does or does not want to invade Scotland. Save your money and your time and read her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite of Gregory's Books","review":"I've been reading many Philippa Gregory books lately. This one is my least favorite and it's taken me 6 weeks to finally get through it (took 2 days to finish \\"The Queen's Fool\\"). Redundant, wordy, and no heart in it whatsoever. I felt disconnected from the the plot and the characterss. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I have read just about all of this collection.

I did not have to complete it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain unlikeable","review":"I've read several of Phillipa Gregory's books, inlcuding the Constant Princess and the Other Boleyn Girl. I thought this book was a giant disappointment. It lacks the pace of the others and as another reader remarked, it doesn't have a single likeable character. Ms. Gregory focuses a lot on telling readers what a stud Dudley is and what a conniving, weak and ignorant girl Elizabeth is. Also, poor Amy Dudley...what a sad woman. But not enough backstory to really understand her. The closest to sympathy I had for any character was Cecil who was oiften so fed up with Dudley and Elizabeth that he wished he could escape them all. Me too, Cecil, me too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fabulous Gregory Novel!","review":"Phillipa Gregory really scored with this one!! This Elizabethean era novel depicts some of the more important and influential men in Queen Elizabeth's life and the effects they had on her (personally and politically). Her portrayal of Elizabeth is simply astounding--she shows a more vulnerable, young and naive side (that surely existed).Simply marvelous!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Book, Disappointing Effort from Author","review":"What a pity that Ms. Gregory had such a rich field to mine as the early life of Elizabeth I and in the end unearthed such an uninspiring book. After reading The Other Boleyn Girl I wanted to devour books about the period. This is definately my stopping point.The Virgin's Lover does not in any way do justice to the times in which it is set and seems, in fact, to be written for someone who has no knowledge of Fifteen century history. The main characters are poorly imagined, one dimensional people. The reader has a hard time imagining that this Elizabeth had one of the most successful reigns in British history. Why on earth would she have chosen such a transparently ambitious and ruthless lover and why would such a man inspire such devotion from an emotionally abused wife. In the end I couldn't find pity or compassion for any of the characters. But I did pity myself for expecting much more of this author.This was a most disappointing effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was 'un-put-downable'.

While it could get long-winded and focused too often on the minute details of personal politics, I did learn alot about the period and the character of the French nation that was very interesting. The biggest problem, as the title of the review said, is that in a 500 page history book with chapters that average 40 pages and no real breaking points, the lack of an index is a crucial flaw. I don't know how many times in the past year I've wanted to reference or check some of the information I found in Perkins' book. Unfortunately, with no index, it's virtually impossible. The book is essentially worthless for reference. I understand that it was written over 100 years ago and Perkins didn't include one. But this is a reprint. The reprinters should have created an index for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected much more.","review":"The other reviewers were right on the money except for the \\"plant\\" who gave it 5 stars.

Amazon must have added the 5 x 8 inches book since or I overlooked it. I went back again and found the 5 x 8 inches one. If any of you out there don't know what lilliputian means, it is a very small person. The space between lines is about half the space as my current (and shabby) At-A-Glance. Perhaps I have the one that is designed for the senior citizen but even the near sighted, in my opinion, could't handle it. Again, the price was too small to bother sending it back.

The design of the control dial/shutter button assembly is horrendous (which you'll get to see for yourself once it breaks off if you buy this camera). Basically, when you turn the dial, you're exerting lots of pressure against 4 tiny plastic pins that hold the dial assembly together. In my case, the dial broke off just after the warranty expired.

Admittedly this is nothing as good as reflection eternal or black star, but this is just Kweli and in my opinion this is better than Quality.As a die-hard fan of Kweli, I have heard advance versions of this album. I heard a lot of stuff I liked on the Beautiful Mix-tape and the leaked version that was on the web. The version he released was not the best mix of the two, rather some-other stuff that wasn't on either and a few tracks that were. While he could have made a better album by only using the tracks on those two, he instead chose to give us some stuff we hadn't heard, and that is a good thing in my opinion. Besides, if he just released what had already been leaked, it wouldn't have sold that much.Although this doesn't have the Hi-Tek sound to it, this album shows Kweli's skill as a artist and is a definite must buy if you are a fan of the genre. And if Quality disappointed you, check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"limp","review":"if you want some polite, well behaved, entirely house-brocken hiphop cop this. the album, much like Quality, is a polished, groomed, made up and dressed up corpse: lifeless and soul-less.loved Blackstar, but this is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hear me out...","review":"Okay as a fan of blackstar and previous kweli... blah blah blah. I can sit here and tell you what else i like and this and that, but you just need to trust me on this one. I gave it 2 stars cuz well, the album is fairly weak. I bought the album with past credentials in mind BUT MAINLY because of the track \\"never been in love.\\" tight nit lyrics even referencing Paris Hilton \\"answering the phone\\" layered over a sick beat. I figured that the rest of the album would hold up... and it DIDNT. Not that there arent other good songs on the album, cuz there are. Considering the names who lend help to Kweli neptunes, dj hi-tek, etc id expect better results. Moral of story: some good and decent singles, preview songs and purchase individually if youre not into stealing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Rest...but still","review":"Talib gives us an almost classic with his latest album. The one problem I have with this album is the beats, it seems way too mainstream and I truly miss the old days when Talib & Hi-Tek ripped Hip-Pop apart and showed Hip-Hop a different or a rediscovered light. But still, this album is still better than most of the ish out there. The man's words and delivery is still there. It's unfortunate that this album was leaked a while ago that delayed this release. Due to that, some of the tracks have been remixed and I preferred the original mixes. I hope that it the delay doesnt take away from Talib's thunder. Now, to the true Hip-Hop Headz, cop this album (from the store) it's worth the price of admission.Stand out tracks:- Damn man, itz all great pick it up.I'M OUT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Desperate attempt","review":"Talib Kweli is a Very Talented MC no doubt.but I guess being the concious Rapper is not in step no longer.somehow having Faith Evans&Mary J.Bliege on the same Album feels more like 1994&Happening than 2004&Desperate for some duet shine.Talib has entered that phase sadly of just going through the motions.this album is flat to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down With Weak Follow Up","review":"For a guy with so much talent, Talib's career is following the path of Cannibus rather than Common. Whether its his poor choice of production, his questionable hooks, or alarming drop-off in lyrical quality, Talib raised a lot of eyebrows with this weak follow up to the good, not great Quality. He still has the talent, which is glaringly obvious on the three good songs on the album, \\"Ghetto Show\\", \\"Black Girl Pain\\" and \\"Beautiful Struggle\\". Hopefully Talib's next album will mark a return to respectablility, but on this disaster, Talib let down his fans and hip-hop itself, which needs MC's of his caliber ripping it as much as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"?????editorial??","review":"Oliver Wang, or whoever he is is not qualified to review this album.

Incidentally, he happens to be just that, uninspired, boring, and uninteresting. I reserve the same for faux-underground acts like Aesop Rock and Sage Francis, however this guy along with Kanye West is regarded as underground by a LOT of dumbasses who wouldn't know the first thing about hip-hop. While I do give my respect to nowaday's popular rappers that somehow manage to rap to these repulsive and banal beats, but then again they're not that good and they don't have anything even remotely interesting to say, as is the case with Kweli. He may be popular on the streets, where people are too ignorant to know the difference between him and a class act like KRS-ONE, but in somebody's living room, he's embarrassing. Save your money and research the genre before you purchase what your friends tell you to."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Uhh.....

I Still can't understand why he has lost his organic roots to produce tracks that have pushed him into the hip-POP crowd. I would definetly consider 'Train of Thought' one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time .. the chemistry between Hi-Tek and Talib is unbelievable.. so when Talib's first solo project 'Quality' was a disappointment (definetly not worth that title), i figured in Talib's second solo album he would try to collaberate with Hi-Tek and Mos Def a little more, instead Mos was traded for Mary J. Blige and other R and B artists while Hi-Tek produces the more mainstream west coast sound versus his previous jazzy organic beats killing the underground sound. I only pray Talib will reflect on his previous tracks and get back on the subway TRAiN (of Thought) to the underground where he belongs and is trully appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talib's fallen off","review":"I've tried to get into this album but can't.. The beats are too hard and overproduced for a Kweli album. This album sounds more like Jigga's \\"Black Album,\\" (with whack-ass beats and overproduction), much like most of the over-commercialized crap on the radio today. Talib's still a gifted rapper with a clear messege but I seriously miss his (or Hi-Tek produced) laid back beats and smooth ryhming style that's made him an underground icon. He's now gone too mainstream/pop. Sorry, this album is weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, check it...","review":"Talib Kweli is nasty, i'm not tellin u anything new. He's in fact prob. my 2nd fav. MC (Pharoahe Monch is #1) Now Quality (which was slightly better than this) was a hot cd. Beautiful Struggle was a hot cd, but I constantly ask myself if I would like Talib so much if Reflections Eternal never existed. Maybe I would cause of Blackstar but still, you feel me? I'm not sayin he fell off or anythin like that cause he's lyrically too good to ever fall off, but I think he owes us another Reflections Eternal (and when I say that I don't literally mean it has to be Reflections Eternal part 2, I just mean an album of the same greatness) Don't you agree? Anyway like I said i'm not hatin on Talib, i'll always support him it's just something to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have CD","review":"I only have one thing to say, Talib is a real Eemcee.

The characters are well portrayed and not just cardboard characters for window dressing, they contain dimension. The carrier scenes are striking and realistic and for those unfamiliar with life in the Navy such as I was, it's all explained in simple prose and not too much technobabble.

No, it's not romantic like, say, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, but it gives a lot to talk about. Like The Most Dangerous Man in America, this movie considers the impact an individual can have (or fail to have) in a world with seemingly overwhelming forces of violence and injustice. Walter's movie offers the points of view of victims, rebels, and those who are neither but like to discuss these roles. The footage of Streep and Brecht is fascinating as it examines the ways both orchestrated their effects. The juxtapositions of images are poetic: rows of skulls, rows of bicycles, and while the movie touches on many issues, Walter pulls them all together in a satisfying way. So if conversation is part of your seduction strategy, this movie is for you. It would also be great to see with anyone you like to talk to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not*about Meryl Streep","review":"This is not about a Meryl Streep profile, it is about a famous?? but boring play that only a few snippets of which are shown.

While Sam Micawh, the protagonist, certainly can't be faulted for being boring, the brazen attitude bestowed upon her by the authors, and the patronizing tone with which the client company's employees are addressed, only serve to reinforce the negative stereotype of \\"the arrogant consultant.\\" This fault makes me hesitant to recommend \\"Leaning into Six Sigma\\" ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Six Sigma Primer","review":"I have read several books on Six Sigma and found this one to be extremely weak on content and heavy on the current Buzz Words!

The biography was well written, and certainly motivated me to keep reading.I knew a fair amount about Akhmatova and Tsvetayeva going in to reading this book and it felt like it filled in missing pieces of the same story. For me, the only unfortunate aspect was the nagging feeling that Hingley was somehow taking sides in the veracity of the various women in Pasternak's life. It added a weird gossipy kind of tone to some of the issues that were discussed.Still a commendable effort, and recommended if you are looking for a decent Pasternak biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roots the movie Episode 1","review":"Movie was very good.

Short on facts, long on hyperbole, and with some distracting cinematographic techniques that ruin what could have been an excellent summary of this period from a German perspective.

A lot of people didn't like the fact that Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 used the same graphics as the first one, but here we are years later in a totally different game and it's still the same. The interface worked well for Rollercoaster Tycoon, but I didn't find conducive to this game at all. This game could have taken a lot of pointers from Railroad Tycoon 3. Chris Sawyer makes good games, but he really needs to modernize his efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool for train buffs","review":"Ordered this for my teen son. He loves trains.

I did it 3x/week for a month prior to my trip and really saw results. I can't say I felt like a stronger paddler, but I had much more endurance. And I was much, much less sore each morning after surfing, which says to me that the workout targeted the exact muscles used while surfing. I highly recommend this workout for other beginner surfers, but it's also a fantastic full-body workout for anyone and takes only 45 minutes (including warm-up and most of the cool-down). Added bonuses are that my biceps pop a little more and my butt's perked up a bit. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent program","review":"I found this exercise program to be very helpful and the DVD itself was very nicely done. I think it's a great program even if you're not a surfer. The fundamentals it teaches apply to anyone, not just surfers.They seem to know exactly what they are talking about, the video was very easy to follow, and the results have been very positive for me so far. I've had lower back problems in the past, and was told strengthening my core was highly important to improving my health. The Core work this program promotes have really helped me. If core strengthening is one of your priorities, this is a great program, whether you're a surfer or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout","review":"This is the best workout video for surfing I have ever tried.

What's astonishing is that Hyper Groove 1 is also one of the most transcendentally great pop albums ever made, right up there with Pet Sounds. It's like some kind of freak of nature.

While this product looks nice enough, I've had two problems with it: 1) the first time I ordered this thing, the Herzher company sent the wrong color, and since I live in a NYC apartment building with no doorman (and no car, and my office is two crowded subway trains away), returning items thru the mail is a pain in the neck; 2) the second one I purchased was the correct color but the latch on the front panel was defective from the moment I opened the package -- so the front doesn't stay closed (the spring in the latch doesn't \\"spring\\") and my cat scared himself silly when he tried to enter and the door flopped open and clattered to the floor.

Once my cats are inside covering their bodily functions as cats do the door flops open which then rattles my cats. I have had to tie the door at the top to keep it from opening.This is not what I had in mind for the price of this product or what I was led to believe its purpose would be.I would not make this purchase again nor would I recommend it to anyone.For the same price you can purchase a free standing folding door and serve the same purpose without frightening your cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonco Kitties","review":"I bought this product to keep kittens from getting kitty litter every where and to have it out of sight,That it does to a extent.But if you want it for keeping the smell down it only does it partly.It does look nice with my wicker furniture I have,that too is why I bought it.You should try this product.

But like other reviews, the latch does not catch properly. So, first I set the latch. Then I hit the top-front with the heel of my hand until it snaps in place. Then I give the front a tug to make sure it's secure. Shouldn't have to do that though. Also, the latch handle is a bit close to the front making it hard to grasp and pull down.1 Star for Mr. Herzher's: What they originally sent to me was a 'used' cover. All of the front metal parts, as well as the latch, were badly scraped and rusted. Clearly it was a well-used return. That they allowed it to be resold was unacceptable. I complained and received a new cover. But too late for them...

It's a little pricey but well made and certainly adds a little class to a stinky situation! We got the dark brown since it matches our wicker conversation set. It comes with a plastic bottom tray with the corners cut out/molded to accommodate the rubber feet from the top portion, my only issue is if you try to move it by sliding the top comes off anyhow since it's not attached, no big deal.

I just barely scanned through it, and I was mostly yawning while doing so. But I've seen enough of it to warn the curious.This book is filled with pure mathematics. I know it's the language of physics, and I do know some calculus and stuff like that, but come on, save this for the textbook shelves. This Penrose guy is not writing for a layman like me.I like to read about Penrose theories but I don't think I like Penrose as a writer--at least not this book. He should just stick to the classroom and chalkboards. Let other people (like Michio Kaku) explain the Penrose Theories to us.At one part somewhere, near the end, I thought it was going to get interesting when he started to address the Big Bang theory, and the beginning of time, and all that stuff, but then he lost me in some convoluted fussy math and I started yawning again.If you are not some kind of a math buff, stay clear of this book. It's a lousy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penrose Road is a Dead End","review":"The road to reality is not found in this book. Penrose doesn't explain what reality is, not even mathematically. The book is a failure. The road to reality begins with one simple question: why am I on this road? Penrose Road seeks to lead us to the so-called ultimate equation that will unify the seemingly conflicting theories of modern physics. Once this equation is found, however, the question will still remain unanswered, namely, why is this equation at the end of the road?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly loses steam.","review":"This book starts out as if it were aimed at the lay person and even makes efforts to explain points that require no introduction to a college graduate with a degree in math or science. (Example: the author rhetorically asks how one can have a square root of a negative number.) And yet, less than one-fifth of the way into the book, he proceeds from assuming you don't know what a complex number is to requiring understanding of Riemannian geometry. The author attempts to provide more than mere nonmathematical philosophizing as some slimmer books have done, but the failure is that his presentation quickly outstrips understanding. This brings us back full circle to accepting on faith what the undoubtedly brilliant author has to say, but now in the form of a tedious, 1000+ page tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!","review":"If you are mad about science that a book you MUST have.

I should think that you would want to have recently studied calculus & complex analysis. The hard work required does not lead to a great reward. Penrose's Twistor theory has been around and dismissed for a decade or more.

He starts with the mathematical instruments that cast light on the road to the elusive physical reality. These instruments allow appearance of singularities, which make the current understanding of the universe incomplete. We cannot know for sure what was the universe before the big bang and how it will evolve and end. These questions find amazingly elegant answers from the physicist Eugene Savov in his book Theory of Interaction. Savov considers space experiments and afterwards draws equations. I highly recommend these two basic books to everybody who is interested in the creation and the unfolding of the universe and in the application of mathematics to this great mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Making Your Mind Run the Boston Marathon","review":"This is a challenging book, even for self-described intellectuals. It's critical to put in the time, slowly, in the first few chapters, stick with it, and see the benefits unfold in the later, rather elegant chapters where it all comes together -- literally. While Penrose can be a bit strident at times, he makes a convincing and worthwhile case for his explanation of how the laws of nature interrelate and flow into somewhat very unexpected fields. Not having read many (any) other books on theoretical physics, it's hard to compare this to other books in the genre. But from a more philosophical viewpoint, it's an impressive effort to expound on current theory and can make even a hardened 19th century Western European old-school philosophy curmudgeon like myself to take pause and think things over. Well worth the time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"No free lunch","review":"I was trained as a mathematical economist, and Mr. Penrose's book confirms the dismal science's old adage \\"There is no free lunch\\".One cannot teach the whole of mathematical physics to the layman in 350 pages or so - what utter madness!A shame, because I really liked his \\"The Emperor's New Mind\\", esp. his expos�� of G?del's incompleteness theorem and Bell's Inequality Principle (even though linking consciousness with quantum physics is one of his crackpot ideas).A popular book? In terms of sales figures perhaps, but surely not in terms of the number of people actually having read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly covers physics","review":"This is an amazing book. It has so much in it that I do not see how anyone could learn it all. It is encyclopedic. Even the elementary chapters are a pleasure to read, as Penrose has his own insights on the subject.

If it's been a while since you've done serious math (or never) -- brush up! (or get comfortable with not understanding the details) While the first third covers a lot of the relevant math before getting to the fun physics, it is not a math tutorial and the rest of the book assumes you get it.Now, I just wish I could find an equally thorough and objective treatment of life sciences ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I re-learned calculus for this book (and others), but 90% of the math - and the book is all math - is much more advanced than calculus.I believe the book would be very valuable to someone with an advanced degree in math, recent enough to still retain the details, and who has no prior background in physics, but who is interested in it. Penrose cannot or does not have the ability to 'teach' the math, either - he calls some functions \\"uncomfortable\\" or a function \\"doesn't seem honest\\", etc shop-talk for people who know this stuff inside/out already. But if you're an advanced mathematician, this is the introductory physics text for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fatally flawed book","review":"It is amazing: the reviews center on the quality of the mathematical/physics presentation (which I think is very high), and totally ignore the fact that this, like virtually all books written in this vein, is supremely naive about fundamental philosophical issues. What I mean, briefly, is this: the book is predicated on an unstated, rigidly held Cartesian dualism, and for dealing with fundamental questions that is a very suspect ground--an expression of what the philosopher Lawrence Cahoone calls \\"philosophical narcissism.\\" For an antidote, I highly recommend Cahoone's \\"The Dilemma of Modernity\\" (SUNY, 1988), or, immodestly, my own \\"The Unboundaried Self: Putting the Person Back Into the View From Nowhere\\", published by Trafford (2005; Details at [...])."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Penrose is a genius!!!","review":"The Road to Reality : A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe is an instant classic, this is brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know Your Math!!!!","review":"As an occasional reader of some of the more general books on the universe, I was looking for something with a little more detail, something that didn't run away from math. A quick read of the intro and I thought this would be the perfect book. Penrose claimed that he could help people with limited ability to work with fractions. Fractions?!? No problem I thought.A few pages later and I was drowning. This isn't simple math. Problem is, he doesn't start from the beginning and build up (which granted would take more like 10,000 pages). Instead, this book jumps hardcore into some serious math. I'm sure this is great for some people and many will deservedly give this book 5 stars. My issue is that it is being sold as a \\"don't worry, I'll teach you what you need to know\\" type of book. In reality, the reader better have a serious math background. For the record, my math background was generally statistics and business related math via an undergrad and an MBA program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good book, a must have for the scientific library","review":"Yes, it's very complete. It is also a book with enough pages to give examples, formula, background info on how things were wrought up by scientist of early twentieth century. This book is definitely a good buy. Penrose is an excellent educator and really explains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review only","review":"Alas I must give thumbs down to this book. If you know the material then it can be a useful roadmap with some interesting highlights, but when he gets into an area you don't already know the book has little value. He doesn't explain the math, so it come across as a list of facts. Does a list of facts about tensors really sound useful? Compare this to the brilliant job Kolmogorov and others did in \\"Mathematics\\".Mathematics: Its Content, Methods and MeaningBuy that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped book - bit of a disappointment","review":"This book is overhyped and was a disappointment to me. The book consists of 2 parts : the first part summarizes the mathematical background that you need for the second part. But the chapters are not explained in such a way that they can serve as stand-alone study material; so if you lack some knowledge, the book itself will not be sufficient to explain everything and help you through the second part.Penrose tries to explain complex mathematical concepts without formula, which turns out to be a failure. I stopped reading the book at about 70% and sold it on eBay, I didn't even want to keep it in my personal library! I wouldn't especially recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plato to Quantum Gravity","review":"Roger Penrose's \\"The Road To Reality\\" offers both the mathematically skilled and non- mathematicians great insight into the laws that govern the universe.

I love the far-flung locations with various cultures, space travel, and fun sci-fi gadgetry - it was a lot of fun to read.And the mystery of what was really going on kept me guessing throughout. I don't like spoilers so I'm not going any further with it, as much as it may kill me. :)I just finished reading book 2 (Warpaint) which was great. Personally I hope you'll read this one first because it sets everything up so well. (To be honest Warpaint probably works as a standalone; I just think you'll get so much more out of it when you see how it all began. And I think the fun in this book shouldn't be missed anyway.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"Interesting, well-rounded characters and a compelling story line. Would love to be able to use the free wheeling mode of transportation found on Cady's home planet. This book stands alone as a complete story but sets things up well for following Cadence Drake on future adventures. If you are looking for a read to draw you in and transport you to a world of adventure get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I'd never read anything by Holly Lisle alone before, only collaborations (The Rose Sea, Serrated Edge books), and I wasn't sure what to expect. I was blown away - this book is terrific! I have to read more of her stuff. Since I read Laurell K. Hamilton's Nightseer, I particularly think this book should appeal to her many readers: it's fast-paced, funny, and scary as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping story worth the read","review":"Cadence Drake is a compelling character, especially if you have an affinity for butt-kicking female leads. What this first episode with the smart, beautiful, and trouble-attracting Cady may sometimes lack in convincing dialogue or convincing plot twists it more than makes up for in lovable characters, gripping action and an overall story arc that makes you want to keep reading. The dialogue flops are present but rare as are the minor plot twists that don't quite convince the reader (or at least this reader). All of this barely detracts from story enjoyment but is why I awarded 4 stars instead of 5. For a Cadence Drake novel that gets 5 stars see Warpaint; Written fifteen years later, it showcases Holy Lisle's expertise as a writer and delivers a Cadence Drake undiluted by some of the issues seen in Corrigan's Blood. Nevertheless, Hunting the Corrigan's Blood is a good read and one you won't regret buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"I love foreign action films. I take chances on films I dont know about in the hopes I find a hidden diamond. This one turned out to be just coal. Artwork looks pretty, with the tag line \\"From the studio who brought you Ong Bak and blah blah blah\\"...This movie was not like any of those 3 stated in the tag. Acting was bad. Characters were stiff while delivering lines, overacting while shooting (recoil of weapons), and like the previous reviewer you never know who is who until an hour in which adds to the poor character development.That aside, the action scenes are ok, not great. Modern day ninjas (with machine guns) drop after a kick. Book beats gun every time. Didn't know grabbing a fire extinguisher could go unnoticed but alas I guess its possible.Movie was overall dark, lighting seemingly coming out of nowhere in the middle of the woods. Logical progressions in storyline are absent.Not worth buying.

Duggins has a powerful voice which I find easier to listen to than Flogging Molly. The music relys on powerful banjo and mandolin performances which helps steer them clear of obnoxious guitar riffs which can so often detract from a strong celtic group. The Tossers do a nice job of mixing American themes along with Irish themes and make sure you know that they are from Chicago. All in all the vocals are amazing and have you singing along from the first song to the last. The music makes you want to get up and stomp your feet along with it. What makes the album even better is if you have ever seen the Tossers perform live, then you realize just how much passion and energy they put into their music. I highly recommend this album for anyone who enjoys powerful celtic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good But They Don't Even Come Close To The Pogues.","review":"This band is what I would call a polished Irish punk band with skilled musicians. The Pogues were like a runaway train ready to derail at any moment but this band is firmly on the tracks which to me takes away from the excitement of the music. They are talented but if I was going for a modern Celtic punk band I would have to go with Flogging Molly.

The blue print makes entries easy to find when you're trying to flip through the book quickly. This is especially useful in the middle of a conversation! The definitions are clear and go into great detail on variations and options, enabling you to find the best word choice. It also provides a comprehensive list of conjugations in both German and English to help you use the words you're looking up correctly.Physically, this dictionary is very well constructed.

I have a feeling this book will become one of our enduring favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Childrens Book - Good for 0 - 6 Years!","review":"My daughter is a book lover and people love to buy her books so we have a BIG STACK of books. One Moose Twenty Mice is my absolute favorite of all the books we have in her bookshelf. She received a hardcover edition as a baby and it was fun to look through at the beautiful artwork with her. Then at 1 or 2 years of age she started having fun searching for the missing cat on every page. I could watch her get better and better at finding the cat! Then she started noticing that there were different numbers of animals on each page and we used the book as a counting book - from 1 to 20. After she was able to master the counting (at 4 years old?) we started working on recognizing the numbers on the page that corresponded to the count of animals. Now, at 5 years old we use it as an early reader. This has been the absolute best book ever for a baby or small child - it grows with the kid and the art work is simply spectacular in my mind. I can't get enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It lacked visual clarity","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much when i purchased this book. The concept is good and the wording is very cute, but the colors and vibrancy are definitely visually confusing to a little child ( my younger daughter of 2.5 ) could not clearly see the shape of the the numbers.

The discussions never really touch upon the fundemental conflict within Islam. Islamic teaching and principles are not analyzed in the light of current socio-economic meileu, but instead glossed over. The author could have done a much better job of enlightining the world about inherent conflicts in Koran, and the different interpretation of it.

One might more readily excuse the gaps (such as omitting AIDS and the gay rights movement from the \\"Protest and Unrest\\" section, or JFK's assassination from the section on the presidency), if it weren't for the redundancy of having both a \\"Hollywood\\" and an \\"Arts & Entertainment\\" section, plus \\"Fashion, Fads & Fun,\\" which cover far too much of the same ground. Worse, even those who expect less substance from Life than I may have hoped to see are likely to be disappointed by the all-important photos.

I don't much care for medieval philosophy. It lacks the clarity that contemporary philosophy exhibits, sometimes. Anyways, Medieval Philosophy is always difficult for the english speaking student because it's all originally in Latin. However, this book satisfies the serious student by printing the Latin on the facing page. It is amazing. On several occasions as I was working through one of the sections, I had trouble understanding the arguments due to repitition of words or the use of different words in the English. With the Latin on the facing page, I was able to clear up issues that stem from the vagueness of translations. It was easier to see the string of Ockham's argument when viewing it in his orginal language. The preceeding reviewer expresses some of the books other merits.

IO pipe do not work.\\" This is simply wrong in so many aspects. All of these can serve useful purposes when normal amount of caution is taken. THEY WORK. It makes me wonder if the author understands the real interaction of I/O under Apache/mod_perl's model at all, since he does not give any reference to the truth. On the other hand, the section does not state caveats such as scope and persistence of variable values in any apache/mod_perl setup.

I could also associate with his brother's struggles for comprehension, and acceptance; the other side of the coin or basically the same quest ?I also found the book very soothing. The descriptions of the nature surrounding Jean-Marc's life are exquisite and balance very well the descriptions of the main character's wounds, leaving you personnaly touched, almost heeled.Transcendent throughout this book, love forces the characters to evolve, to change, to see. It allowed them to accept, to breath, to forgive, to live, and to eventually die, in peace with themselves and with the others.Aelred's Sin left me in peace with myself as well.Enjoy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great back story to Titanic!","review":"This has a lot of interesting characters behind the story of Titanic.

The plastic one is getting worn and this was to replace it, but the plastic one is more accurate even worn than this one is as new.If you are looking for a good quality caliper, this is not it. Mine now sits in my office where I use it for basic stuff that does not require accuracy, and folks come and play with it and comment on how nice it is. So it DOES get complimented, and it does get used; but for modeling and anything requiring accuracy it is not the thing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"The guitar playing is awful and almost every track has that terrible fusion guitar sound that helps to mask mediocre skill. On the few cuts where the sound isn't electronicly smeared, you can often hear the buzz from an inaccurately fingered fret. This is acceptable when you're listening to someone like Joe Pass play 10 notes a second at a live jazz festival but there is no excuse for it on relatively slow passages recorded in a studio. I was especially disappointed with Somewhere Over the Rainbow which is one of my all time favorites and is given disastrous treatment by Mr. Stowell. The melody is distorted so as to be unrecognizable at times and finally lost in a misguided attempt to be original. The singer, Lynn Skinner, has a pretty voice but it doesn't work in this setting.

While including material which may not be the best evidence of the theory that Jesus survived the crucifixion and then traveled eastward, ultimately ending up in Kashmir (like the Gospel of Barnabas, which seems to be very late and not at all authentic), it at least draws attention to the fact that, yes, we Westerners almost never assume that any part of the world outside of our own knows anything (or at least anything \\"true\\") or might shed light on our own history. There's lots of information here, all of which is worth reading not only because it presents a very plausible theory of Jesus' life and death, but just because it awakens one's awareness of the other side of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg to disagree...","review":"While I have not seen Valentin De La Sierra, I have recently watched Soy El Hijo Del Gallero and was not impressed.

I played the CD with headphones on and felt like I was in a future time looking back on the Tour De France Race.It's been a long time (17 years) since Kraftwerk has released an album of new music. Tour De France Soundtracks shows us they haven't lost the magic. And that they still are the leaders of electronic music. They have a unique ability to create music that you feel as well as hear. Listening to this CD gives you the impression that you have been a part of the race they commemorated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long, But Worthwhile Wait","review":"I always felt that for Kraftwerk to release a new album would be a daunting prospect, both musically and metaphysically. Where could these trailblazers go? was the question I pondered.

Kraftwerk fans will not be disappointed by this release, they will know what to expect and will be very happy with what they hear. I can't wait for the next one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kraftwerk crafts another classic","review":"For fans of the electronic music movement, Kraftwerk's stature as pioneers in the early 1970's is undisputed. They achieved international stature with their hit \\"Autobahn\\" and continued through 6 major releases. They've been relatively quiet since their last major release \\"Electric Cafe\\" in 1987, but \\"Tour de France Soundtracks\\" shows them in prime form once again.The first 4 tracks hearken back to the expansive, panoramic sounds of Autobahn and Trans Europe Express, as they illustrate the passing French countryside seen through the vistas of the Tour. The next 6 tracks are more introspective, focusing on the details that drive the riders forward. Finally, they finish with a remake of their 1983 single \\"Tour de France.\\"All in all, a welcome return by Kraftwerk to the genre they helped to found."},{"rating":"2","title":"The return of Kraftwerk.","review":"Tour de France Soundtracks (2003) marks the studio return of Kraftwerk. The band renuites to work on a series of instrumental tracks for the Tour de France, sort of a concept album involving the world's most celebrated (and grueling) cycling extravaganza.

The problems seem too modern, and there is too much angst all around. The character of Hallie is not well developed; she turns into a one-dimensional monster. Some of the plot twists also don't ring true. Why was Oren fine when Ian was away at war, but suddenly stopped speaking when Ian moves to his own section of the house?

Most books I read fall under either this category or are just plain stupid right from the beginning.I am happy to say Housewrights does NOT fall under either of these two categories! It is a great read. Housewrights is actually a remarkably short book that tells a very detailed, complete story. The twins' relationship is fascinating, and I absolutely loved Lily. One sign of a good book is when you actually care about the characters. I actually cried during the last few pages of this one!Super writing, lovable characters, a plot that is interesting, background characters who are developed. Need I say more?

It sucks you right in and offers a wonderful sense of mystery (the relationship between the twins is quite mysterious), along with a great story.This book easily could have been a disaster in lesser hands. Romance, twins, historical setting...it's all elements for melodrama in someone else's book. But in this one, it all weaves together brilliantly. Perhaps the highest praise for a first novel, Mr. Corriveau knows when NOT saying anything is far more interesting than telling you too much. He's got the balance just right.BTW - I just recommended this to my friend for her bookclub.

However, today was the first time using it and was extremely disappointed. Upon following the instruction booklet that came with it, I refrigerated the insulated core case (not freezing, but refrigerating per the instructions) overnight for travel use today. We were on the road no more than an hour and the vials of meds were no longer cool but were just shy of room temperature. I was a little shocked at this. The case is very convenient for carrying everything, but certainly does not keep the meds cool as promises to up to 12 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I had three thumbs....","review":"I would give this book a three thumbs up review! Quincunx is an incredible writing feat. I can see why it took the author 12 years to complete. He has captured the essence of Dickens-like characters by getting into their skins. One would think he actually lived in the era of the incredible cast of characters. I loved the way Palliser re-capped throughout the book, using the characters to restate major events that had taken place many pages back. It isn't hard to get a bit turned around because of the many turns of events that take place. Just when the reader takes a deep breath of relief for the heroine and her son, something absolutely awful takes place and the roller coast ride is on.This is a page-turner that transports readers to not-so-jolly England."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the most enjoyable read ever","review":"i highly recommend this book. i read it about 4 years ago and i feel i could recite each chapter. the story is hyptnotic, the characters unforgettable. do not miss this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I've read and enjoyed lots of long books, but quit several hundred pages into this one.

Surely there are many other books with such detail that are not as grueling to read. My paperback edition has over 1,200 pages containing hundreds of characters, the backgrounds of all the family members of at least six different family lines, and an extremely convoluted plot. I love \\"getting lost\\" in a long novel, but about halfway through this one, I felt as if the author were presenting his readers with a test of endurance rather than a story to be enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping Challenge to Any Faith in Human Kindness","review":"This beautifully written book transports you into Victorian England. Even during the times you are not reading it you will still be breathing, thinking and feeling engulfed in that age and place. The plot, while superficially complicated, is in essence a challenge to any belief in alturism and human kindness. Slowly and methodically the innocence and trusting of the child protagonist is widdled away at by the notion that most people are inherantly selfish and greedy. The central character, who desperately wants to trust others, is betrayed over and over again by those he trusts. Yet, the intricacies of the plot overcome its depressing nature and compel the reader to finish the book to see whether human kindness triumphs in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"I just want to assure readers, that if you get a few hundred pages into this dog and feel like you've invested too much time to quit, you are wrong. The ending does not redeem this interminable mess, but will only leave you more frustrated. So after 200, 400, 600, even 800 pages into it, you will still gain a few hours on your life if you just walk away. Yes, take it from one who did finish, it is that bad. Would that I could get those hours back and invest them in ANYthing else.Understand, I am not uneducated, nor am I shy of long books (recent reads include The Stand, Pillars of the Earth and Atlas Shrugged) I've read War and Peace, I can even follow along in Umberto Eco's books, but this book promises only to frustrate and confuse. Don't even start it, but if you already have, do yourself a favor and quit now. You can never get the time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"I really why this book is rated so high. To me, this book is not that great.

The book contains so many unnecessarily lengthy sentences."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm too dumb","review":"Another book I was too dumb to follow. The plot twists and turns, crosses back on itself, and there are a million characters, half of whom are related to each other. I tried to take notes, as another reviewer had suggested, but I gave up on that. Felt too much like school work! I almost abandoned the book at about page 400 but decided to plow on. I wouldn't say this was a terrible book, but it's one that I won't keep and won't recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it ever end?","review":"As some other reviewers had done, I bought this book many years ago and only recently picked it up and began reading. It took me a couple of weeks to get through it and I must say that whereas the depiction of character and scene is quite remarkable I felt that the book would never end. Not because of the length of the book (although quite considerable) but due to the fact that every time you thought a conclusion was being reached the main character was yet again captured, beaten, trapped, etc..., It reminded me of the time many years ago when I tried watching a soap opera during lunch with my wife and after 2 weeks I was driven nuts by the fact that there was never a resolution to any of the vignettes. It just went on and on and on....,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This is a great book. I've read it twice. The first time was 15 years ago. I saw it on my shelf and thought I'd take another look at it and loved it just as much the second time. This is a complete oversimplification, but if you love mysteries, you have to read this book.

I've tried to read this book three separate times -- the first because of wonderful reviews and the second two times after I'd read The Unburied by the same author and loved it (you can SMELL the dankness of the old buildings he talks about and feel the splinters in your feet from the sagging, leaning stairways in those buildings). I thought if Palliser could write one book that was so very good, I needed to just get into the big one and it would be very good, as well. Well, I never found that out. Never got further than probably page 100 and that was only by having skipped several pages of exposition. So my recommendation? If you like loooooooooooooong books, this may be your cup of tea, but if not, skip it, read The Unburied and maybe whatever new Palliser has in store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I'm sorry, but no matter how good they say this book is, I just can't get to like it, let alone finish it. Not everyone is into Victorian-era adventures. I borrowed it in 1990 or '91 from the library after reading Roger Ebert's enthusiastic critique but just couldn't get into it. I tried going over it over the decades - to no avail. A few years ago I bought a copy at a used bookstore and started reading it again but couldn't get even halfway. It just doesn't interest everyone. While I agree that it is well written, this a must read for those who are deep into literature only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like \\"The Jungle\\" or the Book of Job","review":"This book mostly concerns how poor and abused a boy and his mom can become. Everytime you think they've hit bottom, it gets worse. I finished this book, not out of a sense of joy or discovery, but just to do it. I kind of wish I hadn't as the end was a waste.

And the plot ... god I hate plots that rely upon the endless stupidity of their protaganist to drive them onward.The plot ... nothing happens except in responce to some idiotic action by the main character.

Until Quincunx, I always finished a book once started, figuring that there might be a gem by the end and a bad beginning shouldn't be a deterent. After 400 pages, I gave up. The mother and son went from one bad decision to the next undetered by intelligent thought. Their decisions were totally implausible. I found this book to be all that is bad about Dickins, with none of the good.I passed my copy on to a series of friends, who like me, coulnd't finish it. Long, difficult, challenging books are wonderful when the characters and plot are well thought out. Unfortunately none of this is the case in Quinconx."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't pick it up","review":"I tried to get through this mammoth novel, but gave up after about 250 pages. I tried, I tried... but it was so poorly written, the characters so unconvincing, the 'dramatic' scenes so contrived and trivial, that I had to jack it in.

Give this thriller 100 pages, and I guarantee you, you will not be able to put it down. The novel's scope is enormous as is the intricacy of the plot. There is no wonder it took Palliser 10 years to write the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read this book, pack your bags--you'll be gone awhile","review":"Charles Palliser has created an accessable masterpiece. The comparisons to Dickens are valid, but even Dickens probably couldn't have imagined some of the plot twisting circumstances found in Quincunx.

It is at one of these lectures that Montmorency hears about the new sewage system and an idea forms in his head. Before long, Montmorency is conjuring up a plan to use the underground network to help him with his burglaries, but he needs a partner...or does he? This novel had great style and characterization.

I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Montmorency, The Sweet book","review":"MontmorencyEleanor Updale has out done herself this time. Montmorency is an awesome book. It takes place in London, England in the late 1800s. It is an adventure book and I recommend it for 6th grade on up. In spite of his fatal accident, Montmorency still has the urge to steal. He always wanted to be rich and live the big life. One day while Dr. Farcett was going to show Montmorencys wounds to the public. He overheard the conversation on the new sewer system. After he gets out of jail, he uses the sewers to steal stuff. Will he succeed in becoming rich? Read this super duper book to find out. This is a quite suspenseful book in parts. Also it shows how life is in the older days.This will certify that the above work is completely original.By Betty Johnson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for sequels","review":"Fast paced and elegant, this novel packs plenty of believable detail into this story of a thief's transformation into a decent 'gentleman'.

The doctor \\"puts him back together\\" and after serving his prison sentence, our thief becomes not only a \\"gentleman\\" but a daring burglar as well. Using the sewer system of London the burglar is very successful. He redeems himself with an act of courage and begins a new, honest, life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Solo Guitar","review":"Being a fan of jazz guitar, I have collected most of Linsky's CDs. This one is special because you only hear his guitar. Some of his other music is overpowered by flutes and other instruments. Although I like almost all of his music, this is a really great introduction to a great and little-know guitarist. I also think his choice of material for this solo CD could not have been much better. You may have a hard time accepting the fact that you are only hearing one guitar. There are not many artists that could get so many well-played notes from one guitar without overdubs. The only reason I gave this CD 4 stars is that the tempo on some of the songs is too fast for my taste. If you are familiar with the songs, you will notice this, but the music is so good--you will enjoy it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful accesorie for birthady's girl","review":"My little daughther loves hello kitty and she was very happy in her birthday with this accesorie in her dress.

If any DVD can teach dance successfully without personal coaching, this one can! 1.The music is great. 2. The teaching is easily understood. 3.The teachers are experts in their field. 4. It's a bargain! 5. It's huge! It will take years of free time to learn all the dances on this set. Drawbacks: One of the instructors is a bit tense teaching to a camera but his moves and verbal instructions are outstanding. Some of the outfits are now dated, but that is unavoidable. Overall, it's well done! If you can't afford individualized lessons, this DVD is the answer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"This is a collection of very old videos thrown together on a DVD.I had two of the videos.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for!","review":"I bought this DVD set mainly for the dances of the 50s and 60s DVD. I was wanting to learn those dances and it is impossible to find any DVDs that teach you these solo dances - it seems like everything is for partner dancing. Anyway, you'll learn the Alligator, the Swim, the Fly, the Monkey, the Mashed Potato, the Jerk, the Frug, the Shimmy, Watusi to name a few. The dances are broken down step by step and then at the end of a series of dances, you put them together in a \\"let's dance\\" segment.The dances are only demonstrated a few times so be prepared to rewind the DVD.I'm looking forward now to moving on to the 70s and 80s dances!This is a lot of fun and a great way to exercise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"called culligan","review":"great filter easy to install, works perfectly.

This week's replacement was different, though - we woke up to a HUGE flood in our kitchen with a ton of damage. Came back here and saw a number of other people have had the same problem. I can't quite see if it's the main part or the filter, but it sounds like it might be a breakdown of the base (although we don't see any cracks, but can see the leaks and drips all around the top part.)

Their is a noticeable difference in smell and taste and this replacement is a breeze to install. I changed ours after 1 year but I think it could have gone a bit longer as we are only two people, but I think it is good to have a routine to change it every year. I used to use a facet mounted filter and had to change them all the time and they were always in the way. This is much better and I really like the fact that you don't have to turn the water off to put in a new cartridge. Just hold with both hands and twist counterclockwise about 1/3 of a turn and it will pop down and then you push up the new one and twist back into position."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTER AT WORK","review":"All I have to say is...If you know anything about Masters at Work...particularly Kenny Dope, then this is the CD for you !

J. Graham correctly points out that the definition of postcondition is incorrect. This has been addressed. She also correctly notes that something is wrong with Figure 1-17; there was a problem in showing the box around PostingRule as a dashed outline, and I'm not sure why this was not corrected. However, I fail to see how these add up to 'so many glaring errors,' and I suggest that Ms. Graham forward notice of other errors she finds to APress for future correction.Mr. Ng, on the other hand, makes an assertion that is clearly false. The differences between the notations in Figure 1-13 are explained on the previous page; if he wishes to see an expression of which notation is 'better,' he'll have to find a different book. In the meantime, remarks such as 'sometimes you read it with lots of ambiguities come into your mind' is less than useful.

Lewis was the John Glenn (the astronaut) of his day! Chandler, the author, broke historical ground in pulling together the intrigues of an intriguing era. The author persuasively shows the possible motives several powerful men may have had in quietly disposing of Lewis. It is significant that the only mention of Lewis being prone to melancholy (suicidal) was a statement by Jefferson. Great reading: International intrigue (Spain), a corrupt General of the Army (Wilkinson), frontier murder, and retired President concerned about his public legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a greatest hits cd nothing new","review":"It would be cool if were actually a new album instead of just a greatest hits cd.They trick new listeners into buying this cd thinking its a new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not for 5\\"x8\\" calendar.","review":"This is not for 5\\"x8' calendar.

There was one reference to getting gasoline for $1.06 per gallon. Ahhh, those were the days.I wish the author went more into what was necessary to accomplish a whole year of RVing but all this book is is a listing of what they did. For example they would talk about going to an event and how they hooked up at a site but wouldn't discuss what one has to do to accomplish this. Even once would have been enlightening.As a light travelogue this is an OK read but it doesn't really bring a lot to the table when it comes to being the complete package about full timing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"This is a very well written book.

'Ultimate' by Lindsay Lohan (the star of the movie) is OK, I like her voice but the song could have done better. Simple Plan sucks and always will. Lillix's version of 'What I Like About You' is an insult. Ashlee Simpson's song 'Just Let Me Cry' sounds like a ballad but it's more of a rip off of No Doubt's song 'X-Girlfriend'. 'She Is Beautiful' by Andrew W.K is good, he's got better music on his new album \\"The Wolf\\" though. In all, this soundtrack isn't that bad but it's not the best either.

There isn't one on this CD.AS for the music itself, I've heard better, and I've heard worse. Some of the songs are good (like \\"Ultimate\\", What I Like About You\\" \\"Happy Together\\", and \\"What A Wonderful World\\"), while others aren't that good (the other songs on this soundtrack).

The \\"Pick-Up\\" documents the love-affair of two alcoholic losers who are so hopeless that they decide to commit suicide fifty pages through the novel. They don't succeed. This and other sordid incidents comprise the book's \\"plot\\", all culminating in a surprise ending that has lost its shock value in recent years and doesn't add too much to the book's meaning. I still recommend it, especially if you enjoy wallowing in the grimier aspects of human existence. Favorite passage: \\"She let her hair go uncombed. She skipped wearing her stockings.

Forget Superman, Batman, or the Avengers- these people have lived in harrowing circumstances. One survivor was born in the ominously named \\"Total Control Camp\\"-another was imprisoned because her friend was a lover of Kim Jong-Il and knew the pillow talk. One survivor found spiritual sustenance in literature likeAnna Karenina,Resurrection (Oxford World's Classics), and was inspired byThe Count of Monte Cristoto escape.

It looked like it might have the same types of flaws.If your wrenches are extra long (as I guess some expensive premium wrenches are)this item may perhaps work for you.If your wrenches are, as in my case, a set you bought on X-mas special at ACE, this wrench roll is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good materials + bad design = worthless","review":"Remarkably good materials and construction for a product that simply doesn't work.Pockets are too deep for wrenches, chistle sets, everything. You must up-end the roll and shake out the wrench you want, or squeeze it out. Imagine trying to retrieve the lost string in the waistband of your swimsuit and you'll get an idea of how awkward it is.

But don't take my for it, just check out O'Reilly's errata page. The most astonishing thing is that they accidentally omitted an entire chapter. Even after I painstakingly marked every correction in the errata list, I was finding more errors constantly. The other major fault is that it is just too full of ideology, which has its place of course, but he's gone way overboard with it in a book that should be primarily about the language.

Unfortunately, it is riddled with novice programming mistakes, has a poor and unmaintainable programming style, and displays many of the things that are widely considered to be \\"worst practise\\" in C++ programming. The coverage of the STL is poor and its proper use is not encouraged as it should be. I'm glad I never had the misfortune of ever having bought it. There are many, many other books that cover C++, and nearly all of them cover it better.If you're looking for a good book to learn C++, buy anything but this one.

The author does a masterful job of portraying the Holmes and Watson we've grown to love, while placing them into a completely alien environment--the United States. Many have tried this and failed, but Christopher Leppek does a near-perfect job. The plot is appropriately dramatic and, while historically unlikely, it's skillfully constructed and has a definite ring of authenticity. It's pure fiction, of course, but a good author can persuade his reader not to care-- and I found Mr. Leppeck to be a very good author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on process, low on recipe's","review":"The book covers the process of smoking well.

You get recipes for different kinds of brines, seasonings, basting techniques and just about anything else you'll need to know for smoking.This is a MUST HAVE book IMO! You can't beat the detailed in depth instructions on how to smoke and cure just about anything.

This studio recording tries to make the best of the singers/actors and the band they have, but unfortunately this recording loses to lack of talent!I'm sorry to say it, but Alice Haywood as Eva is dreadful. Gone is the singing, gone is the acting, all we are left with is a poorly pronouncing, screaming, annoying, unmoving performance. I would be grateful if Ms. Haywood would kindly inform me as to where 'Bwaynoz Ayreez' is!Other performances are bearable, but the band loses the lyrical touches of Lloyd Webber's score, leaving this an unmoving, unanything recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evita","review":"Unsatisfied.

You will often find yourself doing thoings you didn't want to, or trying unsuccesfully to perform a manuever you should be able to pull off. Also, the enemy intelligence is not up to par with other games. Many enemies will just stare at, not even trying to shoot you.

The camera takes a couple of seconds to turn to your back- the normal camera view- so while you are waiting for that, you are getting shot, and you can't fire back, because you can't see, because the camera is facing the wrong way.

Not only this, it's so riciculous and poorly written that you might find it hard to believe Ms. Sweetnam herself wrote it (and she apparently writes all her lyrics). Skye Sweetnam's debut album will be released soon, and it doesn't take a genius to see that she will not be a success.

I'm actually anxious to hear her surely \\"spunky\\" debut. But this song is vapid, boring, and completely predictable. A tale of G-rated \\"rebellion\\", the track describes the feeling of not wanting to go to school and \\"feel for once what it's like to rebel now\\".

The music drones on and on in your ears with lyrics that neither work as song (no rhyming schemes or rhythmic patterns are used at all), or as storytelling devices usually used to move the plot forward. The visuals are about as backyard as any low-budget student film, and the direction almost non-existent.The story itself is repugnant featuring many scenes of human-beings being disemboweled for entertainment (this is all shown in graphic detail), and lyrics about cutting holes in woman to have sex with them.No decent person with any heart at all could derive enjoyment from garbage like this.

The majority of the singing was awkward and halfhearted and the music had virtually no musicality.I give it one star for some impressive visuals, and one more just for \\"Zydrate Anatomy\\", which even I'll admit is pretty fantastic. There would be another half star for actually managing to make Paris Hilton look attractive, but it's cancelled out by that awful song \\"Seventeen\\" that would have been alright if it weren't so completely out of place in the movie.If you do want to see it, I urge you to rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling Dizzy","review":"The music is spectacular.

Its not a great film, but its not aiming for that. its different, the songs are catchy, its a little violent and its a little weird.

Although it sets the stage of being a very interesting story, it falls short with shallow characters and very poorly written songs. Apparently Repo! tries to be \\"cool\\" and current with today's \\"rock\\" generation, but it falls prey to being so \\"cool\\" that it becomes shallow instead. The level of acting couldn't be any lower, every character's difference is only tied to his or her background, which is not enough to make you feel attached to them, especially in an opera or musical. Character development is important in musicals and operas, and Repo! has none of this whatsoever. Scenery is pretty bad to say the least, it looks like someone just filmed it on an abandoned house they found, so I would say its step above YouTube quality.There are many more worthy operas out there that are much better than Repo! It may seem like a \\"hip\\" opera for our generation, but don't fall prey to it, its an opera without soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Decline","review":"One interesting thing about societies in decline is that their members are the last to know. Is \\"Repo\\", artistic, creative, intelligent, even entertaining? If you think so then, well then, good luck. Song and musical quality not even in the same Earth (ball park) as \\"Rocky\\" or \\"Phantom\\"; maybe a grade school musical. CGI was cheaply flat/static with little depth or detail. Special effects - e.g. the plastic sheeting used in walk-in freezers; typical blood filled syn skin prosthetics. Acting?

It's just a plain fun movie. Yes, there is singing. Yes, the plot is a bit melodramatic at times. But this is what true opera is like: singing and melodrama and everything else.

I don't think there's anything else out there quite like this - which some people may say is a good thing (considering it won a Razzie), but I disagree. I think all of the actors gave spot on performances, even Hilton. Anthony Head is absolutely brilliant, he's such an amazing actor. He doesn't get enough credit, imo. This is a movie that I will watch time and time again.If you're thinking, hey, I loved the Saw movies, so I'm going to watch this...think again. This is nothing like Saw.

Used to be Europe was the source of cruddy \\"music\\" (- if you think ABBA is bad, for example, listen to what the Swedes were listening to BEFORE they came along! It will actually make you appreciate that band). There are scraps of decent melodies that start here and there in Repo, but they never gel into effective songs. No matter what you think of Sarah Brightman, she can actually sing; too bad they waste her here along with all the rest.

Besides, all of the dialog seems to be written by teenage goths who work at hot topic, and even though they have a good idea they don't understand the concept of story telling so they fail all over the damn thing.It is good for a laugh, but not much else.

The entire soundtrack was completely forgettable and seemed to be lacking lyricism.I really thought the plotline had potential (how cool does an organ repossessor sound?), and you could certainly tell the actors were giving it their all, but the movie just doesn't pull it off.

It scratched the door up pretty good. She got in the closet within 5 minutes of her bed time. They do not slide well, they seem to get snagged between the door folds and rub off the finish.

The differences come in three varieties, first that the recoding was done in the round with the two halves of the orchestra surrounding the conductor and microphones, giving a real sense of being surrounded by the performance. The second major difference is the speed of recording; it is much faster than the usual standards. The third difference is that it is much more involving than the usual reproductions, the passion takes flight and you are carried along by the words and music.I highly recommend that you get a copy of this to show how Operatic the ladies of Leipzig thought it when they wrote to the town council complaining of the Opera Comedy played in church on Easter...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic functions only","review":"A good tool with basic error code readout for OBD1 equipped vehicles.

A quote on the box cover likens the film to Donnie Darko or Rushmore (which are two strange movies to liken to each other in the first place) and that's hard to understand in any tangible sense, other than that all three center around a bizarre teenager. There are more parallels with Donnie Darko, but nothing very close.This film is somehow escapes being depressing and falling off into psychotic melodrama (like Rosie or The Princess and the Warrior), and doesn't push any message to center stage, and avoids the pitfalls of becoming a morality piece or some sappy tale of a misfit.It's really well done and will have you thinking on it for quite some time.

The mountain from the beginning looms ominous. Seventeen year old Noi live within a very small network of people. He is loved, but he is lost. No wonder. There is not much future imaginable in this town.He rejects school, he rejects work. A desire for evasion is secretly burning but without consequences. When he finally tries to do something, he fails. And on that night, his entire \\"community\\" is destroyed. He is left with a toy viewer through which he dreams of Hawai'i. The end.Oh, but Iceland.

It is a really fun romantic comedy, though, and I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. The seventies music in the soundtrack worked well, and the subplots were enough to keep you involved. Think of this as sort of around the same tone as \\"Picture Perfect\\", but with more well-rounded characters... Really well done, and quite romantic.

However, I have two major problems with these cuts.

However, her 4th album and some \\"bonus tracks\\" made at the same time are really bad as her voice has faded and she sounds no better than my wife. So there is nothing here, which anyone who has been around for awhile, would find enticing.So even though her first 3 albums got OK marks, this one must get a D- or an F."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going in Reverse","review":"I thought that the 5 songs from Miss Church's first CD were the highlight of this GH album.

An album of this type was not a good idea at this stage of her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of What???????????????","review":"I've listened to all of the Charlotte Church albums and the selections which have been included in this \\"Best Of\\" album are worse than any single album she has had out yet. If Charlotte made these selections, then she should find some other line of work because she doesn't know good songs from mediocre and bad. This album will undoubtedly be the worst seller of any of her 5 albums to date. Don't waste your money on Prelude - Its a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prelude??????????????????????????","review":"The title of this album appears to be a total contradiction in terms. A prelude is at the beginning. The \\"best of\\" anything is typically reserved for the end. I can accept a prelude for the songs in this CD as they sound as if she is practicing and developing her voice. She certainly has a long ways to go before being considered a credible singer. She must get more emotion into her voice. She sounds like she is in a recital rather than meaning what she is singing. She is OK for a novice. However, something like this should be given away as a demo as opposed to going for full price. For curiosity seekers only."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Has Been Left Out.","review":"For a girl who had relatively few well sung songs, its a shame that most of those have been left out of this album. Its obvious that the people in her organization and the buying public have differing views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte is no Jenny Lind","review":"I had heard enough about Charlotte Church that I thought that I would listen to her Greatest Hits album and judge for myself. As it turns out, I cannot see this CD even being considered good as a stand-alone album, let alone a Best Of album. Charlotte, in my opinion is vastly over-rated and is no better than many local girls who sing in my area. If she is going to keep singing, she better sing some original songs because virtually any girl can sing the songs from this album as good as she can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I'm not a skeptic, pessimist, whatever. I really, really like Charlotte Church's voice. To me, it's gorgeous singing, and most of the songs I really liked. \\"Bali H'ai\\", \\"The Flower Duet\\", \\"Habanera\\" (which sounded good to me!!), \\"Panis Angelicus\\" (my personal favourite) and many more. But really, if you haven't already, you should purchase her first 3 CD's, which are even better.She should start recording again. It may have been a bit too early to record a Greatest Hits CD---she should make, probably, about a dozen or so more albums until she does that. Premature? Yes, but I like her voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the \\"Best Of\\" Charlotte Church, I would dread hearing her worst!!!!","review":"I have heard of Charlotte Church, and had to check out this particular CD from a public library to see what all the buzz was about. Ms. Church's voice is so thin and lacks any resonance, it makes my flesh crawl listening to it. Who is the schmuck that signed this gal to a recording contract, thinking she actually had singing talent? The musical selections she attempts to sing here do not match her vocal style. Either that, or her vocal instructor needs to be fired! The only song in this set worth a tolerable listen is \\"The Prayer\\" in which she shares vocals with Josh Groban. The rest of the album may satisfy those who appreciate an immature singing style that is somewhat reminiscent of chalk screeching across a blackboard! No thanks Charlotte, I'll stick with Sarah Brightman, Celine Dion, or Judy Collins for an \\"easy on the ears\\" female voice and REAL talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why 4 & 5??","review":"Charlotte should have quit while she was ahead. That is, after her 3rd album, she should have taken a break for school or whatever, because her 4th album Enchantment and this her 5th, which is selections from the first 4, really show that her voice is gone, or at least going.Charlotte never did have the voice that any of the Divas have. Even Mariah Carey said that Charlotte would never be a pop singer. \\"Prelude\\" confirms that. Just listen to how bad the song \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" sounds. Its even worse than the Johnny Cash version. Apparently this CD had to be made because of her contract. Well that's their problem. Don't make it yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"When I first heard of Charlotte Church people told me she was an amazing singer with a mature opera voice. After listening to her songs I realized that the people who told me this do not understand what a mature opera voice is. They think since she has vibrato she is amazing. What she really sounds like is a young girl with vibrato."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an intelligent move by her record label","review":"This CD is not worthwhile of my time, my money, or anyone's time and money for that matter. I don't know why anyone would want to buy this CD---true opera lovers will be appalled by this poor excuse for opera, broadway lovers not be impressed with all the great vocal CDs out there, and I have no idea why any popular music fans would like this music. Ms. Church's voice is by far NOT ready to record a CD---a \\"best of\\" CD by a mistrained mimicker is quite humorous. Buy this CD if you need a good laugh, but if you want to listen to a singer that actually has talent and will keep your attention, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"R&B For Charlotte","review":"If a bird can be annoying as in a Rooster Crowing in the morning, some people will like it. A dog can bark in the nights we sleep, some People will like it. A human voice so light, so vibrated within their own dimensions, people will like it, but not I. I never really saw the beauty of opera, agitating to the ears, just like a Rooster calling on it's hens. With that said, Charlotte needs to turn to Blues Rock or R&B. Yes, Boogie style Blues Rock, she has the voice for it. No matter how many here perceive Opera or know what should sound good, no opera singer could ever sing Blues without a voice and a heart for it. Not One! So why should a girl with soulful music embedded in her, do the same? I say, \\"it's time to really Rock Charlotte!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Now I am not by any means a Charlotte Church fan. I think she always had a pretty lousy technique but when she was younger, she at least had a pretty tone and she could hit high notes fairly well. But in the songs here off Enchantment, she sounds almost like an alto! What happened to her voice? I'd always hoped that when she got older, she would get a good voice teacher and train her voice to its full potential. But now it appears that it will never happen. A bit sad, isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break - please!!","review":"No more Charlotte Church, OK? The record companies have milked her for all she's worth, and that's a shame. But a 16-year old (her age at the time this CD came out) with a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album?! You've got to be joking! The money grubbing doesn't get any more blatant than this. She's 18 now (and quite well off financially), and spends much of her time on vacations with various boyfriends, smoking, eating (seen pictures of her of late - she's packed on some major poundage), and partying. You might say that's \\"normal\\" 18-year old, rebellious behavior. I call it shameful, especially on her parent's part. Charlotte, do something with your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Voice Poor - Selection of Songs","review":"Charlotte Church has a good voice at least to my ears. I thik the problem with this CD is the selection of music and songs. It's not exactly a good representation of her capabilities. But if you like Charlotte Church you should not be displeased."},{"rating":"1","title":"too pretty too bad","review":"This album is appropriately dubbed as greatest hits. Appropriately because, judging by how much the voice has deteriorated over the last 4 years, it's unlikely that we'll see more of Charlotte Church's albums. What's needed now is a skilled vocal coach who might (!) be able to restore Church's originally pretty soubrette soprano back to the way it sounded when \\"A voice of an angel\\" was recorded. Big labels, shame on you. A talent needs to be nurtured and brought up SLOWLY, so that it could first develop into something. By shamelessly exploiting Charlotte's adorable looks and youth, Sony executives have ruined a promising career before she could even develop into a real opera singer.Charlotte, if you're reading this, STOP singing now and look for a good teacher. Or just be content as one of richest children in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE IT STOP!!!","review":"I have never claimed to be a fan of Charlotte Church's. From the beginning I found her voice to be incredibly annoying (and I sang opera at the time so I know a lot of voices for comparison). I didn't think she could get any worse, but lo and behold, she did. I really hope this is her last CD, and for crying out loud, can we stop making CDs by 12-year-old British sopranos and wannabe \\"crossover\\" performers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same.","review":"As others have noted, this CD brings nothing new to the table. The \\"new\\" songs have the same problem that Enchantment had and that is that she had lost most of her voice when they were recorded. I am very disappointed that something better than this could not have been released after such a disappointment as Enchantment. But maybe this is as good as she will ever be. If so, she needs to look for new musical genres. The ones included herein are not compatible with her voice any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Early For A Best Of","review":"I was hoping that Charlotte Church would bring us something fresh and new after her disappointing Enchantment Album. However, all we are receiving with Prelude are some of the same things which made Enchantment so disappointing. Charlotte is far too young and her songs far too immaturely performed for them to be compiled for a \\"Best Of\\" CD. She needs to wait about 20 years and then include some original material songs in a \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Best Of\\" CD. At that time, she will look back and conclude that most of the songs included on \\"Prelude\\" are the \\"Worst Of\\" not the \\"Best Of\\" Charlotte Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Reinforcement","review":"In my opinion, Charlotte's label chose a very poor time to release a compilation of her songs from her first 4 albums. There are many faults with the way she sings; not the least of which is the fact she no long can sing with any sort of volume to her voice. While many of her faults can be attributed to age, we do not need to be reminded of this with a re-hash of many of those songs which showcase these faults. Hopefully this CD will be pulled from circulation until she can legitimately present a compilation of professionally-correct sung songs. A \\"best\\" compilation fo a 16-year-old is as silly as the book she wrote about her life at the age of 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prelude???? To What???","review":"The title of this album struck me as a contradiction so I thought I would check it out. A more appropriate name would be \\"Postcript\\" As an artist on the way down and out, I can't imagine what would be next other than a long lay-off to get her voice together. Another problem here is that Charlotte gives us too many songs which are from the most recent period when her voice was just a whisper of what it was as a pre-teen. We needed to hear more from her first two albums when she was something of a wunderkid, belting out big-time vocals with a little body.I see this CD as being coveted by only the most die-hard of Charlotte's fans. It really brings us nothing new and reminds us of what happened to her voice through abuse and overuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prelude to The Best","review":"I believe that the title of this CD is gramatically incorrect. It should read \\"A Prelude To The Best Of Charlotte Church. I say that because what is included in this CD cannot possibly be her best within her entire lifetime. All of the songs are juvenile and child-like renditions. As one reviewer commented, she needs another 10 or so albums before she is ready for a \\"Best of\\" or \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. For her age, she sings fine. However, I would not attempt to advertise these works as anything special, because they are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like The Beginning","review":"This was the first time I had an opportunity to listen to Charlotte Church, however, I did not feel like I was listening to a \\"Best Of\\" collection; rather, it sounded like a demo which a high school girl was submitting to a record company. Granted, the production values are considerably above the \\"demo\\" level, but Charlotte's singing is not. Give this a 3/4 as a demo but only a 1 for a Best Of album which she is not ready to produce yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Professional","review":"I know that in pop music, you find a lot of artists who can't really sing. But, given the type of songs which are covered in this CD, I would have expected a high-level vocalist to be used. What I hear is a little choir-girl whose renditions are reminiscent of a caroler who recently sang in front of my house.This type of thing may be O.K. for shopping malls and the like, but should never have been released on a CD. It is very amateurish and makes me wonder what the future of music will be if this is the best a label like Sony can muster for the holidays. Not worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad to the Bone","review":"Please turn this one off. Better yet: don't even put it in the CD drawer. No voice. She can't sing. This is bad, very bad. Give us all a break. The music? Two stars? I don't even know at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 1-Song Wonder","review":"I listened to the songs on this album because I heard the song \\"All Love Can Be\\" in a movie. I would buy the aforementioned song as a single, however nothing else here, in my opinion, is worth listening to. She has the formula for success with the above song and should stick with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Rate","review":"I heard Charlotte sing on TV and it was pretty bad, but sometimes live music can get screwed up by the sound system, so I listened to this album to see if she was really better than that. But the songs here are just as bad. I mean the songs are good but her singing is really juvenile. Maybe when she was 12 it was kind of amazing, but as a full grown girl her singing is strictly 2nd and 3rd rate. She should wait a few years and see if her voice gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Alpha and Omega","review":"Its a shame that Charlotte's career had to end so tragically. In the 4 years she was singing, she never realized the promise she hinted at while a 12-year-old. I guess the songs in this album will show you what might have been had she ever really got serious about singing. However you will be able to hear why the critics came down on her so often. Other than being able to reach some high octaves, she lacks in virtually every department including range, control, feeling and that charisma which most in the business possess. Such a pretty face. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"I can't get enough of this CD and DVD! It absolutely ROCKS!! This gal is so talented. A must-have selection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit Smoking - Charlotte!!","review":"Like most people who have reviewed this CD, I too have noticed that Charlotte's voice has become much worse after her 3rd album. When I listened to her try and sing Bridge Over Troubled Water, and heard how weak and clouded her voice sounded, it reminded me that 3 out of every 4 pictures I see of her lately, she is smoking a cigarette. I can never recall any diva who is in her best voice who smokes. In my humble opinion, its the cigarettes which are ruining Charlottes voice. She needs to get rid of the cigarettes and start puffing out some golden throated songs like she did when she was 12. Otherwise, they can title this CD, \\"The Last of Charlotte Church\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...the negativity astonishes me","review":"Why are so many people hell bent on smearing this young woman?? Every track on this album is excellent. I could care less: 1. WHO wrote the songs 2. If her voice completely flawless every second. 3. If she publicly puts her foot in her mouth once in a while. Who hasn't?? My personal favorite is her rendition of Amazing Grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrifying.","review":"Why would anyone have a prepubescent or teenage girl singing the Habanera? It is for a rather sizeable mezzo soprano who has some life experience to help interpret it. And that's for a reason: it was written for a woman with that particular voice, maturity, and training. Let others assay it at their peril.Similarly could be said for everything she has sung from the opera repertoire.Repertoire has been chosen for this poor child with total disregard for her age, instrument, and training.It's horrifying. Please don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Very Pretty Songs","review":"For anyone who enjoys beautiful songs, this album is probably for you. Every song on the album is virtually a standard and Miss Church does a very good job with the vocals. Others have said that she falls short of the originals. However that could be said of anyone since the originals were all performed by different people.In addition to Charlotte's singing, these songs are well produced. A CD like this will make a welcome addition to your auto CD player on a long trip. A definet consideration for purchase here."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"Best Ofs\\" Yet","review":"I believe that a CD of this nature is way too premature for Charlotte Church. None of the songs included have received any radio play and the only time I've have heard them other than from her CDs have been on TV Shows where her label has paid to have her on. At her age, she is little more than a novelty which began to wear off after her first album, Voice of an Angel.She needs to record more of her own material if she is ever to attain a credible position in the music world. Then she can legitimately present \\"The Best of Charlotte Church\\", as opposed to the best of others. Considering that Charlotte's covers of these songs are, most likely, the weakest we will ever hear, to call them the \\"Best of\\" is a gross misnomer. This CD should be pulled from circulation until a real \\"Best Of\\" is developed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Progress","review":"I've listened to Charlotte since she first began singing and while she appeared to be brilliant at first with Pie Jesu, there has been little, if any progress since that time. In fact, I must agree with some others who note that her voice is not as strong as it once was. Considering she has a voice coach, it is somewhat baffling that her vocal control has not improved. And while her range seems somewhat broader, she appears to be straining to reach the lower notes in Habanera. Bridge Over Troubled Waters also seems very weak and should have been left off of this compilation in favor of some of her earlier numbers.This album simply left me with a bad taste in my mouth about Charlotte's singing career to date. She needs to take some time off and improve before continuing with recorded music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Star","review":"It was really sad to hear some of the more recent songs sung by Charlotte in this CD. They are just a fraction of what she was singing 4 years ago. I'm not sure whether it was puberty or just bad habits which caused her demise. Whatever the case, it is sad to hear how far she has dropped in ability. She is now at a very normal level for girls her age, but is nothing special any more and not worth listening to. I think that her best material is in her first two albums, so you would be better off in acquiring them and then creating your own \\"Best Of Charlotte Church\\" CD from those two. Anything after that is kids stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Goodbye of Sorts","review":"I would assume by the songs on this CD that Charlotte is saying goodbye to the world as far as her singing is concerned. From her first known song, Pie Jesu, to the final song on her Enchantment CD, \\"The Prayer\\" with Josh Groban, she lays out a career which, while having some bright spots early on, ends with her back on a level vocally where most girls her age reside. Prelude omits many songs which were some of the bright spots in her career. This may be so that a re-issue can take place later on. The songs herein are really not on any real commercial level, so they will interest only the curiosity seeker."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Need Feelings, Not Just Notes","review":"When I was first introduced to Charlotte Church via the Classical Showcase Channel, she showed tremendous promise, even though she was singing in essentially two octaves. Reviewing, Prelude, I find that she still can only sing with any authority within that two octave range. In the meantime, her voice is certainly not as strong as it once was. Additionally, she continues to sing as if it were a rehersal, with no emotion, as if she was simply a studio singer for hire. For anyone with an ear for music, her totally structured approach to singing is a turn-off. She needs to begin to feel her music and her audience will begin to feel her. Until then, her songs will remain sterile and unappealing to the patrons of the arts.S. PresserVocal InstructorLos Angeles Academy of Fine Arts"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Selection","review":"Charlotte Church has enough of a problem with her failing voice, so that she doesn't need a poor selection of songs to further add to a what has to be one of the worst albums ever released alleging to be the best of an artist. She brings a brilliant Josh Groban into sing The Prayer with her which only shows how inept she is vocally compared to Groban. She also performs Habanera which makes her sound rediculous straining to reach down to an octave well out of her reach. She also leaves Carrickfergus, which was somewhat of a shining star in the black hole which was her previous album, out completely. This album is best left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Major League Material","review":"After listening to the songs in \\"Prelude\\" it is hard for me to believe that this artist lasted until her 5th album. Her voice is strictly minor league, so I can only assume that she had a long-term contract which could not be broken by her record company. Hopefully she will go down to the minor leagues and attempt to improve her voice before and if she ever returns to a major label again. This record may appeal to small children, but I heard nothing which would be of any interest to an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post-Mortem - Not Prelude","review":"Based on the selections from this album, it should appropriately be called \\"The Last of Charlotte Church\\". Its been no secret that her voice had been in a state of steady decline and that she can no longer sing the songs she sang as a 12-year-old. If nothing else, this CD walks us through an anthology of her songs which chronicles her decline right down to a warbling attempt at the song \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\"; a rendition considered so bad that it was dropped from her last album. It could also be a good lesson for any aspiring teen singer on how NOT to proceed in a singing career; with the resulting adverse consequences painfully obvious as you progress into the songs from her 4th album. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this recording to anyone who simply is looking for some singing enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"charlotte church greatest hits","review":"I was introduced to Charlotte Church's music when I saw one of her concerts on PBS.

That aside, the Ms. Church's voice and the selection of songs (especially the three duets) are something that you don't easily shake from your mind after waking up. That's especially true when you set your DVD to \\"shuffle\\" and \\"repeat\\" so that it playe all night after you fall asleep. Incredible! What's become of her in recent years anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of Charlotte Church is missing one of the best","review":"I am blessed with the spiritual songs of Charlotte, but I think Prelude is missing the \\"Lord's Prayer,\\" which I believe is one of the best, if not the best. Besides, the mixing of the spiritual with the somewhat music \\"of the world\\" does not do so much good, because I feel that according to our tendencies to love God and the Virgin Mary, or to love the world, one will love one or the other, and I don't think that we shouldn't love both, because nothing is this world can save, except entertain, console, etc. Therefore, I think that there should be a best of the spiritual and a best of the world of Charlotte Church, and for her sake, she should continue much more more in the spiritual side, because, I feel she is going much more into the music of the world which, although pleasurable, I know, it cannot save.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEST OF???????????????????????????","review":"I took time to listen to this CD at a listening station at a local record store. This was the first time I had heard anything by this artist. I could not believe that this was the Best Of album. If that is the case, then how on earth did anyone see fit to but the albums from which the selections herein were picked. My daughter can sing this well and she has never had as much as a single lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a singer of light classical and pop, I was disappointed to hear Charlotte's progression (digression) from a child prodigy to what amounts to being a pedestrian vocalist. I concur with another reviewer who suggested they should have re-issued her first CD \\"Voice of an Angel\\". However even that work could not even hold a candle to 12-year-old Aselin Debison. Charlotte needs to go to a conservatory of music and attempt to recapture whatever she had early on. Prelude can only be interpreted as a prelude to retirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Songs To Select From","review":"I have a very big problem with an album like this (Best of) being released to soon after the beginning of an artist's career. Charlotte Church does not have much in the way of distinguished songs in the brief 3 to 4 years she has been singing professionally. So it is much too early in her career to put out any type of an album like this. I can only think that Sony is dropping her and that this CD is a way of fulfilling their contract. A very bad release."},{"rating":"1","title":"This girl has vocal problems","review":"I was reviewing Charlotte Church's CD because I had heard her live in Cincinnati on 12/3. At that show, she was so bad that people booed her off the stage. So, I wanted to see if she just had a bad night or was her voice really that bad. Well, after listening to \\"Prelude\\" which is suppose to be her best, I have concluded that her voice simply isn't up to a professional level. She sounds like my sister in the shower. It also sounds like her voice has been getting weaker and raspier as she has been getting older. I also agree with some of the others who have reviewed this singer, who have said that her best singing was at a much younger age. She should not be singing, especially live, until her she can change her voice for the better. It is simply not what anyone wants to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Songs","review":"I believe that the reason so many people do not like this album is because whomever selected the songs did a very poor job. In my opinion, where charlotte shines would be in the Rest of Charlotte Church not the Best of Charlotte Church. Check previous albums for better songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?","review":"This CD is a joke! I'm not throwing any pun towards Church or her music but for someone who has been the music business for only 5 years at the most, having a \\"Best Of\\" CD was a bad move. I can't believe that she'd have a greatest hits CD out so soon at the age of only 16.In fact, I'm not sure if she actually did approve of the release of this muddled collection. At 16, her voice is still in the process of maturing and there are many obstacles ahead before it'll be an acceptable time to release a hits CD.Much of the music is bombastically overdone and the vocals on her material on the songs from \\"Enchantment\\" was overdone to an unbearable level, worse yet, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" sounds more like she had a cold or something.Sorry, but even with 18 tracks, this CD doesn't even deserve to exist!End of story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Time is Not a Charm","review":"I had purchased Charlotte's last CD \\"Enchantment\\" at K-Mart. In addition to the regular songs, they added 4 \\"bonus\\" songs as a test-marketing promotion. However, the 4 songs were not received well, especially Bridge Over Troubled Water, which sounded as if Charlotte had a cold. Accordingly, the 4 songs were dropped from the regular album. So, subsequently we have a \\"Best Of\\" CD and there are those 4 songs including Bridge Over Troubled Water included again, without re-doing the vocal tracks.As others have noted, there are some of her better songs missing from this CD including Carrickfergus and Danny Boy, although Danny Boy is on the DVD. In addition, Habanera should have never been sung by Charlotte let alone be in this album. That song was meant to be sung by a mezzo. If they were going to do an album like this, they should have polled her fan clubs first. This is a very poor selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Immaterial Girl","review":"I disagree with those who say that Charlotte's voice is bad or that she can't sing. She certainly has a better voice than many of the \\"pop\\" singers I've heard of late. The problem is with the songs she sings. They have almost all been done before, and the versions which were done before were clearly superior to hers. \\"All Love Can Be\\" was new and she did a credible job there. \\"Just Say Hello\\" was also new but was marred with so much controversy as to become a nullity in a musical sense. So, Charlotte is not bringing much of anything new to the table in this compilation and the novelty of her young age is no longer applicable. I would agree with some other reviewers in that she must come in with more original songs to have any material impact on the music world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can We Turn Back The Clock?","review":"Charlotte was a tough act to follow as a 12-year-old and that goes even for herself at an older age. She never came back to the form and voice she had with Voice of an Angel and this album, Prelude, is a testament to that. I'm not really sure what the title \\"Prelude\\" signifies, but the fact is that Charlotte has seen her best days as a singer. The 4 \\"new\\" songs which she has in this CD, when compared to the 5 songs from VOAA will aptly demonstrate that. I believe that they would have been better off releasing some of Charlotte's \\"live\\" performances as a 12 and 13-year-old. That is something that the public could remember her by. This album simply presents a downward spiral."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesson in singing to early.","review":"This album should have never been made. None of Charlotte Church's albums should have been made. She was too young and her voice was too fragile. She should have been singing in church choirs not huge stages. This album is horrible. Her technique and breathing is horrendous and her pitch is not placed at all. With a lot of training she may and I emphasis may have been able to sing in a opera choir but her voice is not impressive, despite her age and all she will do is ruin it. I'm not sure if that really matters though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel bad for Charlotte","review":"There's no denying the girl has talent, but enough for opera? I don't think so. I'm no professional, but her voice is weak to my ears. She's raspy, airy and sounds just plain weak. She doesn't sing from her stomach, but from the back of her throat. Very annoying to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"The voice from Hell","review":"Let's hope that this is the last of Charlotte Church. Her voice is just AWFUL!!!

However, you have to be careful. If your path reaches the edge of the board, then you are out of the game. It is very simple to learn and play, but difficult to master. I believe that almost any age can enjoy this game, and since it can be played with up to eight players, with games lasting only 10-20 minutes, it is a good choice for parties and small gatherings.

The voice with which the stories are told is more common than McCourt's (in my opinion almost contrived) loftiness, and the image I most often had in mind was Connelly as my own father, telling random stories from memory as they occurred to him, and as he remembered them.

It is brand new why do I need it repaired?Thanks.Joe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Drill Press!!!!","review":"I decided to write this review since it didn't have a very good rating. I've had my drill press since April 2008 and I use it quite often. I haven't had any problems. It does everything I need. It drills very straight without wobble. I do woodworking and pen turning. It was easy to set up, although it was very heavy so I needed assistance placing the top portion on the lower portion. Like one reviewer wrote, it's a table top but it's not small. It's works and acts like a full size press. If you're looking for a press that is portable or that you can move around your bench, this isn't for you. I put mine on a cabinet I built that has wheels so I can move it around the garage.I would highly recommend it.***May 25, 2010 Update***Still using the drill press, a lot, and still working great and I would still recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great drill press","review":"I was looking for a benchtop drill press, and decided to get the jet. It is called a bench top drill press but i think that it is a full size drill press on a short pole. The table top is the biggest in its class. Changing speeds and setting the depth stop are excellent. Spend the extra money for a 3/4 hp instead of a 1/2 or 1/3 hp. Just another great jet product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-built and does the job.","review":"Overall, I am happy with this machine. It is well-built, but there is a slight wobble in the chuck. This could, however, be how I installed it. I'm going to try redoing that.It is larger and higher than I expected for a benchtop drill press. It is very heavy because it is a floor-model remade to a bench-model. It is too high to be on my regular 36\\" bench. I had to have a lower,very sturdy table to set this on, which I hadn't planned on.Still, it does a good job.

Less than one week later I had to return it. First the camera turns on by sliding a door that covers the lens over. This mechanism works only when it wants to. Half the time you can't even get the camera to turn on.When it's on it immediately drains the batteries. I changed the batteries twice in three days.Somewhere around the 6 day mark the camera just stopped working completely.In addition the software takes forever to download and ended up corrupting many of my files during the installation process. The pics are ok at best.

I eventually just started popping the batteries in right when I used the camera to save them. The mechanism that slides over the view finder eventually gave up as well.It did however deserve a couple of stars only because the picture quality of the camera proved to be not so bad.In the end, if you're gonna spend money on a digital camera in the first place, I recommend shelling out a few extra bucks on a pricier camera.

This book is nicely arranged as to the content and is quite easy to follow for putting the information to practical use. For example, while at a party, I had a friend obtain a number of handwriting samples from women in attendance I did not know. I then matched some of the stroke formations given in this book to the handwriting specimans of these women. I jotted down the personality trait description for each stroke formation. When I finished with a short profile, this was given to the person who had submitted the handwriting speciman. To say the least, each person was absolutely astounded.

I read each Spiderwick before he did and found them mildly entertaining--and Tony DiTerlizzi's illustrations are fantastic! My son was excited about each one and read them a couple times each. I thought the books were well-planned and carefully created. These don't really look like children's books--the hardcovers have a leather-bound appearance and there's a colorplate at the beginning of each book.

Everything from a little household brownie to a huge griffin are depicted. Not knowing what everything means, these children go off on their adventures following the \\"Faeries.\\"I loved the plotline, even though it seemed very choppy. The books are very short and not exactly cheap. One suggestion would be to combine some of the smaller books to make larger ones. And the books, when bought alone, are expensive at $10.00 a piece.

I think the guy who read the Spiderwick Chronicles was very good, because he could make his voice sound like a female's.

Not since I read The Gingerbread Kingdom, have I been captivated by a young adult fantasy book. One of my favorite things about these books are the detailed illustrations.

It was disappointing to receive a set of five tiny books, each containing one scant chapter. At a cost of over $5.00 each, this could be the most expensive children's book ever, once you read all the different volumes. So, not much of a story, and a rip-off if you look at value, which you should certainly look at. One of the many satisfying things about the Harry Potter books is that they are full books, some quite long, and very engrossing, even as a re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, too bad disk 5 is defective","review":"It was a very enjoyable and well red story, fatally ruined by the defective disk 5 that starts on chapter 2.

I have other quotation books that are better organized and easier to navigate; however, what I liked best about this one was that I could open it up to any page, at any time, and find something to focus on, something that would make me feel better. I wrote it in, made marks and underlined sayings that were especially helpful. Nearly 10 years later, this book has traveled thousands of miles with me and I still pick it up from time to time when I need a reason to smile, or something to think about.

Isn't that stupid? I mean the whole book was like that. Plus, there was no real story line. I mean she kept jumping from her grandmother to Dion stalking her to the New York angel. The ending was confusing and stupid. Then at one point she'd complain because she is afraid of heights. Sure, he's a spider too. It was awful. Now before you say \\"Oh she hated it so she didn't even finish it. How would she know?\\" Well I did finish the book. I don't think you should write a review unless you do.

It's spectacular. certainly worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much comedy, not enough war","review":"This game is a disgrace to Army Men!

The only good thing is the cinemas. When I first played this game I was like ''What the hell is this garbage!!!'' When you kill tan they turn into these human shaped guys with no face or detail.

Crotch rockets with arms. . .So the main character (ballerina) quits ballet due to an injury and becomes involved in motorcycles. . .a comparison of riding and touching the sky to freedom fits together in an obscure way. The backstory is not really far-fetched, but political/military conspiracy to destabilize the government for its world domination agenda. There are some CGI clips that are pretty awesome. The closing is descent, however, it seemed too short of a series. The gaps in time are left to the viewers imagination for character buildup and adds to the storyline progression. On a personal note, Yamaha R1 engines should have been installed for top performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, wrong storyline","review":"I enjoyed this Anime until I got to the middle to the end.

I have no memory of what I was drinking before PG Tips, but that must mean that it was forgettable. PG Tips is not. The English seem to know what they're doing in this department. No surprise there. To me it has precisely the right flavor, full and rich. If I get up in the middle of the night, for whatever reason that happens, PG Tips is there to quiet me down and put me back to sleep. (Won't work for those sensitive to caffine, I'm afraid, but I am not.) Now, after a long absence, I've returned to drinking it in the morning in place of coffee. My wife still thinks of it as something to have in the afternoon. Just the best at any time.

I still can't fathom how Lorna Moorhead not only can laugh at her own situation, but can make us laugh with her.Even the occasional proofreading and editing glitches don't sidetrack the reader from a real sense of involvement. I read it straight thru in one sitting because I didn't want to put it down. Please let there be more books from this fresh, funny new voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammatical errors overshadow substance","review":"Ms. Moorhead's book is an attempt to tell her story. This book was obviously not edited. While Ms. Moorhead brags about being in \\"honors\\" English classes, she misuses \\"there\\" and \\"their\\" throughout the book, puts too much information in parentheses, and didn't even bother to spell check certain chapters. Being a fellow MS sufferer, I had looked forward to the book. However, the nonexistent editing was so distracting that I could not enjoy the content. Ms. Moorhead would have done better to wait for a publisher who would have helped her produce a viable work. This is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing and horribly edited","review":"Do not read this if you are not depressed or angry about being diagnosed with MS. It is disheartening and seems to assume that MS will start to define your identity.

If you have MS but are not (or not yet) suffering serious symptoms, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enlightening","review":"The book reads very fast, but it is nice to see somebody not just write about being depressed. She speaks for a lot of us when she mentions things like the \\"MS jogger\\" and \\"Not Tonight Dear I Have MS.\\" Living with this disease leaves you few reasons to laugh, but Lorna addresses issues in a way that makes you want to laugh. The only problem I found with the book, is poor publication quality. I hope she finds a better publisher. I'm looking forward to a longer sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but...","review":"I think it's cool when somebody can write their own story and it's entertaining plus informative.

I like the story though, the writer has a funny outlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I bought this book because, in a quick look at the bookstore, it seemed to take a relaxed, calming approach to wedding planning, and I was lured by its tasteful cover compared to the glaring pink and flower & bells bedecked covers of its neighbors. However, I did not find this book to be remotely useful. Despite its title, it had very little to offer by way of making your wedding unique or personalized.

It will rub your underarms raw! The first day I wore it (only a couple of hours)under my clothing, I couldn't even try it again for several days because it rubbed my underarms so raw. So then I thought I would give it a try over my clothing when at home or sleeping...I still can't have it on for more than an hour or so. It is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever tried to wear.

I couldn't wait to get home after my Mom told me it arrived in the mail when I was on a trip. Well, they fooled me alright! It's not even by the actual rappers and hip-hoppers themselves. It's sung by two wannabes who can rhyme, but can't rhyme to all the songs! And, to top that off, they changed the beats a bit to make it warped! They don't cut out for all the big-timers. You can dance to this, and that would be great, but you can't just sit back and enjoy. So, if you're planning on having several, and I mean several parties, than this CD might be bearable to own. My opinion, save the few bucks this lame CD costs for another CD that might be a little more expensive, but worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You think it's tha BOMB, but it's NOT!","review":"Before I bought this I thought it was awesome! Look at the price Mom! She said sure. I said cool. I got it in hopes of listening to it nonstop. There's Tupac, Dre, Snoop, Coolio, and all the other awesome rappers! Great CD! You would think. I got it and then discovered it's not sung by the same rappers as it was in its original version (that's why it's so cheap). I thought I could deal with that still, but then I discovered they were the same two rappers for every song, and the beats were messed up! They changed it! You can still recognize the song, and the CD is bearable, but nothing I would listen to for more than a few minutes every once and awhile. It's a loser if your just sitting, dancing to it would be alright cause you're having fun anyway.

Yes, it is a sad attempt at satire and humor, but certain things are offensive no matter in how colorful package you wrap them in.I'm 110% sure that this book would suffer a terrible outcry and call for lynch if you would replace word \\"Men\\" with word \\"Women\\". Probably one of notable news anchors or show hosts ladies would spit all over book in prime time but since it is about men, that makes it okay, right? No, it doesn't.This book and it's terrible attempt at humor (whatever) is not something to accept lightly.

Yet wondering how many will take it as how they truly should be? I did not see anything in the book to indicate it was supposed to be funny or light hearted. There are people who believe that the opposite sex needs to be manipulated and treated with disdain. If this is really what the book portends, controlling men, who are all dogs, not just compared to dogs, then I would not recommend that to my worst enemy. Yet if the intent is light hearted humor, it seems a bit warped in it's sense of heavy handed man bashing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious.","review":"I agree with the first reviewer that the title is a tad misleading in that there is no daily exercise with to practice this newfound power.

Now I need to go play my favorite game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people serious?","review":"You know, demeaning and demoralizing men as dogs really isn't helping make the case for gender equality. In case you are too dense or bitter to realize it, this author is encouraging the same mentality as the male chauvinist types who expect their women to be subservient and submissive.

It took a pair of vice grips to remove the bit. I threw this thing in a drawer and can't imagine ever taking it back out. Complete waste of money.

That worked better!Now I question whether the Fiskars brand is quality.Don't buy this tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great initially...then things start slipping","review":"When I got this initially, I loved it. Ergonomic. Light. Quick. I used it for all kinds of projects. Then the gears started slipping. I don't know if they wore down, worked themselves apart or what, but it's so disappointing. It's obviously not intended for industrial applications, but it seems like better quality components/construction could easily make this stand up longer than it did. It's a simple design. No reason it couldn't have been made better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good handy tool.","review":"Often, when working, I don't need to have the massive power of my cordless drill, nor the size of it.

Little did I know, this hand drill went through pine, maple and oak like hot knife through butter. Trying to find its limits, I used it in galvanized steel (12GA). What a surprize, after a couple of cranks I was there. Amazing little thing, I cannot do without after a week, useful for light and not so light work. It takes around 5-6 holes to get used to it but if you do that, your life will be easier without batteries and cords. VERY good tool, can do more than you can imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best tool for most jobs!","review":"I LOVE this drill. It requires no cords or electricity.

The other was the Sears Craftsman version which I ran over with my car after 10 years. For quick work and smaller jobs - drilling picture frames, wall board and the ilke, this little guy can't be beat. It is very light, and fills your hand nicely making it very easy for accurate positioning. An inherent feature of hand drilling is that you have perfect control of the bit - speed and feed (or pressure, if you like). The shape makes for easy carry in a tool belt or in your pocket. My only complaint with this one is that the Fiskars drill lacks the little recesses on the forward housing to hold bits (with a rubber band that goes around the nose) The Sears model has this. This tool is practically indestructable, doesn't need electricity, and does very nice work. I'm sure this one will last just as long as my other."},{"rating":"1","title":"total disappointment","review":"Drill did not come with attached bits as per photo.

Any older media reproduction and storage devices are, for some of us, just as valuable today as they were 10, 20, even 40 years ago. Whether the value is practical or sentimental, whether you continue to play LP's or save information to a zip disc. Old tech blazed the way for the new. So yes, I continue to save my valuable information to zip disc. They are practical, reliable, and do exactly what I want them to do. That doesn't mean I do not have my valuable information backed up on an usb stick or in a cloud. But for my day to day working, a zip disc is the perfect storage medium. So as you're listening to your favorite Pink Floyd record, and recording your most adored TV show on VHS, remember if you don't keep up with old technology, it will come back and bite you in the butt when you really need it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It It Just Me, or does this movie really stink?","review":"This movie stank. The acting was okay, but nothing great. The plot was pitiful.

It is so refreshing to see a gay move that doesn't center around someone coming out, or dying, or getting gay bashed that this movie deserves some credit. It was a light hearted view of the mess people can get themselves into. Sure there were some plot holes (uh, did the Xander have trouble hearing a difference between the other two guys), but I can forgive them al for just presenting a situational romantic comedy. My partner and I laughed out loud several times while watching. Contrary to another review, I found the \\"old wise queen\\" funny and that actor played the part remarkably well.

The story is very sweet and romantic. It shows how we sometimes tend to do things that sabotage our relationships, whether we're aware of it or not, because we fear rejection.

Maybe if you left some hot peanuts on the table and put the glass next to those they would eat the peanuts and WOW, I need a drink fast! I am not sure how the dribbling mechanism actually works but it really gives you a good shower when you think you are about to enjoy a big gulp of milk.

They helped me and so many other women overcome this condition, they truly saved my life, and I'm sure I can speak for the other women Ive met there who have said the same. Most women that suffer and have suffered from vaginismus understand that its impossible to \\"cure\\" yourself. The women at WTC know what they are doing and they are educated, kind, incredible women. Im sorry that you feel that they are a \\"joke\\", it seems that you have looked for answers on this condition for a long time, trust me they have the answers.

Colore Santos es de los mejores y mas variados trabajos de Cerati, quizas el mejor. La musica es una mezcla entre el rock super melodico de Cerati y beats y sonidos electronicos. El disco lo sacaron en el ano 93 y el estilo y la estructura musical son bastante avanzados para la epoca en que fue producido. Mis temas favoritos son El Aire Rie y Colores Santos, pero todos los otros son excelentes tambien. Estos son los discos que valen la pena comprar, los que uno se los tripea de principio a fin!Para los fanaticos de Cerati y sus creaciones: Ninguno de los temas en este album aparecn en otro asi que vale la pena tenerlo para que sea parte de nuestras colecciones de Soda y su lider las cuales yo estoy seguro que es de nuestras mas preciadas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Remastered\\" - needs to change listing","review":"This is a good enough CD, but it is not what is advertised.

Como el compatriota Venezolano dice en otra resena, Cerati le lleva muchisima ventaja a los demas musicos de rock latino americanos. Su musica es super avanzada, esta bien compuesta, es compleja, variada, etc. Que mas puedo decir, pocos roqueros en espanol estan a la talla de Gustavo Cerati. Este album, poco conocido entre las demas de sus obras , para ser del ano 93, parece mas bien del 2002. Si lo sacan de nuevo, se venderia como pan caliente."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hermoso disco","review":"Este es un disco hermoso.

The book has twists and turns and it makes you think. It's fun to try to predict the ending even though that with all the clues and hidden information it is nearly impossible. This book holds an unpredictable romance and a dangeous mission. It shows felings of real people, while they are put through strange events. The characters change from your best friend to you worst enemy as more facts are given and more secrets revealed. It is a note-worthy novel of mystery and surprise, and I recomend it to all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Worship CD thus far...","review":"If you call yourself a Christian and have not at least heard this CD, you are truly missing out on real worship and intimacy with Jesus. 100 Portraits and Waterdeep have been absolutely filled with the Holy Spirit in the creation of this album. The songs are truly God breathed, coming from Divine inspiration. This CD will change your life! I cannot even begin to choose a favorite song...every single one is awesome! If you are really wanting to experience God in a way you never have before...get this CD!

The first cord lasted for about five months before it suddenly stopped working properly. The tip needs to be wiggled to just the right angle to even allow the computer to hold a charge. And forget charging at all. Because of the angle it has to be at to hold a charge, it can't also be charging the computer(not all sides are touching or something).I bought a second one. It lasted for all of a week and then started doing the exact same thing. Oddly, I bought the car charger of the same type as this and it works perfectly.

If you only think of Chopin as a great composer of salon music, think again. All eight of these pieces reach incredible climaxes worthy of Beethoven or Tchaikovsky, etc. The soloist here is not a household name but his playing is absolutely superb and the piano sound is close to perfection.

Mine were also just thrown in the box. All the crayons have marks from the other colors all over them, they definitely didn't come the way the picture shows.

I almost bought another brand with only one tube for a few dollars less but decided to go with the brand of my cross bow and arrows. The reason for the pack of three is that the wax is very soft and each tube will likely not last too long. It goes on very easily and goes into the strings as it should. Waxing the strings on the cross bow is recommended every 5-10 shots. This soft wax will likely work better than the harder wax that I used on my others bows. I would especially recommend this product for cross bows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient!","review":"The chapstick like design is really inspired, however it does convince me that I should maybe just use old chapstick instead of buying specific lube wax.

I bought one and the string broke after only 6 shots. That is when I learned that the string and rail have to be waxed. I bought this item (and replacement strings)and was really suprised at the difference it made. The cost was among the lowest that I found but I have fired my crossbow more times than I can count after replacing the initial string and am still on the (1st)replacement string and the first tube of lube wax! As always, shipping was better than expected. I have only two complaints.....the first is that I bought too many extra strings and the second is that one tube probably won't last forever. Great investment for someone that likes to use their crossbow a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barnett String Wax","review":"As far as string wax goes it is top of the line! Quality easy to use wax.

Israel was once a noble project - the Jews deserved a homeland, and Israel's defense of itself in 1948 and 1967 was merited. But Israel needs to remember that the Palestinians too deserve a homeland. Israeli nationalists just cannot accept that Israel might now reasonably be considered a pariah state, and that Europeans might just have a case. As a European, I am proud that Europe is standing up to Israel - someone has to when the Americans seem unable to take the lead. This book is propaganda, and does nothing to contribute to a solution of Israel's problems. Hard-core conservative Israelis will love it, but no-one else will take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agressive Christian Folk/Rock would fool anyone","review":"My friend introduced me to Shane Barnard yesterday, and what an impact this man has already had on me. I've always felt Christian music often falls behind secular music, but not here. This guy is amazing. He has an aggressive accoustic sound that, for me, is very reminiscent of Ani DiFranco. As far as other Christian bands go Jennifer Knapp is probably the closest thing, with Caedmon's Call falling close behind. I highly recomend this album to any Christian looking for cutting edge music, and ON A WORSHIP CD, who would have thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best statistics texts available today!","review":"As a biostatistics PhD student I've had to endure many very poorly written textbooks (though there are many good one's too). Not only is this book a great text on applied survival analysis, it's a great piece of statistical writing and should be used as an example for all applied texts. The general approach of introducing the theory followed by examples with SAS/SPlus code makes learning the material easy and fun. I wish all statistics texts were even half this good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality","review":"I bought the kindle edition of this book so that I would not have to carry around a hard cover book. The text is difficult to read. It looks as if it has been scanned. Some words are broken into as much as three segments! Often parts of the letters are missing. For example, when a beta appears often the back of it is either very thin or missing entirely. I would not mind if Amazon was charging $10 for the book but they are charging upwards of $70 for the kindle edition of the book. For that price they should deliver a perfect file that does not make ones head spin every time they try to read it.

They lost all of their rawness and energy and it sounds like someone put the songs together with a computer rather than four guys jamming with instruments. I listened to this CD a few times, hoping it would grow on me, but ended up selling it on ebay without even burning a copy to keep - it's THAT bad.

Of all the terrible bands to emerge in the past 40 years, and there are alot of them (Aerosmith, The Ataris,Coldplay) they rank among the worst of the worst. If Poison was considered pop-rock 15 years ago, then The Starting line is flat out bubblegum. The songs are all the same, same formulas, same themes. No real instrumental talent can be found; and the catchy songs are forgettable. Also, all these songs have pretty much been performed by countless other bands. The lead singer is totally a word that rhymes with maggot. And as for that one dude that sings back up vocals, well he's just dreamy, i mean, nevermind.

With their mix of pop and punk, and the heart felt lyrics accompanied by the pulsating rythms and chords that make you wanna jump, this cd is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"the starting line is a great band. i was really blown away when i heard this album because i loved their EP \\"With Hopes of Starting Over...\\" so much. if you're into the punk/emo type music...DEFINITLY BUY THIS. you will love it. this is one of the very few cd's that i can listen to non-stop and not get sick of hearing it. all the songs are catchy and upbeat. it's definitly a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album from an Incredible Band","review":"Overall, theres not much more to add than whats been said in the otehr reviews. This is a great album and if you like punk, you should pick it up. The only thing I wanted to say was that people who say this band is \\"generic\\" and sounds like all the other bands, obviously knows nothing about the genere. Its like saying all country sounds like Garth Brooks, or all rap sounds like Nelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on something better!","review":"First off, this cd is nothing great AT ALL. Many of the songs sound alike and are really annoying. The lyrics are weak, and the singer's voice isn't anything to go crazy over. The only song that is just okay is Up and Go. It has a decend beat and it's even kind of catchy. But if you're DYING to get the cd, borrow it from a friend or check it out at the library and burn it, cuz this lame cd is a huge disappointment!! If you want to get a good punk-rock cd, even Good Charlotte would be better than these losers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop-Punk: An oxymoron.","review":"I'll say this: If you like bands of this genre like Good Charlotte, I'm sure you'll like this CD. I made the mistake of picking it up... Now I want my money back. However, if you're looking for some real rock/punk, you're looking in the WRONG place. Pick up some Dead Kennedys or Bad Religion, ANYTHING but this. Take my word for it, unless you're some teeny-bopper 14 year old girl and like to pretend you're punk, ala Avril Lavigne, stay far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people should take their own advise","review":"I don't understand why nobody has razzed this record yet, I guess I'll have to be the first to offical say that this is no good. Come on guys! This is boring pop punk that makes even MXPX look like a great band. Throughly unorginal and it really has no feeling whatsoever. I guess the band didn't title the record, becuase they aren't saying it like they mean it. Maybe Drive Thru titled it \\"say it like you mean it\\" condescendingly to make Starting Line look stupid. Anyways yeah boring pop songs that are almost catchy but just don't even seem to fit. Even if your into guilty pleasures you should really look some places else."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was i thinking","review":"why did i buy this crap when there is so much good stuff out there. it's the last time i trust amazon. i couldn't even get through each song. my life would've been better if i hadn't wasted the 30 minutes i spent on this.i'm embarassed to have ordered this and would like to save you that horror.i'll be selling it. please. someone buy this. i'll give the money to charity or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its POP!!!","review":"All I really have to say about this cd is that its pop!! It is nothing more, not rock, not punk, but pop. If you like poppy bands that try to be rock like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan than you will probably like this cd, so go for it However, if you're expecting REAL rock then don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"downward spiral","review":"this pop surgance has got to stop.this music is not good. at all.it's music for people who don't know what good music is.it's selling an image.drive-thru is hands down the worst label ever.they're ruining punk rock.flooding the scene with garbageplease boycott drive-thru, there's honest music out there.go find it, that's what punk rock is all about.finding what feels right to yourself, not just what a couple thousand people think is cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't get it...","review":"Okay, I see everyone rating this CD 5 out of 5 stars, and I have to say, I don't understand it at all. If this is your favorite CD, you either have bad taste, or you're 12 years old.Don't get me wrong, I liked this when I bought it, but I still liked Simple Plan and Good Charlotte back then. Some of the stuff on this CD is okay. But their EP is way better (maybe that's just because I like their stuff better when it's acoustic).But I wouldn't recommend this CD. I think the lyrics are really lacking, and I think lyrics are the most important part of the CD. If you want to download a couple good songs, try The Best of Me, Almost There Going Nowhere, Decisions Decisions, and Left Coast Envy."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Whiney Little Kid Rockstars","review":"Modern music today is filled with stuff like this. Unoriginal teen girl friendly, power chord laced tripe. While some punky pop acts like blink182 and possibly even sum41 carry a sense of fun the starting line is only annoying with most of the songs being about some girl that broke these young boys hearts. Granted this kind of material can make for a good song but the music and vocals bringing this across also come off as annoying. The lead singer is whiny and unbearable. It pains me to think people in the future will look back on today's music and see this kind of music as indicitive of what we listen to today. The starting line does nothing original but hey neither does Fenix TX, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory or any other pop band so thats why they got 2 stars instead of 1. If you want to hear punk music go buy a millencolin or alkaline trio and leave this little kiddy rock to the teenage girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"I think this CD is great if your into the pop punk. The Starting line is a great band, they have great lyrics in their songs and you can relate to them. I think that this CD is rare because i was able to listen through the whole thing without skipping over any song, in my opinion thats when i know something is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD","review":"one the of best CDs i have ever boughten. It took a while to find it in the record stores, but when i got it i was very very happy i did, BUY IT NOW it is an awesome CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness I opened it first! . .","review":"I purchased this as a secret-Santa gift. I thought it was so cute! Just to make sure it was okay, I removed the plastic and played it. It is horribly out of tune. It sounds like an off-key, drunken and creepy version of \\"when you wish upon a star\\". I could keep it as a really creepy conversation piece (\\"Hey, you want to know what a nightmare sounds like?\\"), but I'm going to return it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful as the TV show..","review":"One of the most pleasing facets of 'Providence' the TV series is the music, which is always 'just right' for the mood of the episode.This CD offers you some of the best of the tunes featured on the show, including two versions of 'In My Life' the series' theme.'Say Goodnight' by Beth Nielsen Chapman is particularly indicative of the musical sounds regular viewers associate with the beauty of the show itself. 'Con Te Partiro' by the great Andrea Bocelli is an added bonus as I see it, lending a different musical element to the caliber of the CD.There have been numerous times I have checked the epidsode guide online for the titles of some of the songs used on the show when I wasn't familar with the particular selection. With this CD you can have your own 'soundtrack' of the Providence music anytime you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for my home and office collection","review":"Nice addition to my home and office music collection.

It won't be returned. So your on your own with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid EP","review":"Solid effort compared to their other albums. Raw EP, but is enjoyable because of the bands typical amazing energy that flows into your body listening to the tracks. Also, its strange of all ATDI album music samples you can listen to. only El Gran Orgo is able to play its samples. Not a must have, but if you're a die hard its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the bad parts of the band so far","review":"Noisy, ugly, and mostly amateurish early punk release from the great band is seen hardly beginning to spread their wings on this adolescent outing. Short of a few interesting ideas the release is a throwaway for greater things to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm in love with ATDI, but this ep is just too forgettable","review":"Okay, first off, just let me get something off my back. Relationship of Command is their best album, hands down. I don't care about it's somewhat mainstream success. It is a landmark of an album and needs to be recognized as one. All their other albums (Aecrobatic Tenement, Vaya, In/Casino/Out) also have a very special feel to them. Sadly though, this has to be the worst offering by ATDI, and even sadder, one of THE worst albums you could possibly buy. I went through the trouble of special ordering it, just because I thought I would have been in on something. Honestly, when I found out that it came out after Aecrobatic Tenement I almost cried. How could they go from that to this? I also noticed that the back-up vocals sounded a bit different, maybe not Jim Ward in a couple of the songs. The melodies just don't have ANY special kick in them, but it's not a big deal cause ATDI will live on with their other albums. I'm saddened..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"This is At The Drive-In's weakest album. It must appeal to more straight-on punks, since most of the other reviews seem pretty positive, but for a more casual ATDI listener, this album is awful. Having lost two of their members that they recorded \\"Acrobatic Tenement\\" with before this album, ATDI was at a low point, and it shows through musically. It sounds rough and incomplete, and much worse than \\"Acrobatic Tenement\\" and incredibly inferior to the following \\"in-CASINO-OUT.\\" If you're obsessed with ATDI, or just like anything with a guitar, buy this album. Otherwise, buy their other four -- THOSE are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning mountainese is easy - being a mountaineer is hard.","review":"Mrs. Williams has shared a glimpse into the daily lives of her family and friends in a manner so riveting I have stayed awake much too long some nights unable to put the book down.

I chose this to remodel my current home, having a matching lever on the bathroom faucet. I also have the passage and am looking to purchase several keyed versions.Worried about left-hand/right hand? There is a small pin that comes with each one that allows you to install the door and switch from Lh to Rh in seconds, without having to uninstall the unit. Keyed upside down? Having this pin allows you to take out the lock mech and switch it over again, w/o having to uninstall.Great for you house flippers, remodelers, and like me, just sick of those pre-installed gold door knobs. Nickel is great, but there are more colors.Buy it you will enjoy!

These were very easy to install and reverse depending on which side of the door (left/right) the lock goes. They seem very durable and I've had zero issues with them.

This cd is a wonderful journey of the soul. His lyrics speak to the most tender parts of us, yet several songs do it while remaining upbeat and quick-tempoed. The front cd cover gives a brief background for each song, giving insight to why and how it came to be. I like that Mr. Norman is willing to share that with his listeners. The music on The Fabric of Verse is mostly acoustic guitar with other instruments added as needed. I highly reccommend this cd to those who not only like excellent music, but also lyrics that make you evaluate and appreciate your own life, too!

The only thing I don't like about it is it leaves a tiny bit of the crushed pill residue in the chamber which is very hard to remove,but I think I'll try a sterile paint brush next time. If you just use it for the same pill every time,it shouldn't even be a concern after the first pill because the amount of pill that empties out should be equivalent to a complete pill.

It works very well and requires little effort. I previously tried two other pill crushers. One broke within two weeks, and the other got crossed threads after three months' use.One small drawback is that the base of this crusher has some sharp plastic edges that are uncomfortable to your hand. I corrected this by using an emery board to round off the sharp edges. (Medium/fine sandpaper would also work.) As another reviewer mentioned, the problem would be solved if the manufacturer would put the same padding material on the base as they put on the top.Overall, I gave this item five stars because it is durable, easy to use, and priced right."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgot other end","review":"The top of the crusher is nicely protected with soft coating, but they should have done the same for the bottom.

I ordered the \\"Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black\\" from Amazon, and just recieved it. AMAZING! I did six pills at a time w/ no splitting and in less then 15 seconds...have pulverized pills. The grinder does cost $20, but so well worth it. If you do order it---after you have pulverized your pills, let it rest for a minute so all the \\"pill-dust\\" will settle. Truly, worth the $20!!!!

I can see it being ok for small pills but I got them to crush larger pills (for my dog- the smaller ones I just put in his food and he eats it but can't do that with the bigger ones), I'm assuming a lot of people get them for similar reasons or people can't swallow really large pills, but this crusher doesn't work for that at all.

The design of the pill crusher has some pluses, with the top being easy to grip and turn, and it may work okay to crush two or three pills, but it doesn't work well to crush a number of pills and especially not large vitamins.There are no \\"teeth\\" on the element that pushes down on the pills, so you can't grind the pills by screwing the top. You have to depend on the brute force to smash the pills.I found it did not work as well as my old crusher, which both crushed and ground (if necessary).

The book was really decently priced, in new condition, & the seller had good reviews, so I bought it. My dad has been talking about how great this book is for days & looking through all of the different projects & plans the book has in it. He can't wait to build his own work bench, etc. Thanks for the great book & quick delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"jazz fusion for the modern age","review":"i heard a track off this CD on a houston radio show. blew my mind. The world is stuffed full of great jazz and fusion players, but I'd never heard of this guy. Turns out he's a percussionist with a Christian folk college phenom called Caedmon's Call. I think he should go solo, cause he's gopt the chops. This CD covers jazz fusion, flamenco, even a new age indian mantra ambient sort of thing. Yeah, it's a tad schizophrenic, and occaisonally runs long, but this is a great experimental album from a guy not yet known for his jazz chops. I'd love to hear more, this is must for chill at the pad listening and musicians who love to hear some cats push the edge. The Bass is by some guy named TRIP who is AMAZING! Guitar by a guy named Jet who apparently can cover ottmar liebert and andy summers in the same breath, and there's amazing piano by Robert Boston (I think). Anyway. Pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Major Work by John Rutter","review":"On each of the various John Rutter CD's in my music library, I find the few compositions by Rutter himself particularly enjoyable. These are generally short compositions of approximately three minutes in duration. Consequently, when a CD such as this comes along with a Rutter composition (Dancing Day), which is approximately 25 minutes in duration, it is a real find indeed. While the Toronto Children's Chorus does not have the depth of the Cambridge Singers, Rutter's usual choir, they are very good, and the beautiful Rutter choral sound is definitely present. For anyone who shares my fondness for John Rutter's work, both as choral director and composer, this CD is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture book that is NOT in color","review":"Know that this book is a picture book that is NOT IN COLOR. I returned it for that reason. I needed color photos for my hobby and was shocked to find this book without color.

It rendered the book worthless to me, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully illustrated","review":"When I decided to buy my own copy of Peter Pan I wanted to have one with illustrations. I looked at every illustrated copy I could get a hold of, and this one has the best illustrations I have ever seen. There are about 50 illustrations total, all beautiful oil paintings, with a wonderful map of Neverland in the front and back of the book. The details in the paintings are also amazing, you can look at one again and again and each time find something new, especially with the illustrations that take up a full two pages. This really is something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic To Be Discovered","review":"Illustrated by one of today's most influential illustrators, Gustafson's Peter Pan is a delight to the eye. His painstaking illustrations bring the world of Peter, Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys to glorious full color life. A lavish edition, the pages are filled with vignettes as well as vast full color landscapes of the world we know as Neverland. This book in particular captures all of the magic and childhood whimsy we know from Peter Pan and have come to expect from gustafson. The text is broken up into chapters as was Barrie's original story, so this edition will delight a new generation looking to know the full story of Peter Pan. Expect to see Peter and Tinkerbell at their most magical, The Darling children at their most adventuresome and Hook at his most dreadful in this classic brought to life by a favorite illustrator.A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan","review":"For all of those minds who have been poisoned by the Disney version of Peter Pan in place of the real, unabridged version, I truly do suggest that you read this book. I have found, after reading this tremendous book, that scenes in the movie have been made up, as well as disposed of, and is poisoned as Hook did to Pan's medicine. In Peter Pan, the legendary hero springs to life once again, and is up to more trouble than ussual fighting pirates, freeing \\"redskins\\", and saving his followers from the peak of disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific illustrations/ Classic story!","review":"The artist has created stunning paintings that accentuate this beloved classic tale. The models chosen to portray each character were great choices and I love his use of lighting throughout. I was surprised, though, by the amount of violence throughout the story. It's subtle enough to avoid lasting impressions, but it should be noted. Interesting how Barrie pits every female on the island against Wendy. The girls just can't seem to get along. Peter is definitely the much sought-after Alpha male figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan","review":"Peter Pan is a book about a boy who never wants to grow up and lives on an island called Neverland which is a fantasy world. Peter found Wendy and her brothers and brought them to Neverland. Where Wendy plays mother to Peter and the lost boys. After, Wendy gets sick of playing mother she wants to go home and while going home Peter fights Hook and wins.My favorite part of the book was when Hook fought Peter. I liked it because it was like war the lost boys and Peter versus Hook and his men. Peter came out on top,he fought to the death. He said Hook or me this time. It was Hook who died.I would reccomend this book to alot of people. People who like fantasy and adventure. It has this stuff in it because it has faries, mermaids, and pirates and it's adventurous because Peter goes on constant adventures.I would also reccomend this book to people who are outcasts. I would do this because Peter himself was an outcast.Always a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan: The Complete and Unabridges Text","review":"I LOVED this version of Peter Pan. It's the original version and it has really beautiful pictures. I like the original because it gives so much more depth to the story.

There are some great parts in the book that the movie didn't even touch, which I think was stupid of Disney to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney actually improved on this one","review":"How many of these other reader reviews are by children or their parents? I read this book to my eight year old boy (and by the way we don't even do Disney), and have to say I was apalled. Call me a fuddy-duddy, but Tinkerbell's behavior as a little tart and the ... suggestiveness of Wendy and Peter were just too much for a young child. Their role-playing as \\"father\\" and \\"mother\\" was far too mature for my kid. This is a good book for Freudians and students in lit classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"violent, mean and turgid","review":"After I read the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" to my five-year-old son, I thought \\"Peter Pan\\" would be another good one.

The illustration and pure magic that jumps out from every page will enchant children all of ages (even big kids like me!) This edition of Peter Pan was written and designed with love for the story; that is evident! You'll find a map inside the cover, showing the Lost Boys Territory, Buccaneer Zone, Deadman's Isles, among other things.Peter Pan presented like this makes a beautiful coffee table book. You'll be anxious to read this to your children, and your older kids will engross themselves over it, too.This is not the Peter Pan we had growing up!

On a less personal level, every minute of it is impeccably performed and perfectly recorded, turning it into one of a handful of particularly powerful live albums: I put it up there, alongside Peter Gabriel's 'Plays Live'. To top the quality of the performance and the recording, every single song in it is a Supertramp classic in itself, with \\"Fool's Overture\\" being the one that benefits the most from the live performance. This is a must for all rock fans, and if you are new to Supertramp, this along with \\"Even in the quietest moments\\" will give you a heavy dose of what this band is capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the finest","review":"Paris is one of the finest live albums ever produced...right behind Procol Harum's Live with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and ELP's Pictures at an Exhibition!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing Program","review":"Steven Stosny's book and Boot Camp program are a life changing event.

While working through this program I experienced an epiphany that has opened a floodgate of positive change in my life.

My experience has been that when I changed, things got better, even though I thought other people were the/my problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"I am researching a book for partners of people with personality disorders and was hooked by the title and premise. But here's the big problem: your abusive ex must want to read the book, go through boot camp, and change his ways. And yes, it's \\"his\\" ways, since another premise of the book is that emotional abuse by women isn't as bad as emotional abuse of men, because women have more fear. That may be so, but abused men have more shame. So on the bad side for me, this book doesn't much deal with women abusers, and the abuser has to WANT to change. On the good side, it looks like there will still be plenty of room in the world for the book I am going to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and stereotypical","review":"I agree with the reviewer below.

Buy the book. Give the book 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Male bias","review":"This book is written along with 99% of self help books that focuses on the male as the abusive partner. It is as if we live in a society where very rarely the women is the perpetrator of physical and verbal abuse. This of course, plays into politics and womens liberation, whereas it is almost as if they are entitled to act this way. I would imagine that there is a rather large percent of women abusers in today's civilization. In a society where single parents, mostly women, are the caretakers, there must be a very strong pattern developing in the present and the future. The book is an answer to prayers where it does in fact focus on significant issues. It is not the simplest read, it is written with the self help confusing format.Shame on Stosny for not focusing on women as the perpetrators.

He had told me that he did not like the title of this book, but the publisher forced him to use this title for marketing.

The only people who are portrayed as evil are those who would censor video games at the cost of the First Amendment.This book is for everyone, rather you're writing a thesis on the subject or are simply (like me) a lifelong fan of video games.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent social look at video games","review":"In many ways, this book may be misrepresented to people. Its not simply \\"hey, remember how awesome this game was?\\" type of book, nor does it look at games from a technical side (though technology is featured at times). This is more to do with the social impact of games. As such, it does not spend excessive time on the failed consoles, or failed games (though the exception can be made for the Atari-buster known as E.T.).Its a very useful book, I'm using it for a college class! Its probably the first 'text book' i'll actually look forward to keeping! The book is about as comprehinsive as one volume can be (and obviously, books like High Score and Game Over will complement this book). It is comprehensive, and exhaustive, as there are many excerpts from the people that made the games, and changed the world of home entertainment.

With all the countless books about Plath, her life, her death, and her art, it was exactly what the others were lacking.Nancy Hunter Steiner takes her limited time with Plath and sets her memories to page. She has quite a few interesting stories to reveal, which she recounts with her unique perspective. She acknowledges her fear and shortcomings, as well as those she found in Plath.Nancy takes her readers into her room at Smith and the apartment at Cambridge. She takes us back to a time when Plath was all raw ambition and dreams. The maturing, self-conscious student is the Plath we experience. How fortunate was Nancy to know her then, and how fortunate for us, too!It is an immensely interesting book. Plath is real and flawed and beautiful. The only problem with the book is that it ended too soon, but that is always the problem when any good book ends.Highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"marvelous edition","review":"I heartily recommend this edition to every true Spinozist, for several reasons. First, it contains every significant work by Spinoza, even his Hebrew grammar and his study of Descartes' philosophy. Second, it is a surprisingly compact book, considering that it is nearly 1,000 pages long. Finally, and most important, Samuel Shirley's translations are delightfully readable. The book is ably annotated, with a short introduction.The paper flyleaf is fragile, so if you are going to carry the book around with you, I suggest investing in a cover for it.

In the end, Socrates converts to Christianity because the claims of Christianity are so absurd that nobody would possibly make them up. The sequel to this will probably be Socrates meets Mohamed, or Socrates meets Zeus (oh wait, the real Socrates already knew about Zeus and was executed for atheism).It takes the author around 100 pages to end with the most ridiculous reason to believe a claim ever conceived.

The idea is great, the writing style is very good. The author totally blows it. Rather than take on the real challenges that face Christianity the author chooses to play the strawman game.When defending Christianity rather than deal with substantive objections, the author chooses to place in the mouth of critics the most inane, uninformed arguments possible. This means that either as an author he did not have the chops to deal with truly difficult questions or he specifically choose strawman arguments. In either case there are much better books to read.

It is by far the worst book I had to use in my degree which is quite an achievement. I read amazon reviews prior to buying books and oftentimes I disagree with poor book ratings (some students are complaining about their own inefficiencies).

After three installments and endless write-ups in newspapers and magazines, we get the point. I'm not sure what's more disturbing: That the stories contained in \\"Darwin III\\" are (purportedly, at least) true, or that this series sells as well as it does.I mean, it's a great bathroom book -- something to read in short bursts (or longer bursts, depending on the state of your constitution), but I would hope there would be a greater hunger for more substantive reading.Still, if you're looking for the mental equivalent of a light snack, \\"Darwin 3\\" is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making money from the misfortunes of fellow human beings","review":"People who love the Darwin Awards feel that it's OK to laugh at other people's tragedies because those people are literally non-human - they aren't as fully evolved as the rest of us.Dehumanization is of course a favorite tactic during times of war.

Knowing that somebody actually supports an industry that profits from laughing at the deaths of fellow human beings tells you exactly what you need to know about that person's level of compassion.And then there's Darwin Awards lovers' desperate need to feel superior to the dead people: 'Wooh Thank God for my good DNA' says one reviewer on Amazon.Lack of compassion is no barrier to successful reproduction - if only it was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The books are getting worse","review":"What was a good idea has been stretched too thin.

Compared to my favorite recording of this movement onBeethoven's Adagios, Philharmonia Cassovia's performance drags in places. But this may be merely a matter of taste; Wehner's interpretation saves energy to contrast with and highlight the Allegro con brio finale.Real connoisseurs may prefer other recordings, but at the price, you can't go far wrong with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Time Liar!","review":"The reason I went and watched this show is that I was attracted by the poster.In the whole show, there is only one helicopter!

The book highlights the most collected categories, and the artist-signed chapter covers over 250 pages. The 900 postcard images, though reduced and in black and white, are useful; my favorites included the Krampus cards, Alligator border card, and the Halloween cards are a real treat. Mashburn provides short biographies of some of the artists and publishers (and even an introduction to Krampus). Although Mashburn does present some useful guidelines on topical, views, and roadside America I thought those chapters were too short in light of the vast number of cards available. Mashburn also includes references for more specific topics also."},{"rating":"2","title":"rearm kit","review":"I have used these two or three times, every time my inflatable vest gets wet. works good, easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"It was flawless, I paid and right away I got an alert that my book was sent.

Very easy to keep just the right saturation on the roller so painting goes super fast, but cleanup is a good 30-45 minute operation. Put the roller in a plastic bag between coats so it doesn't dry out.The technique I used to keep the roller at the right saturation was to \\"Pulse\\" the button. Press the button for a second every every 4 or 5 seconds, if it starts to get too wet you wait longer between pulses, if it starts to get too dry you shorten the time between pulses.I had a broken part on my power roller which didn't affect the function - Wagner sent me a replacement, no questions asked (Use email though, their phone support is lame)If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for 5 minutes - do NOT buy!","review":"My previous power roller (same model) worked for close to 10 years. finally gears started to make funny noises and it died.

Being a novice knitter, after completing 2 of the items in the book, I found that to avoid having these mistakes jump out at me while in the process of knitting the item, it would be better if I went over the instructions beforehand. I found so many mistakes, obvious mistakes, like not knowing that a garter stitch is a \\"knit every row\\". It was beginning to seem like a nightmare.

This book needs a good proofreader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome, but a little to much talk.","review":"I think this book is the best fantasy book that I have read, so far. There was more conflicts and less traviling in the last two sequels of The Elenium, but there was a little too much talking involved. They draged Sparhawks little conversations a little to long. Some scenes were kinda shocking and some people might lose intrest in this auther. One scene was of the queen and Sparhawk, very shocking. Kinda disapionted at the ending thou, but the complexity of the whole plot is nice. The fact about Sparhawk and the use of Bhelliom is vary cool, doubt I'll find anything as well created as this plot.

Always, some mortal man picks it up and uses it to kill a God, only the BAAAAD force of the universe is actually in the God. No wonder he can pump out the books, he just scribbles out the names and locations, and fills them in! The characterization is good...if you only want one character that is. Every single one of them cracks the same jokes, has the same grin. Amusing for the first 20 pages or so, then its stereotypes and repetitive humour stars to come out.

The heroes have changed and the only aim of Sparhawk's team is to slaughter and assassinate church soldiers. The book is so boring that you read the first twenty pages and then switch over to the last twenty page with the result that you don't miss a single thing. Sparhawk and his party travel around...fight battles...talk to strangers...fight battles....walk around. That is really boring and I am really disappointed. I don't think that I am going to read the Tamuli saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sapphire Rose is the tying of too many loose ends.","review":"The Sapphire Rose does not resemble the first two books of the series. The main character's personalities and values have been changed. The relationship between the knight and the queen is ludicrous. The author seems to be tying up loose ends.

So, under close supervision, and with me holding the pipe steady for getting the cuts lined up, he used this to make 32 columns 9cm long each.Nice straight cuts, no problem.Incidentally, other reviewers have mentioned the lack of a replacement blade.

Once the tube is filled the handle is heavier than the roller so its very difficult to push along the walls. You can't get the same angles that you can with a standard roller. And clean up - what a MESS! It took me over 20 minutes to clean this thing up. The directions said to flush with water about 5 times - it took about 20 times to get the tube clean. This thing is going right back to Lowes - its not worth the time nor the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Had The $24 Back.","review":"Yup, it works and it pulls the paint in from the can very neatly. But if you think it's going to save you time and trouble, don't bother. Whatever time you think you saved compared to a regular roller on a pole you'll waste cleaing it up.It's not good with any small details. You have to use 2 hands so forget using it on a ladder.The only way I'd consider buying it again might be if I were a tall man wanting to paint a ceiling without a scaffold.I was using latex exterior with flat cedar shakes. I filled it and emptied it twice. It was fast. But I put it down and went back to the regular roller. The regular roller is so much easier to use, that I forgot all about the paint mate, until I had to take it apart and clean it to throw it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick & easy painting","review":"I suggested this product to my husband to help him in painting our master bath and it worked great. It is much better than having to go back to the paint tray to load the roller every time.

I wore it out so I bought a PaintMate to replace it. Big mistake. As far use and cleaning goes, it is virtually identical to the Paint 'N' Roll except the roller assembly was redesigned to snap together instead of screw together like the previous design. During use, the roll tends to come apart, drenching the floor, the painter and everything else.I've looked at all the newest Wagner painting products and they all use this same design. It made such a mess that I fixed the crack in my old Paint 'N' Roll and am back to using it.I wouldn't buy it again. I like the trigger feed so I'm going to adapt it to my old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This was the best money ever spent on painting supplies. I used a premium Sherwin Williams one cover paint with this automatic roller and not a single drip from the roller, the clean up was much quicker than my paint sprayer, and the room looks great!

Paint Mate = Paint All Over YOU","review":"I like the idea of a syringe style paint roller, but the quality on the seals are so low that when you plunge the pain, it ends up seeping out of all the joints. Consequently, I am not covered with drops of Kilz primer and will probably spend more time cleaning up the floor than had I just used a traditional roller. I don't know about their power products but based on this one, I'd have a pretty tough time being convinced their quality is any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!!!!","review":"I had purchased and successfully used the original paint stick. Unfortunately, it didn't survive 2 cross country moves. So I purchased this Wagner paint stick.

Wagner did a poor job copying the original paint stick...very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the second time I used it","review":"The first application was brilliant and worked well. The second time I used it it seemed to lose the seal from the part that sucks up the paint so it was just dripping paint on me and everywhere. I tried tightening it down and seeing what the problem was but there was no way I could fix it so I threw it away after the second time I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"My landlord bought this for me when I offered to paint the ceilings in our house. I've painted plenty of times before, and I've never had a problem with a nice long handled roller and some disposable brushes. Tried it out today. Not worth the plastic it's made out of.By the time I was done, it was cracking and showing obvious stress fractures. With the extra weight of the paint in the roller you have to press twice as hard to get an even roll as well, so ladies take note! This thing is also not the proper length to work comfortably standing on the floor and painting the ceiling. And forget about working securely from a ladder, you'll easily upset yourself painting if you're not careful. Cleanup was long and irritating, and gee, what do ya know, it uses a special brush that works only on this paint applicator. So save that brush if you don't want to pay out the nose for replacements!Save yourself the hassle, buy some disposable paint rollers and trays, toss em' out after you're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Added work","review":"This system does not draw paint well even when lubricated properly with vaseline.

I decided to use two layers of plastic (from a bag) to seal the input. Simply unscrew the piece, put the plastic over the input, and screw the piece back down. No more leaks! I love this thing - it saves me paint and I can clean it fairly quickly now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take care of it, and it works exactly as advertised","review":"My wife and I both love this thing. Just take care of it like the instructions suggest with regards to cleaning and lubing the seals, and the thing works perfectly. We bought one to see if it works well, but are about to buy a second so we can paint the whole house via divide and conquer.Don't let the duckbill seal get clogged with paint by letting it sit around too long during breaks without covering it with plastic. That's one of the things that makes it leak - one time. Now that I take care of it, it works perfectly. If we didn't have a lot of painting to do, I wouldn't bother, but since we do, this thing rocks. A huge time saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok....","review":"The one thing to keep in mind is that you are carrying a lot more paint at a time and will be a lot heavier in the beginning. I am not exactly the strongest so painting with this after initial paint loading was hard. My arms got tired quickly. After a while, the weight lessened and I guess after that it did beat having to bend down and reload a normal roller brush.I did find that after some use the roller part started to leak a little but just kept working with it. I would use it again...but first I'd work out a lot and get a little fitter.."},{"rating":"1","title":"pastic check valve breaks","review":"My plastic check valve broke after 2 quarts of paint.

I'll grant that they skip the usual warm up exercises in beginner's videos and get right to the techniques. They cover many techniques (maybe 20) but that shows how briefly each technique is covered.

This is essential to prevent mold and mildew that occurs with the newer plastic type safes that use a water cell type insulation. Plastic body safes melt in a fire to seal the door in order to obtain their 1 hr. fire rating.

So, expecting the same great soulful and energetic songs with bluesy, gruff vocals, I bought \\"Thats Right\\". Boy, was I disapointed. I barely made it through the first listen of the album. The whole thing came across as rushed and forced, as if the album was done because they had to, not because they wanted to. It had no life to it. But the thing I really couldn't stand was the current vocalist! Gone was the dynamics and attitude of Sugar Ray, replacing them was a very dull, flat, non-agressive singer (he's just waaaayy too smooth for a blues singer). Over all I was very dissapointed. I can't point out one track that really stood out for me, they all sounded the same; all nicely done, but with no heart or soul to any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Release!","review":"The Roomful of Blues are one of those bands not unlike the Fabulous Thunderbirds or the Nighthawks that seem to endure yearly personal changes and still somehow manage to sound great. This is the Roomful's 17th release. The disc opens with a mediocre swing number \\"That's Right\\" which may give the listener some pause for concern. However, once you get past the opener, it's all a good time romp in typical Roomful fashion. No youngsters to the blues, the Roomful plays with the best of them. In fact, the guitar of Chris Vachon on tunes like \\"How Long Will It Last\\" and \\"I'll Keep On Trying\\" is so good; it makes you wonder why he is not featured more. Whatever the reason, the Roomful of Blues formula of horns, keyboard, guitar, harp and great vocals is a formula for success.

I do not like teas with chicory or with licorice root- until we had Raspberry Red Tea This stuff is amazing. Just the right blend.There is no caffeine and no problems at all for me- sometimes I can be sensitive to some teas. It is unusual to have my whole family love the same tea, but this one did it!Another fantastic way to have it is not only with honey, but with a little bit of Chambord in it for a cold winter night. It is amazingly delicious.We bring a few bags of these individually wrapped teabags to restaurants and even shopping with us.

Every story in this collection is only 1-2 pages long - they have to be, to fit 365 stories in a book of reasonable size. As a result, unless you are an extremely slow reader, none of them provide enough time to build up the suspense. There are a few exceptions - some really good stories which did manage to chill me, - but they are exceptions, not the rule. Simply put, a short short story is a very difficult format in any genre, including horror, and very few writers can pull it off. Reading just one at a time, as the subtitle suggests (\\"Get your daily dose of terror\\") leaves only the impression of \\"Huh?\\". Reading many at a sitting is like eating a boatload of popcorn - it felt good going down, but left you empty afterwards.

In a Jr. high writing contest this \\"might\\" get a participation badge. In fairness there is not much you can do with a 1 to 2 page story. But even the show \\"Are you afraid of the dark\\" had more originality, making the author R. L. Stine seem like a literary genius by comparison. There is not that much else to say except that it makes me angry that anyone could consider is good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to Robert Harris?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Harris' previous books, which seemed well-written (though occasionally over-written) and engrossing. I was excited to get hold of this...but wow! what a disappointment! This book was a terrible dud--hard to get into, full of nothing but laughable stereotypes. It simply plays to the moronic caricatures of Soviet Man that we were raised on and does not even begin to suggest the causes for the terrible state of much of Russia today. This is a book strung together out of cliches of thriller fiction, including the boring anti-hero--and furthermore the writing is just plain bad.Cheap thrills for the ignorant. I suppose Harris is hoping it sold as a film.I hope the star I gave it is taken as a zero, which was not an option. By the way, I've been to Russia several times, and it was nowhere in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Stalinism Really Dead?","review":"The search for Stalin's secret notebook brings a British historian, who is definitely not politically correct, to a modern-day Russia struggling to come to terms with its Capitalistic reforms. There the historian finds something more shocking than even he could have imagined hidden away in a far-flung northern outpost of Russia. Perhaps Stalinism is not dead after all. This tightly-written novel will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the end of the book; I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Novel That Shouild Have Been A Movie Script","review":"Frankly there is not much to enjoy in this story and one could give away the entire plot in a few sentences. It would make a good movie with the Russian scenes, the right music, good casting, and better dialogue. As a novel I found it dull, plodding, and mostly predictable. The author seems to have the right idea but not the skill to execute it properly - at least for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise, however it ultimately falls short.","review":"The premise of this story is brilliant, however Harris is unable to pull it off in a convincing fashion. While it keeps your attention throughout, the ending is somewhat unrealistic and disappointing. If you are looking for an escape into a thriller this may do, however don't expect it to portray a realistic portrait of Modern Russia. Additionally, other than the main character, all of the other players are relatively superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasonable start - poor ending","review":"I bought this book because of all the hype, but I was sadly disappointed with the story. Having set the scene with what we all imagine to be the \\"bad old Stalinist Russia\\", we were left with a cheap film script \\"Die Hard\\" type ending which was totally implausible. I read this book in bed and it got me off to sleep in no time at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Rarely can a book have started off so well and yet ended so ridiculously. The first third of the book shows Harris at his best, conjuring up an atmosphere of suspense while skilfully interweaving the results of his prodigious homework. Who could not be enthralled by the idea of Stalin's secret notebook coming to light after 50 years? Up until the moment when our two heroes set off for the northern city of Archangel all is going fine. But then -- and I can't say much more for fear of giving away the most critical element of the plot -- the storyline suddenly veers off into the simply unbelieveable. It is hard to believe that the author who produced Fatherland could have lost the plot so entirely. The last two chapters are insultingly bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Normally I buy books; this one was borrowed and I'm happy for not having spent the money.What will the next \\"secret paper, hidden offspring\\" blizzard of titles consist of, \\"The Clinton chronicles\\"? Between the hackneyed plot, floridly gratuitous descriptions of everything from sounds in the halls to mid-hangover vomiting, and boring, overworked, scenarios - a total waste of time - and someone else's money.The jacket writers and critics who cite this piece of work as depicting an accurate view of the \\"new\\" Russia obviously didn't experience (or otherwise know) the \\"old\\" or \\"new\\" Russia.If \\"Archangel\\" is this author's \\"third and best\\", let's hope there is no fourth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Yes, this is a good book. That means it is readable story. Where is exceeds most is the taut, cold atmosphere of urban Russia and the Icy desolation of the Siberian countryside. The story's twist is a nice one.The book I think is a little too quick. The story seems to run away from itself with the reader playing catch up. There are also a couple of uninteresting and irrelevant sub plots involving the Russia intelligence units.In England Archangel was greeted with massive critical acclaim. I think it was a bit overdone, but it's a compelling, well researched read. Even if he rips off the idea from \\"Boys from Brazil\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Archangel intriguing, but not a good read","review":"Whereas Fatherland and Enigma were fascinating, Archangel is little more than readable. The story never meshes. It's not until the 250th page or so that the reader finally understands the whole plot. For the bulk of the book I was struggling to understand what the big hubbub was about.Despite the confusion, the book holds together well until the very end. The final 20 pages are mind-boggling. I had to re-read it several times to understand what was happening. It's as if Harris was rushed to finish the book and compacted several chapters worth of information into one. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"When I purchased this book through Amazon, the picture of the book cover used to represent the product was a picture of the Arrow Books edition. I have that edition already and was expecting to receive a virtually identical book. The Arrow edition has good paper, is well bound, and has readable text. What owlsbook sent me was a very poor substitute -- poor quality paper, small difficult to read font, and poorly bound, so that it is hard to keep the book open to read it. Furthermore, the front cover is torn.My experiences with Amazon Marketplace have virtually always been good, but this was an exception to that rule. I received two other books from this seller, and they were fine, but the copy of Harris's Archangel is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start, Disappointing Conclusion","review":"ARCHANGEL starts off with great atmosphere and detail, and the suspense builds through three-quarters of the novel. Unfortunately, the ending was contrived and absurd by comparison. It almost read as \\"X-Files Visits Siberia\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I enjoyed this thriller very much. The action is exciting, the characters are engaging, and the portrait of Russia is chilling (if everything I've ever read about Russia is close to true, what a depressing place, full of pollution, deprivation, and misery). The critical reviews by some readers are way too harsh: sure, the ending is a bit unbelievable, but this is a good book--lighten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Follow","review":"The basic plot had the makings of some real intrique, but from from page 250 to the end I could not figure out where we were or what we were doing. I still cannot figure out what the ending of the book was all about and I was glad to get this read over with. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great novel","review":"I have already read Fatherland and Pompeii by Robert Harris. Both of these books are some of the best reading I have ever done in my entire life. Archangel can now be added to that list of favorite novels. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and when you pick it up and start reading, it keeps you interested from front cover to the back cover. It is just plain intense. I would suggest this book as well as Fatherland and Pompeii to anyone who is interested in anything historical. I love detailed and how much research Harris does on historical facts... it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure in post-Soviet Russia","review":"What if Stalin tried to carry a secret to his grave--but Lavrenti Beria (head of Soviet secret police and fellow homicidal maniac) got wind of it? What if the evidence of that secret were in a notebook buried somewhere in Moscow? Why would such a secret be so dangerous that people start ending up dead over it in post-Soviet Russia? That's what an American historian who specializes in the Soviet Union wants to know after an old retired KGB agent pays him a visit at his Moscow hotel room. The historian follows up some leads, acquiring an unwanted assistant in the form of an eager cable news reporter. They end up heading north to Archangel, a city on Russia's Arctic coastline, to chase the story down.The adventure is a good one, with believable characters acting on believable motivations throughout the book. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Russia Without Tears","review":"An almost-un-putable down book that just oozes atmosphere. I learnt more about Russia in the few enjoyable days I spent with this book than a lifetime and many Russian relations (including Grandparents) had ever given me. For the first time, I now have an authentic \\"feel\\" for this enigmatic country. The plot got a little too imaginative for my liking near the end but the writing throughout is so professional, tight and captivating that this little discrepancy was forgiven, as, holding my breath, I hung on to the final page. Thanks Robert Harris, I'm now starting out on your other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilly spellbinder portraying the decay of modern Russia","review":"While Robert Harris performs remarkable task in bringing to life the despondency of a nation desperately trying to survive amid urban decay and civic apathy, he challenges a reader's patience while setting the scene for the chilling chase and finale. Few details escape his keen eye as a writer and, for this talent, he writes with a camera's clarity, right down to every cemented crack and rusty rivet. However,he's best at describing the all-pervasive odors, the stench of forsaken buildings, the stink of unwashed bodies and the rot of a people abandoned by events over which they have no control. Against this backdrop the plot seems incidental."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book was O.K.","review":"Archangel started out as good novel, but the author couldn't keep it up. There was too much down time and not enough action or mystery. The book overall is not very exciting. And the ending was rushed and incomplete. The author could have expanded more and made a better story. I felt as though he didn't have courage enough to finish the story. This book fell short of my expectations and I would not recommend on the fact that the ending will disappoint any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the history, not the trick plot, It's the people.","review":"The postulated history is fascinating. The plot and story original and thought provoking. The emotions, the people, the understanding---great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very different from what I was told","review":"Someone told me this book was the greatest novel on Communist Russia so I thought I'd give it a go. From the first time I saw the book (with it's title standing out on the cover), I realised this was nothing more than a book to read on an airplane. Boy, was I wrong! It doesn't even make a good airplane read! I mean, the story is very well researched, but the main character, Fluke Kelso, is made to look like James Bond, and the situations he faces are even more improbable and involuntarily funny than the ones Mr. Bond has to put up with. When I finished this book, I left it on the plane and erased my name from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A post cold-war, cold-war style trhiller","review":"This is a compelling page-turner that will keep you up at night. If you enjoy cold-war thrillers, Robert Harris has figured out how to bring them back to life in this post cold-war era. This book has an outstanding plot tied to a secret notebook that was supposedly stolen from Stalin on the day that he died. From the moment we learn of this missing notebook (on about page 2) through to the last page, Harris takes us on a wild ride from Moscow through the Northern reaches of what used to be know as The Soviet Union. The story never slows.Harris is a masterful fiction writer. He uses words that paint pictures so vivid that we feel we are with the characters. He weaves historical facts into a wonderful tale that had me reading every free minute over the course of three days. If you are looking for an exciting piece of fiction, don't miss adding this book to your reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Paced Intelligent Thriller","review":"As a lover of history, I found this book to be quite disturbing (in a good sense). It is fast paced (I finished it in two nights)and offers the reader a good look into the past as well as the present while being wrapped around a scary fictional scenerio. The author does a great job of introducing the story and leading you through the twists and turns of a tortured modern Russia that refuses to let go of its communist, dictatorial past. Again this book comes to a disturbing sequence of events (one that is probably not out of the question in today's Russia) that will leave you both highly satisfied in the book and deeply disturbed at the attitudes of Russia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book, but for one niggling problem...","review":"I loved this book, even the ending others have found ridiculous or straining credibility. It was a flight of historical fantasy, yes, but it is not impossible and a riveting story. But there's one flaw that's bothered me in the months since I read it - Fluke passes the stadium where Russia is playing somebody in soccer. The game is tied, goes into overtime, and ends 3-2. But hey! International soccer goes into overtime very, very rarely - only in certain playoff matches - and tied games end tied 99% of the time. This could have been the 1997 Italy-Russia playoff, but that didn't go into overtime. Was this just an edit made for Americans? Or did Harris really not know how the game works? Either way, I found that to be a bothersome, insulting part of an otherwise excellent novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but slow","review":"Robert Harris is a good writer. He describes the place and emotion well. The first part is very exciting, that's why I got this book. As you continue, the description of the place is good. The suspense is there,you'll feel Russia with all its secrets, the politics,power and corruptions of the past and present rulers over its people and the struggle of everyday people. The plot is good, the secret documents of Stalin. But , about midway towards the end, it lost its drive. I find it hard to finish the book, but I finished it. It drags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling premise - very poor follow-through","review":"The premise of this book - How would the face of modern Russia change if Stalin's attrocities were ever brought to light (through the discovery of his secret journel) - is a very compelling theme. Harris starts us on the journey down this path in a suspensefull manner that makes the book hard to put down for the first 100 pages. Past that, the plot falls apart and becomes one non-sensicle farce after another. Past the first 100 pages, all character development (such that there is) stops and Harris seems to change his tone and begins to regard the reader as a teenage girl reading \\"The Nancy Drew Mysteries\\". This book has a wonderfull premise, a passing beginning, but in the end, falls well short of it's promise.Having read other works by Robert Harris, I would have to say this: If you are a Harris fan, you will probably not be too disapointed; if you are a first time Harris reader, I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Harris. Among the elite in thriller wrtiting.","review":"Robert Harris, Archangel. Purchased at the airport in Sydney in Nov. for my return travel to Europe. It took some time to get into the book, but when I did I could feel as I almost was there together with Fluke.A very good plot, very in much in time with the world scene. When I closed the book, 10 to 11 hours had pased and I said to my self, oh great, I am nearly home. 11 hours of booring flight is gone. As good as Fredrick Forsythe,Robert Ludlum,Ken Follett and Colin Forbes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Beach/Plane Fare","review":"Good airplane or beach reading, this thriller hangs on the premise that Stalin had a personal diary that no one ever read, and which has remained hidden since his death. A U.S. historian/journalist in semi-disrepute is invited to a conference about Stalin in Moscow where he is approached by an old man with just such a wild tale. Everything proceeds to careen through 4 wild days from the \\"new Russia\\" of pricey Moscow bars and hookers to the bleak forests of Archangel in the far north. It's a good ride, imparting lots of useful factoids about Stalin and his current appeal while delivering a solid Robert Ludlumish conspiracy thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A View from Moscow, Russia","review":"Archangel is one of not so many books available today, where author really understands what's going on in today's Russia, gives his interpretation about the history and its impact on today and it is really interesting to read about the events in Moscow living in Moscow in less than 1 km. from the Beria mansion. The other great book that should be mentioned in this context is \\"Snow Wolf\\" by Glenn Meade that also covers the last days of Stalin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misses the mark at times","review":"Only \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" kept me as intensely interested from start to finish, but Archangel depends a little too much on simple stereotypes and misconceptions of Russia and the Russian people. It is a suspenseful, entertaining book, even with the lack of political and social understanding it displays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointingly average","review":"The subject matter of this book is intriguing. Harris outlines the role of the past in modern Russia acutely, and illustrates well the conflict that this brings. The plot develops slowly and peaks all too quickly however, without ever generating suspense. Harris leaves his characters desperately undeveloped (with the exception of O'Brian), distancing the reader rather coldly from the events. Lacking style and flair, this is a novel that never really fulfills its potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"Although I enjoyed his first two books, this one is a complete waste of time. The plot is convoluted and ridiculous. The characters are so poorly drawn you can barely keep them straight in your mind. And the ending is so ludicrous that it's laughable. If you're looking for thrillers, there are a lot better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere close to \\"Pompeii\\"...","review":"If you are considering this item because you have enjoyed the author's excellent \\"Pompeii: A Novel\\" - forget it. This book is not only quite inferior to \\"Pompeii\\" in terms of the quality of research and the breadth of the story, but also the \\"Archangel\\" is - simply put - rather boorish, dragged-out and disjoint. Considering the number of half-developed characters, the number of half-cooked sub-plots completely irrelevant to the story, and a rather illogical ending, a reader cannot shake the feeling that this book was supposed to be twice as long, but the author himself got completely bored of it all half along the way, retroactively inserted a dozen events to make a quick conclusion possible, and abandoned his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time","review":"i read fatherland and thought it was a very entertaining and involving book. this book was convoluted, the characters were hard to follow, and ultimately the story was not that interesting. there are too many books out there to waste your time with this one. i am annoyed with myself for finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literate thriller that probes contemporary Russia","review":"I confess that I know very little about what actually is going on in Russia today, so I cannot assess whether or not Robert Harris' appraisal of conditions there is accurate. However, his fictional depiction of the enduring appeal of Stalinism as a possible threat to the (so-called) democratic reforms in Russian society is certainly provocative, and his insights into the internal workings of Stalin's mind and the terrors of his regime make for fascinating reading.There are some sections of the book that drag a bit, but overall, Harris succeeds in creating a slow buildup of tension that keeps the reader turning the pages right up until the final sentence. His depiction of his characters and of geographical locations is skillful and convincing, and overall, the book is impressively well-written. For people interested in historical fiction related to Soviet and Russian history, this book definitely makes for a fine \\"summer read.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lumbering towards disappointment","review":"I sat down on a flight to Chicago, looking forward to demolishing the new Robert Harris. 'Enigma' had been a reasonable read, if a little over done. Sadly, 'Archangel' was hard work. Great concept, and a pretty good initial hook, with Fluke Kelso uncovering this slender link to the hidden memoirs of Stalin. The first fifty or so pages sets up the premise and the story builds with some momentum....but by page 150, it still feels like set up!Harris's style takes a bit of digesting and does not make for a fluid, easy read. His knowledge of history is great and I now feel better briefed on Russia's legend and culture. But his characters are a bit wooden and I never got to connect with Fluke Kelso.The final few chapters do have some pace and some action, but it's more like Rambo than the 'great literary thriller' the cover boasted! Harris can do better and will do better.

The G2 pilot pro I ordered for $5,that Amazon carries, is a much better pen and you can modify a mont blac refill with a small sissor cut and slip it right into the G2 pro, making it write like a thousand dollar pen.

The quality is excellent, way better than any cassette deck.Unfortunately, no microphone is included with the unit. My only other complaint is that the buttons are small and not as easy to operate as you typical mini-cassette recorder.Finally, I find it rugged.

Either way I am buying it TOMORROW because I know it will rock out pretty hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"....... Oh my god","review":"Holy $hit. This is incredible. Thgis DvD rules and having the CD lets you listen to most of the songs anywhere you have a Walkman. it rules. There is no other way to describe it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful DVD","review":"I own a lot of live DVDs and this has to be one of the worst. Chester can't hold his vocals, the crowd seems disinterested and the whole thing looks so phony. Even pleading from the band can't seem to get the crowd going. I still like Linkin Park but will stick to their studio work. Seemed to me that with limited energy from band and crowd, a smaller crowd and venue would have been a better choice for a live album. Many empty seats in the Texas stadium.Save your $$ or buy a real live album like RATM at the Olympic. Now that's a metal/hip hop concert that ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for what it is...","review":"This concert is effectively a reproduction of their studio work, and its decent. However, the atmosphere and audience engagement just isnt there, which in my opinion spoils what vibe they could actually bring. One thing I hate is when people say they've got talent... they have virtually none, bar they're ability to write a radio-friendy, \\"i'm so hardcore man,\\" song for the masses. If you want to see real talent, check out Dream Theater, (and their new live DVD)...that is what its about! On a positive note they do play most of their good songs off Hybrid Theory (IMO Meteora all sounds the same and is terrible anyway), and the mix is not bad. But the bottom line is if you want to be a sheep who follows mainstream not-even-half-decent music, this is for you, but otherwise, steer clear, and find some quality music instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Concert DVD I Have Heard","review":"Ok, their songs sound pretty good on albums....for obvious reasons. Thats ok once you get past the repetitive, emo, my girlfriend makes me cry lyrics. So I was very interested in how they were going to pull off a live performance without all that help they get in the studio.Crash and Burn. The songs sound exactly like the album, there is no crowd noise or cheering because they couldnt use ambient microphones. Why? Because the singer has to have loads of effects on his voice just to sound decent. So there is no live feel at all. I think most of the instruments have backing tracks. There is no jamming. No improv. Its a joke. This is the worst concert DVD I have seen. If they would find a singer who can sing and write, they would be pretty good. Unless you are a pathetic fan-boy, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST FRIGGIN BAND IN THE WORLD!!!!!","review":"This CD/DVD combo is a must have for any Linkin Park fan! Its jammed packed with everything that you could ever expect from an LP concert (without being there). There is nothing and I mean NOTHING that is wrong with this. And if youre an LP fan to the bone, you wont notice anything out of sorts anyway. You definately should pick this up and ROCL ON!!!!!!! LP RULES!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Live CD/DVD","review":"It took them 4 years, but it's finally here. Nothing defines a band more than their live performance, and fans of Linkin Park will not be disappointed. The CD/DVD combo is nice, as live performances are better watched than just listened to. Linkin Park is just as intense live with their music. The energy level is high, and it is maintained throughout the performance. Those who are not LP fans may even want to check this one out. It's an awesome value."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I am SO glad I bought this concert. I have always loved linkin park and laways wabted to go to a concert, and this DVD was like being there. This was definitely worth my money and I reccomend to any Linkin Park fan that you buy this DVD as soon as you get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"You feel like your there!!","review":"Words can't describe this awesome CD/DVD. I've seen them in concert a few times, and I have to say I feel like I'm there. This is a must If your a Linkin Park fan, and even If your not It's still a great CD/DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert - Awesome Music - Too much Camera Motion","review":"Really started to get into Linkin Park recently. Thought it would be neat to get a concert DVD to see how good they are performing live. Still amazing how Chester doesn't loose his voice after every show! The energy and skill of these guys is tremendous. Seeing that there aren't too many rock bands around today - it is good to see a band like Linkin Park is thriving and doing phenomenal. Sound is great on both disks. The biggest complaint is the camera work is constantly moving and 'focusing' which is ok for a 5 minute video - for 90 minutes it gets to be a headache. I get the concept of all the motion and action, but they invented 'steady-cams' for a reason! Great band, concert and energy - just find a director without ADHD to settle things down a bit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LP RULES!","review":"Ok Linkin Park is a great band live. I actually went to the dallas concert that they recorded the dvd at. In response to the most recent review saying that the crowd is louder for LP that 'tallica and that LP is the greatest performing band out there. That is a little extreme. THe crowd was not louder for LP than metallica. No could would be. And yes i agree Linkin Park is one of the best performing bands out there. But no-one and i mean NO-ONE is a better performing band than METALLICA. Even the horrible music from St. Anger rocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park Rocks Again!","review":"Another Linkin Park CD-they have done it again! They are totally awesome live, with the CD, and the DVD is just like being at their concert! I highly recommend \\"LIVE IN TEXAS\\" to any LP fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Louder than Metallica?","review":"I too went to this show and it was, to say the least, incredible. All the bands sounded great and the atmosphere was electric. I have to comment on the reviewer saying that the crowd was louder for LP than for Metallica. What show were you at? I am not a big Metallica fan, but there is no way that the crowd was louder for LP. I'm sorry but that day Metallica proved why it is a legend in rock. They performed an incredible show. Not to detract from LP, as their perfomance was exceptional also and I will be buying this set. But notice in the DVD how some sections of the crowd around the bowl were not so full. Believe me when Metallica went on stage it was SRO. Overall an incredible day I will never forget and this combo will keep it fresh in my memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"Being new to flaring, I wanted a tool that would do the job right and be somewhat easy.

Now my 2nd granddaughter is two and she is still enjoying the animal movements along with the tunes (although I must say the keys are waaaaaaay too hard to operate). The toy provides a nice selection of tunes and the spinning animals entertain, but the other aspects are not really worth mentioning: the difference between the instrument sounds is not very interesting and using it as a keyboard is just too hard. Battery life and durability are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!!","review":"My 2 and a half year old LOVES this toy. He loves pressing the buttons and dancing to the little songs (they have short little songs which play as the little plastic animals make their little circus moves--adorable). It also acts like a regular play piano, which the child plays. You can select whether you want the horn, organ, violin sound or another sound. Also, I emailed the toy company (Kidoozie) and they said there is no BPA or PVC in the toy (a big plus for me--it is really hard to find plastic, fun toys which don't have PVC)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animals only work for a few days","review":"The piano is really cute, and we were excited to give it to our one year old on her birthday. However, even after replacing the batteries time and time again, the piano is the only part that worked about a week after giving it to her, the animals do not move anymore, so she would get very upset when she anticipated their movements and nothing happened.

This catalog will be used as a research tool to show how plentiful and relatively inexpensive some of these appendages still were as late as the mid/late 1980's.

Sharp, crystalline fractures of sound, with fragments of disembodied melody meted out in small amounts. \\"Laughter of Birds Bloody Mud\\" adds tapeloop maestro Jason Lescalleet creating a dense wall of disintegrating noise, while the guests on \\"The Moon Is A Clear Mark of Midnight\\" (shakuhachi and percussion) make for an almost orchestral lushness. I managed to catch them live a few months back and their live set was really tight. Given their focus and seriousness onstage, I thought they might be a bit pretentious, but I talked with them a bit after the show and in fact they are ridiculous characters (showing a mild predilection for off-color humor and absurd antics)!

Mary Mackenzie teaches us the process of compassionate communication without our even knowing it. This process makes it more likely that our own needs will be met, as well as the needs of others. She shows us how to connect with ourselves and with others, but does not leave us there - once we have connected we make requests, based on the valuing of our own and others' needs.

At first glance this appears to be a sturdy, well-designed tool. But the critical part-the cutter wheel- wobbles like a cheap child's toy. It WILL NOT track a circle around a pipe, instead running random spirals that never meet. I was unable to make a single cut or even get it to track one circle. The way it is designed, it cannot work because the cutter wheel is so loose. Even if the cutter wheel and its pivot axle were sized properly I would have my doubts because the cutter is mounted on the adjustable portion of the tool instead of the fixed portion, which give it less tracking stability than other tools. This is another example of poor quality Chinese products that are a shameful waste of manufacturing resources.

Kind of brother .. Same look and design, however its just glossy finish on top instead of dull finish. Rest is best, I was able to setup this mouse very easily with my Sony VAIO VGN-CR320 laptop. Its gr8 to have a bluetooth mouse with my sony Laptop, Every time I switch on the mouse it auto connect just about in 5 secs. Works best on every surface, I most of the time use it on my bed on bed sheet. Very smooth working, So far never happen to get a chance to change battery .. However it looks good battery life.Only Problem : For mans rather with big hands people its bit tough initially as mouse not comfy in terms of width and for long use you might feel little pain in center part of your palm.

After 6 months of not very heavy use, Mouse #1 committed suicide. Mouse #2 works sporadically with connection issues whether with my sony laptop or imac. Now I think this is a very overpriced gadgety product. Plain vanilla travel mice and cordless types work fine and are more comfortable to hold onto.

Readers coming to this series for the first time should start with the first volume. Powell's work is social comedy in the tradition of Jane Austen and George Meredith. Contemporary writers with whom he is often compared include Marcel Proust and Evelyn Waugh. The 12 short novels of A Dance to the Music of Time give a panoramic picture of English upper-class social life from 1921 to 1971 that is both intensely realistic and amazingly funny. Readers either love Powell's work or can't understand what others see in it. My own opinion is that Dance is the best novel written in the twentieth century. Others share this view: A Dance to the Music of Time is #43 on the recently constructed Random House/Modern Library 100 Best Poll (of twentieth century fiction) and was made into a 4-part miniseries on British television just about a year ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning Curve by DJ Rap","review":"Wow, was I disappointed.

In this case, however, Immortal Technique has earned every one of these five-star reviews. Much like dead prez, Technique combines uncompromisingly revolutionary political messages with amazing skills and complex lyrics. Best of all, he doesn't come off as \\"preachy\\" or as substituting politics for musical ability (e.g., Michael Franti). My favorite tracks are \\"Peruvian Cocaine,\\" an innovative posse cut which traces the path that illegal drugs take to reach the streets, and \\"The 4th Branch,\\" which illustrates the mainstream media's complicity in war. I would also highly recommend Technique's first album, \\"Revolutionary, Vol 1\\". Unfortunately, Amazon.com doesn't carry it, but it's worth the effort of tracking down."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"This album is over rated as hell and is definately not a 5 star album.

It's simply the same B.S message that we've heard from Chuck D, Paris, and other similar and just as crappy artists. This is not entertaining, and there is no intelligence here either.

Immortal Technique has a raw flow with hilarious punchlines and astonishingly great beats. This is a great album through-and-through. I knew about almost all the political things he brought out, but he does it so cleverly and with so much energy you can't help but stop and think about what he's saying.

He never Composes that annoying melody that you never know what movie it is from, but always composes to be felt throughout the entire scene and beyond. You listen to his melodies and you don't even know they are there. If George Fenton ever deserved an acadamy award it is the moving and gentle score to Anna and the King. This movie deserves awards as does one of the best scores I have ever heard. Where is the music from?

Encouragingly, she shows thatsuch epidemics are beatable. Discouragingly, she also shows that nobody whowith power to implement solutions actually gives a damn. But the horrorsof Ebola fade somewhat before the horrors of the collapse of healthcarein Russia. Garrett interlaces statistics with personal stories but itsthe stats which I find more horrifying. Its easy to dismiss one badstory as just that, but the stats show the deep horror of a failedstate.

This dynamic superwoman occasionaly outruns her facts (penicillin is NOT a sulfa drug) but she has produced a classic that ranks with Zinsser, DeKruif and Sinclair Lewis in understanding the obligation that governments have to preserving the public's health. Unfortunately, when the US Constitution and Bill of Rights were written health was up to God so the right to health was never recognized. Consequently public health has been left to the police powers of the state, and of whatever state is involved. Garett chronicles the failure of politicians to respond to their responsibilities and the lip of the precipice where we all stand. It is a wonderful book and a synoptic view of the failure of public responsibility and governmental bundling that puts us all in jeapordy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick it up until you put it down.","review":"Garrett was amazing in relaying all the relevant facts to the increasingly destabilizing realm of global public health.

Laurie Garret succeeded to highlight the issues of poverty, social disparities, political unrest and their relation to health in a number of countries. On the other hand, the content of information was biased due to its selective nature of presentation (at least in chapter on the Former Soviet Union). Nevertheless, overall the book is a standalone powerful tool that is targeted on a general public in order to raise its awareness of the problems of the global public health."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well-written book for amateurs","review":"It is a well-written book.

The story focuses on Frankie Griffin, a 17 year old male in the middle of a dysfunctional family, who is becoming a man. His family treats him like an outsider. His nationalist mother and his father who is always away. His sister Maggie, who thinks everything he says is 'stew-pit', his youngest brother Noelie who acts like he's 6 despite being 10, thanks to brain damage, and his other two siblings, sister Dawn and brother Ray. It follows his antics with his friends, the girls he likes and the girls that are seemingly obsessed with him. His mothers anti-british attitude is also hilarious at times.

It is a wonderful combination of personal experiences and medical facts.She raises awareness as to how the birth process has become a medical condition, the effect this may have/has had on mothers and infants, and helps you realize that the mother should be the decision maker in how she brings her child into this world. She does this with little or no bias by presenting the facts and allowing the reader to draw his/her own conclusions.

As the story goes you learn that Zel's mother sold her soul to the devil in order get her daughter.

I think the thing that I despise the most is that she uses so many simple sentences. This might be alright is she was comepletely consistent with it, but since she occasionally throws in a compound sentence you realize that her pupose is not to write the whole thing in simple sentences, but that that is all the ability she has to write.Overall, the plot is quite good, but the poor quatlity of writing reuins it for me and I simply cannot believe anyone could actually like this book.

Given that these are Alpine, Type R speakers, I figured I did not have enough power pushing them to get the true sound and performance that the speakers are made for. I then hooked them up to my 4 Channel Kicker Amp, and the sound was night and day difference. The bass was deep, sounds almost like mini subs, the mids and highs are out of this world. If you buy these, hook them up to amp and you will not regret it all. You will hear sounds in a song that you have never heard before. Great speakers and I would recommend anyone to buy them if they will hooked up to an amp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sound","review":"The only issue is that unlike the other speakers in this line these did not come with with lead wires and connectors.

The real-life Fidel may be a ruthless dictator or a heroic leader; in either case though, he is a charismatic figure who transcends time and enemies. The author's Fidel is a one-dimensional, cliche-speaking, cartoon like character. Worse can be said of the other two protagonists, ball-player Billy Bryan and the love of his life photographer Malena Fonseca. Nothing in this novel seems right.

I've had no problem fitting any of the tools I already have into it, and it still has room if/when I buy new sets of drivers/wrenches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"I got this item to store a slightly expanded beyond the basics tool kit behind the seat of my Ford Ranger truck. Space is limited there and every thing else I looked at was either too big and bulky or it did not have enough individual pockets to do the job. The tool roll seems to be constructed pretty well. I have about 20 pounds of tools rolled up in it and it holds together nicely when moved around or carried. I figured out additional larger tools such as a claw hammer and pipe wrench can be carried in it as well by laying them lengthwise with the roll when rolled up and securing them with the straps on the exterior. Storage for sockets, both short and deep well, could be better so I gave this item 4 stars rather than 5 stars for the short-coming. Overall, a very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Tool rolls offer compact, organized storage of tools in a way that all your tools are laid out before you when needed. This roll is of very high quality construction, and the included handle and tightening straps put it far above the much simpler craftsman version with its insecure laces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made but unrealistic","review":"Can't argue with the quality construction, but not very practical once you load it with tools. A slightly smaller profile that was meant to hold half as many tools would be handier. And offering in two colors would allow you to grab the roll you needed. And frankly I'm not fond of the buckles either. For tool rolls as with tools -- simpler is better. I wish I hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its pretty good","review":"Bought this tool roll to carry some loose camping equipment on longer trips. It fits my tent stakes, pop flares, 550 cord, tin snips, cable binders, knife sharpener, knife/fork/spoon, etc. that often get lost due to lack of proper organizational pockets in larger rucksacks It also fits matches, wire, methanol fuel, etc. in the 3 pouches. Material is pretty decent and has a plastic coating on the inside, making it easy to clean. The cinch-up straps use a cam buckle, which holds it really tight, but can be cumbersome when opening and closing it often. If space is tight in my ruck, I can attach it to the outside MOLLE webbing using the straps. The handle is tough and durable, and the elastic strap down the middle of the inside keeps items from falling out Overall, I haven't found a better tool roll in this price range, and I just ordered another to use as a tool roll for my truck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool Roll-Up","review":"I got tired of having my paleo tools make holes in my daypack when I was in the field. This takes care of that problem. Everything rolls up wonderfully well, nothing sticks out, and everything is protected. The material seems to be very rugged and the size and shape fit perfectly in my pack next to my nalgenes. My only criticism is that they should have figured out a better way of opening the pack. As it is, you have to loosen the straps and edge them off the ends of the roll. A set of releasing buckles as are found on many belts, would have been more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little or a lot?","review":"I loved this form of storing and carrying tools. If you have just a few tools you won't have a large cumbersome case full of nothing to carry. And if you have 8, 9, 10 or even more tools (depending on their size and how you organize them) your tool roll can also hold them nicely. Not to mention they also seem sturdy, which is essential when dealing with tools. I got exactly what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful voice singing beautiful music","review":"I was delighted to discover that this CD is still available as a \\"manufactured on demand\\" item so that I could give it to someone else and introduce them to this wonderful singer.Anne Hills has perhaps the loveliest voice in contemporary folk music, or maybe in contemporary music of all types. This is one of her earliest albums, and I think it may be her best. There is quite a variety of songs on this CD, ranging from the traditional Water is Wide to the relatively new Last Days of Pompeii. Anne seems to specialize in songs that tell stories about extraordinary ordinary people, and her Donna from Mobile alone is worth the price of the album. Unfortunately, the sample gives you a nice piece of the orchestration on this CD, which I thought was excellent, but it never gets to the song! To get a feel for Anne's voice, listen to the sample of The Water is Wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding photography and essays.","review":"Eric's photography shows his ultimate commitment to artistic perfection.

Overall there are some great tunes on this CD. His original compositions are excellent. His reworking of Video Killed the Radio Star is an emotional grabber. Geoff Downes does justice to the cover tunes on the CD, most notably Nights In White Satin. This CD would have rated 5 stars, but I couldn't get into the arrangement of one of my all time favorites, A Whiter Shade of Pale. The organ parts were great, but the piano solo on AWSOP was lacking.

Like other previous reviews state, this product is little more than an over sized fan. I have another swamp cooler from a different manufacturer, and it actually cools, but this one is literally no different from my normal cheap circular fan, just louder. Except my fan doesn't leak water all over my floor. This swamp cooler came with a hairline crack at one of the wheels, obviously some kind of design flaw. It's not the only design flaw, I don't know what they were thinking about having the water volume meter impossible to read, or the place to put in the water hardly large enough to stick a straw into.

I kept finding myself putting down Elizabeth Kostova's HISTORIAN to pick up Dolby's novel. They're EXTREMELY different books, but some nights I couldn't deal with the Ottomon Empire and its association with Vlad The Impaler (Dracula) and wanted something fun to read. The author clearly has (or had) his hand on the pulse of what it was (or is) to be young, gay and trying to make a name for himself in New York. (Wait, Dracula may be more closely related to the subject matter than I realized) Seriously, in several instances I found myself not liking some of the main character's (Toby) choices. Of course this is not the author's fault, he allowed his character to take his appropriate journey and we as the reader (whether we liked Toby's choices or not) got to watch from the outside in -- even if we ocassionally cringed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The literary equivalent of a snack ...","review":"... pleasant enough but not much substance.Yet another \\"coming-to-grips-with-being-gay\\" story, \\"The Trouble Boy\\" should keep you entertained for the duration of a plane journey but you're likely to forget it pretty soon afterwards.Tom Dolby's style is uniformly journalistic throughout, i.e. punchy, and at times even quite amusing. This enables him to sustain the pace but somewhat prevents the characters from being much more than cardboard cut-outs. The flash-back to the university episode did not gel with the rest of the novel and managed to be artificial instead of adding depth.Some readers might also treat \\"The Trouble Boy\\" as a \\"roman a clefs\\" and engage in a spot who is who game that may add piquancy to this otherwise rather bland concoction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous and fun, but not great literature","review":"I only read gay debut novels if the author is hot, since most gay debut novels are largely autobiographical and I usually use the author's image when envisioning the protagonist's actions. Tom Dolby's picture passed the test, so I bought the book, and finished it in one night. Spiced with often amusing social observations, several references to my favorite fashion designers, and enjoyably superficial characters, The Trouble Boy did keep me hooked. I was very disappointed when Toby, the protagonist, made the \\"right\\" decision at the end, and all of a sudden almost everything in his life became perfect. So, the superficial characters and predictable storyline will keep critics from calling this great literature, but who cares, since it's a fun read.By the way, TOBY = TOm dolBY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Goes deep into the pysche of the main character without getting too over the top.

Joy Division was recorded here for the John Peel Show. It's sound quality is excellent as are most of Peel's recordings.

That live recording of New Order is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a strange mix","review":"this cd set is not for those new to these bands or, to music of this era.

Summertime hit me hard when Fantasia Burrino sang it on AI3, which is a powerful song to begin with.

Fourtunately we were getting off of the cruise ship so fellow passengers helped us wrangle up all of the bills.Bottom line- this wallet does not safely contain ANYTHING in the main bill compartment. Even when it was folded up, I was still concerned about money falling out... if one isn't meticulous in putting the bills in just right they would stick out a little.I will never use this again and won't even give it to my son to use...

It is also handy for hiking and camping as it is much lighter than a typical leather billfold filled with credit cards, business cards and other stuff you don't need in the wilderness.This new one has an additional interior pocket that closes with Velcro - a nice addition not in the older model.All in all, a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"I have not been able to find a replacement for my 2-fold nylon wallet by Rolf's.

This is because one end of this comparment is entirely open and the compartment for the dollar bills is secured only when the entire wallet is folded. I fail to appreciate how this product can even be called a wallet when there is no secured compartment for bills. Granted, commados may never need to carry dollar bills or they are trained with special skills to secure them in this product.

I would strongly advise against buying this.If anyone knows where a high-def version (with 5:1 surround sound if possible) of this performance can be found, I'd be grateful if you shared it.

Kassandra Sojourner's stirring and powerful story of the beginning of the fall of Crete is one to read more than once. More than a coming of age saga, the novel weaves a compelling web of intrigue, lies, and prophecies as it brings alive the fate of one of the last Goddess cultures. Joining Ansel are other richly drawn characters: her mother, Phoebe, Escort of Knossos and psychic spy; Geneera, the graceful athlete coming to grips with her love of women; and Theseus, lover, traitor and savior.Those who love visionary fiction and stories of the Goddess will enjoy this book immensely. My only regret is that the sequel is not yet in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instantly Forgetable","review":"I wanted the story to be good. I wanted to like it.

The book jumps, seemingly randomly, from one scene to the next and the reader can easily lose what little focus this story provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for music's sake","review":"Being able to play your songs again has to be a musician's dream. Many people will pick at this cd because it's not their definition of what real music is. This is just real music that you'll either love it or hate it, but it don't matter about your opinion because the band did this because they love music.

Since purchasing this album, I have not been able to stop listening to it. I was a big fan of the orignal Keasbey Nights and was skeptical if this album would be worth buying. Streetlight's version is a great cd that is different enough to not be repetative of the original, but still maintains the qualities that made the original great. For the most part the sound is much cleaner in recording and the new solos, arrangments and verses on some tracks add new life to the original songs.

Many people will probly dislike this album because its different than Keasbey Nights, but that's the point. It's different and it's good. Tomas knows what he is doing and like Keasbey Nights, A Call To Arms, and Everything Goes Numb, this is one of the best CDs that I've heard in a while.

First of all, it seems like Tomas Kalnoky just wanted to make this album to spite Catch 22.Even though I knew this album was going to be a remake of Keasbey Nights, I thought it would at least sound something like Everything Goes Numb, which is one of my favorite albums.Basically, the main addition is a stronger but bland and uninteresting horn line for most of the songs.The music completely lacks any personality, and it just isn't fun to listen to.Tomas Kalnoky needs to realize that his music is for FANS to listen to, not for his personal enjoyment.

Almost all (99.999%) joints need two or more dowels - a proper machining fixture needs to locate the multiple holes without moving the jig so that the holes are exactly the same distance apart on the mating boards. So right off the bat, this CAN'T work. On top of that, the turret is sloppy and the drill guide holes are sloppy. The result is the holes just end up \\"wherever\\". You could do BETTER with a careful layout and a brad point drill bit - no kidding. Not exactly what you need, right? I can't believe they're now charging $35 for this thing. Save your money.

Grizzly and Rockler have middle ground jigs that are ok (but not perfect) for about this kind of $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy design results in misaligned holes","review":"Regardless of how precisely you mark your intended hole location, line up the jig and crank it down, this jig does not hold the bit true. It allows the bit to move as well as drill at a slight angle. The result is that the wood you are joining does not line up and needs substantially more sanding than should be necessary with doweling. The revolving turret seems to be the weakest link in this product with the turret slide not far behind. I'm returning this product and will spend a little more money on a self-centering jig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor results","review":"I have found through several tries that this jig just does not have anywhere near the precision results needed to be able to successfully use dowels to join wood. The drill bit tends to go in at a slight angle and can be off center. The holes just don't line up."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap price and not worth it","review":"Largest problem is that it is aluminum and has no hardened inserts for drilling thru.

The clamp ends as well as the clamping screw are plastic, allowing the entire tool to shift with even a slight amount of pressure. Only one guide arm has a set screw, this also affects the tool's stability. The graduated guide bars are nearly impossible to read and not nearly exact enough for this type of work. Spent several frustrating hours with this tool and several more sanding the the joints it created. Again, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly piece of junk.","review":"I purchased mine years ago for a project that I did not want to use biscuits on. I QUICKLY found that this jig lacks any real positive stops. The workkmanship is so sloppy that the bit guide simply wobbles around as you insert the bit through it, causing misalignment of the bit, and potentially throwing off the drilled hole. Out of 10 sets of matching holes, 2 in my work piece were badly misaligned. Avoid this tool if at all possible.If you read my other reviews, you will see I rarely slam a product.

I have been disapointed with it's performance. The housing is plastic and the cast iron table mount into the plastic base lacks rigidity. this makes it hard to sand anything square considering the attractive looking table with it's 90 degree slots. The attachment bolts for the belt table are difficult to work because of he lack of clearance. You also have to remove the belt table in order to change the belt. In hind sight I would have bought a more exspensive sander with a cast iron base. Consider what plastic does if you were to sand metal. The graphite on the belt platten wore off right away.

The mixture on SoapOpera shows the range of audiences that they can reach. With songs likes \\"Preresquisite Rocker\\" and \\"Martyrs\\", the Jellybricks show their rock-n-roll side. Switching it over to ballads like \\"too far\\" and \\"bittersweet day\\" shows that the guys--Bryce, Larry, Garrick, and Laine--are indeed flexible. Take the time and check out this release you won't be dissapointed.

The explanation of the poses was easy to follow. This is definately not a DVD that will collect dust in my closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for peple with back problems, good for strong beginners","review":"Stephanie Snyder teaches at Yoga Tree in San Francisco and I have been to her classes. The vinyasa routine was way to slow for me and spent too much time explaining basic things that experienced yogis already know. People fairly new new to yoga who want a strong vinyasa class should like this.I could not do the core routine past the first set of exercises because it hurt my back. Actually it didn't hurt my back because I didn't actually do them but I fast forwarded through the entire 30 minutes and I know all the excersises would have had me laid up in pain. I think part of her back ground is Forest yoga and I have found that Forest yoga is awful for people with back problems.Stephanie is a very good teacher and extremely popular in the Bay Area. However, avoid her style if you have back problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Yoga DVD!","review":"I must have 40 yoga and pilates dvds - from Rodney Yee to Ana Brett's Kundalini series.

The Craftsman equivalent, #967173, is built better. Unlike what a previous reviewer says, this particular Craftsman unit does not require you to remove the chuck from your drill.The bushing runout is similar on both units, with the Craftsman probably a little tighter - at least comparing the units I have. The Craftsman is also made of cast aluminum with much thicker and heavier guide bars. There is also a spring return that should help press the unit flat against your work for added stability. There is a handle and more surface area on the base for holding the unit against your work and applying clamps. The General is made of injection molded plastic, and lacks all of the above features.Plus, I bought my Craftsman for the regular store price of about 27 bucks.Pretty no-brainer on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like cr*py things made in China, you would love this tool","review":"Thing has arrived in a good looking box.

There is absolutely NO runout on the spindle, which fits into precision bushings.

How many times in one song can you repeat \\"when i look in a little girl's eyes\\" or \\"you're my flavor\\"? I mean, really.

I'm surprised that a great number of musicians aren't declaring him one of the most talented artist of the decade. Listen to his funky melodic bass lines on this album. Any serious bass player would benifit from learning those bass licks. Overall, \\"5\\" is a CD chock full of excellent funk-rock w/ techno-style retro soul.By the way, I want to thank Lenny and his record company for rewarding the true fans who bought \\"5\\" w/out the bonus tracks.

If you have never listened to Lenny Kravitz before, start with this album. From the funky \\"Supersoul\\" to the soul-searching \\"I Belong to You\\", Kravitz takes you through several genres of music, a successful experiment of his talents.

He knows how to blend or play separately rock, soul, funk, R&B, etc., and you never know what you might get. This album is on the funkier side of things, and I occasionally felt like I had stepped back into the 1970s. Personally, I like this album less than his debut, but \\"5\\" is definitely better than \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\". Since I truly think that he shines best in his rock and roll persona, I liked \\"Circus\\" much more than this one.

If you want to hear the same stupid lyrics sung over and over again, check out The Police; at least their monotonous lyrics are tolerable. Even though I haven't heard the rest of the album, I'll never in my right mind buy it, because I know FLY AWAY is on it. I'm rating this 2 stars because I know it is unfair to bash an entire album because of one song. I'm sure it isn't too good. After all, FLY AWAY is the only song from this album I've heard on the radio, so why should the rest, that have not been on the radio, be any better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to fly away......yeah","review":"Lenny Kravitz: were you in Milli Vanilli?

That stuff is DEEP! And, after my first listen to 'mama said' many years ago, back in college, to think I actually liked Lenny....my, oh my. Must've been the beer! Kravitz has shown absolutely no progression in his music whatsoever. In fact, every album sounds exactly the same. Another bit of evidence of the equation: freaky hair + MTV + record company induced style = Wildly successful 'artist'.

Unfortunately, it seems to me that Kravitz is heading in the wrong direction with songs that go on so long. Almost every song has a decent melody which you get quickly tired of after he plays it 10 times. Every song seemed never to end. Also, the lyrics seemed a bit corny, especially on \\"Fly Away.\\" You'd think somebody of his artistic talents could conjure up at least half decent lyrics. The one's on this album are bad. Still, I like his cover of American Woman and it's one of the two good songs on the album. All of this is to say that I know Lenny is trying to change his sound a bit but I don't think this is the best way to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boy is this ....","review":"I only chose 1 star because there was no zero.

Although this series ties in with the Empire of the East you need not read it to enjoy the Swords books.This series is primarily good fantasy fun with a lot of action and some original ideas that kept me interested throughout the three books. Dont expect a lot of character development or full resolution of all the plot lines. What you can expect is a lot of fun and a few suprises as well as some very imaginative story devices.I view this series as a bit more novelized than the Conan series or Fafrd and the Grey Mouser books. Im somewhat reminded of the Elric saga but with more action and fun and less of the gloom and despair. Fans of Brust's Taltos series might like the Swords series also although the Swords series is more genre derived and defined.I gave the Swords trilogy four stars instead of five simply because I do not believe the series will have the staying power like that of Tolkien, Donaldson, Brooks etc...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good fantasy read","review":"The setting takes place on earth and the Greek gods on high.

In the process of doing this, I began to do research on clothing made in the earlier part of this century. It was then that I discovered the beautiful work of Madeleine Vionnet. I saw the best work of many others, but Vionnet's dresses were pure magic, flowing and exquisite, so unlike anything of their period.

The pertinent chapter is buried within the larger work and has to be sought out.I would recommend searching for his original book, unless you are particularly interested in Mr. Dreyfus' bio."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Least Your Parents Didn't Do This....","review":"The book should get five stars for the nostalgia factor alone!!! Growing up in the seventies has ever been more unglamorously or accurately depicted as in Meg Wolitzers brilliant, funny, and touching saga of the Mellow family. Paul and Roz Mellow write a book akin to 'The Joy Of Sex' which they end up being the models for. The book becomes a massive bestseller, and changes their lives. However one evening the children pore over the pages of the book together, and witness their parents in poses that one never hopes or could even imagine their parents being in. The shock waves from this reverberates into each of their adult lives. I fell in love with these characters. They were all so real and so identifiable, you can't help see parts of your own family in theirs. I also found the book hard to put down, which is always, to me anyway, the sign of a really great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One family's story, and more","review":"Meg Wolitzer's been steadily building strength over the course of her career, and I thought she'd really peaked with The Wife -- until I picked up this book. The narrative is so assured, and laugh out loud funny, that it's impossible to put down. With a steady hand she shifts point of view chapter by chapter, as if passing a relay baton from character to character, painting a complex and complete picture of one colorful family then (in the 1970s) and now, until the very end when The Position becomes more than just the portrait of one family or an era (or a sex act!). It's a crazy, beautiful meditation on how each of us, with our own unique dysfunctions, finds happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that.","review":"After reading about 130 pages I began to feel like I had already read this. It reminds me a lot of The Corrections, though not as depressing or interesting...or good. The parents--the children and their individual perspectives and lives and then a lesbian affair. It's all been done before in The Corrections (and various other novels, come to think of it). It's boring, really. I didn't care for any of the characters, and even though I'm nearly finished with the book I still feel that they are two-dimensional. The Thea and Anne affair was so predictable--a sure sign of a mediocre book. I am only bothering because I have book group next Tuesday. I wouldn't bother if you really enjoy a well constructed novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"electric forgiveness\\"","review":"Sex, irony and subtle tragedy reign throughout the novel with sadness and love intertwined.

Funny that 'electric forgiveness' was the trademark of the parents sex guide yet forgiveness was not the families strong suit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Bookclub book for October","review":"A bit risque, but actually quite fun to read. It is the book of the month for our neighborhood bookclub and our meeting is on Monday, so will be interested in seeing how the rest of the girls felt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"POSITION yourself for a page turner","review":"Written with wit, insight and smart, intelligent prose, Meg Wolitzer writes another page turner. While very different from The Wife, this book is both psychological and filled with humor. It shows how all of us come from our own history, make choices based on that and are molded indelibly from our family way. The premise is so delicious and the outcome enfolds in such unanticipated ways that I staggered finishing the book, because I did not want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey from head to heart","review":"Each woman's story is an intimate sharing of her personal time with Jesus, as she experienced it.

I can't remember the exact chapter, but at one point Rachel's assistant Pia once again goes away from Rome to perform research in a different part of Europe. A few pages later, Pia, the assistant that went away to perform research is standing in Rome as part of a conversation. Did the editors and author not catch this?

Doing trim work, baseboard, casing etc. almost every time I bent over (which is constantly) the tines would pull from the buckle and the belt was on the floor.

Admittedly, the average reader can glean helpful information from the last chapter or so, but I truly think the information would have made a much better article in Oprah and would have reached a wider readership.

Among the connections and relationships Szporluk explores are: Ukraine-Russia; Poland-Ukraine; Russia-Poland; and Czarist Russia-the USSR. The essays, wirtten over the last 25 or 30 years, are marked by: an encyclopedic familiarity with all of the types of literature that have bearing on his subjects; a healthy respect for facts--particularly some that were long obscure to most observers--and where they lead (in the sense of not treating facts as mere fodder to be crammed into some favorite theoretical framework); and, a highly thoughtful and perceptive analysis that interrelates facts with facts, and facts with theory. If you're interested in Eastern Europe, a book not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Perhaps the reason a scant handful of reviewers here do not appreciate this book, saying that it says nothing new, is because Mr. Szporluk himself is the founder of the way modern historians and political scientists view and analyze Eastern Europe.

I love Christmas-themed stories, so one has to be really bad to disappoint me this much. It's the only David Baldacci book I've read, and I thought maybe it was an anomaly, since he seems to be quite popular. But I think I'll take \\"Sludge's\\" word for it and not read any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the Trip!","review":"David Balducci takes a break from thrillers to take the reader on a Holiday ride on the rails. Most of the characters on this cozy cross-country Christmas cruise are kinda cardboardy, and we all know the genre and seasonal requirement that they're all bound to Live Happily Ever After The End. But there is a refreshing relationship to Mark Twain and even a mystery mixed in as a sidecar. This is recommended fare - why not book a train trip and read it then? Take the time to relax and enjoy civilized transportation. Also, check out Friends of Amtrak to see what you can do to help preserve this endangered mode of mobility.Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Baldacci's work.","review":"I won't repeat the comments made by other reviewers, because I agree with them that this book is a big disappointment. I have read all of his other books and enjoyed them. I have the sneaky feeling that his 14-year-old daughter wrote this, and as a loving Dad he wanted to make her happy. His name got it to the publisher's, but it's still a book written by an adolescent."},{"rating":"1","title":"wated time and money","review":"This book isn't worthy of your time or money. Mindless pap would be a good description of this drivel. A total bore of a book that would have been better left unwritten and unread."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Derailed Christmas Train","review":"This book sounded like a third grader wrote it. The plot changed directions every other page. I agree with the other poster who said that maybe Balducci's kid wrote it. The train travel information was good and thankfully it was short. I can't bring myself to ever read his work again. I came on this site to see if it was just me - and it's not! Maybe those of us who didn't dole out extra stars are just too cynical but I, for one, could not wait for this to be over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trains, no planes Movie script not a book","review":"The train history was interesting - the characters were believable especially the amtrack employees.It seems everyone who reads this book thinks it was written to be a movie. The insights you get from 'reading the book' just are not here. Could have used more depth of emotion instead of just cute character sketches.Nice holiday feel good reading is also predictable. But I would definately see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"It's a good thing I got this book as a freebie through my book club because it is certainly not worth the cover price. I thought it would be a nice read for the holidays but I only made it through the first 100 pages and finally decided it was not worth the time. I've enjoyed several other of Baldacci's books but the Christmas Train was hardly worthy of an amateur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite Baldacci book.","review":"I have read many books by David Baldacci and had high expectations since I enjoyed the others. However, that was not the case with \\"The Christmas Train.\\" I did not enjoy the stereotypes that plagued the characters. I did not want to hear about how 'large' one of the passengers was and how tight her pants were so many, many times, for example. I also found many parts of the book predictable. I did enjoy hearing about the character's unique personalities when they were not being steretyped but that did not happen regularly enough for me to enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Christmas Train","review":"So Awful that there are no words to decribe how awful, even painful, reading this book really was.It was as if some one who was a fan of AMTRAK and train travel kidnapped Baldacci and submitted this \\"I CAN READ BOOK\\" for fourth graders in his place. I have enjoyed almost all of his work even though a few might not be prize \\"Winners\\", but this can't be his.At least the others had plots, characters and interest. So many cliches,corn and just plain bad writing. How could this be possible? Loved \\"Absolute Power\\", \\"Wish You Well\\",\\"The Simple Truth\\". Liked \\"Last Man Standing\\" and \\"The Winner and \\"Saving Faith\\" were OK.This new peace of dribble was just sad!!!!!!too. Does Nicholas Sparks know you attended his writing class???A friend had the audio copy and the narrator (a good actor who plays the VP on West Wing) did a dredful job as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Baldacci!!","review":"I like this author. His other stuff that is. This story was predictable, juvenile, boring and just beyond annoyingly stupid. If you like his other character driven books, then skip this. I found myself speed reading everything tenth word just to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything But The Kitchen Sink","review":"This tried to be everything: a romance, a mystery, a travelogue, and even contained several references to Mark Twain--but in the end failed to live up to this reader's expectation of anything but a Christmas story, and not a very well thought-out one at that. The train lore and geography were its saving features. From the author of \\"Absolute Power,\\" I would have thought there would be more action, but no--this too fizzled out after straining the limits of believability. Way too much coincidence and sappiness, even for Christmas. For a Christmas suspense novel in a snowy English country setting, tryChristmas is Murder (A Rex Graves Mystery), which at least doesn't try to be serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"I don't know what took me so long to find this little gem. I read Baldacci AND read him while I ride trains! What an oversight on my part.This book has it all: A cross country train trip, star crossed lovers who rediscover each other, a film crew, a boy's choir, an avalanche, crooks, men of the cloth, sage car attendants, circus folk, young starry eyed elopers, Amtrak lore and a big dose of holiday cheer.OK, this is not university level literature but it sure is a good yarn. bg"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Aboard the Polar Express for Adults","review":"It didn't take me long to purchase The Christmas Train at an airport bookstore of all places during my end of the year travels. I purchased it because I thought maybe it might be just what Dr. Baldacci prescribes for a bad case of the holiday-rush-arounds. I was right.Baldacci knows that train travel appeals to all of us--if we had the time. He recognizes that weary travelers fantasize about relaxed travel during the holiday season;and he fashions a story that weaves the thoughts of going home for the holidays with an adventure.When your busy schedule permits, pick up a copy of \\"The Christmas Train\\" and find yourself a little nook and cranny to read it in. You will enjoy the holiday a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"All aboard","review":"I'm not a regular Baldacci reader, though I have enjoyed two of his books. The Christmas Train, however, is a major departure for Baldacci. This is not a mystery, and there is no villain to nab....just good warm hearted storytelling about a train journey. The book has a lot going for it, love, confused passion, and the inevitable romance trains seem to exude in novels from decades back. If you're a lover of trains you'll want to experience this story. If you're a sucker for heart warming christmas story, you'll also want to read this book. If you're both a lover of trains and christmas stories, then you're doubly in luck. Get this book and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star -only cuz it can't be lower","review":"The only suspense - could I make it to the end? Well, I did, but only by skipping every second page. Every \\"scenario\\" he concocts is more ludicrous than the previous.Don't even pick this one up at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"This book was terribly disappointing. All of Balducci'sbooks are contrived but this was ridiculous. It readas if a child had written it."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't miss the train!","review":"Not a perfect 5 star for me but still a fine holiday read. The story will have you riding the rails in fun. Thought the plot was a good one but the ending could have been better. Would make a good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas train","review":"I thought it was a bit slow to start with possibbly a little predictable toward the middle but a bit of a surprise at the end,not his best work I like the a bit faster pace but still worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not like this book at all. I only kept reading it because I am using it for learning how to plot. I found several of the characters to be either stereotyped or caricatures. The only character I liked at all was a minor character named Harry or Henry or something like that. I had not connection with the protagonist, and none with his love interested either.The plot dragged on and on, and then things wrapped up too quickly at the end, and too nicely. There was too much jumping back and forth between story and exposition. If there had been some indicator of the breaks between, like *** or putting the exposition parts in italics or something, it would have been better. The book seemed to do a lot of 'telling.' I honestly would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was so impressed by David Baldacci's, The Winner and Split Second that I couldn't wait to get more of his stories. With the holidays approaching, I thought The Christmas Train might help put me in the mood to start my shopping early but...I don't know. It wasn't a 'bad' book. It was well written, and all of the information about Amtrak was very interesting. It just was hard to read. Not exactly boring, but it didn't draw me in or hold my attention the way the other two books did...surprising since I love romance novels. Frankly, I can't remember the last time it took me more than a couple of days to read a book. This took me about ten days.Maybe I'll read it again someday and see if my first impression changes. And for those wondering, I read it in October of 2011...I'm just catching up on posting some reviews now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Locomotive Lark","review":"In The Christmas Train, David Baldacci delightfully combines at least five literary genres: mystery/thriller, comedy, romance, history, and travel/adventure. At times this story of a cross-country train trip is laugh-out-loud funny, but the suspense is ever-present. Baldacci's cast of quirky characters is a hoot. This book is a great trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a trip!","review":"If you want to take a great trip without buying a ticket or resorting to mind altering drugs, read this book. It combines wit and intelligence with romance and adventure. David Baldacci's research into train travel provides an avenue for sprinklings of interesting information to appear throughout the book enabling the reader to learn without effort - almost like osmosis. This book more than fulfilled my requirements for a well written book - it placed characters who became real to me and that I cared about within a storyline that I thought about long after I'd finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a children's book?","review":"Wow, what a disappointment. This book reads like a children's book. Contrived, simple minded and sticky sweet are the first adjectives that come to my mind in describing this book. It was a painful read and if not for the fact that I just can't make myself quit reading a book once I start it, I would have it put it down early on. One very good thing, it wasn't a long book.David, I love your past work, but this one ran \\"off the tracks.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly bad","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Los Angeles. This is clearly a \\"pop it out and it'll make money for me\\" book. The story line does \\"sound\\" interesting, but the writing was woefully, almost laughably bad. I certainly don't think David Baldacci is nearly as poor an author as this effort indicates. I do, however, think it's insulting to the reader who relies on his past efforts and his reputation for him to have put forth such a poor effort. There are only two good things to say about The Christmas Train: the Amtrak information was interesting and the book was blessedly short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is just plain bad. Boring use of language, cliched, uninteresting characters, predictable plot, lame pace....ugh. I have never been so disappointed in a book. This is reminiscent of my 8th grade creative writing class when I wrote an essay about an ice skater who - gasp - injured herself right before the big event, but through her tears of self-pity and terror, gritted her teeth and fought on, training day after day, working harder than ever.....to win the gold to rounds of applause and tears of happiness and pride. You get the picture. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak writing, strong disappointment","review":"A dismally weak effort. The concept of trains and Chritsmas sounded fasinating, until I started reading. Contrived, slow moving plot combined with routine characters and insipid dialog make this a giant disappointment. Are publishers this desperate for material?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was hoping for a nice story to read on vacation but what I got instead was a headache. It was so unrealistic. It felt like the author was \\"trying\\" too hard for a romantic, feel-good story.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why I kept reading...","review":"I don't know why I kept reading, but I did. I guess I hoped the story would redeem itself. I agree with every negative review here. Please don't read this book thinking you've got a cute little Christmas story to take you into the season. It is a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Train","review":"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER...My account was charged, but the book never arrived. When I emailed to seller to try and work out what had happened, I never got a response. I finally filed a claim with Amazon.com, and they reimbursed me. Stay away from this seller!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bore-iant Express","review":"Ok, so the great cover sold me on this book. I am a train buff and thought \\"Just how bad can it really be?\\" It was worse. I once gave it as a Christmas gift to another train buff friend; no wonder he never sent a thank you card. When I was through, I couldn't even donate it to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Train","review":"I have read all of Baldacci's books and this one was a real let down, I gave up on finishing it after 100 pages. Too bad as his first books really held my interest from the first page."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"After a brilliant book like absolute power i do not believe an author could think of a crap like christmas train. It was like reading a Mills and Boons"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad it took alot out of me to keep reading","review":"Just bad!! I dont know how I keep reading this book. It went no where and the charactors where bad. Then there is an avalanceh that happends out of no where. It's a horriable christmas book that you should skip. Maybe the only good part was the person who was stealling stuff from people and even when we find out who it was it's still bad. Just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Train - All Aboard","review":"You would be crazy to waste your time with this book. I picked it up as an audio book rental from a cracker barrel on a recent trip and what a horrible book.The book itself was bad and the guy they got to read it was even worse. I would have rather listend to NPR in pig latin vs. this book.For those giving this book rave reviews...are you serious?? Are you being paid by the baldacci's? The train engineer didn't think to back the train up until the engines ran out of fuel. They blew the snow off with a helicopter. Dumb - Dumb - Dumb - Dumb - Dumb. Did I mention that it was incredibly dumb?Sorry, I don't write reviews but this was so horrible I couldn't let anyone else make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"story dragged on for too long","review":"The core of this book is a love story, surrounded by a passenger cast on a cross continental Amtrak train. Overall the novel is a disappointment. Basically the first two thirds of the book was a painful read. It drags on and on with dull and what-is-the-point subplots that prompted me to give up reading several times. But I managed to endure until the part where the train was hit by the avalanche. So it finally got to the climax of the story and it gave me a reason to keep going. The union of Tom and Eleanor is sweet, though the love story itself is so contrived and unreal. 2 stars for adding some twists at the last couple chapters of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas feel good story","review":"To start off, I am a Balducci fan and this one was a surprise a real 180 from what I am used to. What a great story and character study. I really thought it was a great book and the ending was super. A couple of big surprises at the end. It leaves you smiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"Boring and predictable.... read it because of book club, and most of my friends agreed with me... only plus, my desire to travel in a train at one point in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Has a lot of humor, mystery, intrigue and suspense. A \\"feel good\\" book! Totally different from any of other Balldacci books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good Christmas story","review":"This was a pretty good Christmas story. Sometimes, it felt predictable, yet I wanted to keep reading. An interesting set of characters. I did like the ending and didn't see it coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love this but...","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I enjoy Baldacci's writing style, but it seemed like he tried a little too hard with this one. Think about every cliche and far fetched idea u can imagine, and try to sell it as a Christmas story. Look, i understand the concept of a Christmas book. Something sad happens, then something nice happens and you feel better. However, this book seemed like too much went wrong, and felt like it had no soul. It certainly didn't warm me up at all. The characters lacked any depth and i felt no empathy towards any of them. There are plenty of better Christmas books out there. The only saving grace was that its a very quick read. If you want a warm and cozy Christmas story, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice diversion, a \\"feel good\\" tale of second-chance love...","review":"This is no masterpiece you will need to own or to read a second time, but it is worth reading once if you are a romantic at heart, or are curious about what a cross-country train trip is like these days. Tom and Eleanor are the main characters, lovers who broke up several years before the book opens, and who are reunited (to the astonishment of each) on an Amtrak adventure. There are fascinating details about how the passenger train crews do their jobs, and how train travel, usually safe, can have its perils. Many of the secondary characters are delightful. The novel ends with a couple of surprises I did not see coming, which is always nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"While I love good books of mystery, history and thrillers, sometimes I want a break from the intensity each of the above can provide. This is why after reading a \\"sample\\" of \\"The Christmas Train\\" I knew this is just what I wanted to read. It's a light-hearted, fun and entertaining mystery with a nice bit of history regarding train travel. As a matter of fact, it has inspired me to take a trip from San Antonio to Chicago, then on to Philadelphia via the \\"rail\\". Thank you David Baldacci for \\"The Christmas Train\\". LSC"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun story","review":"I just finished listening to the book, and it is a fun read! It may be not be as deep or developed as his other books, but it has fun characters and a wonderful surprise ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and interesting storyline","review":"Romance with lots of twisting and turning mystery--all wrapped up in a long-distance train ride at Christmas time...one could almost feel the rhythm of the rails and taste the bourbon in the lounge car. I appreciated the scattering here and there of history lessons about the passenger railrays and loved how the author acquainted me with characters who exuded both originality and real human warmth; I hated to say goodbye to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Boat Rides The Rails","review":"There are two good things about this book: the dustjacket and the title; everthing else is as flat as roadkill and a lot more stinky. This book should be flushed down the toilet because it's a load of crap. It's as if someone took a Love Boat script and exchanged the boat for a train. Agnes Joe, a large and at first, bullying female, is actually an undercover railroad police officer, and the priest who steals and returns other people's property isn't a priest, just a poor man who lost his wife and two sons. After reading this book, I know how high school English teachers feel after spending the weekend grading term papers. I returned the book to my bookseller. If you loved the Love Boat, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"I cannot believe this book got published. It reads like it was written in about 15 minutes - at the most. We passed it around during the holidays and it got to be a big joke - we all agreed - it was one of the worst books we'd ever read.The charactors are predictable, the outcome is obvious, the ending makes no sense.Where do I get my money back !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"David Baldacci has some good books (ex. the simple truth) but one has plot holes and poor writing.PASS ON THIS ONE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, Simple, and Shallow","review":"I did not find this book interesting, except in a few places. I gave the book a rating of 4 only because it did have a few areas that held my attention for more than 5 minutes. I agree with other reviews that our famous authors are not writing with the thought and dept they once wrote. The books seems to be written in a hurry maybe to meet a deadline and not to entertain a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Christmas Disappointment","review":"Boring, dull, predictable, uninteresting, unrealistic....the list goes on. Obviously, this was conceived and written under the heading of light reading and is not meant to be a timeless literary classic, but still, the author could have put a little more thought and effort into it. A five-foot boa constrictor on an Amtrak passenger train? Really? And the protagonist, a Pulitzer prize winning journalist, thinks it a good idea to release it into a fellow passenger's sleeping compartment? You get my drift; don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Audio and Hardback","review":"This is one of my favorite Christmas stories.. THE ONLY THING - I wish they had more actors reading. Having a guy do the women's voices cracks me up.. Lol and makes it hard to get into the story. But Toms voice wins it..If they made this into a movie. I'd be at a midnight showing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting!","review":"This book explores a chracer who has pretty much lost his way in life and is given one small chance to get back on track. The cast of characters in this book a re certainly varied, and very interesting. A smooth easy read for those who like to learn about people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Christmas Train has a surprise Ending","review":"I really enjoyed the entire book. Baldacci does it yet again with the suspense however this time it is a cliff hanger love story. The book made me feel as though I were a passenger on the Southwest Chief. I could vividly picture the characters in their various roles. Without spoiling the surprise, the ending was a huge surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good author","review":"I like every thing written by Mr. Balducci and this was no exception. He has a good plot, excellent writing style, very sharp wit causing me to laugh alot throughout the book.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Christmas Train","review":"It is a very uplifting romantic story with a twist ending.The story brings two ex lovers together on a train at Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"Funny, sweet, romantic. The Christmas Train made me laugh--a sure fire winning characteristic for any book. A great read no matter the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Christmas","review":"I wasn't expecting to be so thoroughly wrapped up in this book, but the character depth is so great that you feel like you know these people. When you think you know what's coming - you don't! This was an absolute treasure and really made my Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly badly written -- not nearly as good as his others","review":"Admittedly, I had high expectations, having read almost everything Baldacci has published, and after browsing reader reviews here. But this one just doesn't cut it for me.The plot is straight from the Canterbury Tales, without the depth of interest. The style is circa Mark Twain, but (in this book at least) D.B. lacks Twain's wit or his wisdom. The novel is so badly written I didn't care about the plot or the characters, just wanted it to be over. So it was, about 2/3 of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant departure","review":"See book description above.Another reviewer thought this was like a late night movie. I myself will compare it to a made for TV movie, although it would do best on the Lifetime channel.It was a pleasant departure from his normal thrillers, and because it was somewhat short, I decided to give it a try. I liked it. Baldacci can draw you into a story to where you actually care about the characters. Almost all the characters in this pleasant novel had something you liked about them.I don't read stories like this very often and prefer to stick with thrillers, but it's nice to take a break every once in a while and read something 'feel good'. And it kind of makes a person want to hop on a train.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This book was the most boring and mundane book I have read in a long time. I didn't read it through; I couldn't. To me, it is for someone with a limited vocabulary. I'll never pick up a book by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay Attention to the Bad Reviews. They are Right On!","review":"I picked up this book immediately after reading Grisham's \\"Skipping Christmas.\\" When I first started reading this book, I thought it was going to be a lot better than \\"Skipping Christmas.\\" I was soon disappointed. It ended up being as insulting to the intelligence as \\"Skipping Christmas.\\" I would have to think really hard to figure out which book was worse. I'm trying to figure out if it was part of Grisham's and Baldacci's book deals to write really lame Christmas stories and that they waited until the last minute and threw this crap together in order to meet a deadline. I really can't understand the good reviews that this book got. This book is not worth your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot holes you could drive a Christmas Train through","review":"I won't detail the plot holes in this laughable story, because I don't want to spoil the fun for those who apparently enjoy this sort of drivel, from the 4-5 star reviews here. I will say that the first part of the book is an ode to Amtrak (of all things!) and a piling on of one pencil-sketched character after another. The story seems to be going nowhere, and it isn't. The last part of the story is where the humor really begins, as we are treated to most ridiculous plot turns I've ever read. Practically nothing adds up. But of course, every ludicrous situation is tied up with an implausible little bow at the end. There is no way anyone could get this book published if he weren't already a best-selling author. The editor should be slapped for letting this go to press in the shape it's in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor showing for Balducci","review":"Many of the reviews were better written than this book. It is insulting to pick up a book clearly marketed to adult readers and find it to be so woefully adolescent in every possible aspect, and that is being kind. How does such pap get past the editor's desk?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Romantic","review":"This Christmas Train is an enjoyable romantic read throughout the winter season. I've traveled by Amtrak a couple of times and love it. You could almost picture the train and the interesting characters in this Christmas classic. The characters are real and well developed and the storyline is fun and exciting. The twists will keep you guessing until the last sentence. I picked it up as a cheap paperback at a gift shop and know I will treasure this book forever. Overall it is a quick read. My only problem with this book is the characters dialogue. I know the author is a professional but the conversations between characters were occasionally somewhat choppy and forced. This slight miscue is not enough to knock it down from 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the holidays","review":"really enjoyed this book--surprised others thought it was disappointing; it is not a heavy read, rather a light and fun one--i kinda think that was the point; anyway, if you like trains and the childhood mystique and attraction that comes with them, read this book; perfect for cold night next to the fireplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"An On-Time In-Time Special","review":"Baldacci's latest was thoroughly enjoyable. How nice to read a good, cozy-type novel without all the trashy language that pervades nearly all best sellers these days. That's right! And nobody jumping in and out of bed with everyone either. Yes, it's still possible to find a good read that doesn't insult one's intelligence, morals and character. Thanks to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"HISTORY OF THE 80'S","review":"I had just finished watching the Sensational 70\\"s which was less than sensational and did not want to proceed to the next decade and risk disappointment.This was not a reasonable decision but an emotional one.

It is hard to find anything they do because it is so rare, especially their videos. The DVD has old videos, live footage, rare moments, making of their CD with David Zaffiro as well as the Up From The Ashes concert. If you are a fan get this ASAP, also if you like Stryper, Barren Cross, Bloodgood, The Brave or any other Christian metal/AOR bands you need this as well. It is worth every cent to own the footage this DVD provides.

With the Xbox you have to go through setup on your Xbox and on your router. With Linksys, only setup the router. I bought the Linksys WGA and it's awesome.Also if you ever stop your xbox live account you can only use this with xbox. What if you bought a Sony Playstation or PS2, you won't be able to use this one on it. With the Linksys, you can use any game console. Just my opinion :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality, performance and ease of installation.","review":"This adapter was way to easy to setup. Opening the box was the worst part.

Unfortunately this model MP-740 does NOT support WPA encryption standard. While it does support WEP encryption, WEP is extremely insecure & crackable thereby putting the entire network at risk. While WPA is susceptable to dictionary attacks when the encryption key is weak (less than 20 characters), keys between 20-63 in length are (for now) considered the most secure way to go without installing a VPN server. For anyone truly concerned about the security of their network, this product is unacceptable.

The train of thought seemed \\"zig-zag\\", for lack of a better phrase. It skipped around from one thought or point to another, then would flash sideways, then try to return to what the original story was.

We took it off, emptied the water, started it up again and, as soon as water got in it again, it died out.

Really, most of the whole Ander/Haken storyline seemed monotonous and unnecessarily. Unless this somehow seriously contributes significantly to the next book I really will be disappointed. For the first time I found myself skimming and skipping to keep from falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing but May not be worth your time.","review":"A well written book that does not add depth to the main characters. You can skip this book if you want to find out what Richard, Kahlan, Zed, Cara and the rest have been up to. If you just want to read Terry Goodkind, then you will enjoy it, but you will feel empty once you have finished. I may or may not buy the next book, I feel that I just paid for a sidebar in a great series. I and all the rest who enjoyed the first four parts were not given a continuaton of a great saga, just a book to fulfill a contractual obligation. After finishing, I re-read the first four to make sure I had not deluded myself into thinking that Terry Goodkind was a great writer. I only hope that, along with Robert Jordan, he doesn't extend this stroyline beyond its natural conclusion just to keep the series going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the worst fantasy I've ever read...","review":"Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series started with more fire and imagination than it's continued with. Story lines are often rehashed varieties of the same ever increasingly dangerous plot, and Soul of Fire is no different. One eventually wonders how the author never thought to himself \\"wow, this is incredibly boring and repetitious, I should scrap it all and start over.\\" The plot is so paper thin that the reader can easily guess how the story will end. I would recommend the book only if you're a desperate fantasy reader and have extensively read (and re-read) your current collection and need something else to read, regardless of how stultifying you might find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"P U! What a stinker!","review":"I have read all of Goodkinds books and this had to be the worst of the lot. All I could think of was: Who were these people and what do they have to do with the story line I liked so much? I felt this was a terrible waste of paper. If there is to be a continuation of the series, I will be hesitant to read it unless I hear differently from others as to the story continuity. I expected to read more about the main characters, but what you get instead is a meaningless wandering into another story with bits and pieces of the original. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If your following the series. I guess you'll have to read it","review":"I found that the build up of the characters in Anderith were sort-of pointless because they just died or just gave up hope. Though it was interesting to find about they're lives, it just lacked humour, action and deeper/sinister thought. That relates to the chimes aswell. The build up of the chimes being a horror etc, was dissapointing. The idea of Kahlan being pregnant will the chimes being existent could've been elaborated, but..... Overall, the book was interesting to read. But not as good as 'Wizard's first rule' or 'Stone of tears'"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let-Down","review":"Unfortunately, this book does not compare to the rest of this great series. After being blown away by the intensity of books 2-4, this seemed a bit pointless. The plot seemed to be thrown together from one line at the end of book four. I love the characters in this series...maybe in book six we'll get to see them again! Richard without his sword for the entire novel? PLEASE, I wish I had waited for the paperback. That being said, it's still a fine series and I will get book six."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hero","review":"For personal interest, I seek more fun with main caracter 'Richard' but this book has some points that show the sideviews. Richard became the emperor of the Midland and everyone thinks he is a hero of the world. However, in this book we see how the world treats him and who is a true friend to him. So I guess Mr. Terry Goodkind wrote this unexpected scenes for his own purpose. Even though I miss Richard, Kalhan, Zedd, and etc for their heroic actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"It must just be herd mentality","review":"The most frightening thing about Terry Goodkind books is not Jagang, or the Keeper, or anything that crawls beyond the boundary. It is the herd of arrested adolescents who will scream \\"You rule, man!\\" to anything Goodkind runs up the flagpole. Goodkind could blow his nose on a blank manuscript page, turn it in and have it typeset, and these rabid fans would swear it was gold, award him five stars, and scream for more. [In fact, I'm convinced this is exactly what happened with Soul of the Fire.] This book was pathetic, and a waste of money and time. Goodkind's once promising career has spiraled into an endless stream of words stretching what was once an idea into an ever-thinner thread that frayed and broke a long time ago. It's too bad his fans have the kind of money to toss away, making him richer, while the reading grows poorer by the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much talk and not enough action","review":"I have really enjoyed Goodkind's books until now. The first 4 were exciting, had good character development, and plot. In the Soul of the Fire I felt like I was reading a completely different author. The plot seemed shallow and the characters were not the same people we have gotten to know and love or hate. Kahlen was constantly doubting Richard's feelings and ideas, and then they would talk about it for about half a chapter, then they would finally go and do something. By that time -after the talking about it and reasoning what they would do was not very exciting. We did not see the strength that we saw in Kahlen the first 4 books, nor did we see the same sweet and brave Richard. Cara, the mordsith, was the best character in this book. She was developed very well. I certainly don't think I could produce a book as well as Terry Goodkind, but compared to his last few books it was kind of a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Alright, i retract my original opinion of the sword of truth, i reviewed the book \\"Wizards first Rule\\" as a wonderful book and an required read, well that was five books ago, and the plot,or anything at all, has changed from the original book, the sword of truth series \\"came in like a lion and out like a lamb\\" this lat book was so weak and tired, i havent finished it, i have simply put it onj my bookshelf, and hope that maybe a couple of months later i might have enough motivation to finish the damn thing, i got too bored of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeper","review":"Transitional or not, this book was slow and boring. The first four were excellent! Must have been a push to meet a contractual novel clause cause it just doesn't stand up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was VERY disappointing","review":"What a shame! The first 4 books in this series were excellent, Soul of the Fire was not. Who cares about Anderith? This book did not get going until chapter 52 and I certainly hope book 6 is much much better than this. This series is by far the best in publication, I would hate to see this book bring down the rest of the series. Book 6 needs to be dramatically better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"A great disappointment compared to the last four books. Seem to me T.G. has spent more time on the marketing plan for his books than on putting thought into writing them. It's a great story and deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap.","review":"This fifth book in Goodkind's series is crap. Nothing more. Hmm... let's see... could it be a rehashed story written only to make some money and tide over fans until he feels like writing a real book? I would have to say yes. The same storytelling ability Goodkind has demonstrated in the past is still there, but that's about it. The main characters that were developed through 4 books are practically missing from this fifth. TG: I got your point, but you didn't need 500+ pages to make it. Perhaps make your point, then tell some more of the story? Oh, wait, but then you couldn't make as much money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"yeah, it is obviously goodkind borrowed some ideas from jordan, but i haven no problem with that because goodkind makes them work better. 'sword of truth' series may not have such and endless stream of characters like 'wheel of time', but that's a good thing. goodkind makes you care for the characters in his books. you form a real emotional attachment towards them. jordan, on the other hand, has never been able to achieve that kind of emotional bond between the reader and the characters, partly because they're just too many. so, after read 'soul of the fire' i now certainly rank the 'sword of truth' series above 'wheel of time'."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS; ITS FROM A BITTER PATRON","review":"do not get me wrong, i thought goodkinds books were good.... but he totally ripped off robert jordan. seeing as how robert jordan was published first, terry goodkind took the same idea and watered it down. take the names for example...richard, and rand? hello. these books scream rip off. no one can beat robert jordan. his books are by far superior. TERRY GOODKIND IS A RIP OFF!!!! HE STOLE HIS MATERIAL!! if you want to e0mail me and discuss this further, please do- i would like to see a good defense set up for terry the cheat goodkind. fletcherama@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"HEY YOU!!! READ THIS!!!","review":"Okay, first of all I recently read Goodkinds books this last fall they are phenomonal, and I didn't read anything else for a while, other books in my opinion not being as good as Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, until I began reading Jordan's Wheel of Time. The Wheel of Time is as good as the Sword of Truth, I found some comparisons I'll admit, but they are much more different than each other even with those similarities.Goodkinds books are great, I regret I haven't read this book yet. But Goodkind I know will not let me down, the other four were great, and this one I know will either be better or as good.And that's the bottom line, because I said so!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much wading through character development.","review":"Very disappointing effort from Mr. Goodkind. Based on the first four volumes, I expected the same intricate story lines and plot development, and received about 300 pages of the political intrigue in Anderith. Who cares? This sequel was only loosely tied into the plot of the series by the ever-present references to the Dominie Dirtch and how the Imperial Order would win if they gained control. All the other nonsense with Fitch and the Hakens seemed very irrelevant. Definitely not Mr. Goodkind's best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this great writer.....","review":"I mean, why on earth did he write this fifth novel? I gave it two stars becouse it lacked everything that made The Sword of Truth a great story. Why would he write about people who have no impact on the story at all? And what is it with the sex thing? When I first read the readers reviews I thought that it was just an American thing to be so shocked by the sex in the novels of Terry Goodkind but they are right. There is absolutely no reason to write the things he wrote in the fifth novel. I will wait until the sixth novel and I will definetely read it because I totally loved the first couple of books (book 1 was far out the greatest) but when this sixth novel is just as bad as the last one, I will quit reading this series before it will change my view on the Sword of Truth story. Please take some more time to develope the end and please don't give me any chicken-who-is-not-a-chicken stories anymore Mr. Goodkind....Camiel Lentjes the Netherlands"},{"rating":"1","title":"More crap from the Wizard of Unoriginality","review":"Gods, you people who love Goodkind have got to find better writers. People like him, Brooks, Feist and McKiernan have ruined modern fantasy.Thank the gods for Robin Hobb, George RR Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay and Glen Cook.And forget Jordan, the overrated windbag that he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointing read","review":"This series started out so good it's a shame to see it sink to the level it has with this book. I think Terry Goodkind has finally lost the plot and is doing a Robert Jordan on us. Wandering all over the countryside, and putting elaboration in for the sake of it.This book could do with some serious editing. I would have liked to see a tighter story, that progressed the plot more than one millimeter.This is the last book I will be reading in this series, it seems never ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I am a major fan and this one was just horrible in my opinion. but it is necessary to understand the next ones. It is my least liked book in the series. somehow it was just boring, i would normally sit up all night to finish one of his books. not this one, it took me four days to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"The First 3 books of this series were very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st especially. With the fourth, however, there was pretty strong indication that the following works could be sliding. Unfortunately that was the case with Soul of the Fire. I was truly hoping never to hear about the \\"Mud People\\" again. But we get 100+ pages about the \\"Chicken that's not a chicken\\". Kahlan is becoming very high maintenance - what happened to the testical eating babe we came to love in Book One?! And what happened to the Gar and the Dragon; I have an idea, bring them back to wipe out the Mud people!...Well anyway, I'm going to bite on Book 6...I just hope the Mud People are completely and utterly destroyed for all time by the Order."},{"rating":"2","title":"great storty","review":"These books tell a great story the only issue i have run into is the massive amount of back story i dont really need a paragraph refresher for every reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only put up with this to get to the next book","review":"I can't belive it; usually Terry Goodkind is on the mark with his punctuation, but not this time. I haven't seen punctuation that bad since I was in high school. It was even hard to follow this book sometimes, but I did my bestThe story itself is interesting.Whatever editing company he uses REALLY dropped the ball this time. I can't totally blame them though, he bears part of the blame for letting it get printed after he read that CRAP.I am about to read something else, then come back and read his book Faith of the fallen (because I already own it) I hope the punctuation is better.I am very dissapoined with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul of Fire gets doused.","review":"The concept for this book is one of those that probably looked great when he was outlining it. But hundreds of pages about some fledging kingdom did not interest me considering the previous four SOT novels. But I soldiered through hoping for some payoff in the end. What I got was robbed,ripped off and cheated.If you are hoping this kingdom plays a future role in the fate of the D'Haran Empire? Don't :(If you are hoping Richard finds some clever way to defeat or dispel the Chimes. Don't :(If you are hoping Richard has some awesome battle with a powerful wizard. Don't :(The ending was such a paste-on that I'm left wondering who really wrote it.At the end of the day, you can skip this book and miss very little in plot advancement. That's the real tragedy of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very VERY disapointing","review":"I really like the previous four books, so when this one came out I was really excited. Then I started it. This was the first of the books that I had to struggle to finish. It was completly boring. Iread this a while ago so I don't remember all the details, but I remember as I was reading it being completely fed up with hearing about the Chimes. I DIDN'T CARE what they were doing because he didn't make it interesting. I would recomened the other four books to anyone who likes fantasy but unless you really want to I'd SKIP this book. I just got the sixth one and hopefully that will be better...if it has a lot to do with this one I take back the thing about not reading it but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this series?","review":"First of all, I am a fan of the author and was (until now) enjoying this series. This book really let me down. It was lacking in all the elements that made the previous books good. It wasn't enough to turn me off of the series completely, but it was close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could the series get any more amazing?","review":"When I read Terry Goodkind's last book Temple of Winds. I thought that was the last book of the series and was greatly disappointed. When I found the fifth book I was estatic. Usually after writing about the same thing in so many books causes the books to deteriorate but that is not the case with this book. It is an incredible book and I read it in 3 days. The ending is shocking and i hope he comes out with his next book soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book of the series!","review":"Goodkind was on a good start with the first four books but The Soul of Fire is by far the worst book of the series.It's always good to see that Terry Goodkind is sticking to the habit of describing the raping and torturing of women, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUITE A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Although I really liked the other books in this series I was really disappointed in this one. It is not often that I consider not finishing a book, but it certainly happened here.Also, what is the huge obsession with sex in this book? Do we really need to know these kinds of things to read this? I usually read a different type of book if I want to know about peoples sex lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book starts good then it fizzles out.","review":"Oh boy was I dissappointed. Are we sure that the same author actually wrote this book? The first few chapters are written in the manner that we are used to seeing, and then all of a sudden your asleep. Word of Advice, don't purchase the book, check it out of your local library and save yourself $25.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not on par with the other four books.","review":"I am dissappointed. The author spent to much time and effort developing characters I did not care about. The series has been about a number of main characters. Those characters,while present in the story, really do not progress or develop to any significant degree. The underlying story does not move at all. The Midlands are still at war with the Imperial Order and nothing really happened. Jagang makes a brief, meaningless appearance.I did like the fact the magic dissappeared. It was creative. Magic still had to be addressed but in a different light.In short this appears to be a book written soley to meet a deadline and pick-up a check. Before I buy the next book, I will wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Most","review":"This is not as good as his previous books, but is better than the majority of fantasy out there. I admit the chicken was a little much (chickens usually aren't deadly monsters), but hey, it was innovative to say the least. From the beginning of the book my heart was racing. I'm only to page 160 or so, but I can tell already that this is a great book. Reading of Anderith is fun, however, hopefully Richard and Kahlan will be in the later chapters. Despite the weak points of this book, Terry Goodkind has done it again. Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Goodkind has never disapointed me.","review":"In the previous four books, Terry Goodkind has ranked among my top favourite book authors. I expect that this book will be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jordan is bad","review":"Hei... I am not beiung prejudice or bias toward Robert Jordan. I used to like him alot but his recent books are just too... long winded and has no solid story anymore. Each book he wrote for the last 3 books were just to kill one of the bad guys. Unlike jordan, terry goodkind really gives you solid thrilling stories about the main character and very very good at making surprise endings... I haven't read his latest book but i hope he doesn't follow the foot step of jordan. Imagine jordan writing 2 pages just to describe a room or a person and 4 pages to describe a stone or something.... ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO WORDS: WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"In ToW, and indeed, all of the SoT books, the reading has been intense, but also had a restraining sense of steady progression that made the book \\"feel\\" real. Now, in Soul of the Fire, Goodkind rushes through the events with the haste of a high-schooler writing his first piece. Then, what irks me most of all is that he has given his characters (and readers) what they want most: happiness. An in the space 500 short pages, he snatches it away. I, for one, am totally and utterly disappointed, and hope that Mr. Goodkind will make an effort to amend his mistakes in future installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the series, skip this book","review":"While I have enjoyed the overall storyline, this is the black sheep of the series. The novel the other ones don't want to talk about.This installment is a pain to read. It leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth and thinking 'What was the whole point of the last 600 pages?' The only good thing is that all the people you grow to loathe (and in an 'oh please don't make me read more about him' way not an 'oooo, he's so evil and bad' way) end up dead in the end never to return. The only bright spot I can remember was how one of the nobles got revenge on his religious based king and his cheating wife.I recommend the series. It is entertaining and enjoyable, but I also recommend to go from book 4 to book 6. You can totally skip this book and not miss anything in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't that good","review":"Here's the bottom line. Goodkind didn't have the same influence on this book as he did on Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears. Goodkind might be losing his touch as some authors will, occasionally. I just hope his next book will be better than Soul of the Fire. His first two were awesome. He just needs to stop putting in his own political ideas and just move the story along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drone Drone","review":"This book almost make you want to reach in to the story and slap some people silly.

You mean to tell me that through all of his struggles that one land makes him want to give up. And for grimy sakes why is it that this story has to beat down the main characters all the time. It seems that Terry Goodkind likes to just let the main characters just scrape by.I have the complete series and am not going to read Faith of the Fallen for several months.

Too little events of real importance and too much attention is given to rather dull characters like Fitch. It took me more than the first half of the book to get suckered in by the story. The book itself may be worth 3 or maybe even 4 stars, but in comparison to its precedants it's just plain boring.HOWEVER, I would urge everyone to read this book, because it provides the setup for the sixth book of the series, 'Faith of the Fallen', which is, in my opinion, the very best book of the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Where were was all my favorite characters? The series seems to be declining as I read each new book in the series.
