Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"There is so much wrong with this game, it's difficult to know where to start. First, the voices are out of sync with the the speakers' mouthing of the words. Second, the game is supposed to take place in Germany and Russia, but everyone has as Brooklyn accent. Third, the puzzles are lame unless you are about 10 years old. The story line is unrealistic and movments of the characters is shoddy...for example, the girl picks up a sheet of metal, but never goes near it, and of course, no matter the size, it disappears into inventory rather than her being encumbered by it. I was very disappointed, usually The Adventure Company puts out quality stuff. Not this one. Don't bother, go get a pizza or something instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, casual fun","review":"I enjoy adventure point-and-click games with a little thought behind them (e.g., Grim Fandango). Tunguska fit the bill perfectly. My fiance and I played it together, and the \\"puzzles\\" I thought were obscure made perfect sense to him, and vice versa. So I suppose none are truly obscure, it just depends a little on the way you think. I use quotes for \\"puzzles\\" because you rarely run into situations where you have to solve an unrelated put-the-chess-pieces-in-the-right-spot kind of puzzle in order to continue. Instead, it's a fairly logical game where the difficulties you solve are all related to the plot. The plot, by the way, has some holes (all computer-game plots do) but was overall entertaining and had some beautiful cutscenes. A lot was put into the scenery and graphics. I'm looking forward to the 2008 release of a related game, and will definitely buy it. Highly rated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN GAME! LOVED IT!","review":"I loved this game! It reminded me a lot of the first Longest Journey game where the main character is a young girl on a mission. The puzzles were fairly simple, which is a plus for me and other gamers, I'm sure, who don't have to be rocket scientists to figure out the puzzles. Great graphics, and storyline, although voice acting could be better. I'm looking forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product please help if u know a solution","review":"I bought a copy of this game a few years ago and just now decided to play it.

The authors are quick to find fault with seemingly all aspects of modern Russia, failing in the meantime to acknowledge and explain the enormity of the challenges facing that nation and giving credit for progress and achieved successes. A truly objective look at both the failures and the successes of Putin and post-Soviet Russia would have been more informative and persuasive. The authors seem to have an agenda, which is not well disguised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single of the Year!","review":"This is a studio recorded version of a song that stopped a nation...well, the 3 or so million Australians who are hopelessly addicted to the Idol phenomenon anyway.

Buy it now, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good....but needs an editor","review":"This is a very useful collection / reconfiguration of Norman Long's writings on development, updating his earlier thought in relation to more recent literature and social theory, and offering both a useful antidote to overly Foucauldian writings on the topic, and insights on the relation between structure and agency, and processes of state formation, that go well beyond the study of development. But it really needs an editor -- the chapters have been constructed from prior texts in ways that seem haphazard -- for example, p. 64 repeats an entire paragraph more or less verbatim from p. 62, likewise p.45 and p. 41."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful on the practice range.","review":"I got these to make shooting at my practice range easier. They needed a little breaking it but, after reloading each about 3-5 times, they all work smoothly and as expected now. I've used numerous types and brands of ammo including reloads and they all work perfectly now. I'm using these with a '74 S+W .38Spl K-frame square butt revolver. I had to change grips because the ones that came on the gun were in the way of the loader. The new grip also has an integrated laser for quick targeting and, if needed, hopefully making your target think twice about attacking you. I re-stock ATMs part time and this is the setup I carry when I'm moving money around. I always carry it loaded and with at least 2-3 speed loaders loaded and ready - just in case.

This is the kind of teaching strategy that is mostly memorizing and rote learning. You can \\"learn\\" what the book says, but you won't have a clue what it means. If you are only interested in spouting off physics facts to sound impressive, this book will do just fine. If you want to even begin to understand physics, you'll need to find a book that goes into the how and why of every phenomenon, rather than just stating that the phenomena exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"The back of this book says simple enough for beginners, but IT IS NOT! I think if you have been over physics before this book \\"could\\" be helpful, but not for someone seeing this stuff for the first time.

It's pretty sad if an EDUCATIONAL BOOK cannot even pass its own tests. Also the frequency of improper definitions and misleading information is appalling, last time I checked displacement is NOT also known as distance and distance is identified in equations simply as 'd'. I question the author Stanley Gibilisco and the McGraw Hill Publishing Co.'s intelligence and knowledge on a subject that demands absolute, pin-point accuracy in fields where it is used on a daily basis. A message to anyone who is desperately looking for a Physics book, locate your nearest bookstore and its science section and scrutinize (and be as critical as possible) before making a purchase, after all it is your money and I would hate to see another penny of it go to a science book that can be categorized under Fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book does not cover much of what is covered in actual physics classes.

He is completely unqualified on the subject, and gets it wrong from the very first concept: simultaneity. He states that two clocks can only be synchronized if they are right next to each other, and that the finite speed of light prevents synchronization at a distance. This is patently false.

It would be better that there were other dvds from Elvis like Elvis On Tour or films like Blue Hawaii, Flaming Star, Fun in Acapulco or Girls, Girls, Girls. Don't waste your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it.","review":"There's a lot of rare footage in this film, the only problem is that it has an overdub of someone saying Elvis quotes all through the documentary and the guys trying to sound like Elvis and he fails. If we got more rare footage and removed the annoying impersonator overdub, this would be a nice movie for your collection. It does however mark the first time that anything from Elvis in Concert appeared on DVD (even though there's no audio). Nice addition to an Elvis collection but not something you'll watch often."},{"rating":"2","title":"a game of car through history","review":"this does not just have cars of modern day but early cars to. every time i played this i played as ford. you get to unlock the cars with certain races. get this to try out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iraq's Nuclear Mirage: Memoirs and Delusions","review":"This book should have become more widely known. Many of our questions on WMD in Iraq would have been answered.Imad Khadduri's book is a well written and detailed account of the beginings of Iraq's WMD program, and right through until the author finally got out of Iraq. However, he was an integral part of the weapons program for many years, unlike others, who have since been discredited. I first read this man's work on the internet version of Yellow Times and emailed him for more information as everything he said sounded so genuine. He replied courteously to me. His was a lone voice trying very hard to get the truth about the non-existance of WMD in Iraq in order to stop the plans for war, which was built around the lie that the WMD had not been found, even with the extensive searching of UNSCOM etc.I would recommend this book as another source of information if we are ever to understand the true story of Iraq and the Western Powers' interest in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small and falls apart","review":"Baby Stella barely fits in the cradle, I definitely thought it was larger.It lasted only 3 weeks and then fell apart in its non-screwed parts, they can be fixed but still the product is not made properly.This cradle looks nice but I would suggest to look for something bigger and sturdier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst toy purchase ever","review":"Received the Stella Cradle as a gift. It's very pretty but is made horribly! In fact It's with out a doubt the cheapest made toy in our house. Both ends had to be re-glued together a few times and finally I screwed the ends in which did split the cheap wood a bit. Then,the bottom part that rocks the cradle fell off as it was glued to the end.

This game can get difficult at some points like driving a weird car or flying an airplane as Spongebob, but I got through it pretty quick. I was only stuck about twice.

If you are looking for an in-depth account of how various couples have dealt with these intermingled issues, this is the book for you. Glaser, a dedicated journalist, tells her own story, and unbiasedly offers the reader several glimpses at how others have struggled with clashing beliefs.

I'm Catholic and my wife is Jewish so I thought it would be interesting to read. A few pages into the book, the author describes the Bris cermony performed on her newborn son. The author related that since her son had already had a medical circumcision at the hospital, the ceremony consisted of sticking the boy's private part with a pin until blood was drawn and he cried. I thought about that for a few seconds ... the woman let someone stick her newborn son's private part until he was in enough pain to cry and bleed ... for no medical reason. I then concluded that this woman must be clueless and can't have anything useful to say. I threw the book away.

It is flawed by a very odd writing style---deadpan and stilted. The format is so odd as to make it almost unreadable at times---two blocks of print on each page, at very different levels, as if one is meant to be a caption, yet it isn't! The author doesn't seem to know whether she wants to be a book for the curious, or a book condemning you for being curious. A fascinating subject, which is why this book can be interesting at all, but really not handled well here---don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mediocre overview of a fascinating subject","review":"The illustrations are spectacular in Special Cases, and many of the anecdotes are vividly written. But the author also omits much of the subject matter's historical and scientific context, leaving the \\"special cases\\" looking more like simple freaks. As well, this book is poorly organized and poorly edited, so that by the end I was completely frustrated with Ms. Purcell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Visually, the book is rewarding. The author has photographed her specimens imaginatively, compelling the reader to look twice to identify the subject matter. The text, however, is a great disappointment. Not only is the format confusing (as some reviewers have already pointed out), but with a writing style so disjointed and without an appreciable sense of structure, the book leaves us readers floundering in a fishpond, desperately seeking the shore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one.","review":"This book was very hard to read, the format was confusing.

I am boggled at the typography decisions, I suppose someone has been reading too much WIRED and thought it looked avant garde.

The mother was too busy to discuss Clara's intrigue about how bread rose, and then the father also dismissed her desire to learn and to read. He said that farm people dont have time to read. He also stated that dreaming was a bad thing for farmers. Clara also stated how she got tired of farm work. When Clara comes into contact with a librarian of a book wagon, the lady tells Clara to hop in the cart and they would essentially go tell her father he was wrong and Clara should borrow a book, and learn to read.This is exactly opposite of the life we are trying to create on our farm and can lead to bitter feelings toward work and parents. Reading is a priority here and probably among most farmers, but I feel that the way this situation was handled in this young girls life was wrong. Although my 6 year old read this and we discussed the attitudes exampled here, I will not be saving it for the little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Series","review":"Dr. Chinen has written several books that address tales relating to different stages of life.

In my opinion, the real value of this book can best be appreciated when used in conjunction with actual hands-on training with a competent boxing and/or martial arts instructor. One thing the author and I can agree on is the fact, that in most cases, boxing has the most effective punching techniques of any other martial art.

Will somebody please smell the coffee and get this show back on the air, the merchandising end of it is working better than most shows that have been running for ten years!I'll buy this boxed set so I can have all of them, but this will be a hard one to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I had never seen any of the Gamera episodes before.This was a revelation, and while I'm still a Mike fan, between this and volume 20, I can now more easily see why so many are hardcore Joel fans.I usually give breakdowns of episodes for these box sets, but this time around, I don't think its needed. They all feature a giant turtle named Gamera who, along with other monsters, wreck up Japan. The set starts out great and gets funnier and funnier culminating in GAMERA VS. GUIRON which is now in my top 10 favorite episodes, and is just behind THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE as my favorite Joel ep. There is just so much going on in that one. The little kids, the brain eating aliens with southern accents, the absolutely horrific dubbing job (\\"Hello! Thank you!\\"), Officer Cornjob, Gamera swinging on the gymnasts beam, the little old-faced girl... I could just go on and on and on. So incredibly perfect.Absolutely one of the best box-sets you can get for MST3k, no question. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to finally have these episodes","review":"I was afraid that MST3Ks Gamera episodes would never see home video but Shout Factory has delivered a great set! The Deluxe Edition come in a metal tin and houses a regular thin pack DVD set and a few postcard sized posters for each episode.Because these episodes are really early in the shows run the jokes are a little slow and the sketches mostly consist of silly songs; however, the paseing does improve as you watch the movies. As a big fan of both MST3K and Gamera I highly recommend this and think it's a great gate way for people looking to get into both."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"This thing is a piece of junk!

It's even better when I read it the second time. It's a story about two women that have nothing in common fall in love with each other through their hilarious trip across country only for one petty revenge. It's sure put a smile on me everytime I take a trip across country. I highly recommend it if you need a good laugh and a happy ending story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTER OF PARADOX","review":"Dr. Niel Micklem's work on hysteria is an unsurpassed landmark in psychological studies. The book is the result of a lifetime's dedication to this complex and shady illness. His approach touches upon the medical as well as the mythical origins and historical development of an ever changing ethiology. There is simply nothing that can match his uncanny insights and depth of learning. Dr. Micklem was a sage of old times who could look into the seeds of psychosis. He was a master of paradox. Together with Adolf Guggenb��l-Craig and Rafael L��pez Pedraza, he belonged to a unique generation of jungian psychotherapists the like of which we may never see again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"I am not a chef, or even an accomplished cook. I am just a mom who likes to eat and create! What I love about this book is that it makes me want to cook more adventurously, and is as much a feast for four senses (I didn't lick any pages) as the recipes are a feast for five. Aren't inspiration and motivation more than half the battle? It is a truly beautiful and imaginative book--stunning enough for the coffee table, but I'm keeping it on the kitchen table so I look at it more often, and get inspired! So far, I have only tried the crepe recipe, but I almost cried with joy; after years of trying one recipe after another (Silver Palate,etc.) I was finally able to make crepes that were exquisitely thin but not overly fragile, truly just like the ones I have had in Paris!"},{"rating":"2","title":"were you surprised?","review":"that pancake repairman obviously doesn't know what he is talking about.

I took that tidbit of info and applied it to modern use in antiquing wood and paper (works great!)...... but now that I've told you about the hair, there's really no point in buying this book.

It is quick to set up and get started and the rules are written well. I've played with friends and hosted this game at conventions. It is always a hit, and any player can turn a losing game into a winner in a single turn (which is always exciting). The price point on this game is consistent with non-mainstream games, but fluctuates as it is in-and-out of print from time to time. The components are decent quality, but the actual modular game board hexes are relatively small and could be a bit bigger and better overall. This is one of my favorite games and with a modular game board, the replayabilty is nearly endless. Good game to teach strategy and tactics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great strategy game for the whole family","review":"Nexus ops is a game that has proven itself over and over again in our house and gaming group as beign a game that is easy for the whole group to get into and learn in a comfortable amnmount of time.

The Speed loader works fine with the Ruger GP 100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"Never had a speedloader before this one. It is easy to use and as compact as it can be. Simply put six rounds in and twist...they are held firmly in place and ready to go. The knob feels like it would \\"untwist\\" and release the rounds on its own, but that hasn't happened. When you're ready to load, just pop out the cylinder on your revolver, use the plunger to expel the spent casings, push the new rounds in with the speedloader, then twist the knob to release.One caveat...loading is definitely a two-handed operation. You have to hold the gun's cylinder in place, or when you rotate the knob, the cylinder will rotate with it, and nothing will happen. So, it is necessary to hold the cylinder or the black plastic part of the speed loader in place before you rotate the knob. Kinda fiddly, but with practice it isn't hard...certainly easier than loading six rounds by hand.So far, the unit seems solid and it works great. The price is right, too. I only wish I had gotten more than one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"These are great. They work fast and quickly.

Amazon is working with HKS to get this corrected, but would advise NOT to order until the special message at the bottom of the Amazon screen (when viewing the HKS 586-A item) clears. I was able to return the 2 speedloaders I purchased, but really bums me out that I now have to wait yet another few weeks to get the right speedloader. Buyer beware-- you may want to check this out first before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speed loaders","review":"These HKS speedloaders are good quality.

One side is microsuede and the other is fabric. It is soft. The color of the one I received is much darker than the picture.

What I would have found more useful is to know what I could expect in the days and weeks and months to follow.

This book was the first one I stumbled across and I consider myself fortunate, for it addressed so many things that came out of nowhere and was written in a way that could be understood and helpful to someone who is not is the most healthy state of mind.I will be keeping it around and rereading it for quite sometime. I won't even make predictions for how long, since I was so mistaken about so many things surrounding losing your mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"under average film on a bad quality dvd","review":"To be clear, I'm talking about the EU version of the dvd but I hear it's just the same as the US, being region free. The film is nice to watch once, a vhs tape will perfectly do. It doesn't add anything new to Marilyn's story, it doesn't present events in a revealing perspective. The footage is ordinary and often very short. It's nice to have/see it as a recap of this woman's life. The Kennedy story is mentioned in about 10 seconds plus the Happy B'day Mr President footage (which is about 20 secs.). The dvd transfer is poor, the colour episodes are phoney but the b/w will do. There's absolutely no extra and if someone still thinks \\"scene access\\" is extra, the music cd business should also call the cd-s \\"enhanced\\" because they have a 4 page booklet or you can choose the songs you want to listen to.

I could see Marley and Ukes, but Dead and Ukes was beyond my imagination. But of the many Dead tribute albums I have heard, this has to be the best yet.

It is electronic, yet it has warmth, unlike when you listen to Moby. I would recommend this to everyone. If you need to relax, to ground yourself, or if you have been out clubbing and need something to help you wind down, Reaching Calm is it.

My wife was making a fruit pizza one day and need to squeeze all of the cookie dough out of the package. I handed her the Townsend Fish Skinner, and with a couple of turns not a speck of dough was wasted.

He explains why simply \\"eating right\\" is not enough to reverse damage that already exists. He even offers some basic guidelines for which supplements can aid in alleviating various illnesses (wish he included migraines).

The two main characters - the shrink, Alan, and the detective, Sam, seem a little nave to me - particularly Alan who is too unsuspecting.Now what is motivating this woman, after many years, to approach a psychologist to arrest her husband? Cannot Alan and Sam try to read behind the \\"simple' story? Also this book is at least 150 pages too long and I became bored of reading about the medical problems of Alan's wife. This was mere fill-in. Unfortunately Boulder, Colorado does not make for an absorbing setting.Sam was a more interesting character and comical, Alan was mundane - you would think a psychologist would be able to read between the lines and do a better diagnosis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Book","review":"White has reached the point that many writers do who write about the same characters book after book. The Alan Gregory books have run their course. You can tell this because each book becomes more ridiculous. Obviously, the author is writing only to fulfill his contract. This book has a silly, predictible plot which is all over the map-- literally. Like most White books, this one starts off good, but just gets sillier as it goes along. The plot is totally unrealistic, as are the actions of the characters. Even Detective Sam Purdy comes out looking like an idiot in this book -- which takes some doing.

Shallow and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"another healthcare professional fiasco","review":"Despite its interesting premise, this work is a plodding yawner, definitely not a page-turning beach read. The plot had promise, but the execution is poorly wrought and overwritten.

It provides an insight into the institutional thinking of the Imperial Japanese Navy that is lacking from most books covering the Pacific War. The book is well written, providing an effective bend of facts into a narrative that smoothly flows from one issue to another as they were encountered by the Imperial Navy. The authors carry their discussion up to the entry of Japan into World War II and conclude with comments on how the strategy, tactics and technology of the Imperial Navy were implemented during the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"This book fills the huge void on the Japanese navy prior to WWII. Virtually all other available books start at Pearl Harbor with no analysis of how (or why) the Japanese navy had a modern, fully trained, and equipped navy capable of challenging the US. I bought the book on spec purely because of a lack of other publications on the subject but was very pleasantly surprised to find how well written it was. Apart from the content it was a pleasure to read it, an observation I can't make about many books on specialized military topics. A strong recommendation for readers who have had enough of the actual war stories (such as Paul Dull's excellent book) and want some background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall source I have found on the Imperial Navy","review":"I luckily received my copy of \\"Kaigun\\" only a few weeks before I finished research on a large paper on the IJN.

The author's writing style made it flow very smoothly and it wasn't a chore. Another aspect of the book that made it so good was how the author seamlessly transitioned between the three levels of war and described how each level impacted the other. The most significant portions of the book were on the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, and the author does an outstanding job in showing how these experiences significantly impacted the IJN up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which mirrored the attack on Port Arthur in so many ways. The development of improved torpedo design and improved naval design of battleships and aircraft carriers was shown to play a significant role in the development strategy, and the author demonstrated its impact on IJN operations in the late 30s and early 40s. Overall an excellent book which shows the enduring influence of Corbett and Mahan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HALF-BAKED REWRITE OF MARI SANDOZ'S BOOK","review":"The Author says he was inspired from Mari Sandoz's book on Crazy Horse which is all fine and good but this has to be considered fiction--yet it is constantly cataloged as non-fiction.

Just it alone is worth the price of the set of cassettes. You also get to hear LSMFT (yes, that's the title of the story), which has a nearly perfect ending.

There is absolutely no need, in the middle of the narrative on the battle of Austerlitz, to tell us the number of effectives in EVERY regiment in the French army, on the day of the crossing of the Rhine, at mid-point in the campaign, and on the day of battle itself. It shows that the author was a good little student, and did his homework, but it weighs down the story of the battle, and slows it to a crawl, and it's the battle itself that most of us want to read about.

She had instead made a softer easier-on-the-voice album instead. The songs in this really show off what Lauper can do. I was very impressed at some of the power she put into this. (and I'm glad she put it off until she was feeling better because you just can't pull these songs off without all that power)Very memorable, highly dancable, fun tunes to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"New XBOX 360 owners beware.","review":"If you have a newer Xbox 360 This Cooling fan Will Not work.

This may not bother you if you view this series to enjoy the eccentric characters. Others will have to use their \\"suspended disbelief\\" mode of viewing to not get disappointed. Fans of the original Agatha Christie novels will be disappointed. One example of the disbelief being needed is when the police, the medical examiner, and Poirot fail to examine a crime scene and corpse for basic physical evidence, such as bruising, powder burns, and bullet trajectories, and jump to the wrong conclusion.This set of programs comes from the time when British television viewers started complaining that the BBC programming was being dumbed down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"This book is a short picture book of Hatsheput's Egyptian reign.

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one, is because I feel that what she experienced is true and she is sharing truth.

Obviously, this woman (Jan Price, the author) does not believe in or has never read the \\"Holy Bible\\". The junk she writes about is more demonic than anything. Sounds like someone on drugs. She speaks of her 1 day old baby that died. However, in this so-called place that she claims she went to, in her NDE, she never once mentions seeing her baby, yet she says she saw firends and family, and even her little doggy. But why not her baby? She also mentions in this book 3 different times how pretty and beautiful she thinks she is. How conceited!

There are no absolute, clear-cut answers for Father Kremer (brilliantly acted by Ulrich Matthes). The film is an exceptional examination of the consciences and actions of two men in particular, Kremer and Gephardt (very well-played by August Diehl). A stark and sometimes brutal piece, I cannot imagine that a person could be unchanged after seeing it. Americans could learn much from this film -- it takes enormous courage to look at ourselves with such brutal honesty. The German filmmaker, Schl?ndorff, clearly knows what that means....and isn't afraid of it, perhaps because that's theonly way we learn anything genuine about ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absorbing Holocaust drama","review":"I have seen this movie twice and both times scenes in the movie haunted me for days.

Since it differs in every aspect from the book, I wonder why they just didn't make a movie about the priests in Dachau. Even the title is wrong, as the priest was given a 10 day leave to attend his mother's funeral. And what made it incredible is the fact that the priest did return to Dachau in 10 days. But that was just an isolated incident in the book. Ulrich Mathes was okay, but this portrayal pales in comparison to his excellent portrayal of Joseph Goebbels in \\"Downfall\\".

The big minus is that it doesent give you any pointers on how to take appealing looking photographs. Nearly all of the sample pictures in the book are little better than posed snapshots and don't make you want to grab your camera and rush out the door like Brian Peterson's books do.

Lots of equipment information - good for choosing the right flash. It's a shame that Susan, the author, uses in almost all photographs a Nikon N90 and a SB26 flash, which I think limits *a little* the book.

It also seems true that there aren't many books on the subject. Attention photography writers! Here's a big opportunity for an imaginative and authoritative writer on this subject. Where are you?

'Stuck inside a condo (with Mr. Marlon Brando)','Just say yes', 'Elevator (in the Brain Hotel)'are great songs. 'Oh Boy' is brilliant!

Since we bought the insert, he falls right to sleep once laid inside.Pros:1) Its plushy; so, he will certainly be warm on cooler days and during the winter.2) Its padded, which keeps him comfy and fuss-free the entire timeCons:2) The material is probably too warm for the hotter daysOverall, even on those hotter days, my infant much prefers laying on the comfy padding of the insert than on the stroller alone.

Mr Johnson was THE trombonist of the time and plays to such a consistently high standard that it would be impossible to pick out highlights in his playing. The first four tracks are from the album \`J.J. In Person' and they benefit from the presence of Nat Adderley (cornet) whose exciting solo on the opening number always turns heads. Next two selections are from \`Blue Trombone' and the track bearing that name is a 9-minute classic with terrific support from Tommy Flanagan (piano), Paul Chambers (double bass) and Max Roach (drums). The remaining tracks seem less remarkable but still worthwhile.

Unfortunately, that is not really an accurate description. The author, whether from humility or reticence, tells us little of his spiritual development and practice.Still, his life has been remarkable and he describes a spiritual world in China and Tibet that is gone forever and can only be vicariously experienced through books such as this.The author is a modest man, perhaps excessively so.

If you're discovering them for the first time, consider this a necessary listen. Little Feat found their own space with an approach that took the relaxed, earthy, and often humorous elements of southern rock and married them to R&B, progressive, even jazz like sophistication. The result in a live venue is a wildly exciting and just plain fun concert that captures Little Feat at their best. The live versions of their songs are supercharged and embellished with occasional detours that keep them fresh without ever detracting from their studio counterparts, perhaps even supplanting a few. The recording quality of the remastered/extended release is excellent.

Amazing.

The Out take is just an okay cut, but keep in mind that outtakes were not meant to be heard by fans at the time of a release of a record back in those days.. From what I remember from the original double album - all the tracks and track lengths are correct or longer. Cold, Cold, Cold was not on the original double LP.

Using the cmd-P gets the print menu but even selecting all forms gets only the federal ones.Overall, this is poorly designed software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"This program reported an error with my choice of charity, downloaded update (none available), repeated error - download.

When I was ready to do my state taxes, I discovered that the California forms were not going to be available until February 28th! None of the Federal Updates ( strongly suggested ) are available yet for Mac, probably not until late Feb!

Note, I haven't started using the software, I've just installed it and tried to update the software.There are two main issues:1.) Update download- the update download wasn't working as the ftp site reached it's max user limit of 200. With the sales of this product you would think they would have more than 200 allowed on at 1 time to the site.2.) State Tax software- the State Tax software won't be ready until later Feb.

This game should be rated for a toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Stuff","review":"This product does exactly what you think it does. The warming effect isn't overpowering, but makes for a nice subtle touch. It leaves skin feeling initially a little sticky, but well moisturized after being washed and dried (this is positive).The biggest mark in its favor is that this product tastes wonderfully of honey and some form of spice, almost cinnamon. It does not taste offensive in any way, unlike most other lubricants I have used.The ingredients list: Proylene Glycol (FDA approved, used in e-cigarettes and smoke machines, non-toxic), Glycerin (for slickness and wetness), Diglycerin (same as previous), Honey (flavor!), Acacia Senegal Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Water, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work","review":"This product does not work.

The production quality is very low. The picture is blurry and too distant. I spent half the time feeling as if I was seated in the back row watching a small production. The performances themselves felt repetitive and old. I recommend purchasing Bellydance Superstars: Live from Paris at the Folies Bergere instead which features a taste of many styles and is a wonderful production!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still awesome","review":"No, this one's not as good as the one filmed in Paris.

The issue of Sickle Cell was the most profound. There are so many African Americans with this disease.

It seems she really loved her mother, eventhough she was not what we could say a \\"good one\\". I also enjoyed Cassie and her friend. Her friend learned a good lesson about beauty being in the eye of the beholder.This was a wonderful love story, that I think you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Woods at his Best","review":"This long-out-of-print CD has finally been reissued and it's a must-have for Phil Woods fans, or for anyone interested in an excellent example of post-Parker be-bop saxophone. The sound quality is excellent, the rhythm section is very competent and Phil is at the top of his game on a nice mix of standards and originals. It's easy to see why he has been the benchmark for jazz alto for decades. His swing and inventiveness are nicely showcased as he eases his way through the list of tunes. If one were to buy one or two CD's that best show Phil Woods' ability to create meaningful jazz, this one would have to be high on the list for consideration. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Autograph - I don't think so.","review":"I bought these cards for my son's birthday. He doesn't have many older cards so I thought he would be excited to see what older cards or autograph he might get. What he got was a variety of older cards (since the early 1980's) which had obviously already been picked over for the good ones. In the whole box the only hall of famer was a Kirby Puckett. There was also no autographed card. When I looked at the box there was no guarantee of an autographed card. It says there is a 1:500 chance you'll get one. There are 140 cards in a box. The Amazon description says \\"Each box contains ONE Autograph card\\". Sounds like false advertising to me.

It is well-made and the leggings and corset top are worth the price alone. The little beaded necklace is an awesome addition also.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has revised its recommendations to avoid Sudden Infant Death syndrome (SIDS) and now recommends putting babies down to sleep only on their backs, not their sides, as this book suggests. The AAP also strongly discourages the use of blankets or soft bedding to avoid smothering, particularly with newborns and infants, and this book tells readers to cover the baby with \\"a variable number of light blankets.\\"This author/publisher really should revise this book in future editions; it's negligent to market this as reliable medical advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is extremely helpful, especially for first time parents.

I thought it was terrible. Stupid. Not only was it badly acted, but they couldn't get the main special effect correct--the blood really looked like old motor oil. Come on, I'm no special effects person whatsoever, but corn syrup and red food dye would have been better. BLOOD IS NOT COLORED BLACK. Why would they use black blood?? Enquiring minds wanna know!I had no idea what the movie was getting at. Disjointed. And in the end, I'm still wondering what it was about. I OWNED IT, BUT NO MORE--I THREW IT IN THE TRASH.

There is no book that will be completly comprehensive in the skill of boxing, and no one will learn boxing until you actually get trained under a boxing coach, put on gloves, and get in the ring with another fighter. This is not to say that you can not learn and understand some of the principals and science involved by reading. It does make sense to some of the training and I recommend any student to read everything and talk with everyone. This is a good basic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good for a book","review":"I'm not a professional boxer or anything, but I found this book helpful for improving my form and technique, as well as learning some new things.

If you're starting from scratch, this will show you everything you need to know. However, this is not what I was looking for, I have about 7 years of on and off boxing experience (my focus is mainly in grappling/jiu-jitsu, with boxing/kickboxing being secondary), and I was looking for something more in terms of boxing strategy and putting your basics to use in an actual match.

The two that I find almost excruciating to sit through are: \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Letter to Hermione\\".The songs that I could OD on are: \\"Till the Next Goodbye\\" \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" & \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\". As a matter of fact, Genesis should send Johnny a note of thanks and a fruit basket for showing the world just how beautifully eerie that song can be.These days I can't get enough Human Drama.Human Drama is infectious and habit forming...and an all too well kept secret.

It's almost a STRAIGHT rip (yes I know it's a remake but still) of the first movie. It'd be like Avatar winning Best Picture and Director even though it's a remake of Pocahontas, it would be ludicrous. In any case, I can see why this series won so many Kong Kong Film Awards. The cast is all fantastic, the writing is very solid, and there's enough plot twists to make M. Night Shyamalan jealous. You can never tell what's going to happen next and if you try to guess, you'll probably be wrong. Of course, now that I've said that you'll probably just guess the opposite of what you normally would and be right, but I digress. While the prices vary from place to place, getting this at 30 or under is a STEAL. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Foreign movies then check it out!","review":"I am a huge fan of foreign movies and as of late been renting several Asian movies. The Infernal Affairs Trilogy is my favorite! Way before the hoopla of \\"The Departed\\", this movie has stood out amongst alot of Asian viewers as a 5 star! Andy Lau, star, director and writer leads a team of undercover and dirty cop characters twisting and turning in the police force. Who is good and who is bad, that's what keeps you hanging in your seat till the very end.Anyone who likes cop thrillers, and a cast of characters that keep you guessing should pick up this trilogy.

The film is shot on old 16mm film. It is grainy and at times you can hear the camera running. The guys take off to go to a lake home in Pa. on a vacation because they couldn't afford New Jersey. You have lots of footage of Pennsylvania's poorly kept roads and the inside of a car. The monster is described as a reptile on the box. Large carnivorous cold blooded reptiles could not survive in a temperate zone, nor would they be active in the cool evenings.I found the movie as exciting as watching a stranger's home movie. If any of us had made this film, it would never have been picked up. The Polonia brothers have a reputation among indie films, so it got marketed.No women in this film except for a glimpse of a naked girl on a drinking glass.This was John Polonia's final film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Like the other guy mentioned, he's back to kick some rear ends.

It seems like they did not record this at any special concert, just a typical concert they would do on tour. (I understand the bootleg concerts, and I have no problem with the clips from those). The setlist was really good, and a lot of good songs were repeated later in the bootleg and bonus songs. There did not seem to be much stage presence, the musicians would headbang and move around, but just something seemed lacking. I still recommend buying this video though if you are a Dark Tranquillity fan, or even if you are like me and have your high moments of them.

These speakers were purchased for a motorcycle I recommend them highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the high pass caps?","review":"These speakers sound great (for being budget marine speakers). The sizing is bizarre and has been addressed in other reviews. My main complaint is that there is no high-pass capacitors to cut the low end. If these are rated for 80Hz there should be a cap to prevent block out anything lower. I run these off of a head unit as I'm sure many people do. There is no crossover but it desperately needs it to prevent your speakers from distorting with your bass. I used two 470uF 35V bi-polarized caps (ECE-A1VN471U) which are close enough to decrease the deep lows. Immediately I noticed I could turn the stereo up without the sound of the speaker dying out on me. For under $1 a piece I highly recommend doing your own research for your setup and determine what value you need.All things considered I'd give the speakers four stars with the proper high pass setup because they are a great value. Also the rigid plastic grill is a nice touch as far as durability goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought for my jeep wrangler","review":"size is incorrect in the listing for the application. still sitting in the box because they are to small. not happy with seller. it is what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spa Speakers","review":"Good speakers.

I had to cut out an extra .5 inch all the way around to get these speakers to fit. You need a good EQ on whatever receiver/amp you're using, as they don't have a very full sound (but CAN produce it). You can't normally get much bass from outdoor speakers, however these have much more compared to others.I also was expecting white speakers, but received BLACK, GLOSSY speakers.

Initially, like alot of software books, the author's smug comments were not irritating. By the end of the book they were unnerving. The biggest beef I had with this text was that the author does not offer sufficient explanations for the code examples. He assumes you can just read it and then understand it. Also, in several chapters rather than presenting the facts then illustrating them in a complex example he does exactly the opposite! This did nothing but serve to confuse the issue.The author's goal is commendable: attempt to be brief and too the point. However, unfortunately this book suffers due to little or no supporting narrative to accompany the code.The book reminds me of a professor who is teaching a beginning class but assumes you can figure out the details on your own.

The main characters are Artemis Fowl, Butler, Juliet, Opal Koboi, Commander Root, Cudgeon, Captain Holly, Mulch Diggums, and many more. The book is set in two different places: 1. Ireland and 2. Russia. At first Artemis is at counseling and he receives a call from Butler that his father is alive. Artemis ditches counseling and escapes to The Artic Circle. His father is held captive by the Russian Mafia and now Artemis uses the help of the fairies to find his father.

We returned the first book thinking it was just a bad copy but in both books some pages were bound so far into the pages it cut into the text. What looked like a security device was glued into the middle of a page in the first one and in the replacement book 2 pages were glued together obliterating the text on both pages where they stuck together.

I think book 2 and 1 are cheesy, gross, wierd, strange, boring, confusing, and bad examples. There is quite a bit of swearing in it. I personly don't really like books that have 12 year old criminal boys that steal gold from pixies or fairies. I like reading fantasy, fiction, ect. I thought that since this is a Science Fiction/Fantasy I would like it, but I didn't.

This film has taken that script and made it into a movie that is so bad, you can't wait to get it out of the house and back to the rental company as fast as you can. I saw the first three Billy Jack films when they initially came out, and they were intriguing at the time. Well, \\"Billy Jack\\" was intriguing, but the others were only fair. But \\"BJ Goes to Washington\\" is, first, an insult to \\"Mr. Smith\\", and, second, painful to watch in how badly edited and cheaply made it was. Others have given very indepth reviews of the film here, so I won't go into that. I had heard many years ago of this film not being released because, according to Tom Laughlin, of political pressure...but, believe me, folks, this is just a bad movie that wasn't worth releasing. If anything, the only thing I can compare it to are some of the inept films of the Fifties that Ed Wood directed. Stay away, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bye Bye Billy","review":"It's to easy to trash this movie and point out all it's flaws, so I'll try another way to review this one. The nice thing to say I guess is that by this time Billy Jack had run it's course. No one was interested in his counterculture \\"hippie\\" views by 1977. By that time it had worn very thin and people were already seeing that there was nothing left for Billy to do. With nothing new to say it was and is time for \\"One Tin Soldier To Ride Away\\".

I do like that these are tiny since I wanted to use them for training and don't want to overfeed my dogs, but in order for training treats to be effective, the dogs have to LOVE them.

This time instead of showjumping, he is bedhopping, I mean trying to win a TV franchise from the evil Tony Baddingham. This is your classic fairytale of evil versus good but in this case also wicked. The reason I loved this particular book in this series is because Rupert Campbell-Black finally gets what he deserves - he falls in love with the daughter of his business partner, Declan O'Hara. Taggie O'Hara is such a sweet girl that you can't help but hope that RCB gets her in the end and that some of her sweetness may rub off on him.

I'm not sure why anyone would want to own a Pitbull,even your homeowner's insurance may cost you more as a Pitbull (or Rottweiler) owner, and the breed is statistically proven to have an aggressive behavior. One section of the book describes a situation where 2 dogs get into a vicious fight and the author has to intervene. That is not a \\"pet\\" I would want my children or friends or neighbors around.

He talks about the experience being in New York for 9/11 and evacuating New Orleans for Katrina. I have had this book sitting on a shelf for the last year and finally got to read it while I was recently on vacation and just couldn't put it down.

I didn't understand the premise of the stories especially in the beginning, it was more a story about the dogs the author \\"found and left behind\\". I thought the saddest part of the story line was here was someone that I assumed was rescuing all these lost and abandoned dogs only to discover that he left many of the dogs that he discovered needing help without any! I kept waiting for him to realize himself and at least recognize that there were times he should have done more but he never did. I hope anyone with an interest in rescue will do more to help than the author. Maybe he donated his proceeds of the book to a shelter or rescue group at least that might make up for his lack of assistance to some of the animals. The book seemed to ramble on and I found myself putting it down and to go back to it later. It was a real waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing ...","review":"As a volunteer at an animal shelter, this was the book to read for our book club. I was sorely disappointed. Although I know Mr. Foster's heart is in the right place, the start of the book begins with his observations of dogs that he didn't help - which was quite disturbing. Additionally, I found his writing skills poor. His lack of explanation as to why, for example, his dog was vomiting blood, left you hanging. The book just ends, no real ending to the story. As I said, I was very disppointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Ken Foster writes in a positive style. The focus of the book is on finding loving caretakers for dogs, who are left behind by their owners. Every dog owner and dog rescuer should read this book.Also, I enjoyed reading about Ken Foster and his dogs living through 9/11, Ken's pacemaker surgery and Hurricane Katrina. I was especially glad to read that so many had left New Orleans, with their pets, before the Hurricane hit.I've already purchased 2 more copies of the book to give to friends.

His observations on how people don't even notice homeless dogs around is a stark reality. You're often torn with what to do when you happen upon a loose dog not knowing whether it's a stray or lost and I just hope I can do the right thing the next time. I love that he gives voice to the bad rap that pits get. I found myself unable to put this book down.

The criticisms about its sympathies to Communism are well-taken, but a good middle or high school teacher can remedy that in short order, or simply assign selected chapters instead of having kids read all the way through from start to finish.

My classes are always composed of children from a wide variety of different cultures. It is so powerful to have one book that so many students can relate to. With stories from Japan, Africa, Guatemala, Russia and many others, children can usually find a story that represents their personal culture. These stories are excellent tools for opening the door to group discussions. These discussions present opportune times to discuss morals, cultural differences/similarities and human nature.

IT's truly amazing. After being sold the 250, being told it was the same as the 450, we were very dissapointed. Our main frustration is that the optional Microphone isn't available, or VERY difficult to aquire. And to tell the truth a waste of investment without it.

The last straw was when I took it to the Long Beach Gran Prix and it didn't work at all. In addition, the digital camera feature is so low quality that the pictures are not even worth emailing. Very grainy, little color. So, in summary, I have a non-working camcorder that is garbage or needs costly repair after one year.

It broke during the birth of our second child. No images of this irreplaceable moment. I am so upset. Don't make my mistake. Don't shrug off our warnings.

I unloaded the film and battery and reloaded them again to see if it was going to go away. The red X dissapeared and it started to tape fine.

It has performed flawlessly since day one. Some of the reviewers claim that this camera is too big physically, but it's really not that big. It is true that the menus are a little hard to navigate, but the more you use it the better. The only thing that this techie has found lacking is a microphone line in. They went through the trouble of adding line inputs so you can make copies from other sources, but failed to include a microphone line in so you could use a better mic. No biggie. This camera has alot of features for the money. The camera has still image capability, but at web quality only which is fine. It's not a digital still camera. It's silly to expect a video camera to have high quality still image capability @ 30 frames per second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera for the price.

I'll never buy another Sony product.This sharp has lots of great features for the price. I do find that it is slightly uncomfortable to hold and the menu system takes a little getting used to, but the picture quality and other digital features are top notch (compared to my old 8mm). The smart card feature for taking still photos is awesome.

My wife waited several days to test it. She later told me that she was having trouble with it. I just assumed she couldn't figure it out. So a couple of weeks went by before I had a chance to look at it. The thing would only play if you pushed start than stop about ten times before it would play. It would record fine otherwise. So after several weeks I took it back to Best Buy(Worst Buy), they said they thought I just wasn't connecting it properly to the tv. So I tried it again at home still not playing. I took it back to best buy. A different guy looked at it and said it was (messed)up. So they shipped it for repairs. It took almost seven weeks to get it back. Meanwhile I missed hallowween and thanksgiving(I have a 2 yearold and a 3 yearold-not good with the wife to miss these on tape!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be persuaded by the negative reviews...","review":"I have read all the reviews, both positive and negative before buying this camera. I was nearly persuaded by the 1 star guy, but I am glad I read on... I think it is evident by all the reviews that this camera is a POOR digital camera (digital still-shot camera). If you want that feature, buy a real stand alone digital camera. Even the best high-dollar Sony's produce poor (though much better) stills compared to the 3-4 Mega-Pixel cameras. Seeing this camera for what it is makes it a steal - this is a low-cost, 'mini-DV' video camera. It takes excellent video recordings, and supports firewire connectivity that can produce any number of stills desired. I give it a rather high 4 star rating because of the price/feature ratio. If this were a (more expensive) camera, I'd rate it a 3, because of the low quality stills. Additionally, I do not have green dots on the display as others have reported. A few more of those reports would change my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price went up plus no bag/tripods in stock","review":"Amazon had this camcorder [at a lower price] on Saturday and before.

The picture quality was very grainy, especially on skin and plain surfaces such as walls. I tried it both with and without the image stabilization with little visual difference. I compared it back-to-back with my JVC VHS-C camcorder and it was worse! Not what I expected from digital recording! I am not a hard-core camera buff, just a very casual user, bought my JVC as my first video cam 5 months ago to film my new baby. The picture quality problem is very obvious, and not acceptable. I assume that better digicams are not this way.

I used it for about 8 months during which time we recorded 10 tapes. Every time we used a new high quality tape. Then one day the picture scrambled and I couldn't record anything. I contacted Sharp and they sent me to one of their repair centers where I paid a lot of money for service (parts were still under warranty). I was told the whole head assembly had to be replaced. Now after another 4 tapes the same thing has happened again. I wrote another email to the same Sharp customer service rep but she hasn't even bothered to answer my email. I suppose because the warranty has run out. I did get an email back from the service center offering to fix the camera again. Of course, they said it would be much more expensive because the warranty had run out. DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.

Playback is ok on previously recorded tapes, but no matter what, it will not record on any type of tape I use (Fuji, Sony, or Panasonic). Looks similar to what a satelite TV looks like when its loosing signal.And the highlight to this is it only comes with a one year warranty, so who knows how much its going to now cost me to fix it. I may just eat the cost and buy a different one.Image quality was decent, sound was great, never had a problem with jammed tapes, battery life [needs improvement], firewire capability was flawless, but the horrible reliability is just not worth it.

I got it back a few weeks later. Worked for a little while, before receiving the message, \\"Eject the Cassette.\\" I ran a head cleaner, but to no avail. I have never been able to use a full Mini DV tape without getting that message. I tried Mini DV tapes by Panasonic, Maxell, and Sony. None seem to work. The camera is way too unreliable.

I used the replacement camera last night to tape a X-Mas party. When I started playing the tape back this morning, the first five minutes were OK, then it was pixelized blobs again.This camera has great features for the price, but I learned the hard way you get what you pay for.

Evidently something or another is \\"blown\\".Also I'm not satisfied with the placement of buttons, in particular the main buttons to turn on the screen.

I went to hook it up to my television later to watch it and it kept telling me to eject the tape. The manual said this was due to a defective cassette so just to see I bought a new cassette to check. I put a brand new cassette and presto! Nada, zero, zip...still said to eject the tape. So off to return it went.I wished I saw more of the bad comments about this camera before I purchased it.

Nevertheless I lost very important 30 minutes of an event I was filming, so I can't be positive about the unreliable camera andI doubt the tape was to blame since other users complained about the same.Another thing is the overall quality of the picture, which is not better than of my analog Canon videocam. I did not look at the pixel resolution but it is not high, which explains the low price.And the last small complaint is about ergonomics of the controls, some keys are not well placed, especially the cateye one, which is easy to accidentally switch on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shop Around First!","review":"After my son opened the camera, read the instructions, and began taping the camera died.

After exactly one year, its picture started to mis-synchronize. Cannon service center (Irvine California) charge about $145 to inspect but do not guarantee to repair it. I sent it for fix. After few months, the problem was back.My first camcorder is the Sharp analog model, also one year life.

I owned both Epson and HP printers and they all lasted more than a couple years. My HP Photosmart 7350 is still working. The only complain I have about that printer is that the ink doesn't last long.

What follows is a series of dishonesties which ultimately lead to M.J.'s redemption. This is not a comedy that will have you rolling on the floor, but there are a number of really funny moments, and Pinchot's portrayal of the pompous M.J.

This is original stuff and it's good. There's even some contemporary Christian/country here. After listening to \\"Fly-A Tribute To John Denver,\\" I found I was in a trance-like state and didn't remember exactly what is was I just heard..but I could have sworn John himself was there.

However, be warned, if you buy this, you aren't going to want to stop here. If you're like me you'll want to own all her albums, which makes this one a little unnecessary to own. Then again, you could start here, and then, after you get the rest of her stuff, pass this one on to a friend. He/she can then do the same.

Firstly, his young age is really evident in this text. I find his prose to be a rather amateur endeavor, and I just couldn't appreciate his story because of this. Secondly, this book is listed as dealing with a youth who is fed up with the predictable life. Nice premise for the millionth time. I would be more interested to see how a rebellious youth dealt with such a predicable book, like Zur's. Zur, nice attempt, but maybe hit the books for a few more years and come back in sometime. One positive note: this novel is far better than those ridiculous poems he published. They were like Seuss meets depressed Marilyn Manson fan. Life isn't that hard...you live in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Mind-Melting Read!","review":"Zur is the one of the great new prophets preaching the life of anti-social counter culture that exists in The City.

This amazing new artist pulls no punches in this great look at a reality where nothing is as it seems. Be prepared to have your face melted off after reading this gripping, intense, page-turner.

Instead, I went by the review that said \\"It inflates everything--tires, balls, pools... anything you need inflated!\\" and bought it.

The movie goes through a few stories, delves a little into each character's personalities and I've gotten to really like Stecchin and her voice actresses (Japanese and English!). She's a quirky little character, even if she isn't around for more than five minutes. 'The Big Guy' is an intriguing character, but this volume doesn't really do him any justice. He's just 'there' most of the time, doing his thing and letting the others hop out into the limelight. Orlend is the typical woman-chaser and 'romantic'; I like machis 'just because' he's the typical glasses wearing dorkish character. As for Alice...eh. I sorta get her, and then I don't.

Besides the author going back and forth refering to the events,which have happenned in the past and will happen in the future. I understand that the mission of the book was to provide historical accounts of Madame Sadayako's life and geisha traditions.

I kept turning from the text to the photos to gaze at the creature who was so enchanting.With each change of her name, Madame Sadayakko morphed into another creature who managed to survive the blows and upsets life sent her.

Maybe Alison's stepfather is an exception, but even he is a caricature, a sort of Bertie Wooster trying to be a parent. You almost expect him to say \\"cheerio\\" or some other cliche.

The main character, Alex, shows no personality at all. In fact they were all quite one-dimensional. The very slight element of suspense that substitutes for a plot line didn't show up until very late in the book.

I didn't think it was written well and after reading the phrase \\"made noises\\" (about making plans) for the 10th time, the end of the book couldn't have come sooner. Also, as someone who is actually from Bucks County, I found it incredibly irritating for her to keep mentioning the county over and over again when the towns she named (Upper Darby and Bryn Mawr) aren't even in Bucks!

But the main character, Alex Davidson, does nothing through the entire book but gripe and complain, and it makes one wonder-- if she is so unhappy, why doesn't she get another job. The problem is-- it's not really clear why she is so unhappy. The group she works with is having problems, but hey--- don't we all. Also, it's never really clear what the big deal is-- a take-over, heads roll, but nothing makes real sense, reader-wise.

The other main characters are not much likable either. The development of the non-central characters was pretty bad too. I'll cite C Se. as an example. She was quite obviously J Lo. but for God's sake just say so or don't try to pretend she is someone else. Come up with something original at least. I am giving the book 2 stars because I actually liked the plot (when they finally got to it that is). Too bad the unlikable characters ruined it. I didn't mind the cut throat image of Hollywood.

I buy this book often to give as a gift to friends and relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow ... impossible to describe, yet obviously brilliant","review":"An amazing effort creating an amazing result.One of the most remarkable collection of concepts, ideas and observations.Never fails to nudge the creative mind our of a slump."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Page a day","review":"This book is a tour de force of creativity and it is suitable for everyone, not just graphic designers. Each page is so thick and rich that you shouldn't browse through it. I highly recommend you limit yourself to 1 page a day so you can absorb and digest what it contains. It is a stunning whack of creativity that you need to take slowly. Over time this book will help you to see and to think in different ways and with significantly more \\"creativity\\".If you consider yourself to be a creative person you absolutely, positively, have to get this book. It will change you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Magic Wonderland","review":"This book is a gem, a pearl for all visual arts aficionados. It intrigues you, it provokes you, it challenges you into seeing - and thinking - from another perspective: sideways. You can't read it - or even peruse it - all in one sitting, but you will find yourself going to it again and again looking for some artistic stimuli and visual intelligence and wit.The author is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Stuff!!","review":"Visually stunning... this is the perfect \\"coffee table\\" book!! Crammed with loads of images and information... definitely a book to impress your mates with!! Buy it, read at your own leisure, and enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivational & inspirational","review":"All the scraps of thoughts, quotes, illustrations, art, and scientific insights all blend into a very nice amalgam of a book. I didn't read it from cover to cover, but rather opened up somewhere random and read different pieces. The randomness of all the inspirational thoughts allows for this type of reading - I think it actually makes the book even better. It almost works as the mind itself: getting bits and pieces of information to juggle with really gets your creative juices flowing.A must have, and must-random-read, for everyone in the creative industries and arts sector. Not sure about what other people should do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"tour de force","review":"This is a massive graphical, cultural, philosophical tour de force likes of which I have rarely seen. Extremely strong in graphics, less so in philosophy, but very, very interesting. Reading it is like drinking from a firehose at times: Open it randomly, and you are likely to find something worthwhile, something to think about, something to be inspired by. It also happens to have more good quotes than a typical quote dictionary. A rewarding addition to an eclectic library of a creative individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a must have.","review":"If you deal with creativity, visual perception and design... You have to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Investment","review":"This is a book that anyone interested in design, philosophy or a laugh could not possibly tire of. Witty and intelligent, it is contains a wealth of information, delight and humour. It is jam packed with funny and inspirational quotes, random and interesting facts and philosophies. The design is fun and clever and full of all sorts of visual stimuli. This book will inspire you and make you THINK in a way that could hurt no-one and that you are bound to enjoy. Perhaps my favourite book to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"look before you buy","review":"i just don't get it. i bought this based on the reviews and i just don't get it. i read a lot of graphic design and think i'm reasonably well versed in the field, but his just doesn't do it for me. See the other one star review about a dozen reviews down -- i agree completely. the two of us must just be missing something. maybe try and read an excerpt or something before buying. its a meaningless, jumbled, uninteresting mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big hoopla?","review":"Based on the ravingly good reviews I bought this book as a present and was incredibly disappointed. Makes me pledge to never buy a book based solely on on-line reviews ever again. He politely flipped through the book, gave a polite thanks and then \\"forgot\\" to bring it home. I found it mostly uninspired, making up for lack of quality with quantity that then only confirmed the toss-off that made up most of the pages. Printing wasn't great. Illustrations weren't great. Writing wasn't great. And what design? Waste of money. I expected it to have the looseness of \\"Speck\\" but this book brings none of the sense of wonder, play, reflection I found in that great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"First, read the title of this review.Now, go read some of the five star reviews.Right now. Go read them.Are you back? Good.If those reviews made you feel sick to the stomach, angry, patronized, or confused, this book is not for you. This is a book that was made for the coffee tables of higher-middle class, \\"artistically\\" inclined intellectuals for the sake of making themselves feel better. By writing this review, I'm actually helping them, because I'm just one more person who \\"doesn't get it,\\" because they, presumably, do.If you're happy being an unsophisticated philistine with no creativity who can't think outside the box, then you best move along."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is full of ideas waiting to be created by you.","review":"I buy books at random, not by selection. I look at something on the shelf and decided if it's inspiring to have. The Art of Looking Sideways is just that, the perspective is left up to the reader. You can flip through its randomness and find something that will spark your imagination and creativity. The book is so big that every time I look through it, I always find something new to read, enjoy, and ponder.Like any art book, this ISN'T for everyone. This is for someone that can respect anything that's everything created by and made out of nothing. If you want to be intrigued, or just want something interesting to read, this is the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide to gain proper ideas.","review":"I am well informed about Alans work and his graphic solutions make a great guide to contemporary design for me. I must say that this book has becomed one of my favorites because on almost every page that I turn there is some new idea waiting to make me think about any project that I am working on. I saw this book on amazon site and as soon as I read the review I knew that this is what I need and this type of book was missing on my book shelf.If you have plenty of ideas or none, or if you are just in deadline with your graphic project this book will show you the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and lovely design","review":"Very ornamental and functional.

It is very attractive on the patio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hesitated -- glad I went for it!","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this table because of the cost, but after looking at the options at the big box and other discount stores, I knew I didn't want something that was so light it could blow away, or metal that could rust. This table is HEAVY and came with all the pieces to put it together in about 2 minutes. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is looking for a side table that they can enjoy for many years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland. No taste of hananero. Not hot.","review":"I bought this at a local super market. Takes like chilie powder. Not very spicy. Could not taste any habanero. So boring I had to mix it with dave insanity sauce and eventually gave up on finishing the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB! DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKING AT ITS BEST","review":"This documentary will break your heart and make you laugh out loud. Not an easy task for any documentary film. This film should be required in all American History, Sociology, U.S. Government, and Political Science courses in colleges, as well as shown in documentary film classes. This is a story told by the people involved - not some mystery \`authority' narrator telling you how to analyze the visuals you are seeing. Please see this film -- if you haven't already. This should never have happened in America. If the images of the Katrina victims were not of poor African-Americans, it would never have happened in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great documentary from Spike Lee!","review":"Not since \\"Four Little Girls\\" have I been so moved! The way Mr. Lee allowed the survivors of Hurricane Katrina to tell their own stories in their own voices made me watch all discs in one sitting!! The stories were very compelling and I feel like I have a better sense of what actually happened after the levees broke as opposed to what was presented on mainstream news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start but degenerates to the \\"them against us\\"","review":"Once Al Sharpton and Wynton Marsalis opened their pie-holes, it started going downhill. And the usual rants about picking on \\"us people\\" (regardless of color) with the usual results got pretty tired. All the blame for the late response was well-deserved to the Bush Administration and all the machinery under it.If you read books about how all the red-tape of beaurocracy, paranoia, trickle-down theories and turf-wars (which the video doesn't really cover in detail) lead to all the delays, you'll be embarrassed as an American. Especially, if you know America's response for emergencies to other countries (i.e. We are usually the first to offer with help from Gov't and private donations. And the first to arrive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitle for English and no closed caption","review":"After I received this DVD of \\"When the Levees Broke - A Requiem In Four Acts\\" and I watched it, there is no subtitle for English and no closed caption either. That surprised and upset everyone, especially for our hearing impaired people. Since I am hearing impaired, we need closed captions and/or subtitles in order to understand clearly. The movie producer Spike Lee must be bigotry against hearing impaired because he neglects hearing impaired aid. He only cares about himself and his lucrative profit and the true character of Spike Lee is a pure racist! Don't buy anything from Spike Lee's DVD products."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the levies broke","review":"Spike Lee essentially blames the US Government for the careless acts of those who did not abide to an evacuation order."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Levees Broke","review":"This is a superbly done piece on Hurricane Katrina. My hat is off to Spike Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful!!!","review":"I think this is one of Spike Lee's greatest works. I enjoyed his unbiased approach. I'm glad I bought it becasue it shows the part of Hurricane Katrina the news media didn't cover. You will experience a lot of emotions. A must see documentary!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"A very impressive documentary which keeps you wondering: where was and is the federal government and what does New Orleans look like two years after?"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD documentary","review":"Such a raw account of the people and destruction of New Orleans from huricane Katrina. Done extremely well and touches on areas that I wasn't aware of. Personal accounts from the people who went through the hurricane and footage I have never seen. Had to own it after I saw it - an excellent unbiased record of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2006!","review":"This is, without a doubt, the best film of 2006 and, along with \\"An Inconvenient Truth,\\" the most IMPORTANT film of the year. You hear that, Academy? If people paid more attention to films like this instead of dulling their brains with nonsense like \\"Night at the Museum,\\" and if Hollywood grew a social conscience instead of concentrating on the weekend tallies, the world might be a better place. Instead, we point fingers at Spike Lee (labeling him a racist) and Al Gore (calling him a spin doctor out for his own political gain). I'm wondering when the world, and Americans in particular, are going to collectively wake up and look at the bigger picture. There are important, universal truths to be learned from these two films. Do yourself a favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required viewing","review":"This should be required viewing for every citizen of this U. S. of A. I cried through most it. I was angry through most of it. Most of all my heart went out to all those citizens of the Gulf Coast and especially New Orleans for their suffering. May this never, ever happen again. Thank you Spike Lee for this comprehensive look at the largest natural disaster to ever hit the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential item","review":"Seeing this documentary when it originally aired inspired me to go to New Orleans and volunteer to help rebuild and help the families who have no help. For those who do not live in the areas hit by Hurricane Katrina we really cannot fathom the devistation, distruction, heartbreak and frustration felt by the people that still continues to this day. This video documents a piece of American history that must be shared and passed down for generations. You will not believe your eyes nor will you believe how the American government and the state governments impacted the healing process. Peoples lives were lost and you won't help but sympathize with every person who suffered at the hands of the Hurricane and the breach of the levee. I hope this becomes an inspiration to all of you as it has been for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Facts","review":"Very informative of what occurred with Katrina and enlightening that after these years there is still confusion about what happened in Louisianna. Although the assignment for class was to watch the first Act, I found myself curious to watch the rest and purchased them. Finding opinions of many for the entire before, during, and after was not only diversified but touched on many differences in people, and the current concerns of today and demonstrates that there hasn't been much change since earlier decades in those regards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being from New Orleans","review":"Being from New Orleans and all that implies, I woke up on Aug.30.2005 and realized that I owned 3 sets of clothes and the shoes that I had on. This is one doc. that everyone in this country should have to look at. Lee did an amaing job of showing what happened here in the city. If you want to go a step further read ONE DEAD IN ATTIC by Chis Rose and, as they say \\"is the rest of the story.\\"1 Dead in Attic: After Katrina"},{"rating":"1","title":"I only received two of the four Acts","review":"Spike Lee did an outstanding job on this documentory, and I felt it was very balanced in its approach. I just wish I had known that I was only going to receive Acts 2 & 3 of the documentory. Other than this discrepancy, it was a great DVD. I love the depiction of our present administration during this crisis, and our President's mother, wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even More Poignant","review":"I saw \\"When the Levees Broke\\" on HBO the 2 nights it premiered. I was moved by the devastation of the cities and the spirit of the people. I arrived home this morning at 2am from spending a week in New Orleans with a volunteer group for Hurricane Katrina clean-up. 16 months later the devastation is still significant. We had an opportunity to go through the lower 9th ward, which is still a ghost town. In the background right now I'm listening to myself narrate as I'm filming the footage that I'd taken in the lower 9th ward. I hear myself saying \\"Oh my God\\" and \\"Unbelievable\\" frequently, and that is only because I was at a loss for words to describe what I was seeing and feeling. Personal possessions, baby clothes, furniture, the stories of the people still traumatized to this day. I'm purchasing Spike Lee's documentary to add to my own personal footage and photographs. This nightmare should NEVER be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"he has a few clever observations which were overshadowed by his lack of creativity in his choice of obscenities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff","review":"Many people complain that Dennis Miller's jokes go over most people's heads. Well, for those of us who can pick up on his often obscure references, this book is a treat.In today's comedy environment, where scatalogical humor and inane observational humor is the norm, Miller is a beacon of light in a fog of mediocrity. He knows just when to drop one of those patented analogies he is so well known. Of course, the analogies would be irrelevant if the monologues themselves weren't sharp and satiric looks at society today.So, I say go read this book. It's funnier than watching a Himalayan mountain guide getting gored by a yak."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Laugh Out Loud","review":"Finally, a book of \\"Rants.\\"Miller and Rooney have selected a broad range of topics fromthe series and gathered them into what amounts to a tome oftimely sociological and political commentary. These \\"essays\\"are both humorous and thought provoking at the same time.More than once you'll find yourself laughing aloud at someof the off the wall references made while commenting on suchtopics as OJ Simpson, Victimless Crime, and What is Rightwith America. If this book has one fault, it is that it istoo short.For anyone who wished they had taped Dennis Miller's ramblingmonologues from his HBO show, this book is for you. And forthose of you who may have never watched the show, you canget a taste of what you have been missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has about 10 funny pages out of 200","review":"This book contains hardly any funny rants about anything. He just talks about how much he hates everything but does not point out anything funny about the things that he hates. It is worth reading if you get it at the library, but do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the funny?","review":"Read this hoping for a few laughs. Instead it was a series of obvious observations told in a manner that was uninteresting. The attempt at humor was forced, and thus failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Outfield's best album!","review":"I think the main reason this album is the favorite of so many Outfield fans, is because \\"Voices of Babylon\\" is a perfect blend of garage band rock n' roll, and sophisticated production. On the one hand, songs like \\"No Point\\" and \\"My Paradise\\" are gritty rockers, while \\"Voices\\" and \\"Part of Your Life\\" are more textured. This is my favorite Outfield album. BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC!!","review":"This movie is classic!! Bachelor party was always one of my fav's! Didn't know there was a part 2, but since it was only like $2 more for the 2-pack why not. Both movies funny great and just old school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible teaching tool for the uninitiated!","review":"This book presents complex subject matter in extremely complex engineeringese (contrary to English). There is little attention paid to establishing a base of reference on which to build. The author assumes the reader has fluent knowledge of complex mathematics and wastes no time or space in an attempt to explain his assumptions or algebraic leaps to the \\"most simplified form.\\" The practice problems are virtually impossible to solve and bear slight or no resemblence to the grossly inadequate examples.All in all a very frustrating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Show!","review":"If I could give a negative star I would.

The visual images conjured up in the Welkening are amazing! The author provided so many interesting characters, situations and possibilities. All 3 of these \\"tales\\" come together in the end in a very powerful climax. I could certainly relate to a number of the situations the \\"Misfits\\" had experienced in their lives, and my guess is that most readers will as well. A very enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Could Have Been","review":"This has to be one of the hardest books to review. Much of the acclaim in the friends' reviews is true. The Welkening is a complex tale, three dimensional, clever, unique, fresh, innovative. The glich is, there are so many problems in the writing, the story is hard to follow. Would that Gregory Spencer, such an imaginative mind, had spent more time learning the craft of fiction. Or that his editors had helped him with things like repetition, poor transitions, weak set up and absent foreshadowing, baffling character motivation, and muddled point of view. This story had the potential to be great. Instead it may well languish on shelves because no one cares enough about the characters to persevere. Too bad. The Welkening contains, in small doses, some of the most inventive language. If only Spencer had Tolkienized his story, even a little ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative Idea, but . . .","review":"I tried to read this book for an independent study project for school, but after just a few pages in I begged my professor to let me swap in another book. The idea of a three-dimensional tale is creative and interesting, but the writing style of this book is so poor I couldn't take the book seriously. The characters fell flat and were too cartoonish--not representations of real people. I couldn't bring myself to care about them, and consequently couldn't finish their story."},{"rating":"1","title":"a modern (commercial ?) record ...","review":"My review will be short: the vocalists on this album have got very little to do with hard rock & metal, so don't expect any miracles. This may be the way Tony likes his music to sound now, but I miss the originality, the feel and the attitude of Black Sabbath. I'm still waiting for a retro-style Iommi effort, and I hope he'll take the risk one day ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sod","review":"Tony really oought to just give it up, especially if he's gonna do his stuff with these pathetic modern heavy metal idiots like Phil Anselmo. Only one track with Ozzy and hes the only decent vocalist on the whole album. Most of the riffs arent vintage black sabbath, the sound like some rubbish a modern band like godsmack or korn would do and that pathetic teenagers with baggy pants dropped down to their knees \\"mosh\\" to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I bought this album because I love Black Sabbath and especially Tony Iommi's guitar work, but this album doesn't sound like Iommi at all, it sounds like metal, but there aren't many signature Iommi licks, and the songs aren't that good. Even with the broad range of vocalists featured, this album sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome album","review":"I love this album!!! All the songs are good. The album stays fresh because there is a guest vocalist on every song. I especially like Laughing Man (In The Devil Mask) with Henry Rollins. Plus the album has a very dark, heavy feel. There is, also, a killer guitar solo on every song. If your a fan at all of sabbath or ozzy you must buy this album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Change your name","review":"Well at least Tony stopped hiding behind the Black Sabbath name and finally made it on his own.

Because of record company pressure he released it as a Black Sabbath album. \\"Seventh Star\\" isn't bad but it sounds more like an 80s Deep Purple than Sabbath. (Ex-Purple Glen Hughes does the vocals). In 1996 Iommi recorded another solo album (also with Hughes) that was never released but was bootlegged under the title \\"Eighth Star\\". (That album is OK but redundent.) This time Iommi's album has a different vocalist for each track so no one could release it as a Sabbath effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Metal God shows how it's done!","review":"Anybody remember those Black Sabbath albums that were really Iommi solo projects in disguise? Albums like \\"Seventh Star\\"? This album is a far cry from those lame attempts at metal, and shows that Iommi is truly the originator of the low-tuned, minor-chord heavy metal RIFF. And with assorted vocalists on each cut, every song offers a nicely different take on a type of music that these days tends to all sound pretty much the same. While I won't admit that Tony breaks any new ground here, the album is HEAVY, LOUD and SABBATH-like throughout. Should appeal to old fans and the kids alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed After Two Years, Chip Melted, Mobo Useless","review":"When I replaced the factory fan (which has three wires) with this fan (which has two wires), my BIOS was no longer able to keep track of the fan's speed or if the fan was failing. I don't know how this sort of this works, but my only guess is that is has to do with this fan not having a third wire. After a couple years, the fan got noisy which required the occasional oiling. Then one day the fan stopped altogether. The chip melted and the motherboard became useless. A chipset fan does not need to be a fancy color, it just needs to be able to run without failing."},{"rating":"2","title":"just great","review":"As 'the man' said, this is a lot of fun.

For anyone who loves hot sauce, daves is a good sauce, but it's a little pricey. I bought this to sample his other flavors, it's great on eggs, complements alot of meats as a dipping sauce. I would buy it again, but it's costly for a little bottle, with shipping. If you love you will buy more of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husbands favorite hot sauce!!","review":"Anything on the Dave's Gourmet line is an excellent choice, but my husband says this one is the best by far!! Not too hot, but definitely enough of a kick.

This uninspired version plods along until the end, and then it becomes wretched. Jim teams up with the pirates to kill the Doctor, Squire, and Captain. This movie was so bad I felt sick after watching it. Jack Palance would have made a fine Long John in a better directed version. On the plus side, the camera work is decent and the Hispaniola is beautiful.Go for the Disney or Charlton Heston version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"total perversion of a wonderful story","review":"We rented this out of our love for the Treasure Island story as well as our respect for Jack Palance's acting skills. While Mr. Palance performed well, the story itself was totally twisted. The \\"good guys\\" became the \\"bad guys\\" and the \\"bad guys\\" turned out to be actually the \\"good guys\\". Par for our modern PC culture which fortunately R. L. Stevenson knew nothing about (and yes, I have read the original story). SPOILER: the story ends by the \\"hero\\" Long John Silver sailing to Jamaica with Jim Hawkins and Ben Gunn (the \\"good guys\\" of the show were killed during a fight at the treasure -- but the story was so twisted that you were actually glad they received their \\"just reward\\" in death!). The only reason I rated this a \\"1-star\\" was because there was not a \\"zero-star\\" rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the film makers read the book?","review":"Anyone who has actually read the book will be disappointed with this version of the film. Despite pretty good casting, the film is ruined by an unforgivable altering of the story. Peter Rowe owes an apology to all fans of R. L. Stevenson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible!","review":"I had high hopes for this film, as it has plenty of well-known actors. But this director/writer butchered the original story. He went far beyond taking liberties with it...he ruined it. The plot development is horrible...characters don't develop, they simply change in the time it takes to switch scenes. And as other reviewers have noted, the ending is probably the worst part of all. As I watched (painfully), I questioned if the director even bothered to read the book. He took a wonderful, rousing adventure and turned it into a sickening, useless film that I will never watch again, let alone buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, some flaws","review":"Good Pirate film. Should have been made more for the kids- there were some overly gory shots, and at times it was too wordy and lengthy for the kids. Good production value, cool sets and boats / costumes / set design was impressive. If you like Pirate films, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT were they thinking???","review":"Alright, I finally read Treasure Island and decided I needed to see a good interpretation on film. This ain't it. Treasure Planet and Muppet's Treasure Island were both humorous at least. This is the only other version I could find locally. It started off promising enough, then it went downhill fast and never looked back. The settings and costumes were simply beautiful though. If you are hoping for a true-to-book movie this is the farthest thing possible. Frankly, it stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably awful","review":"Saw this film only once, and maybe I'm going blind, or the movie affected my brain somehow.....but did anyone else notice that in the closing credits to this horrible film that Jack Palance's name was spelled \\"Plalance\\"?

But even though I was keenly interested in the subject of this book, and what Fenster would have to say about it, I found the reading so utterly dry and boring that I couldn't get even a third of the way through the book. I put it down and came back to it several times, trying to bring a freshness to it. But each time I was drugged to catatonia within a few pages. I gave up trying to read it straight through, and tried skimming and jumping around to get some key points. It didn't help. The author appears more intent on scholarly notes and quotes and references, than on making a clear and readable narrative.

If avoiding avalanches, brushing off frostbite, entertaining yourself for days in a tent while you wait out a storm, climbing on ridges with hurricane force winds, looking down three thousand foot cliffs and staring death in the eyes and smiling sounds fun to you, then mountaineering may just be your cup of tea! Regardless, if you enjoy reading about hardcore adventurers, then this book is definately your cup of tea. The stories are very entertaining and suspensful at times. I particularly enjoyed Krakauer's portrayal of mountaineering culture- Many of these adrenaline rush junkies have eccentric personalities stemming from their own audacity. Anyone who enjoys outdoor adventure, will enjoy reading the stories in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Format but Good Book","review":"In this book Jon Krakauer tells the stories of expeditions, accidents, and incredible feats in mountaineering but instead of just telling one story, every chapter covers a different story from climbing in the French Alps and the nightlife of Chamonix to the origins of bouldering.

A few times I found myself tense from the suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not based on the Eiger","review":"Krakauer lives up to his strong reputation in this collection of short works. Do not expect a full book about the notorious Eiger mountain! That is but a small portion of this book. Look forward to meeting other climbs, from fifteen-foot boulders to the 20,320-foot Denali.

Convivial Dickens is the reference guide to the waxing and waning popularity of beer, gin and mixed drinks in Victorian England-specifically the England of Dickens.

These allow the reader to do some \\"research\\" on their own, to fully enjoy the atmosphere of the times.A pretty useful companion to any of Dickens' works, recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Introduction","review":"It does look like this is a good time for Robert B. Parker to come up with a new character, and judging from this first book, Jesse Stone could be a winner. He's certainly different from Spenser. While he shows some wit, he's of a darker and brooding nature, having messed up his professional and personal lives by hitting the bottle too heavily. In fact, he even goes to a job interview after drinking and surprisingly gets hired as police chief in Paradise, Mass. He figures that he was hired in spite of his condition when the truth is he was hired because of his drinking...he appeared to be far easier managed than he turned out to be.Obviously, Parker intends to have the two series interrelate to a degree. Vinnie Morris and Gino Fish appear in the story, although interestingly, they never interrelate with Stone. Somehow, I suspect that might change in future novels.All in all, this is a promising beginning for a new Parker hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night Passage","review":"Absolutly the worst book that I have read from Parker, I have read most of the, this is the most disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Parker.. except","review":"I always shake my head and smile when I read Robert B. Parker's novels. That I keep reading them is evidence of his talent as a writer. Even so, after about the first 20 pages, I could not help but notice that Jesse Stone is simply a re-working of the Spenser character. I still hold out the hope that someday, Parker will get over his hangups about conservatives, organized religion, the concept of man and wife, and surburbia. The sub-plot about the right-wing militia was laughable! In Massachusetts of all places?? Parker's blind faith in The Professional Therapist as the god-given solution to all of man's problems is passing out of the annoying phase and is now in the realm of nauseating. Its sad that a man of such talent has such a stunted, fatalistic view of Man. If only Parker can overcome this handicap, he will possibly make the leap from fair to good."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last. someone new and interesting comes along!","review":"Jesse Stone is not a perfect person. What a relief to read about a character who isn't Pierce Brosnan beautiful and who has his own personal issues to deal with. This book is truly entertaining and wonderful to relax with after a long day at work. I will definitely look for more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the Spenser novels","review":"After the first thirty pages, I was ready to put this book down. Parker can write, there's no doubt about that, but I didn't like how he handled third-person POV or the fact that he shifts POV from character to character. The storyline is pretty predictable, which is okay usually if the characters are engaging but I just couldn't get close to them. This book doesn't even come close to The Godwulf Manuscript (the first Spenser novel). I own all of Parker's Spenser books in hardcover but I wouldn't spend my money on even the paperback version of this one. Why two stars? Because, as I said earlier, Parker can write.

Soon upon his arrival he learns that names can be deceiving, when he comes across political corruption and a militia group running loose in his town. Add murder and you have a perfect day.This was the second book in the series that I read (following \\"Sea Change\\") and I have to admit I have to add Parker's Jesse Stone series to the list of my all time favorite detective series (eg the 87th Precinct by the late Evan Hunter BKA Ed McBain, and the Alex Cross series by James Patterson)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spenser: In Disguise","review":"Who does Robert B. Parker think he's fooling? Jesse Stone, along with the 'new' female detective Sunny, and Philip Marlowe too as Parker writes him, are just re-workings of Spenser. Same personal problems, same cohorts, same basic plots. Admittedly Spenser is more worthy of repetition than some other characters, but come on! It's as if he only knows how to write one or two characters and one or two stories. I guess as long as he can sell them, he'll keep re-working the same stories. I won't buy them though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parker shows that he can create another complex character.","review":"What a wonderful book. Robert Parker has taken many of the complexities of Spenser and transposed them onto a younger, different character. The book read very well and very fast.

The book was difficult to put down and thoroughly engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start to new series","review":"I am a fan of Parker's Spenser novels, so I was cautiously intrigued by this new series. Stone does share many of the same likeable traits which Spenser has (stubborn, compassionate, fearless, fair), but he's different enough to make it stand out as its own series.

The story moves along at a good pace, and it's full of interesting characters and plot twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author and I won't bother with another one.

Freddie is joined by Ritchie Cole on alto, Ashley Alexander on trombone, George Cables on piano etc. Altoist Mel Flory makes it a septet for one tune. Freddie plays well through out and Ritchie is very impressive on Star Eyes and Lover Man. Stella by Starlight is a feature for the trombonist. Not bad for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"You and Your Hearing Impaired Child","review":"This book is a good resource for parents of hearing inpaired children. It covers everything from initial reaction after diagnosis to how to cope with these feelings. It also details normal development and how hearing impairment can affect behavior. There is a great section on how to deal with some of these special behavior problems. I recommend this book to parents or anyone who is involved with a young or early school age hearing impaired child."},{"rating":"1","title":"want a lively seder? don't use this book","review":"we agree with cantor epstein... this book is too scholarly, looong, and boring. we will have to potske online to find some interesting songs, stories and things to add to our seder. if you want a rabbinical thesis, this is the book for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off with a collection of interesting haggadot","review":"I hate to put out a negative review on something others seem to get so much out of, but I am disappointed in this book. First it makes the assumption that a traditional seder is boring; then it suggests more readings and long texts which seem to only serve to make for a longer and duller seder.I collect haggadot and use passages and activities from different ones each year. I'd suggest looking through any selection of haggadot for new perspectives and commentary rather than tackling the uninspiring passages presented her"},{"rating":"2","title":"One drop only","review":"Someone sitting next to me at a tacqueria doused their taco with this stuff, just like regular piquante, took a bite, and then paid the price for the next twenty minutes. Learning from his misfortune, I took a few tinefulls (on the tip of a fork) on my taco . . . not even a full drop as recommended. Just the perfect amount. Two hours later, I still feel a nice lingering heat.As for flavor, I think serranos have a better flavor, but this wasn't bad. I definitely would put a very very small on any food where I wanted that perfect amount of \\"burn\\".You also may notice that only people from Texas and California have written reviews.

I have written all the others in this series, and although I liked them while I was reading them, I now dislike them. I find the main character to be extremely selfish and inconsiderate of others.

I am a young adult librarian, and recommend Meg Cabot's books to all my patrons, young and old. I also buy copies of the books for myself. Mia is such a wonderful role model for young women! I remember in Princess in the Spotlight, Mia wrote about how family was more important than boys. I was thrilled to find a young adult heorine with morals, values, and humor. In Meg Cabot's newest book, Princess in Waiting, Mia is...well, horrid.She once writes that she loves Michael more than she loves her mom. Mia would never write something like that! She also said numerous times how much she loved being bossed around by Michael.I wonder if Meg Cabot had a ghost writer write this book. Mia was flawed and annoying, and none of Cabot's trademark humor was present.

The first two were enjoyable, the third was okay, but this one is just plain TERRIBLE!! The entire length of the novel, Mia is worried about her relationship with Michael and keeping him. She thinks he is a selfish boy who will dump her for reasons such as forgetting his birthday and cancelling a date. Throw in the added bits about her being a talentless student in the Gifted and talented program and you've got a 225 page long pity party. All she does in this volume is whine about boys and trivial matters. I know she's only 14, but that is NOT what was on my mind when I was 14. I'm going to give the fifth one a shot, but Meg Cbot's wiriting needs to improve, or I might not read past it."},{"rating":"1","title":"meg cabot falls flat in \\"waiting\\"","review":"I am a loyal Meg Cabot reader, so naturally I was anxious to get my hands on this chapter of princess mia's diary, but was to say the least, disapointed. The 4th book in this seris, falls flat of all the humor and adventure in the past three. Instead you get to read 120 pages of Mia mooning over Michael, and trying to call him on a palace phone. The most adventurous this to happen in this book is when she worries that Michael has fallen in love with a surfer. Though it does have the ring of mia's writing, which is almost always a joy to read, and was the only thing to keep me from giving this book more then one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Princess in Whining","review":"A disgrace to the previous \\"Princess\\" books, this is possibly the worst of them all. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the previous novels in this series, eager for the next. I was drinking these books up as though I'd just ran miles. But this book I almost literally snored through. Mia was turned from a funny, clumsy princess into a whining brat. All she worried about in this book was whether her dream boy was truly \\"in love\\" with her or not. Hey, she was his girlfriend -- what more can you ask for? In Mia Thermopolis' eyes, plenty. She just can't get enough. I thought she got over complaining about her princess lessons -- my mistake. She's also an ungrateful little snob -- her boyfriend, Michael, is so sweet and always doing such nice things for her, like coming into Algebra to say hi to her every morning even though he rode with her to school, and dedicating songs to her. And I've noticed that not once does she repay him. Mia is just a bad character to mess with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously lacking","review":"I love The Princess Diaries, but this book was a major dissapointment to me. PD1 was fabulous, PD2 was just as fabulous, and PD3 was incredible... but PD4 was just awful. What happened? The plot was so weak, drawn out, and boring (especially during the first 70 or so pages, when Mia is in Genovia) and Mia seemed to turn into a whiny, boy crazy little twit. She was not the same Mia who I loved to read about so much.I am pleased with Meg Cabot restoring my faith in Mia in Princess in Pink though. Its not as good as the first three, but close."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of meg Cabot's worst!","review":"I just got finished reading this book, and I despised it! The other three were OK, but this one was simply awful! In this book, Mia is inconsiderate and incredibly selfish! She acts like all the girls she hates in the other books! Plus, all she does the whole book is worry if Michael's going to dump her(when you can totally tell he isn't)!This book doesn't hold the reader(I only finished it to see if her stupidity endded). I have to say that this was one of Meg Cabot's worst books and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE and utter disappointment.","review":"This book is revolting! It has neither the spunk or sparkle that was shown in Princess in Love or the original the Princess Diaries.

More brain candy! Well, once I got it, I was extreamly disappointed. Mia rambles on and on about how much she misses michale, and on and on about the same four topics. BORING! I couldn't finish it because the plot wasn't going anywhere, and it was mostly rambling. I wouldn't suggust this book to anyone, but I have and will continue to reccomend the other books in the series to others. Will I continue to read the series? Only if Cabot hooks the reader within the first fifty pages, which Princess in Waiting certianly did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"PD 4- good but not great","review":"I am a huge fan of Meg cabot and love all of her works. i thought PD 4 was pretty good. the first 80 pages were extremely uneventful. when she returned from Genovia, the book started to get interesting. Mia is a bit ridiculous in this book- making up reasons for michael to dump her. i thought that only the end was good. the rest of the book was alright. i just dont know where meg went wrong... this book came second in my princess diaries rankings:1st- PD 32nd: PD 43rd: PD 24TH: PD 1this book did not compare to book 3, but came close with book 2. it's definetly worth reading but will put your mia spirits down compared to PD 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mia is starting to get on my nerves.","review":"I like the series, I really do but Mia is ridiculous and doesn't seem to be changing at all. She's a princess and yet doesn't seem to understand what that means for her and her future. She's insecure to a fault and it's the level of her insecurities that are beginning to bug me. She always needs reassurance and feels she has to exlain herself seven ways to Sunday and just doesn't seem to get it.....she's normal!!! Hello!!! I just wish her friend, Lili would slap some sense into her. All I know is, if I were a citizen of Genovia and this is what was coming to rule, I'd be afraid. Very afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"This book , much unlike the previous three in the series, was an extreme disappointment. It sounds like my friends when they are hyper-venting about their boyfriends. As if I don't already get enough of that.

I was sorlry dissapointed. Instead of Mia's trademark humor or sarcasm, she's become self involved and doesn't care about others.The first part of the book tells about Mia in Genovia, where she has all this stuff to do, and goes on about how all she wants is to see Micheal. (Prince Renee, Mia's cousin is one of the only ups in this book).When she gets back to New York, she decieds she doesn't want to \\"chase after\\" Micheal, so she basically is realyl mean to him and doesn't return his calls. Then she spends 50 pages worrying about the fact that Micheal might dump her.Yuck. Mia is self involved, worring, and a brat. Don'y let this stop you from readign the first three, but PLEASE stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Princess in waiting","review":"The book was good it told alot about princess Mia she was a princess of Ginovia she did not know she was a princess at first until her grandmother came and told her and took her on a journy to become a princess and she tryed her best and she did great."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Does Michael Love Me?\\" and yada yada yada","review":"I've read all of the PD books so far (anticipating the 6th due late March 2005), but this one was definately a dud. It's plot fell flat, consisting mostly of Mia's insecurities and constant moaning. Teenagers moan and groan and whine, YES, but this was down-right ANNOYING. She is in Genovia for the holidays and each journal entry is a count down to the last or next contact she will have with Michael. I can barely remember what happened because really, nothing seemed to happen during the course of this book. It's a blur to me, and I'm not willing to try to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"how fast can I pitch this into the trash?","review":"Like practically everyone on this, I loved the first three books in this series.

I'm really disappointed in Meg Cabot's writing, especially in the fifth book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"While not as good as Princessin Love, Princesss in Waiting, the forth volume in the Princess Diaries series, was still very good. It was funny and sweet, although the constant questioning of how to act in regards to Michael started to get a little annoying at the end. I love the fact that Mia loves the movie Empire Records, one of the best films of all time. Overall, the story was really nice and I can't wait for a volume five."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ONE YET!","review":"I know, a lot of you will say Princess In Love is the best one, but you people who haven't read all of the Princess Diaries books, start now and finish them quickly so you can get to Princess in Waiting. Princess in Love took me about a month to read, only because I wasn't into the plot. But the last parts of the book were worth it. Still, Princess in Waiting is a lot better. She describes her trip to Genovia and it is hilarious. The ending of the book is phenomenal. I won't tell you too much but it has to do with her and Michael. I would rate this 10 stars if I could. This is definately a book you won't be able to tear yourself apart from."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was good","review":"I am a huge fan of the princess diary series. I read the first book two days after it was released and then was hooked. This book brings Micheal and Mia together but apart for a portion of the book.

I recommend reading ALL the books first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book","review":"Okay, i admit, i read it in about 1/2 an hour cause it wasn't too mind-taxing & when i was finished reading i forgot it.

I don't know how this sort of this works, but my only guess is that is has to do with this fan not having a third wire. After a couple years, the fan got noisy which required the occasional oiling.

If your a budding artist this book will show what is essential in making a picture. Wyeth came closer to PYle ideas then Harvey Dunn..not to take anything from Mr. Dunn who was a genius himself, but Wyeth makes living things in pictures like Pyle taught to do. Not like today where its really rare to find any artist work in this mind set and make us feel something when observing. The book also contains so much info on Wyeth himself during his year with Pyle, a plethora from many events in his life. It's a nice large book with stock glossy paper.

Isaiah 53, for example, is said to speak of a subject who is compared to an unnoticed, ordinary tree in a forest, to a piece of junk in a junk heap in a bad section of a city (or something to that effect), etc.Perhaps this book is of value for other purposes; I cannot think of what they might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"For the price of this set, everyone should buy one.

Nancy may have been mentally ill and a difficult child to raise, but it does show that her parents always loved her unconditionally and did try to understand her (even though that was not always possible).It's sad that she has become a pop icon of sorts, best known for having been stabbed to death in the Chelsea Hotel, and not known for the insight and ideals that were uniquely Nancy's, but Mrs. Spungen does bring many of those qualities to light to show that yep, Nancy was a real person with a real life and real problems and occasional triumphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!!","review":"Amazing book!

I was in college, studying Psychology when I got this book and I tell everyone I know who's studying it too, to read this.

My main problem with it was the many inaccuracies relating to the Pistols, the music industry and England in 1977.

If she can't get simple things like John Lydons name correct then what other mistakes has her memory made?I have read a review from a friend of Nancy's implying that this book was written to resolve the Mother of any blame and was rather guilt ridden.

It goes in depth on Nancy's childhood, and how painful it was for her growing up. She was always on; painkillers and medicines created to make her calm. However, they never fully seemed to work, and whenever her mother had called the pediatrician all he would tell her was to double her perscription. Which was indeed very wrong. Also, the only reason she most likely did heroin and acid, was because she had been on so many drugs before growing up as a child, that that was her idea of medication. Therefore, causing her to get addicted. I would suggest anyone who is interested in Nancy Spungen's life or having a troubled family member such as Nancy, to read this book. It will fascinate you.

Nancys heroin abuse was only a result of her being on pain killers, sedatives, tranquelizers since she was young, it was only natural that she begin using heroin to self medicate herself.. as the pain grew more and more unbearable...

I'm glad I read this, it makes me appreciate my daughter even more. I'm glad that Mrs. Spungen had the courage to write this. I think everyone should read this BEFORE they have children. If you are a parent READ THIS BOOK!!! If you judge people without knowing who they truly are READ THIS BOOK!!!This is one of the BEST books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it again for the third time. . .","review":"And I cried this time also. It is a pain that I understand as I too have a child like Nancy. And like the Spungens, I have another child who has it all together. Something happened right there in those first moments of life and here we are 30 years later with a grown woman who still kicks,screams and cries like an infant. No amount of love, attention, money or therapy is enough. Nancy Spungen's horrible death is my nightmare. Deborah Spungen's fear and pain are my reality. What an amazingly honest story of ordinary people up against something so much bigger than themselves. This book will make you go back in for a second good-night kiss from your children. This book will make you count your many blessings. Thank you for that, Deborah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, could not put it down","review":"Not only is about a mother grieving for her murdered child, it also tells the story of a parents struggle with a mentally ill child. Her murder and the time Nancy was involved with Sid Vicsious were just a blip on the screen of a complicated and tragic life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Book; Everyone Should Read It","review":"This is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. Its simple structure makes it a quick but magnificent read as it instantly sucks you into the story of Nancy Spungen's life and death. The book is written in the first person from the perspective of her mother, Deborah Spungen, who succeeds in making the pain of her family exceptionally palpable as she describes her struggle to raise an emotionally and mentally unstable child, who one day came to be both loved and, ironically, murdered by rock and roll star, Sid Vicious. The book provides not only an amazing reading experience, but also a unique empathy towards parents of murdered children and a profound explanation of unconditional love towards children. Because it is so accurate and easy to relate to, I think everybody can get something worthwhile out of this book and should, therefore, read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb book - don't judge Sid & Nancy until you read it!","review":"I'm surprised to see so many recent reviews of this book - I first read it about 10 years ago and loaned it to a friend. She never returned it and I have never been able to replace it as it is extremely difficult to find. Some people in the reviews below are saying Nancy's condition was a result of her mother's treatment. I believe, having read this book so many times, something must be done to change these views - doctors can't go on for ever saying a child is normal when it obviously isn't. Deborah has highlighted in a very moving and emotional book the plight of many families trying to cope with their \\"normal\\" children. Sid & Nancy were both very misunderstood individuals who found solace with each other and one understood the other. Read this book, please - and keep a box of tissues nearby as I guarantee you will be crying from about halfway through right to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"True story of mental ilness","review":"This book about a very disturbed girl and the pressure and toils on her family is very interesting.It is also extremly sad because there is no cure for the girl and as the tittle lets you know,she eventually dies.Murdered by an equaly disturbed boyfriend and member of the Sex Pistols.I recomend this book especially for schizophrenec awareness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I'm glad this book is back in print. I've read it around five times, and each time I cry and feel for the Spungens. I'm a fan of punk music and always believed Nancy to be what the media portrayed her as, but after reading this not only did I change my opinion of her, I felt tremendous compassion for Nancy. But this book is not only for punk fans, it's useful for anyone who has a son, daughter, friend, etc, that are unstable emotionally since childhood, and to question what doctors say. It must be very hard as a mother to recognize that your own daughter would be better off dead, because Nancy wanted to die since she was a child. What else can I say? READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I read this book when I was fifteen. It was at the time I first started listening to the Sex Pistols. This book moved me. It provided inspiration that no matter what was happening in my life at that moment - I wasn't the only one. This book takes you through the life of a girl who was having trouble just being her and ends with the results of a self-destructive life"},{"rating":"2","title":"heart-wrenching-but a must read","review":"I have been going back to this book since I was sixteen years old-quite a while ago. Deborah does a wonderful job of putting those \\"Nauseating Nancy\\" myths to rest and showing Nancy for what she was....a emotionally disturbed young girl desperate for acceptance and escape from her pain.It takes an extraordinarily strong mother to be able to write what Deborah has....kudos to you. Congrats to Susan for her wonderful position at Martha Stewart Living!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful from first listen!","review":"I first and last heard Beth Scalet playing live in Kansas City back in 1975. She was great then, and I always remembered that night. I was going through a divorce, and it seemed like every song related to my struggles and desire for personal growth. I haven't heard her sing since until I happened upon this CD and decided to see if she was good as I remembered. WOW -- she is even better. And her songs are very real -- about feelings and relationships and coping mechanisms. This won't be the last CD I buy of this artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very flattering, and bring so many compliments!","review":"I get more compliments on these earrings than on any others I wear. The quality is very nice for the price, and the slightly vertically-elongated shape is very flattering. The size is wonderful; they are called \\"large\\" but I don't find them overly large at all, and would actually call them a very moderate size for a pair of fashion earrings. I have two other styles of Celtic knot earrings, both more round in shape and somewhat smaller, but I reach for this pair when I am feeling a little more dressy and feminine than just 'everyday'. I think anyone will really enjoy these! I'm ordering a second pair, just in case I lose the first, somehow--that's how much I treasure them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My every day earrings","review":"The earrings are very nice. I wear them nearly every day - after close to six months, there's still no real wear and tear on them. I personally find them a little bit short, but that's my own taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for anyone","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a very captivting story. I thought that it was going to be a very perdictable ending, but it turns out that is wasn't. Some parts of the book did drag a bit, especially during the trial when all of the doctors gave their testamony. I would recommend it to anyone. It is very interesting and thrilling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book Grisham has ever written","review":"What was John Grisham thinking when he wrote this book? I expect so much from his books. I have devoured every single book of his that I've read and *then* gone and seen the movie. Not on this one. I was so utterly disappointed. I don't understand why he wrote it and why it was so dull that I could never *get* past Chapter Three. Part of the problem for me was the intricate detail. I did *not* need to know every little detail of every characters life. I kept waiting for the book to pick up but after 70 someodd pages, I gave up and quit. And I do not quit very often. This is the *only* book of his that I have not finished. I hope he doesn't write another one like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!!","review":"This is not one of Grisham's best. The story was long in the tooth and did not really go anywhere. I found it hard to stay focused on the plot and could not relate to any of the major characters. In short...P. U.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G; trust me; pretentious, surreal garbage drama","review":"The book starts out quick, right? Yeah, and it runs along kind of quickly except some of it starts sounding like switching back and forth from a documentary on the Tobacco Industry to a pretentious, incredulous thriller. The way Nicholas Easter controls the jurors is like a \\"scenes we'd like to see\\" scenario from Mad magazine. The book is also very predictable from the beginning, and the only thing that holds you through to the end is the anticipation of Fitch's reaction, which is not worth unveiling. Not worth the time or the money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One juror couldn't have that much influence!","review":"I bought this book at the airport for a 3.5 hour flight. The first part of the book was typical Grisham, but as the main juror started influencing or fooling every other character in the book, I felt compelled to continue only because I invested the $7. Each chapter with Nicolas spying for the judge, sabbotaging other jurors, manipulating the tobacco big wigs...just did not buy it. The other constant that shows up here that is Grisham's formula ending was the two conspirers getting the money, and meeting up in some exotic destination away from the US. Grisham has got to put more thought into his endings. Until then, I will not buy another Grisham novel until I read the reviews on this webpage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing, Predictable, and Judgemental","review":"A story based upon one individual dictating to the judge, the lawyers, and the fellow jurors was not a plausible one even with our fallible judicial system. Grisham is making a strong political statement with this book at the expense of literary acumen. It was just not believable....all this investigative money and they don't know Marlee and Easter are having conjugal visits??? C'mon....you have to be awfully gullible to digest this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, poor finish.","review":"He needs to go back and start practicing law rather thanwriting about it, maybe that will get him some experience and bringsome life into his stories. \\"A Time to Kill\\" was his best and written from the heart, \\"The Firm\\" was a real thriller (the movie wasn't), since these two books he's become redundent with his plots. His endings can be anticipated. It's difficult to believe that all Fortune 500 companies are out to \\"pray on the little man.\\" He needs to get back to his \\"roots\\" and quit trying to entertain Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the Movies, Make Better Book??","review":"Maybe Hollywood should stop turning John Grisham's books intomovies so that he can really concentrate on writing a book asexcellent as \\"A Time to Kill\\". All the books after that has the same plot, same kind of character, nearly the same setting. And this book is no better than The Firm, Pelican Brief etc.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"As a first time reader of any John Grisham work, I must say that I was impressed, yet dissapointed; let me explain. This book was very easy to follow, the characters were developed well, I finished this book in three days (during the hustle and bustle of Christmas) because the plot building was so wonderful. One night during reading, I had to MAKE myself go to sleep after being so engrossed in the book, found that it was 3:30 in the morning! Get ready to drop everything and read! The only reason why I give this book four instead of five stars was that I believe that Mr. Grisham should have been a little more creative with the ending. While I was reading, my predictions of the ending were more creative than the actual ending, which is where my dissapointment lies. This book however, is well worth the time it takes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun-to-read Grisham novel...","review":"This book was exactly what Grisham fans expect...an enjoyable, well-paced, relatively easy-to-read story.The early sections of the book do a nice job of introducing main characters...in this case by slowly revealing hints about their past. The middle section goes into detail of the trial's progress, taking along a bit of a puzzle about its outcome... not a baffling mystery, but enough to keep you guessing. The later sections to the end keep things moving well, with a satisfying ending.I recently read \\"A Painted House\\" by Grisham and rated in a 4-star book. In retrospect I'd probably downgrade that, giving this one a four instead. It was a much more interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I this book was a real eye opener about our legal system.","review":"I found this book to be one of John Grisham's best books.It really puts emphasis on areas of the law and trials that wedon't think about. It shows how high priced lawyers and juryconsultants spend a lot of time to pick the \\"right \\" jury fortheir side. The story kept me interested all the way throught hebook and i was disappointed went it ended. I thought itwas a good reminder for us that money does buy a good defensewith some good lawyers and how the tobacco industry cantake such a powerful position in a case"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the Jury, Runaway from this junk","review":"Grisham's first two novels were spellbinding - readable, energetic, and just plain good. Everything since has been on a downhill slide.The book just doesn't have it.Characters are just ho-hum. If you have to read this, make a trip to the used book store and trade. Not worth the price by any stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham's worst book yet","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books and The Runaway Jury is the worst which I have read. This book is too verbose, it dwells too long in unimportant issues and there are little suspense. The ending is 'unbelieveable', just to say the least"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's deceiving who in this story? Just about everybody...","review":"A fast-paced and clever tale of deceipt, on every level. The tobacco companies are being sued, but - so far - have not lost a case. And they will do everything possible to keep it that way, be it bribery, jury tampering or murder. In the current trial, they just can't seem to put a finger on one particular juror. He appears to be a nobody, but his past doesn't quite add up. And his knowledge of court proceedings and the law in general is becoming uncomfortably apparent. Who's deceiving who in this story? Well, just about everybody. But who's really got the upper hand of the situation? Well, just keep reading! All of this makes for a great page-turner, even if the ending becomes somewhat predictable. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No likeable characters; \\"twist\\" ending visible from halfway","review":"The best thing about this book: pages and pages of legal issues at the heart of tobacco litigation. But -- I got an even clearer picture in a 3 page article in Barron's.The worst thing: the protagonists aren't likeable, and don't struggle. In fact, they endure not a single set-back through the course of the book.

So, I approached it with some hesitation. But, in truth, I found the book to be one of Grisham's better works. The characters are a bit cardboard-like, but the action is fast, the plot takes several twists and the prose is well written. The ending may be reminiscent of \\"The Firm\\", but it is still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book had a profound effect on me from the first chapter","review":"I wanted to talk to Grisham or a judge or an attorney and find out how realistic this story was because it was scary!

If so, there is something seriously wrong in this country and I hope that this is book is read by every attorney, judge and legislator in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!!","review":"This book was awesome!

Bad fiction at that"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Gift Idea","review":"This book was a gift to a discerning reader, I have never read the book, though from the response it got I may. The actual reader was almost effervescent in her praise of a fascinating and often riveting story of science and technology once more run amuck. In this case, the sciences governing human behavior, (both as individuals and within groups) are manipulated to affect the judicial process. Apparently, there is the underlying reality is that in cases with rich enough plaintiff or defendants juries can be custom designed, assembled and then influenced to render the \\"correct\\" verdict legally. In this instance, there are just the right kinds of heroes doing their best to cause havoc for the bad guys. Of course, the bad guys react less than charitably and so there it is.A well received gift, I completely recommend. (That's it, on third thought I will ask her for the loan it this week.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Litigation","review":"I'll bet that half of this book was courtroom litigation, and this was not interesting to me. I enjoyed the jury scheming and the personalities on the jury, but I didn't read the testimony and began to skip over ALL of it once I realized just how tedious it was going to be. Why did I do that?!? Because everyone knows that nicotine is addictive and that it kills. Did we need more than 150 pages to tell us that?? In fact, I got the gist of the ending, without spending all that time in the actual courtroom.. So, was it all necessary to the book? I don't think so.I'm not saying for some that this book would not be an interest, but I'm more attracted to human relationships and not all these lawyers and repetitious testimony.. Jeez, turn on FOX or MSNBC right now and you'll get more real-life litigation than you'll ever need to see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"In reading the previous reviews raving about how good this was, it's hard to believe we're talking about the same book.

I never liked \\"The Firm\\", and friends kept recommending other Grisham books as the best one he's written (\\"The Pelican Brief, \\"A Time to Kill\\", \\"The Rainmaker\\" etc.) As a result I've read all but the latest 2, but I am sure they are just like the rest; tedious, predictable, implausible, and if any of these students or lawyers were real they would have all been kept from joining the bar or if already practicing, disbarred. Somehow these books manage to further the image of the lawyer as a bottom feeder, even when they seem to be saving us from a worse fate (tobacco companies, insurance companies or assasination attempts on justices). At least this one was entertaining.

The way Nicolas make the jury turn may be a bit far fetched, but who cares. I don't read Grisham's novels to get something to think about. Then you should read Shakespeare or something. When you read Grisham you should expect entertainment and that is what you really get in The Runaway Jury. I enjoyed this book immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runaway Hit!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding his re-use of this plot.I am sure, he would have sued anyone else who wrote this book for plagerism.Also, as an attorney, Grisham knows that all these shannigans that were pulled by his characters would have been caught and stopped.

The characters were not well developed. Although the author tried to give us insight into each and every juror's psyche, I couldn't tell what made them tick. I also found it hard to keep track of these people in my mind as I read: 12 jurors, 3 extras, countless lawyers on each side and even more outside parties working undercover for the lawyers.The best aspect of the novel was the thorough and elaborate description of the effects of smoking and tobacco companies themselves.The book was a fast read, but certainly not a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping insight into jury politics which will keep you awak","review":"Ever served on a jury?

While it is a decent book, it is a tad on the boring side. Some of the characters' names are weird and awkward to pronounce (\\"Durr\\" Cable and Nicholas Easter). This adds a certain degree of difficulty to getting through the book in less than 7 or 8 days and the characters are about as dull as their names. The story of the \\"biggest\\" tobacco trial in history lacks the drama that would be implied, is a bit far-fetched and is sort of anti-climactic. I didn't find myself really caring one way or the other about which side would come out victorious.Luckily, this book is still good enough that it hasn't turned me off of continuing my self-introduction to Grisham. Perhaps \\"A Time To Kill\\" was a bit easier and more enjoyable having been familiar with the movie. I give \\"Runaway Jury\\" 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Runaway Jury","review":"Out of all the John Grisham books I have read, The Runaway Jury was my favorite.

I had given up on Grisham after a disappointing last read, but this one redeemed his writing in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Grisham has created a novel full of cynicism and his usual dose of unsavory lawyers.

So the net effect of the book is that I cared about no one, not even the \\"good guys\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Runaway Brain","review":"(Note: This review refers to the audio version) This is a pretty silly story that becomes increasingly unconvincing as it goes along. Although one doesn't turn to Grisham for hard-nosed realism, this tale was especially far-fetched and seemed like something he dreamed up while sitting on the can at his publisher's office. As unfortunate as the story is, it's made worse by Michael Beck's reading. His version of a Southern accent sounds at times like a bad impersonation of an English butler. For a far better and more compelling listen involving lawsuits against sinister corporations, check out the audio of Jonathan Harr's \\"A Civil Action\\". It's gripping...and true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Detailed","review":"I have read other Grisham books, and I feel they are all the same.

It's just the jury, with all those lovely lawyer/judge spats cut out.The absense of the \\"genius boy\\" lawyer in this novel makes it rather refreshing. The main characters are a woman trying to get ungodly amounts of money and a jury-rigging bad guy. It's no wonder that there has been such opposition to the context of the story when Grisham's signature character isn't there.Grisham's work is incredibly similar to Tarantino movies. He usually jumps around and tries to confuse you just to make the ending better and more shocking. This novel's plot is a little thin though. It's not nearly as deliberate and calculating as his former works, which makes it seem too unnessarily jumpy and belittles the new attempts at characters. For what it's worth, it's interesting, but much more predictable than his previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"The reason I read this book was because of the name \\"Grisham\\", and slowly I started to lose interest as the plot began to develop.THE RUNAWAY JURY is nothing compared to THE FIRM or THE RAINMAKER.All I can say is : This is Grisham's worst book.

What a complete waste of money and my time !!For all of you who haven't read the book yet, don't even bother about it. Just read till Chapter 3, then jump to the last chapter, and you'll still get the gist of the story.Grisham did not flesh out the characters fully, and it's very difficult to sympathise with Marlee or any other characters.This book completely turns me off from trying any of his other books!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Grisham still writing his own books?","review":"You can count on Grisham to be entertaining and a quick read, which this was for the most part. Beyond that, he must consider his readers as moronic as the people on \\"The Runaway Jury\\" to find any credibility in this story. It was better than sappy Bleachers or Skipping Christmas but my respect for Grisham's writing has taken a dive. He's always going to the edge of what can be believed and his characters tend to be stereotypes, but Grisham has lost respect for his readers to put out something like this. I've read everything he's written and this is my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the genre","review":"Successful fiction depends on a modicum of suspension of disbelief. Nothing in Runaway Jury rings true--it could never happen folks, even with a judge as bad as the presiding judge in Grisham's trial. Worse than that, the book has _no_ plot to speak of, and no likable characters--they are all crooks. Grisham's premise appears to be that two wrongs (greed and dishonesty on both sides) make a right--perhaps, sometimes. But, certainly, three wrongs (a badly written book)implodes in an incredible waste of time. I kept reading, hoping that something would happen. Nothing did, other than the cute and sticky moral at the end. Ugh----Interested in good books of this genre, try Turow, Barbara Parker, Robert Daley, Robert Tannenbaum, etc. Grisham comes up with snake-eyes too often for me (The Chamber was another bad polemic)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grisham's Best","review":"Grisham manages to score a real winner with his work, \\"The Runaway Jury\\". In a nut shell, he manages to write an entertaining fiction about the politics and law surrounding one of the largest, if not the largest, health issues of the modern age. Through carefully constucted characters, the sides of the debate are cast in shades of grey rather then ideal morality or immorality. It is a real page turner, and is thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least interesting of all Grisham's books","review":"Grisham often has heroes who have so carefully crafted their battles against their enemies that the pleasure comes not from seeing who will win, but in watching the hero's scheme unwind. We marvel at their cleverness (THE PARTNER) or snicker at the way they take on and destroy richer, smarter, larger law firms (THE RAINMAKER).However, in RUNAWAY JURY, this device truly saps almost all the drama from the story. We never doubt the outcome for one second, nor are the machinations particularly compelling or believable. All Grisham's books require heavy suspension of disbelief, but this book does not achieve that goal. I finished the book, but only in the hopes of a twist or something at the end. No such luck.Put this one at the bottom of your Grisham reading list...and if you've never tried Grisham, stay away from this one...you won't want to read any more, and then you'll deprive yourself of entertaining reads such as THE PARTNER, THE CHAMBER, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"As unbelievable as \\"The Firm\\" and just as poorly written.","review":"I am a great John Grisham fan, but NO ONE IN HIS RIGHT MIND WOULD BELIEVE THIS DRIVLE!

The plot of jury manipulation in a multimillion dollar suit against the tobacco industry kept me turning the pages. I travel a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed reading the novel on plane trips. Grisham manages to keep the interest level high throughout as the reader wonders what Nicholas and this Marlee character are up. Who are they really? What's their angle? Grisham does a great job of developing characters and creating subplots that make the overall plot all the more interesting. The ending was quite creative and leaves one thinking the justice system hasn't seen the last of Nicholas and Marlee (or whatever names they assume in the future) in future tobacco suits. I can't wait to read his next novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"No characters to root for","review":"This book is seriously flawed. The reader of a novel usually likes to identify with, or at least root for, a character he deems likable. In \\"The Runaway Jury,\\" Mr. Grisham makes it extremely difficult for his readers to do this. One cannot honestly admire either of the protagonists, Marlee or Nicholas, for all the shenanigans they pull with their lying and cheating as they seek revenge on the tobacco industry. For this reason alone, I give this book a thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall - Great Book","review":"Overall it was a great book, I couldn't wait to keep getting back to it.

Backed by an intricate plot and sub-plots and by detailed and historied characters, it kept me up many a night striving to reach the end. But alas Grisham's longwindedness got the better of him. It seems that often times Grisham writes for the sake of writing and does not actually read some of the ridiculously unnecessary events he puts into print.

This current-events novel is slow paced for much of the first 400 pages, but the detail creates a building that is necessary for such a complex topic. Some will read this as a guise for displaying an anti-tobacco tome, but a closer look will demonstrate a balance that is rarely achieved even in non-fiction works. Even the good guys aren't so good. Grisham can do better, and he should. His talent is broad AND deep --- he should take his time to produce a richer and more innovative set of stories within the story. All-in-all this production still places him in the elite of contemporary writers. He set a high standard with his previous works --- it's up to him to meet the mark each time out.l"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.

Now I'm not usually a New Age guy but as I continued listening I was hooked. So hooked I bought it before I left! It's one of those special CD's that are good from start to finish. Yes, it's classified as New Age, but it's a CD that EVERY Smooth Jazz lover would love and really should have. In fact in my opinion it's closer to Smooth Jazz than the New Age genre of music. Perhaps the best thing I can say is this: I have well over 600 CD's and if I had to narrow it down to only 25 or even 10, this would be one of the few I'd be keeping.

The evidence is showing that girls who are raised by men are far less likelly to be overly emotional. They have a much higher level(and healthier) level of competitiveness. They are also less likely to nag their partners as adults.Of course, Drexler does not minimize the importance of having female role models available for girls in single male households.

After raising a boy along with a good Father, I can clearly see the importance of both parents and the mix of views, aspirations, drive, and sensebilities that they each have to offer. This book advocates more simply that we should raise men to be more like women and if we manage to accomplish this we are all clearly in big trouble.[...]I guess Drexler liked the sound bite approach to two parents in society:Deadbeat DadsMaverick Moms.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy research","review":"Drexler seems to forget that anecdotal evidence cannot be used to justify the type of claims she's making in this book, which is riddled with biased sample and hasty generalization fallacies.

I heard Dr. Drexler speak last summer, which motivated me to buy and read this excellant book.If i had read only the negative reviews at Amazon I would have had a most distorted notion about the book and about Dr. Drexler. The proof is in the pudding--anyone who reads the book will learn important things about our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congratulations, Peggy Drexler","review":"This book offers terrific insight into raising sons by non-traditional families. Hurray for Dr. Drexler, who did not shy away from the truth, and gave us so much unbiased information. It is both inspiring and encouraging, and I believe anyone raising a son absolutely must read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous assumptions","review":"This is not research, this is opinion. Great she has a few examples including herself. How many mothers don't think there little angels are exceptional? In fact you would be hard pressed for most mothers of troubled kids by objective standards not to say that.Boys raised by single mothers as a group are STATISTICALLY worse off in almost every way. Truancy, drug use suicide, violent crime, drop out rate, mental health issues are a few that come to mind. Look it up for yourself. Oh and then look up girls raised by single mothers as well.This book is a disservice to society and a lie!This does not go to say a single male or female parent can't do a good job, but the odds are against those children when compared to intact / non-broken homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwash","review":"Absolute hogwash and drivel. The author projects her own unresolved issues with her father on to every case study and creates fantastic conclusions based on shoddy and inaccurate science"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinship systems vs. individuals","review":"Drexler is a trained psychologist, and therefore thinks of the family's role as turning out a well adjusted individual (empathetic, motivated, etc). But the issue of single-parent vs. nuclear family structure is more about multi-generational replication of kinship organization. It's about social architecture over the long run. And, not just about boys and men, but also girls and women. It's about giving meaningful roles to both sexes for childraising, sharing the energy burden, and social inclusion. Go into the prisons and juvenile detention centers, and do a survey of the family structure these inmates were raised under, Ms. Drexler. Ask about the pressure cooker of single parenting, and the lower ability of single parents to stave off drug addiction vs. parents with a committed partner. Then, crunch the data. You'll arrive at a different conclusion. Could be your next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite sure what to think about this","review":"My husband and I are raising our (adopted) son.I can only imagine what Ms Drexler would have tosay about raising a boy without women. For therecord, our son shows no signs of becomingmaladjusted, feral or sociopathic - nor has heexpressed any signs that he feels a lack offemale presence in his life.My husband expressed an interest in adopting agirl - imagine what people would have to say abouttwo men raising a daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another female author who likely hated her father","review":"This type focus has become too typical of many female authors.

A book for eunuchs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist Tripe","review":"Another \\"feel-good\\" book directed at lesbians who insist fathers aren't necessary in the raising of boys. They are SO WRONG. Unfortunately, their guinea pigs are the children. The author limits her samples to white, upper class lesbians and single mothers. To say her sample is skewed is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"an important book","review":"As a mother of three sons that I fortunately raise in partnership with my husband I wasn't convinced that this book would be relevant for me but I was wrong. Dr Drexler has written an easy to read and very useful book for every parent who is raising a son. Her research is essential for clarifying the important tasks of being a parent that helps our sons become exceptional men. Straight or gay all parents need Dr Drexler's findings. This is an important book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for kids","review":"My son received this as a gift...I probably wouldn't have chosen it off the shelf.

They all race to the library to grab that book! A must for any elementary grade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading for kids!!","review":"\\"Underwear\\"\\" is a fun read for emerging readers. I am a former Kindergarten teacher and used this book to teach the sound of the letter 'u' in a truly fun way for my students.

I received it in time for Christmas, but I can not give it as a gift because some of the pages are ripped, the print is off center, and some of the pages are stuck together. It's like Quality Control never looked this one over before it got shipped out.I don't know who to point fingers at on this one, but I am disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read aloud!","review":"My kindergartners love having this book read to them.

I recently purchased this book for my neice and nephews, so they too can enjoy the fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underwear by M E Monsell","review":"This is a short book that brings laughter to everyone! It is a great book to read aloud to a group or at bedtime. It is also good for beginning readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and True","review":"This book manages a goal rarely accomplished in the literary world, it is a YA novel that adults can also cherish. As a story of time-travel and telepathy it is a beautifully-done fantasy that feels as real and true as life-experience. As a love story it is suprisingly moving for such an unlikly pair as Juniper and Dylan. To this day it is one of my all-time favorite books, the kind I return to again and again and am always a little sad to finish. The story is pure magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as exciting as i thought!!","review":"I picked up this book from this book sale, and from the sound of it, it seemed pretty exciting. But once I started reading, it didn't sit well with me. ESP and medieval 'time travelling' is great and all that, but it didn't have the emotional aspect of it. The 'link' Juniper and Dylan shared weren't exaclty expressed properly. Overall, it wasn't what I was expecting. You may like it, but it wasn't my type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Kid's Book","review":"Is it an action-packed, edge-of-your-seat thriller? No. But it is a story of young love and learning to help each other through issues you can't control. If you are looking for a nice break from adult romance with a side order of time travel then this is the book for you.I'll definitely look for other books by Sherryl Jordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Redemption of Meaning.","review":"This is possibly the best book I've ever read. It starts out with basic stereotypical people : a strong minded, popular girl, and a quiet, artistic boy who is a nobody. But then Sherryl goes on, and shows people are deeper than what they look like and each has his own strengths. The plot is flowing and deep. Each scene is simply discribed, yet tantilizes the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old favorite","review":"This book is about a girl who partnered with a shy artist, uses thought to convey messages to him to draw what she sees, They end up going through time in a sorts, back to the time when woman were persecuted for being \\"witches\\" This book is a great read and i really enjoyed it. I picked it up when i was in middle school from the library (im going into college now) so my memory of it is a bit warped. But the title of the book and what it was mainly about has stuck with me for so long its in with my favorites, and if i ever come across it again i will be sure to pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny read","review":"This was a funny book about relationships. Everyone should be able to relate to this book at some point or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Reiser, and I loved Mad About You. This book is a funny, gentle, warm look at the little joys and problems of marriage. I am not even married and I was laughing out loud every page. It was a quick read, and it was the kind of humor I like best - the kind with a serious message underneath. Best of all, the book is as funny on a second reading as it is the first time. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but only 10% about couples and relationships","review":"I read this book thinking it would be about couples and the sometimes humorous ways they relate. Instead I got one sentence per chapter about a 'couple' issue and the rest of the chapter is about other life observations. It would have been much better if he just would have called it \\"Life Observations\\" - at least then I would know what I was in store for -- but maybe that would have been too Seinfeld.Another reviewer wrote this book was so great on audio - I'm sure it is because all it seems like are transcripts from stand-up routines. I suspect that may be how the book was written - that's why it has no flow.Anyway, I found it humorous in parts - but had to give it 2 stars because it had hardly anything to do with couples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illumination of the commonplace","review":"Paul Reiser's book \\"Couplehood\\" is a comically insightful work that examines the commonplace marital idiosyncracies that fill the lives of those involved with life's greatest adventure and most delightful puzzle- marriage. He manages to shed a humorous light on all the things that couples tend to get frustrated about with one another; and by doing this, he allows the reader sit back and laugh at the \\"problems\\" of marriage. Problems can be dealt with better when they can be laughed at afterwards. There is one statement in the book that chrystallizes the book's message, and it is a statement I challenge all married couples to take to heart: \\"Enjoy the small things in life, because the big things may never come.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny, \\"gentle\\" humor.","review":"With very few unfunny sections, this is a clever and often hilarous version of Paul's stand-up act. This can be considered gentle humor, in that there's nothing really remotely offensive about any of the bits. Even his wife is portrayed in an intensely loving fashion. I'm not really a fan of Mad About You, but this is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read.","review":"I love Paul Reiser, if he wasn't married I would love to marry him. It's a great book, it's realistic and everyone can relate. We've all been there, done that....That's the best comedy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best humor in such a serious manner.","review":"Paul Reiser's Couplehood is a great read. He shows to be not only a wonderful comedian but an excellent lover. His knowledge on Coupledom in the 90's is oustanding. Reiser gives examples in a comic way, of how to make love - while making love. This book shows how easy it is to create love and how easy it was to delude it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I pick this book up from time to time when I am too overwhelmed to pick up anything heavier, and just need a restful laugh. It always does the trick.Reiser's humor comes from toggling between all-too-real depictions of common relational insanity and exaggerated worst-case scenarios of the same. It's very easy to relate to, and thus the laughs just flow.But underpinning much of the humor is a relational paradigm mentioned more than once - that relationship in reality is nothing more than a constant change of who gets to take a turn being \\"selfish\\". From the way he talks about it, it seemed more than just a humorous opinion - which is unfortunate.You don't have to be a married couple to enjoy this book. If you've been in a relationship, wish you were in a relationship, or have been a friend to someone in a relationship, you'll find something to laugh at all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original","review":"Okay. We liked the book, we also liked the show. And unlike the Seinfeld book, it is not just a rehash of the show. Although it may not prepare you for the real thing, the book should set off a few alarm bells if you are considering that commitment. An enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Reiser is NOT funny.","review":"If there was an option for 0 stars, I'd put that down. Paul Reiser is not funny on Mad about You, he is not funny as a stand-up comedian, and he is certainly not funny in this story. The dog Murray on Mad about You is funnier than Paul."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amusing look at relationships","review":"This is a light, fluffy read. While it is funny, it really just brushes the surface of its subject matter and never tackles them at any great depth. In a way this is a shame, as relationships provide so many opportunities for stories. This book was clearly intended to take advantage of the success of Reiser's television show, but doesn't provide any additional insights or much in the way of new material. I enjoyed it as a distraction, but I'm glad I wasn't looking for anything thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one page out of the whole book is funny.","review":"Only one page out of the whole book is funny.

I have two relatively small air rifles with very low profile mounts. They don't even come close to both fitting. I don't even think I could get one scoped and one open sighted rifle in this case. For the money it is fine for one rifle but don't buy it to put two in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when it works","review":"If you can get this thing started, it works well.

For some reason it does not get any gas when it's cold, I have to pull them plug and inject some in there as well as prime the heck out of it.Should have gone with an electric, they don't clean quite as well, and I thought the cord would be a hassle. In reality the cord and hose is not much more problem then just the hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful little wonder","review":"Two years ago, I bought an electric washer (Karcher). It worked, but just didn't have any punch. The cord was a pain. When it died, I replaced it with the Clean Shot. What a difference! This thing comes with two wands. One is adjustable and is intended for everyday use. The other is called a \\"turbo\\" and is for tough jobs.

That's not even counting the glitches. Quite frequently me and my enemies disappeared completely. Twice a boss went underground and never came back up. And more times than I can count, when I got knocked down my character got stuck in the falling animation, meaning I did not hit the ground until I got hit again. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't underestimate this game...","review":"Don't believe all of those people who say that this game sucks. They, obviously, don't have a life. When I first played this game, I was immediately hooked. The graphics are amazing and gameplay is cool. One of the best things about this game is the \\"heavy blows\\" dealt to an opponent. When fighting a boss, depending on the scenery, you can hit him or her into the background. You can, also, do this to the foot soldiers throughout the game. The boss battles are the best battles in the game.The only things that I don't like about this game is the music and the absence of the Buu saga. When fighting a group of enemies, the music never \\"pumps you up\\" in order to get ready for battle. The Buu saga should really be on this game.

An eighteen wheeler, two horses, and two young girls. A tragically gruesome accident, and a changed horse. A mother who tries to heal the horse, herself, and her daughter. Her affair with Tom was predictable and only slightly intriguing. But the ending fell flat. What of the characters Grace and Robert? Are we to believe that they will be forever content while Annie spends her life doting on the product of her love affair? And what was the child's name anyway, TOM? Tom Booker, an almost- believable character, sacrificed himelf to the fiercely fighting stallion in a Madame Butterfly/Miss Saigon fashion. Oh, pu--lease!No, this novel did not work for me.

However, my interest and enjoyment in the story plummeted immediately after the romantic feelings of Booker and Annie were acted on. Not only did the storyline become offensive, but downright pathetic. Cliches that tried to justify the affair such as, living for the now, and, it had to happen/it was meant to happen, were not only unconvincing but infuriating. As for the ending, oh please! Everything falls apart. Tom's suicide was bad enough, but then Annie's \\"miraculous\\" pregnancy was enough to make me want to tear the book in two. Why Robert Redford, whom I admire as an actor and director, would choose this of all books to make into a film, is beyond me! Evans, in your next book, try to be a little less formulaic, predictable, and downright corny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adultery is not heroic.","review":"This book was an incredible let-down. Am I really supposed to believe that all this woman's internal struggles were laid (pardon the expression) to rest by cheating on her husband?! How is this a \\"love story\\"?!! The unsung hero of this story was the husband, who supported EVERYONE in his family unconditionally, and who was left out in the cold of NY while his wife romped around in Montana pursuing her own personal \\"healing\\".

Nothing ever happened. This book is not even good enough to sit on my bookshelf. My husband and I are having a ceremonial book burning of this book this weekend so that nobody else will suffer through it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This book started out with great promise and finished up with a horrible ending, glorifying adultery and senseless death.

I felt nothing for anyone (including the horse and I'm a horse lover!) and kept reading just in case there was something there. Actually, I read the book because I was sorely disappointed in the movie and gave the benefit of the doubt that the book should be better.

The idea is great...Girl and family override trauma and misery via horse and insightful horseman. Nice idea. Too bad the adulterous sex had to get in the way. It really had some potential. The bond between horse and rider can be a magical thing, but unfortunately the author chose to focus on what sells rather than what is meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degenerates from a promising start to a cheap ending","review":"The premise of this book is so fascinating that it is hard not to be swept up into it immediately. The glimpses into the sometimes brutal world of horse training and the kinder gentler alternatives are so interesting that it is too bad the author felt the need to introduce a tawdry and altogether unlikely romance into the mix. The idea that a woman who is so wrapped up with her daughter's needs would betray her for an idealized new-age Marlboro man is so beyond belief that it cheapens the rest of the author's work. Although the author tries to present the perfect hero, he merely betrays his own dearly held stereotypes of women and what (he thinks) they want out of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"tearjerker","review":"What a disappointment! I was very anxious to read the horsewhisperer and had high expectations, but nope. I found this novel a tearjerker with flat characters who obviously don't seem to have any motives.

He really took the easy way out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic story that won't let you go","review":"No one had ever heard of a horse whisperer before Evans wrote this book. On top of that, he brings us a story about four needy people in search of happiness, not to mention the horse. A really great, old fashioned story, the kind that is hard to put down, and that has real living people in it. Don't be mislead by the hard hearted jerks who give this book one or two stars. They are over-inflated intellectuals with no hearts. Buy this book and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine","review":"The clich�� is to write what you know. Evans should take this advice. Perhaps he could do a guide to edible mushrooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potentially great story with an insulting finale.","review":"A great read that draws you in heart & soul, until the unbelievable ending. It was an insult to the noble Tom Booker to finish him thus--it just did not fit, did not work, with the rest of the story. The book is greatly weakened by the ending and thus is a disappointment, despite the evocative, lucid writing and interesting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It's as if the author got tired, had a deadline to meet so chose the fastest, easiest and most predictable way to go. An insult to the reader. He must have already received the money for the movie rights before the book was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"A friend of mine recommended I read this book because she knows I am an avid reader. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down until I was done reading it. It was an excellent, gripping, emotional, and romantic story, as well as, a book which tugged at the \\"heart strings.\\" My mother, who does enjoy reading, thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The horse Whisperer is a book about soul, without the heart.","review":"Evans starts out the novel with a disaster that gave me nightmares for a week. As disturbing as it was, I liked it because it was real...not sugar coated. I read on and I continued to think it was a book of harsh realities and warm moments. It was a great beginning. Unfortunaltley the end left something to be desired. Evans became wrapped up in the affair that was taking place rather then keeping the story going. It fizzled out at the end. A great beginning deserves a much better ending, it almost felt as if Evans put less effort into the ending. I did not like the ending. I thought it rather ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, what's the deal with this book?","review":"Did anyone else who read this book think the ending was completely over the edge? Where was the motivation for that little scene???? One star only indicates that I actually finished it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trendy nonsense","review":"This story is extremely over rated. I felt nothing after reading it, except so what? Save your eyes and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I give this tripe a zero star rating?","review":"The worst book ever. Reading the fine print on Insurance documents is more satisfying. What offended me most was that the first two thirds of the book were quite enjoyable in a trashy sort of a way. The last third was downright offensive drivel. Laughable sex scenes, Mills & Boon style plot and dialogue and a total abandonment of character development. The miraculous recovery of both horse and girl were totally unbelievable and only dealt with in passing instead of being the main focus of the novel. Equally unbelievable was the regression of the mother from a strong female role model into a simpering moron at the sexual beck and call of a cowboy. Please! The fact that the girl overcame the trauma of ....... without batting an eyelid, when she wanted to kill herself in the recent past just added to the air of absurdity. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"Although I suppose it was worth sticking out this read to its fairly interesting ending, I felt cheated through the rest of the book. Highly predictable, way too mooshy, and quite obviously a freshman effort, The Horse Whisperer proves that the masses are easily amused. I normally try to give every book that is on the bestseller list the benefit of the doubt, but after this one I have no choice but to balk. While Evans does have a gift for storytelling, it seemed waAAYY too much like he was writing what he thought the public would like and not for the benefit of the intelligent. Short, repetitive sentences. X-rated love sequences where simple finesse would have succeeded. An bright young girl whose character completely dims toward the end. Ugh. And it started out as an interesting story.Don't waste your time. See the movie. Redford has a serious knack at this type of story. He probably did the book some considerable justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed, Cliched, Trite...","review":"I wasn't impressed with this book at all. The plot wasn't very interesting and the characters seemed flat and unsympathetic. Evans' research is impressive, but it was not enough to salvage this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"I loved this book.I bought it two weeks ago cause I had seen it in the bestsellers.I read it and loved it.I'm interested in horses and this book reminded me of my horses in Montana.I loved Annie's character because she helped Grace as much as he could.And I was fascinated by the idea of giving plane tickets to Tom Booker."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ?","review":"The horses and humans in this feeble novel are all lame if you ask me. What a tedious book. I only got a third of the way through it, set it aside FOREVER, and logged on to amazon and ordered \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\", which I've heard so much about. I hope it's better than The Horse Whisperer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book.","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book. I was surprised that the movie and book followed pretty closely, except for the ending. I found that shocking. Although it was a good book I found all of the characters annoying. Annie is too *****y, Tom and Robert are too nice and to me Annie doesn't deserve both of them. And if Grace were my child, I would never allow her to be so sassy. Thought the characters were irriating at times the meaning of the story was well done. I applaud Mr. Evans. Go out and read this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gutter language and trashy scenes. Lack of a real story.","review":"I was very disappointed from the very beginning of this novel. Evans peppers his story with gutter language and trashy scenes (the mark of a poor writer with little to say). Many readers, like myself, had hoped for a quality book with depth and literary value. Sadly, I'm also disappointed in the publisher who seems to think that everyone lives in the gutter. One good note is the the wonderful title and cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, poorly plotted, poorly constructed","review":"More and more the American public, perhaps because entertainment is delivered so passively to us via the television set, is unwilling to work hard for its literature. We've seen how shallow, nonsensical stories with shallow, nonsensical characters have become grossly popular. The true read -- one that entertains but also provides knowledge, moral value and judgement, and the intensity of human possiblities -- is sadly passed over in the rush to trivial escapism. This book is a sad example of this new cultural ethic. Fortunately, the film extracts the novel's plotline and then runs with it, creating a magnificent and moving story that you wish Evans' had been able to imagine. Skip the book -- go see the Redford movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was sucker-punched into buying this","review":"Help! Is this what Americans want at the end of the millenium? Mangled horses, mangled kids, emotionally crippled adults. Evans does a great job of appealing to shallow emotions. I'd rather read about wars or serial killers. Those are true horrors."},{"rating":"1","title":"It STINKS!!!","review":"WE as readers were promised a touching story about a girl and her horse. Unfortunately this is what we got: Not much of a plot, bad writing, and very little of what could have been a beautiful story of the love between a owner and his/her horse. Very disapointing and not worth the time it takes to read the back of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read \\"Bridges,\\" you've read half this book already","review":"Our reader's club at work selected this book based on the hope of encountering some mystical explanation of healing and suffering, with perhaps insights into human behavior. Not so. It ended up being a dressed-up romance novel. The book was adequately written with positive male performances. But the women readers took a quick dislike to the heroine, and branded her a flake; they were unable to connect with her and her rationale. The ending was unsatisfying and abrupt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joann says, \\"HORSE MANURE\\".","review":"Thank GOD I did not purchase this book. It was forced on me by a well-meaning friend ! CHILDISH, PREDICTABLE and FOOLISH...Poor horse research. Better title would have been \\" The Horse Pooper \\".PHEW.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched - reads like 'The Book of the Movie'","review":"Honestly I can't imagine what the fuss is about this book. I expected it to have some more emotional depth - if someone had told me that the movie (which I haven't seen yet) had been written first and this was derived from the script I wouldn't be surprised. The whole thing is predictable right from the start and the characters are pure cardboard. There wasn't a single development I didn't see coming pages away. The only remotely interesting characters are the horse and the little girl who is hurt and towards the end of the novel they are sadly neglected in favour of an affair between two people who ought to have known better. Needless to say moral issues are ignored in favour of overwhelming sentimentality and characters undergo the sort of personality changes usually not seen outside the world of soaps - eg a ruthless and ambitious businesswoman suddenly seems content to become a stay at home mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wonderful!","review":"I found this to be a warm and deeply emotional story.A young girl and her beloved horse are involved in an horrific accident which leaves them both horribly maimed,physically and mentally.Her high powered business executive mother takes both girl and horse across country to seek out a so-called horse whisperer, a man who can apparentlycommunicate with horses and heal them of their traumas.In the process of curing the horse,the young girl also begins to heal and to be able to see that her rejection of her mother is a needlessly cruel \\"getting back at her\\"syndrome. A love affair develops between the mother and the horse whisperer and causes them both to reassess their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I did not see the movie, but the advertising blitzkrieg made me curious about the novel -- so I bought it. Almost from the very first page, the book was a disappointment. The description of the psychological turmoil of the main characters is something N. Evans should stay away from; maybe he is knowledgeable about horses, but the knowledge did not translate into the story. The second point was a special disappointment since I had hoped to find an intelligent, \\"horsey\\" book (read to \\"Horse Heaven\\" if you are looking for that).Having stated the negative, I admit to having finished the novel, and not only because I was stuck on the plane for several hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horse book","review":"I really liked this book, I thought Mr. Evans did a super job incorporating the horses, and facts about the animals & accurate descriptions. Where as in some books about certain things, they are more of a back drop to sell the book, here I think Mr Evans was true to the story & had a good mix of the love story, family story & horse story. The only thing was that since I saw the movie, it kind of ruined the book, I pretty much knew already what was going to happen. So, I'd recommend reading the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Horse Whisperer","review":"Nicholas Evans captures the essence of a society that still relies on it's roots into the past to solve modern problems.But like in all dramas the modern baggage comes along with. If anything about this book is true, it's good. Not a must read but one if you have the time. Kudos to Nick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books are always better ... just not this time.","review":"This book was pure junkfood for the brain. It was a quick, fun read, but there was little or no substance. The ending was as contrived as I've ever read. The saving grace (no pun intended) is that at least Robert Redford saw fit to change the ending in the movie! I must say this is one of the few books I've read that was better as a movie (which says more about the quality of the book than the movie)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book until the last 100 pages, then trash.","review":"This book starts off very strong, with an interesting story, engaging characters and lots of tension. Unfortunately, about 3/4 of the way through, the tone of the book changes. The characters act out of character, makes dopey choices, and the book turns into a confusing, unsatisfying read. Felt like the author lost control of the story and took the cheap way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has been way overrated.","review":"I can't believe this novel has been made into a movie. I struggled and struggled to try to finish it because I didn't particularly care for the characters, who are underdeveloped. This book is trite, predictable, and made for those who read silly romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and cliched","review":"I found this book to be so appallingly written that I just wanted it to be over. The plot was formulaic and the characters horrendously stereotyped. Evans redeemed himself slightly with his descriptions of the surroundings, but it wasn't enough to save this novel. The fact that the film rights had been bought well before completion of the novel seemed glaringly obvious, and as I read it, I felt like I was trapped in a B-grade romance. I guess I have only myself to blame - I got suckered into the hype, and had high expectations. Never have my expectations come crashing back to earth with such a deafening thud. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book until the end!","review":"I very much enjoyed this book until the end. Tom committing suicide was so out of character & then we move forward a year & wrap everything up. The characters should have been permitted to make their own decisions, not have them made by default."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horse Poop","review":"phew! This book tries desperately to be mystical and romantic but fails. Horrifically. It is a wonder why this one made the bestseller list, much less a film! The characters are wishy-washy and so is the entire plot(?). And the ending! Ho-hum. I tried to give this book the benefit of the doubt, but in summary, I was suckered by the opine of the masses. Please don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought and banal","review":"Will America never tire of stories where the primary vehicle for personal growth is an extra-marital affair? This story has been done before- and so much better! It reads like a third-rate soap opera, and that's saying alot for the love-making scenes. It's too bad- because Annie was a very likeable character, and the book could have been really interesting. As it was, the only emotion I felt at the end was relief that I had borrowed the book, and not purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Horse Whisperer","review":"Nicholas Evans is an excellent writer and story teller. I appreciate the research that goes into a well thought out story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Horse Whisperer","review":"well written; hard to put down, wanted to keep reading to see what happened next.near the end, I wished the writer had not 'skipped ahead' in the story, leaving 'periods of time' open i.e. from the time the main character rode away on her horse hoping to punish her parents. This could have been a sequel to the 'The Horse Whisperer' . I wanted to know more about all the characters lives from this point to the end of the original book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved, loved this Evans","review":"I just loved this book, full of breathtaking imagery, raw emotion and the complexities of the mother daughter relationships. I would reccomend this too anyone who enjoys to get lost in their book. Nicholas Evans has become a favourite author and this is one i will come back to read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God it's over","review":"I read this book three months ago and still wake up with nightmares. Quick, someone take this man's computer before he writes another bomb. Tonight, however, I was dragged to see the movie and i have to say--thank God for Robert Redford. He and his two screenwriters saved Pilgrim and Annie. Finally, a ralistic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"Like so many others, I was very disappointed in this book. I volunteered to review the book for my book discussion group, knowing it was a best-seller. It is the first time in my memory that everyone in the group disliked a book chosen for review. Although I do not claim any talent of my own for writing, I do recognize such a talent when it exists. Alas, none is exhibited in Horse Whisperer... Instead of looking at what is on the NY Times Best Seller list, I recommend that fellow readers follow Oprah's suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me with a Spoon!","review":"...This book reads like it was written with a screenplay in mind; there's no depth here, or feeling, or quality writing. The book is made up of polished, superficial scenes that will translate extremely well to celluloid and wil make very little impression on anyone who reads it. Cheesy and manipulative plot aside, even the horse whisperer himself failed to impress! He displayed a basic knowledge of horse psychology and a few tricks, and suddenly the world is aswoon over the \\"magic horse trainers.\\" I was hoping for a real story about real people and animals; what I got was a made-for-Hollywood cheesefest by an untalented but ambitious writer. Incredibly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I EVER READ","review":"I LOVED ALMOST EVERY PART OF THAT BOOK. BUT I DO AGREE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SAY THE ENDING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. BUT ALL IN ALL IT WAS REALLY GOOD. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW SO MANY OF YOU CAN SIT THERE AT YOUR COMPUTERS, AND SO HARSHLEY PUT DOWN SUCH A WONDERFUL BOOK, AND IT'S AUTHOR. IT'S NOT HIS FAULT YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOK! JUST BECAUSE IT DIDN'T LIVE UP TO YOUR STANDARDS DOESN'T MAKE HIM A BAD WRITER. I DARE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU WHO SAID THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS, TO RE-WRITE IT, AND STOP YOUR COMPLANING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book magnificent - movie fixes the end.","review":"My husband and friends and I all read and loved The Horse Whisperer except for the last two chapters. We just saw and loved Robert Redford's magnificent movie and loved all of it - including the end. Nicholas Evans should rewrite the book, copy Robert Redford's conclusion and re-issue the book. All of the characters stay in character and take the high road ethically and morally. Bravo! Just read the book and then go to the movies. What a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance novel masquerading as fine writing.","review":"I can't help but flinch at the writing in this book.

Ouch! That's gotta hurt! PLEASE! This book should have Fabio on the cover! This would've been rejected by any freshman creative writing class.

Sure wish I were a novelist who could command that kind of cash though! END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, excellent ending","review":"Read the book in one breath. Beautiful scenery and people. I liked the fact of Tom and Annie having an affair: he changed the horse and the girl, why not the mom, too? And the ending is the only logical thing from my point of view. Haven't seen the movie yet, but I don't like their ending already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed Grace's relationships","review":"More than the story about Tom's life or Annie as the central character, I enjoyed the relationships that Grace had in her life. I was especially touched by the father/daughter relationship. I also liked the development of Annie and Grace's mother/daughter relationship. The comaraderie she had with Joe was great to see and the relationship with Tom, and how it suffered towards the end, was interesting and believable too. The Pilgrim/Grace relationship was like a true friendship, based on trust, hurt, then slowly rebuilt. The development of the Tom/Annie relationship was a bit unbelievable and cliche for me. The fact that Annie was protrayed as the main character confused me a little. But, overall I though the book was well-written and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best novel I've in a long time","review":"The book takes you away to a beautiful place and to some wonderful people. You get into it and forget where you are while your reading it. When you get to the end your so sad as you want it to go on and on and just never end. Also learned a lot about horses and how they are treated in sometimes a cruel manner and yet in another way so gently. I would like to read a sequel to this book. also saw the movie and loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"unexpectable ending","review":"This book is very enxpectable. It has a good plot line with some twists. It sounds like an almost normal life situation that could happen. I addvise every single person in the world to read this book for it is very thrilling with an exepected ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was going so well! The characters were well-developed, the plot was interesting. And then suddenly I found myself reading a bad Harlequin. What happened? The writing took a sad turn downhill (for instance, we hear Annie thinking to herself about two hundred times how strangely free of guilt she feels--didn't any of the editors notice that unnecessary repetition?).If you're going to read this book, stop halfway through it so you'll still think it's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridges without the emotion","review":"The first half drug along like a \\"Tragedy of the Week\\" tvmovie. The second half had the potential of portrayinglife choices made for the benefit of the many at the costof a few portrayed so brillantly in \\"Bridges of MadisonCounty\\". And just as I got interested, the whole muddledmess was wrapped up in two chapters with a death, theemotional \\"maturity\\" of a child who had reacted like abrat throughout the rest of the book and an illegitimatebaby accepted and loved by the whole lot!

The last 100 pages however, I found myself rolling my eyes. I'm sick of books, movies, etc. acting like a few days of hot sex is the most amazing, cosmic-driven thing in the world. I could think of ten men I could have hot sex with for four days. That's not amazing. What's amazing is when you can spend four, ten , forty years with someone and still have love, pasison, and fun. THAT is amazing, not this. I also found it ridiculous that this girl had been through a horrible ordeal, finds healing, then her mother puts her through a whole other horrible ordeal. But she is presented as the female Beaver Cleaver at the end - I don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat writing","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I am not offended by the character's adultery. I am offended that such a book would see the light of day. The author makes no effort to develop the characters.

It was not even a fun trashy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was truly disapointed with this book.","review":"I was disapointed with the shallow plot and undeveloped characters. The story was predictable. I'm not fond of finding one's soulmate outside of one's marriage. It is to my chagrin that this book is a bestseller.

But - This is NOT good writing or storytelling. I agree that using affairs to \\"heal\\" yourself will seldom do that. She found Tom exciting? Of course she did. Do any of you in a long-term relationship remember what it felt like at first? That fire doesn't last (it does creep back in at different times, though!), but the loyalty and constant love that Robert gave his family - that's real love. Why women (I am one, by the way) find stories like this and Madison romantic, is beyond me. The women are portrayed in a favorable light only when they are stripped of their strenghts. Annie had a husband who adored her and supported her in all her pursuits. Poor, poor Annie. I am so very dissapointed. Weak characters, weak, eak writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An immoral story with a very disappointing ending.","review":"After struggling through The Horse Whisperer, I was left feeling betrayed by the author.

Inane, trite, nonsensical and just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hollywood Sellout","review":"Like most of the reviews already posted, I, too, was hooked by the beginning of the book and then frustrated by the second half. I've read that Evans was signed for the movie rights before it was finished. My theory is that the book changes at that point in its composition. Evans becomes too aware of how it would play out as a movie and shortchanges the reader in the process. Ironically, Hollywood apparently wasn't too satisfied with it either. I hear the horse whisperer lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This was the worst piece of crap I ever read.

The passion that can exist between two people is amazing, once you find it. This story stirs the emotions of the heart. I'm not one to cry, buy as I finished it, I felt something.

Just read this book, then you'll know."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most touching love stories I have read","review":"If you love a good romance that makes your heart ache for the characters, this is a book for you. The love between Tom and Annie that builds throughout the end of the book is touching, the kind you always hope to find. I can't believe all the people that thought the book was bad- if you love thrillers, and especially romances this is your book. Evans describes the love so vividly between all the characters while managing to tell a story about two families, horses, and a hot love affair. I would strongly suggest reading this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The boringest book I've ever read....","review":"This book is very boring. I tried to read it, but after 20 pages I gave up, because it's full of horses. I hate horses. Especially horses which create an accident.

I've grown up in the heart of country like he writes about and that is the way things go. Horses can be connected with and there are some people who can and some people who can't. Someone else wrote a review that the horse was forced and tied into submission. Not true!! I liked how he portrayed the story and how true to life it was. And how humans are so fragile and how life can be so short. Read it and then come out West and see what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"All I have to say is this book tells you about the men and women who does this as a living. I'm deeply tuched by this book.It's the best of all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually 2 and a half stars, for the effort","review":"I started off liking The Horse Whisperer. It is rich in descriptions and is quite insightful. Unfortunately, about half way through the book it started falling apart. The descriptions started to get longer, pointless, and started to drag the book down. Most writers seem to know when an experience has been retold too much, but Evans reiterates often and there are only so many ways to describe Montana's wilderness. Also, and far worse, I didn't like the characters. I didn't relate to them, I didn't care about them, and didn't truly understand them. I did enjoy it for the most part, though. When Evans stuck to the point, the descriptions were worth the read. For a first novel, it was quite good. I plan on reading his second novel, The Loop, to see if he has become more disciplined."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoyingly predictable","review":"I find it really hard to understand how this book ended up in all those bestseller lists. I picked it up because so many were apparently fascinated by it. What a disappointment! I guessed from the very beginning what was going to happen and it really annoyed me to find out I was right. Why all the fuss with horses and landscapes when all it leads up to is just another not very original lovestory. I'd vote for no star at all !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Horse Whisperer is overrated.","review":"The opening paragraph of the first chapter suggests a work of great depth and feeling, but after the first page, dissolves into writing that is comparable only to that of the non-dimensional Danielle Steel. As with Ms. Steel, Evans tells the reader everything rather than letting the plot and characters evolve and allowing a friendship to develop between characters and reader. Horse Whisperer is a story about paper doll people with no depth or dimension. Evans has taken what could have been an extraordinary story and has reduced it to nothing. I've heard the movie is exceptional, but do not want to waste my time and my money to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great book that taught me about love and heartache","review":"I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read. It taught me about love,heartache and how to people can live their lives knowing that they can't be together. I wrote an essay for my 12th grade English class explaining why I liked it so much: \\"This book by Nicholas Evans is a book about growing up, and making life changes. The main characters, Annie and her dauighter Grace both had their lives changed dramatically. A horse accident led the mother and daughter to a a man called the horse whisperer. His name was Tom Booker. Tom Booker changed their lives by touching their hearts and souls on a level that they had never experienced before.\\" I think this book deserves more than the 5 stars. I reccomend it to anyone who has not already read it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Have Read All Summer!!","review":"I am usually not a reader, but his book just totally trapped me. The story was great, the characters were great. In some ways I could really relate. This book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most wonderful books ever written","review":"disgusted by adultry? a put down to women? wake up people. look beyond that and see the relationship between a mother and daughter. this book IS BEAUTIFUL! being a teenage daughter myself, i could relate to grace, and i know my mother could relate to annie. anyone who doesn't read this book because there may be a few punctuation errors will miss out on one of the most wonderful and moving books of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, no cigar...","review":"I'm not surprised to hear that this was Evan's first novel. While some first novels are destined for greatness, this isn't one of them. It's mind candy that leaves a sour aftertaste. The plot is predictable and plodding. The characters would be right at home on the daytime soaps. And the ending? It's laughable at best. For Redford's sake, I hope the movie isn't as boring. From the trailers I've seen, though, I think I'll skip it. The book was bad enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have read this year....","review":"While the quest to help both a young girl and her horse overcome the psychological effects of a terrible accident could have made a good plot, the actual plot development is unbelievable. In addition, the dialog of the characters is flat. The characters are not very likable, and are difficult to identify with.For all the terrific press this book received, I would have expected much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Exactly Like Bridges of Madison County","review":"I am writing this review for a contemporary literature class and I thought that the book was excellent. But before actually writing this I read some other reviews and I was surprised at the number of people who compared the Horse Whisperer to Bridges. Except for the part about the romance between two people who knew that in a certain time period would have to resume their lives without the other person. Granted the scenes with Annie and Tom were beautifully written, it just wasn't like Bridges. The book aside from the love story brought to light the issues that children face when they witness a close friend or relative die. Such was the case with Grace and Judith, Evans describes an intense pain that was left with Grace after the horrible accident. The way that Annie was not going to surrender and let Grace give up everything that was important to her gave a lot of merit to Evan's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It was a good start. At least the first few chapters caught my attention. But as time went by, alas, the writer surely got something to distract him. This book is not like the Bridge of Madison County at all. This book is about an extremely selfish woman who uses her childhood as a lasting excuse for whatever she does to others and a man who is emotionally so weak that just kills himself instead of living through hardships. And poor horses, they are never the center of this book except on the cover picture and title. The author tried very hard to justify an adultery but lacked enough appeals to make an adultery a love story. And the ending(more, his death)was very, very, disappointing. I am sure that a man of inner balance would never give up so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than the movie","review":"I was a girl that loved horse books, and this is the best one I read since Black Beauty and national velvet when i was little. I couldn't put it down, and spent all saturday reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Pretty good\\" fiction","review":"Working in a bookstore, I've read a ton of fiction out there, especially bestsellers. I think for his first try, Mr. Evans deserves a slap or two on the back. I've noticed that most fiction takes a little easing into to get the plot going. This book, however, quickly sweeps you off of your feet from the very first chapter and doesn't stop going until the last quarter of the book. It loses a little steam at the end, true, but overall it is a very touching story about the way an injured horse and one man affected a family. I was disappointed in the lack of actual \\"whispering\\" done, but I think the story was written to be about the MAN, not the horse...after all, the title does concern him. And why shouldn't it focus on the people and their problems? If you want to read about HOW a whisperer works his magic, try the non-fiction aisles. You might learn a lot more there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Evans tire of writing????","review":"This was a terrific story until the last 100 pages - then it became a formula romance novel! I loved the tension, descriptions, everything - until the end. I felt let down in the end. I don't think Tom Booker would have reacted as he did in the book in real life - in Annie's mind, perhaps, but not in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional, well-written - I loved it ! !","review":"I just finished this book 10 minutes ago and have to say I will wait anxiously for Evans' next book. I think this story was written beautifully and believably, with a setting that couldn't have been more perfect in my opinion. Evans' writing style totally engrossed me so that I loved the characters and thought about the book when I was unable to read. The love story was the best (light and touching, not trashy) and the relationship between mother and daughter was very real and believable. My only change would be to add more pages detailing the workings with the horse, since that was, I thought, the focus of the book. All in all, I loved it. Keep em coming, Nicholas Evans ! !"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful and engrossing.","review":"This book was hard to put down. It held my attention to the very end and the ending was alittle predictable but still a good book nevertheless. I bought it as a whim after hearing all of the good reviews and was not disappointed. You could really get inside the characters' heads and know how they felt. That is a sign of a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"God! What garbage!","review":"Garbage is the nicest word for such stuff. The perpetrator of this piece of bleep and everyone involved with it should be checked for mental illness.THE HORSE WHISPERER is a dreadful imposition on a reader.

I really did try to enjoy this book. But its characters are predictable and underdeveloped and they STAY THAT WAY. The passages about the actual horse whispering stand out vividly from the rest of the book, but there are not nearly enough of them to support the rest of this lumbering mess. I had hopes--the subject is interesting and first books are often unexpectedly excellent. But the author was too busy covering his bets to actually write a compelling story. Hype wins again. I won't be looking for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged out love story","review":"Given all the hoopla about this book, I expected much better. It seemed like a long rehash of Bridges of Madison County. I found it poorly written and boring. Quite frankly, I was amazed that I actually finished the book. I also dislike love stories where people find their soulmate isn't their spouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Half is great, too bad the second half Stinks","review":"This starts out as a great book, with interesting characters and a good plot. Unfortunately, about halfway though the author decides to become a syrupy romance instead. The ending is as Cliched as a Daniel Steele novel, and as surprising as Barbara Cartland. I wouldn't recomend it as you'll only be disgusted with all the characters by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bang-up start:ending fizzled","review":"As with many readers, the beginning of the book held many promises- but alas, the transition from horses to a tawdry affair was disappointing.

This is the book for a sun-drenched day at the beach. This story of healing, hope, redemption and love is epic in scope yet easy-to-read. Enjoy it, absorb it, devour it. Watch mother and daughter mature, discover love both lost and new-found. One warning...after a roller coaster emotional ride, the novel's final scenes are both trite and somewhat disappointing. Don't dismay -- The Horse Whisperer is still worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book","review":"Is the theme of this book to always act upon your desires? When Annie commits adultry we are told that she feels absolutely no shame or guilt; is that a good thing?She goes to Montanna to \\"save\\" her family and after her stay there decides to divorce her husband with the casual thought that her daughter will learn to live with it.This book bothered me on several levels. Annie was a selfish bitch at the start of the book and she basically remained that way at the end. There was no redemption here.And the self-sacrifice of Booker was a quick device to end the book. I think it made no sense whatsoever.I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly mushy and formulaic.","review":"yawn yawn yawn. It was a terrible read. I don't know how I even got through reading the book. I thought the writer's portrayal of the women was awful, cliche-like, and overly melodramatic. This is not the book for you to entertain yourself with because it reads like some boring adult version of Beverly HIlls 90210. I like reading books that I can relate to. I'm sorry if I can't relate to females who can't keep their marriage vows or who are going through some sort of mid life crisis even though they have the best of everything in their career, marriage, and kids. I seem to be against it because the writer seems to encourage and stand by these awful morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"This is a fantastic book! I couldn't put it down for a second. Twists in the happenings make it even better. A must read wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really excellent story!","review":"I picked up this book because the premise seemed so interesting. The book was very involving and very interesting. The love story was done really well. I can't remember another book I've read like this one. I'm more of a horror fan, but I think anyone who likes stories would really love this one. Ending is predictable, but the movie surprised me. The movie was good, but like always, the book was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwash!","review":"Looking for a convincing portrayal of Montana life, with credible characters and riveting action? DON'T read The Horse-Whisperer -- go straight to Ivan Doig's English Creek or Dancing at the Rascal Fair. Nicholas Evans' characters are too likable; everyone's so NICE (okay, Annie's boss is a stinker, but he's way off-stage). And Evans needs an editor who will tell him that \\"all right\\" is two words, not \\"alright\\" (I don't let my freshmen get away with that) and that jumping from one character's mind to another is for better writers than he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a Harlequin romance","review":"It started out so well; the story seemed destined to explore the nature of healing with an intriguing link to the almost magical world of the \\"horse whisperers.\\" It quickly degenerated into a third-rate romance. The ending is too pitiful for comment. The movie version actually fixes most of the problems with the book, so watch it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horse Whisperer Review","review":"Very touching book. Tom Booker is a healer, whether animals (especially horses) or people. The tome gets down to the \\"nitty-gritty\\" of relationships. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Horse Whisperer","review":"This book seems to be another stab at writing in the magical realism genre, and it also reminds me of the \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" in that it features a mystical man who meets a woman who is in a predictible, even boring marriage. They have a brief affair, he disappears and she is left with her memories (in this book's case, she was silly enough to have his child). I felt the book's opening scene was good,but it went downhill from there; the characters felt cardboardy and even a bit too unreal.If you like magical realism, I would recommend Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He is a master at it, and the love scenes are beautifully written without a jarring resort to explicitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype and no substance...","review":"This book seems to be another attempt at creating a magical realism novel, like The Bridges of Madison County--a lone man with mystical powers, one failed marriage and ta da...who finds the ONE woman for all time--only she is trapped in a marriage she is bored or unhappy with. They have a brief affair and then he walks out, never to be seen again. I couldn't relate to the characters very well. They seemed made of cardboard. In my opinion this book meets the standard for pop literature, not high literature. If it's high-quality magical realism with great love scenes and scary situations you want, I strongly suggest Gabriel Garcia Marquez's books. That's one person who knows how to write in this genre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish it","review":"I was intrigued by the legend of horse whisperers, but found this book unbelievable. For one, the book starts off in the viewpoint of a truck driver, who, other than being responsible for the accident, played no real part in the story by the time I quit reading. Also, a good friend of mine is an amputee who lost her leg right after eighth grade, and I spent a lot of time with her after the accident. Believe me, she wasn't up on crutches very quickly at all. Granted, I tried to read the Reader's Digest condensed version, so they may have had to cut a lot of scenes, but the girl's seemingly short recovery time just didn't feel realistic. Not only that, but I didn't like her mother--she was not a sympathetic character to me, so I never got as far as Montana. Therefore, I can't say what I thought of the character the book was named after"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FIRST HALF BUT FADES AT THE END","review":"It's too bad Mr. Evans didn't follow through with the interesting situation he set up. The pat conclusion does not do the rest of this wonderful novel justice. It's as if he just got tired of writing so he ended it"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've read for a long time","review":"Sometimes there are books which make you laugh, there are some which make you cry. Equally important are books which make you angry, all the more when you think they're not worth to be read at all. But the crucial thing is: all these books change you in one way or other. I guess that's what literature is all about. The worst case would be when a book leaves you cold. This is what happened to me when I was reading 'The Horse Whisperer'. This novel is hackneyed, the characters are flat, and the whole story is one you have heard a hundred times over. The is really nothing exciting at all about it. An artificial and superficial piece of bad work from cover to cover"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK!","review":"Two people close to me (but not anymore) highly recommeded this book and, therefore, I was anxious to read it. It never got any better after the truck accident. I read the whole book (what a waste of time) just to see if it was going to get better and it never did. I'm glad to read the other review articles here to see I'm not the only one who was disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a dismal disappointment.","review":"After hearing all the reviews, I was thrilled when I received this book as a Christmas present. The beginning was suspensful and made me anxious to continue reading. However, after Grace and Annie arrived at the Booker's, the story starts to go downhill. Where are the details and secrets of the art of horse whispering? It's as though it was too much trouble to do any detailed research into this unknown art. The ending of the book seems like the author was in a hurry to wrap the package and get it to the post office in any condition just so he'd be on time with his delivery. The way he chose to end the book did nothing to enhance the storyline. Very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"Very Disappointed, I can't believe that Mr. Evans develop such a story. The starting of the story is wonderful with great description of the characters and the environment of Montana. But what has to do with love, Doesn't he know that Annie has already been married. I consider thats a kind of adultory. And thats very sick too. What going on with his mind. I hope this is not going to happen in his next novel. And think he should go and check his concept of love and understand what in mean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"The cover of this book should show a busty woman and a hunk of a man sitting on horses but locked in a passionate embrace. The synopsis of this book makes it sound like a great story; the truth is that it is nothing more than a dime-store romance. What is this with best-sellers about guys who are just too much for married women to resist? Must be some ego on these authors, who obviously knowing little about true love. (if they insist on writing about romance). I would appreciate it if the synopsis of these books makes it clear that the book is a romance. It is akin to making a porno movie with a plot (no, no I don't mean that it is all about sex, I am just saying that the story exists only to serve the romance, not the other way around"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad editor! Bad, bad!","review":"This book was bought for big money based on a proposal of the first 100 pages plus an outline of the rest of the story. The first part of the book was great, riviting, good writing, really drew you in. But before finishing the book, the writer had money in the bank and got very, very lazy. The editor NEVER should have accepted the final manuscript without significant changes. What a weak, cop-out ending! The actions taken in the end were NOT in character. If the writer wanted to make this ending believable, he sure should have written a character that would have made such decisions. Where was the editor when he needed one? There is an old writing workshop adage: if you are going to have a character shoot himself at the end of the story, you'd better put a gun on the mantle in the first scene. Where oh where was the \\"gun\\"????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst best-seller I have ever read.","review":"I have loved horses and horse books, and reading, all my life, so I thought this one would be a naturalI cannot believe this work got past the editors.

After finishing the dumb thing (I kept hoping it would get better) I threw it away, not wanting to be responsible for one more person reading this junk. A really dumb book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it; Hated it","review":"Reading this book I couldn't help getting teary-eyed mainly because of the visual images it conjures (the horse interactions, Montana, the warm family). The whisperer is a bigger than life hero that has a calmness and maturity you can't help but admire until his affair. The graphic details of lovemaking, etc is so out of place for this Disney-like character not to mention his eventual, sappy demise. You suddenly realize he's no hero and doesn't have it together at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I really thought it was terrible. When I bought this book, it actually sounded good. I don't know what I was thinking...but I never judge a book by it's cover. At the end of the reading, I just felt, like, ...how many more old romance stories must be told repetively over and over? Bluntly put, I don't see how this book is very different from any of those trash books that any english teacher would abhor. So basically, to sum it up what I didn't like was the same scenario: bored ambitious career woman in the Eastcoast somehow decides that because her life with her husband isn't fulfilling she goes and have an affair with some ranch hand guy who psychologically treats horses. BORING. I actually didn't like the heroine character very much either--she was too 2-D-ish. the book scared me too much to wanna see the movie. So I didn't. But somehow I ended up with the The Horse Whisperer Cd....and it's actually pretty good. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I picked up this book due to curiosity. The fact that it was on the bestseller's list for several months along with a seemingly interesting plot compelled me to read it. I regret wasting any amount of time on this poor excuse for a novel. The book had the schmaltzy dialogue that one would find in a cheap romance novel. What could have made for interesting drama (ie., the plight of young Grace) was overshadowed by an affair between the two main characters that lacked both credibility and appeal. There are plenty of well-written books out there that accomplish the drama that Evans could only hope to achieve (Isabelle Allende, Toni Morrison, etc.). Give it up Evans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Message not clear","review":"Being a horse owner myself, reading the book was a must as well as seeing the movie. I preferred the book though to the movie.I just re-read the book many years later and for some reason I do not remember the affair.

The interaction between horse and human is memorable though.This book is not intended for the typical young, horse-loving girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummmmm","review":"I bought this book looking for , well horse stuff. I am horse crazy and I wanted a horse book. I bought it because I remembered fragments of the movie from when i watched years ago. I remembered the horsey parts.

The story is told in a flat and unremarkable way, the characters are unlikable and one dimensional, the plot is unrealistic-it is a story that lacks both imagination, believability, and foundation. The ending felt like a cop out. This book reads like it was written for a third grader. The publisher of this book should feel like a sucker for paying Mr. Evans such an enormous sum for such Drivel; I know I feel like a sucker for buying it and actually reading it. The only reason I didn't toss it after the first two chapters, was because I was in total disbelief that such a hyped book could actually be so awful. I felt it HAD to get better somewhere. The joke was on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The best part of the book was the beginning. I thought as I began reading, \\"This is going to be a good one!\\". However what I thought was going to be the tragedy of a spirted horse saved only by the undying love of a young girl, became a love story between a horse trainer, the whisperer, and the girl's mother. What a waste?! I am looking forward to reading, \\"The Man Who Listens to Horses\\" for a better read about the communication between \\"man and animal\\". It is based on the idea of a \\"horse whisperer\\" not a wife-stealing, son-dumping man who happens to be good with horses."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was truly a tragedy in the Shakesperian sense.","review":"The characters intrigued me immediately when I began reading this book. By the time they got to Montana I lost my interest in everyone but Tom, but I found him pretty shallow. Why didn't we hear about the truck driver again? We knew a lot about him in the beginning. Why didn't the father fight harder for his family? How did he suddenly become so career driven once his wife and child left? Why didn't Tom ever see his son? He seemed to have traveled extensively.

Cardboard characterizations, actually I take that back as the descriptions on the back of cereal boxes have oft proved more gripping, and how about that ending. If it isn't completely amateurish to kill off a character to resolve a plot snarl then the best of novels start off with, \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\" Spend your pennies on a better book.

Flowed smoothly, good character development, believeable romance until the end.

Then, it's like someone else decided to finish the book for Evans -- someone who didn't read the first 3/4 of the book. The ending is so ridiculously bad that I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I don't have difficulty with sad endings, but this ending is too absurd to even be sad. You might as well rent the movie instead. (Something I very rarely recommend.)

I was disappointed in the lengthy drawn-out narratives of the scenery. The character of the husband was nothing but a stereotype, only part of the story because without him there would be no sexual tension and thus no real story. I thought the book was boring and predictable except for the ending......that earned the two star rating.....if it weren't for the surprise ending it would be just another Bridges of Madison County. I liken the plot to a Harlequin Romance ....it's all circumstantial and a lot of mush. I'm not above the romance for romance's sake when I'm in the mood for a light read, but Evans spent too much time setting up the story before anything really happened. To his credit, I hear the book is much better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to follow","review":"I have no idea what this book was about.

The skill and technique of the Horse Whisperer, his ability to communicate with the animal, and also his depth of understanding of human nature in young people and also in adult relationships makes the book a sure winner! No wonder it was a best seller. The movie was also great!Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl - Books One - Three"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera drivel masquerading as literature","review":"The worst aspect of this book is the fact that it tries to be something it is not - quality fiction. The beginning shows possibility in the tragic horse accident involving two young girls, one of them Annie's daughter. Instead of exploring the ramifications of this incident, however, the author uses the tragedy to set an unconvincing love story into action. I could have skipped the nauseating stolen glances between frosty Annie and wooden Tom. Maybe if these characters had actually had a chance to develop I would have cared more - although, I doubt it. I was given the impression that this novel was well-written and of high quality. I am astounded that Robert Redford was able to make a semi-successful motion picture out of this nonsense(of course, I use the term \\"success\\" loosely). I would have sooner pegged it for movie-of-the-week material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice yarn but klutzy prose and questionable ideology.","review":"The narrative -- basically a girl on horse getting into an accident and then only recovering with the help of a Montana horseman -- virtually collapses under the weight of the author's infatuation with baroque adjectives. This is a mixture of feelings, blood and tears, the occasional soft porn thrown in for good measure, eventually sending the message that the earthy plain Montana ranchers (incidentally blue-eyed and blond Aryan heroes) are morally far superior to slick city folk. Most of the time, the suspense holds, so in a way it's fun reading, but the stereotyping is almost harder to bear than the indulgence in real estate selling adjectives. Go, read some Hemingway, before writing another epic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Horse manure","review":"Don't be fooled this is not a book about true romance and soul healing.It's dark, brooding and love manifests in nothing more than primordial lust. There is nothing enchanting or mystical about the Horse Whisperer himself it just seems he's on a quest to get into Anne's pants. Whore whisperer is more like it. This book made me feel depressed like there was a dark cloud looming over me every page I read. Mindless,dark,and paticularly disturbing at some parts. The Horse was not as deranged as the back cover synopsis would suggest, making the character forgettable.I'd avoid this one, don't look the gift horse in the mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic tripe","review":"This story starts out dramatically and then drags the reader through one unbelievable event after another. As with many Grisham novels, the reader must suspend all sense of common sense and logic to accept the sensationalistic plot. I would ask the readers who loved this book to rethink the events and ask themselves whether the characters and events are believable. When I read a novel, I don't want to stop in the middle and ask, \\"Why in the world would anyone do that?\\" Characters are quirky and unidimensional, plot is trite, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing and Inspiration","review":"After reading a new book, \\"Spirit Horses\\" by Alan Evans,which I absolutely loved, I felt compelled to go back and read this classic \\"horse\\" book.

The movie also cut out all the sex in the book. I was disppointed and disgusted with the book since, the beautiful story of wounded girl and her horse and the people who loved them enough to not let them go, was marred by awful, graphic sex scenes and loose sexual morals. If I wanted to read about someone's personal sex life, I would read the proper material for that. The sex was very unnecessary. However, Mr. Evans writes beautiful descriptions of the human heart and the natural landscape."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Mr.Evans could have made it so much better.I am a horse lover + rider, so I know how they act and their reactions to certain things. As I read this book, it did not sound like Mr.evans knew that much about horses. The beginning was good but I started to fall apart from there. I'm sure it would have been a better book if he had had more knowledge about horses. When I first started reading it, I thought the whole book was going to be based on horses. Then, horses were basically taken out of the picture and it was all love. Not very good, and I think that Pilgrim would deffinetly not have been that aggresive after the accident.

If so, maybe he should go back to that line of work. This is a book that starts out like a ball of fire, and is quickly extinguished by mid-way. The end in particular left me cold.I have also heard a rumor...nothing more than that, mind...that this was actually written for the express purpose of making a movie from it. That Mr. Evans was asked to write this drivel so that Hollywood could make a movie from a bestseller. If this is true, then just wait for the movie...the book isn't work the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you buy, read all these reviews first!!!","review":"I can't believe I bought a hardback copy. I won't rehash what so many have stated so eloquently, but will add that I got absorbed until the half way point, and read on hoping for the unexpected to happen, but threw the book into the dumpster when the big affair became imminent. What a disappointing waste of time for readers. I too read on was expecting a deeper, soul searching, or introspective journey, but alas, it was not to be. If you must, borrow a copy - or check it out of my trash can - just don't expect me to be interested in how it turns out"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT DOESNT WHISPER, IT CROAKS!!","review":"This book travels very, very well until the plot (ostensibly) gets to Montana, then suddenly the reader is in bodice-ripping country ie Madision County. The horse whispering theme is hardly explored and is insufficiently developed to justify the idea that Tom heals both horses and their mistresses (young ones and older ones). Based solely on the opening chapters, Evans must have something better to contribute than this embarrassment"},{"rating":"1","title":"A ridiculous book obviously written as a gimmick!","review":"The author starts telling an intriguing story, but soon it becomes ridiculous as the characters make irrational decisions and undertake useless objectives. In addition, the character drawn in the horse whisperer is unbelievable. Nobody is that perfect -- I kept wishing he'd spit on the sidewalk or do something else to expose his humanity. And what silly choices the woman made -- someone with a good husband, an injured child and a comfortable life with a good profession is going to abandon her committment to all of it?

It was a better story.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, to say the least.","review":"I was all excited - a horse book for adults! Well, the story of the girl and the horse was ok, but, honestly! The rest of the story was just stupid. Do we really need such tripe in a book? If you're going to read it, see the movie. It's much more interesting, which is something I rarely say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched romantic garbage totally lacking in imagination.","review":"This book starts out promisingly and, at least for about 170 pages (paperback), it seems like it's going to be the story of three people -- a mother, father, and their injured daughter -- and an injured horse (and what's done to save him). That alone would have been enough to make a good book, but, of course, the author went for the movie deal and tied in a romance -- cliched, of course, between the mother and a cowboy who's written to look like Robert Redford -- that's a copy of The Bridges of Madison County. If only he had just stuck to the girl and the horse ... What a ripoff! They could at least package this as a romance novel, then I would've known not to buy it. Instead, I feel as if somebody snuck into my wallet and pulled out $7.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the movie is better than the book!","review":"This book is terrible! I don't know how it climbed to the top of the best-seller list. I felt no compassion for either the human or equine characters. They both are as flat as cardboard! I hated the story and only hoped it would end quickly to put me out of my misery. Since the story reads more like a screenplay than a novel, I'd suggest that the author stick to writing films and leave the writing of novels to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridges of Madison County on Horseback","review":"This was a really bad book - boring and predictable from beginning to end. Worst of all it was insulting to me as a woman. Evans obviously couldn't write a believable female character to save his life. Annie spends most of the book trying to salvage a relationship with her daughter and the rest of it abandoning her familial responsibilities and selfishly and recklessly pursuing an affair with the \\"strong, sensitive, Montana cowboy\\" (is this a Harlequin??) And in between she spends a great deal of time \\"pleasuring herself.\\" Given the absurd dialogue of the characters and the melodramatic ramblings of the author, I actually found myself laughing more than anything else. Those poor horses.... to have to endure the company of such people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, but predictible and sappy story line","review":"What starts off as an upsetting yet attention-grabbing book ends up being nothing more than a syrupy love story. When yuppie career-driven mom falls for the the quiet rugged cowboy, I was reminded of every girl-meets-boy-girl-gets-boy story. The fact that she's married is a mere inconvenience as she plots to leave her husband. Rubbish! A woman of her fiber would never succumb to such emotion---she's unable to demonstrate love to her own child! Yawn...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the horse?","review":"After all the hype I thought this book would be a profound insight into the relationships between people and animals and other people. How disappointed I was when I got almost all the way through and discovered it was little more than a romance novel! Heaving bosoms and all...I suppose without any hype I might call it an impressive first novel, but I found most of the relationships stereotypical and the ending totally inconsistent with what little character development there was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile and pernicious!","review":"This book is fundamentally disappointing for two reasons. First, imagine a story where a husband with a loving wife and recently crippled child suddenly falls for his kid's physical therapist. He's finally found his one true soul mate. How moving right? Wrong -- he's a self-centered cad (particularly if the therapist is half his wife's age). So why aren't stories like this and Bridges of Madison County treated the same? Secondly and more importantly, the Horse Whisperer treats the crippled kid like some sort of stage prop in the narcistic mom's adolescent fantasy. Its implies that life's real meaning doesn't spring from parenthood and marriage (or any of the ordinary relationships in life) but only from finding a down home hunk in a cowboy hat who talks to horses. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to like","review":"I started reading this book only knowing that it involved a mystical sort of man who could communicate with horses. This concept sounded intriguing. The novel turns out to be more about the thoroughly unlikable Annie character. She is is a self-centered woman, who makes one grand gesture to help her daughter by visiting the Horse Whisperer. It is obvious from the start that there will be a romance, but I could see no reason why Tom (the title character) should have any interest in Annie. It makes you feel sorry for Annie's husband, who seems like a nice enough guy, but is left behind in New York. The horse is really the most interesting character, but he just falls into the background as the story moves on.The wild horses in the story could have been an interesting metaphor, but Evans has an annoying habit of using symbolism and then explaining it too. It is as if he thinks his readers are too stupid to figure it out on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe!","review":"Good beginning, predictable middle, horrible sappy sentimental cowardly ending. Having set himself up with some reasonably interesting characters, placed them in a moral dilemna that might create tragedy, comedy, or god forbid, some sort of character growth, the author either loses interest or his mind and resolves the whole matter with a cheap, lazy and pointless deus ex machina. What was shaping toward an interesting story degenerates into nothing more than a trite, saccharine tear jerker. Instead of facing the consequences of their actions or making decisions about the course of their lives, his characters just dissolve into maudlin stereotypes and go weeping into the sunset. Somebody rent this guy a moral compass, he's lost! Bleehch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Beauty on a psychiatrist's couch. Pluuuueeese!","review":"Not since Black Beauty or National Velvet has a book been aimed so unashamedly at both a teen and family animal-loving audience - which is what no doubt led to its bestellerdom. But if you're going all out to pluck heart-strings, then pluck them strongly. Evans never really plumbed any strong emotions throughout. And the part where they head off across America with the horse, stopping off at the occasional symbolic monument, was hopelessly contrived. With British authors writing about America, it is so often feared that they won't catch the tone right or will lack depth. In these scenes, Evans drags everything to its most superficial level - the American experience becomes little more than a sightseeing trip. In the end, these were the only parts to bring me to tears, I was laughing so hard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and boring","review":"I read this book last summer, on the insistence of my mother and several friends. They thought it was wonderful, and I was nothing but disappointed. I found the book extremely predictable, and felt there was no depth to any of the characters. We all love books that we don't want to put down--I just wanted to get through this one because I don't like to start something and not finish it. Mr. Evans should stick to screenplays and describing the countryside of England--he did not conjure up in my mind any of Montana's beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evans' first book shows only a \\"whisper\\" of talent","review":"The entire time I spent reading the Horse Whisperer, something seemed wrong, sort of unpolished, about the book. \\"It reads like a screenplay,\\" I thought to myself. Imagine my lack of surprise when I read about Nicholas Evans on the book's back flap -- he is a writer of screenplays and this is his first stab at writing a novel. I found his writing terribly uninspired, predictable and trite. It's sole purpose seemed to be to spawn a similarly uninspired movie.If you enjoy reading the work of truly gifted writers, keep shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 pages into the book I predicted the rest of the story","review":"Can you say predictable? If this is a great book, the intelligence of the averages reader is declining fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Marvelous!","review":"The Horse Whisperer has truly been the best read of the summer. The intricate love story between man, woman, horse, and girl, is simply a work in itself. The characters were excellently developed, for I came to know them like old friends. Rushes of emotion flooded me right alongst side the people in the story. Passionate romance and sheer courage and triumph make this novel literally impossible to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this was one of the best books I've read.","review":"I read this book when it first came out and it was one of those books that just pull you right in. There aren't too many books these days that I want to sit down to read at every free moment. This was one of those books. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the movie, but I am looking forward to seeing the video. I hope it is just as spellbinding as the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please spend some money on a good editor!","review":"I finished the book, which I believe is a tribute to my own desire for completion, not to the writer. Why did the author take so long to say so little? I thought no one was paid by the word anymore. I actually found myself skimming for interesting passages to read - a rarity for me, I assure you. The story does hold together somehow, though, and you do want to know how it ends. But then, I want to know how \\"The Brady Bunch\\" episodes end, too. Sorry.

I believe it is true. Again they have come close to writing the same story. All they missed was the location, the names, and a few more insignificant details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and inane.","review":"This book has so much potential that never pans out. There are four main characters (including the horse), but the author chooses to spend the majority of his time describing the scenery. In addition, Mr. Evans seems content to explore the same inane relationships as other authors (boy and girl meet, fall in love, etc.). The focus of the book changes mid-way through the book, shifting away from the relationship between the girl and her horse. If the book is not about this relationship, why devote so much space to the events leading up to the initial injury of the horse and girl? I picked this book up because it was on the best-seller list; I should have put it down long before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising story turned lackluster","review":"I was attracted to this story as I am both a lover of horses and the mountains of the American West. I knew the book had very mixed reviews, but decided to give it a try anyway. While Evans did a great job of setting up the story it never quite takes off and engages the reader. The ending was simplistic and not in line with the characters. Not a book I'd re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Amazing Book!","review":"The Horse Whisperer, by Nicholas Evans, is one of the most amazing books I've ever read in my life. It really pulls you in emotionally. Since I have a horse, I found the accident so realistic it really shocked me. I give it 4 stars because I think the ending could be happier. To continue with tragedy is overkill. It didn't add to the realism of the book. It made me feel like, enough already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable book filled with emotion and inspiration!","review":"This book is my favorite!

I was impressed at the begining, but by the middle, I was bored. I could tell already that she was going to have an affair with some steamy love scenes, but if I wanted a tragic love story and sex, I would have read a trashy romance. I did like Gracie's story though. However, the ending of Annie's and Tom's was way too convenient! She didn't have to make any of her own decisions and didn't suffer the consequences of breaking her promises to her husband. She got off too easy.

Then it totally fell apart with incredibly bad descriptions and a totally predictable, stupid ending that made me yell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking sensitive novel","review":"I very much enjoyed The Horse Whisperer and have just re-read it after several years' interlude. The characters and storyline were as crisp and original as I remembered, and it was a pleasure to read. I found myself truly immersed in the characters and their fates. Several other reviewers have expressed disappointment in the surprise ending; however, I feel that Evans' purpose in choosing this denouement was simply to remind us that in 'real life', the hero does not always ride off into the sunset with the love of his life. Very realistic, enjoyable read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story is not the title.","review":"I read this book sometime back and never got around to posting a review but after reading some of the other psotings I felt an obligation to weigh in.Don't expect this stopry to be all about horses. I think it is naive to take a title and make assumptions about the book. I do not think the author ever intended this book to be for children who love horses. It is a story of pain and healing. A worthy read and the sex did not bother me. I think the author might have taken liberties of convienance plotwise at times, but other than that the story flowed well and was enjoyable. And I guess I'm in the minority, but the written ending did more for me than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly brilliant!","review":"I watched the film 'The Horse Whisperer' before reading the book and although I loved the film, I enjoyed the book even more. It is so wonderfully descriptive, that you feel for all the characters involved. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good solid read, one where you can't take your eyes off the pages for a second. It is one of the best books I've ever read, and that is a lot coming from someone who can't stand all that horsey stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed emotions","review":"This book gave me mixed emotions. For starters I felt that the author should have focused more on the horse whispering part and a little less on the romance. A little romance is O.K. but the author went a little far I felt. The fact that I love horses might be partial to my decision, but I still feel that all the romance was a little too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor ethics","review":"This book is well written, but it is horribly immoral and it buys in to the cultural lie that we should do whatever feels good no matter the pain we will cause others."},{"rating":"1","title":"'0' stars - Waste of Time & Mind","review":"I can honestly say, this is the worst book I have ever read. Not only is the writing flowery and annoying, the \\"put all genres into the story\\" reads more like a spoof Saturday Night Live piece, except this story isn't humorous, only laughable (if Evans was writing it today, he would have added some CSI blood and forensics to boot). Whoops, I am sorry, I don't recall any shooting guns; only the colors of Annie's various dresses (that list comes after her self-gratification, but basically around the time of her selfless act on her husband). I stuck it out till the end, which made me equally upset at myself as I was at Evans and everyone under the influence who rated this higher than a ONE. I can't summarize it any better than another reviewer, who states \\"The fact that this many people actually liked it says something about our morality as well as our literary sense.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I saw the movie when it first came out.

We haven't had it long enough to say anything about longevity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workable","review":"This replaced a Krups unit which was hard to clean. There are fewer crevices which require the use of a toothpick or knife tip to remove the food particles. As the bulk of the slicing object (meat, cheese) gets smaller, it tends to hang up at the bottom of the blade and shred. This was true for the Krups as well. The collecting tray looks nice, but positioning it properly to catch the slices can be a guess at best, and it will move out of position at the slightest disturbance. It ought to be able to snap into place and perhaps be on a swivel to move in or out of place. Best way I found to collect the slices was by hand, like some people do behind a deli counter. The vari-tilt, though possibly helpful, neither makes nor breaks the deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great slicer","review":"The slicer works as good as the reviews describe it.

Slices through semi-frozen beef without hesitation and slices evenly. Sliced \\"chipped\\" some turkey ham for sandwiches - just like deli-prepared slices. Super easy to clean. Tilting mechanism takes some getting used to for locking in place. Used oven cleaner to clean off the factory lubrication since I had no idea what it was made from - followed with hot sudsy water.

This product does a horrible job slicing uncooked beef thinly. Instead, I got shredded beef. This is not stated on the product description and since it clearly says it is up to the job of slicing meat, you would think it can slice uncooked beef. According to Chef's Choice, there are problems with slicing uncooked beef. You are not supposed to use this machine on frozen beef as it will ruin the blade. Again, this is not stated in the product description. In addition, If you still want to buy this machine, do not purchase from Golda's Kitchen because they have a horrible return policy. They would not let me return this product because it is used, but I would not have known the slicer does not do what the description says unless I tried it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"Skip the tilt feature, it is not useful.

Quickly, however, the reader catches on that this aw-shucks Andy Griffith is really a selfish, devilish, manipulator capable of deception and murder, all while smiling and charming the small towns various characters.

And what a great ending!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and tedious.","review":"Jim Thompson achieved a measure of posthumous fame in the 1990's with the reissue of a number of his books. The best thing I can say about this one is that the publisher did a great job of packaging the book. Thompson's writing style is very awkward. To the extent the book has any interest at all, it is in its attempt to tell a story from the point of view of a sociopath. This is not an easy thing to do, and I don't think Thompson pulls it off. There moments of black humor in the book. However, most of the time I felt that Thompson was simply doing the best he could to shock the reader, without much attempt to put together a believable story. The violence in the book, while probably extreme at the time it was published, is really not that bad given what is being written now or shown in films. Rather, the fault of the book is that, as hard as it tries to be shocking, ultimately it is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overdone, bad ending","review":"Pop. 1280 was published 12 years after Thomspon's classic The Killer Inside Me and tells a very similar story - but not as well. Killer was a serious crime story, Pop. 1280 departs from reality to the point where the people often come across as caricatures. The ending of the book was also very disappointing; it seemed that Thompson just ran out to things to say. The two stars are for the sometimes very witty writing and the intricate manipulations that are woven into the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Retread of a Brilliant Novel","review":"Pop. 1280 reads like a first draft of Thompson's brilliant The Killer Inside Me rather than a novel written twelve years later. Thompson wrote a tremendous number of novels during a very short period of time so it isn't surprising that some of them are misses and it's possible that Pop. 1280 was intended as a satirical take on his earlier novels -- though even read as satire the novel does not match the power of many of his ther novels.If you are new to Jim Thompson read The Killer Inside Me, The Grifters, or The Getaway first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have read in years","review":"In the beginning, it seemed as though this book was going to go somewhere interesting.

I think that if you have enjoyed the first 2 books then you will certainly enjoy this one. 4 stars for the excitement and drama in this book. Once again, i feel like a kid again everytime i read Colfer's books. He is a great author that grows with experience.Have fun reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cool!!! Gets Your Heart Racing! <kinda>","review":"It's really great! I've read all the Artemis Fowl Series, and not one of the books bore me. Have to try reading it! :D:D:DGood Luck!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"A good read, always interesting, the Eternity Code is very well-written.Artemis Fowl, thirteen-year-old criminal mastermind, makes the C-Cube, a hybrid of previously acquired (stolen) fairy equipment and human technology. The only problem is, that it's stolen by Jon Spiro, an American businessman. Once again, Artemis Fowl and Holly Short must grudgingly join forces to steal back the cube, just in case Spiro unlocks it secrets.But it's not as easy as just taking back the cube. Holly and Artemis are forced to call in Mulch Diggums yet again. Also on their force are Foaly, Juliet, and her older brother, known simply as Butler. An odd team, but who's complaining?The Eternity Code is full of wry humor from all characters and an adventurous air that keeps the pages turning. A book to read over and over, the Eternity Code is nothing short of wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely good read","review":"The Eternity Code, the third book in the popular Artemis Fowl series, is amazingly well written. Unlike some series, this sequel is completely different from the other two books, with a plot that takes place 95% of the time on the surface with the \\"Mud-Men.\\" I don't want to give away the story, but it is basically about Artemis' struggles with a corrupt American businessman over technology that was stolen from Artemis (who, of course, stole it from the People in the first place.) The important thing in this story is that Artemis' father, who has returned, wants the Fowl family to go straight, making this possibly young Master Fowl's last saga. I hope not, for this series is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great for kids and adult readers!!!!","review":"simple, clever and can't wait for the next book! Hurry Eoin Colfer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly good Book","review":"I liked this book very much because it had suspense and a lot of descriptive words. This book is a fairly long book but you will never want to put it down. This book also has a lot of similes and metaphors. This book there was two people I liked one was Butler and one was Artemis. Butler is very gallant; he is Artemis's body guard. Artemis talks in a very savvy way. He thinks he knows everything and he does. John Spiro kidnaps Artemis's C-Cube (mini super computer). Now Artemis must get back his computer before he finds out the secret language and the password and get back from the Spiro Needle (the building that the C-Cube is being held captive). Although Artemis has a lot of strident words in his vocabulary but they is still not enough to save the cube. After Artemis is captured he must rely on Butler and use his brains to outsmart the multi-billionaire John Spiro. Will Artemis ever get out of the Spiro Needle?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code","review":"This next book (in the Artemis series) is sure to be a winner. Before Artemis gives up the life of crime for his dad he has one last scheme.Artemis has constructed a super-computer made from fairy technology. He meets with a powerful Chicago business man, Jon Spiro. Jon Spiro steels the C-cube and mortally injures Artemis's Personal bodyguard, Butler. To save Butler, Artemis will have to ask his old rival, Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Artemis Fowl","review":"Purchased the Audio CDs for travel, and just like the other 2 books, Nathaniel Parker does an excellent job in narrating. If you enjoy Jim Dale (Harry Potter Series), you'll enjoy Nathaniel Park too.Book 3 offers a ton of adventure and suspense, but also contains highs and lows in the story line. Like every Artemis Book, it leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"New adventures for our favorite anti-hero!","review":"In this book, Artemis is still dangerously clever and selfish, but yet somewhat nicer now.

Eoin Colfer has created something toatally different then J.R.R Tolken, and C.S.(Clive Staples)Lewis. In this certain book, Artemis pulls off his greatest sceam yet, The C Cube. It adds new charecters, such as Jon Spyro, and yet keeps the best of the old ones, such as Foaly, Root, Holly, Juliet, and of course, Artemis and Butler. Artemis Fowl:The Eternity Code, truely tips the scales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book by Eion Colfer","review":"omg this waz such a good book i culd read ovr and ovr! totaly awesom good caracters 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eoin Colfer: Book Writing Genius!","review":"I could not put this book down. It was so interesting to read on how Artemis came up with ideas to save Butler and steal the stolen C-Cube. I enjoyed reading this book because in this one the stakes were a little higher as the clock wore down on the time that Butler had to live. It was so smart what he did to Jon Spiro and what Butler did to Arno Blunt to get them caught and so that they would confess. In the very end it looks as though Eoin left the story open possibly for a fourth book.. This was one of the best kids books that I have ever read, and I hope that Eoin Colfer comes out with another to wrap it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great cool amazing can not wait for the next one so much yes I'm literally eating my own tampon hahaha lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure beasht","review":"A book of epic proportions.

Artemis has stolen special fairy technology and plans to give to someone, Jon Spiro, who is a Billionaire. If Artemus is just going to give this away, he has a plan. The thing is that Spiro is nobody's fool, he has a plan of his own. As the events unfold, someone Artemis is very close to is gravely hurt. Perhaps Artemis isn't as cleaver as he thought he was. When he's pushed to the brink, Artemus comes up with a plan. As cleaver as he is, he can't do this alone. He needs help, and it's interesting who he gets help from. When Artemus' crew is gathered, he has special plans for Spiro. That's all I really want to say about the plot.What's not to like about this? This has it all; humor, fantastic writing, and many plot twists that will keep the reader glued to the page. I loved how Artemis is always three or four moves ahead of the bad guys. I was so glued to the book, I finished it in two sittings."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book...great series","review":"Eoin Colfer has delivered yet again.Artemis Fowl has developed a revolutionary computer called the C-Cube. One day, he decides to show it to billionaire Jon Spiro at a London restaurant. All of a sudden, everything has gone wrong. Jon Spiro has outsmarted Artemis. Butler has been shot and is near death. The C Cube is in the hands of Jon Spiro. The C Cube is locked by an Eternity Code. It can only be cracked by Artemis. Inside it, Fairy secrets are held. Only one thing will save Butler and possibly get the C Cube back. Fairy technology. Along with Mulch Diggins, Holly is back to save Butler and save the People.Eoin Colfer has definitely delivered. This book has so many twists and turns that they are uncountable. The magical tales of Artemis Fowl are great and everyone should read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"On a scale of 10, I would rate the first book a 9, the second book a 7 and this book a 6 (but lean toward 4 stars instead of 3). This book seems a bit rushed and thrown together. Not as creative as the other two and not as easy to read. We get the usual characters and it gets pulled off pretty well. Still, I would only read it after reading the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"write more artemis fowl","review":"atrimis fowl the eternity code is a really great book! i can't wait until the next book comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fowl Fans Should Love This One","review":"The third book in the Artemis Fowl series seems a little darker than the first two, but still a fun read. Artemis is brilliant as ever, and pretty much five steps ahead of all the adults of any species he runs into. I liked particularly the development of Julia as a character--a young, take-charge kind woman who does her own thing. The ending is a cliffhanger, leaving you wanting the next book, and quickly, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"the third","review":"I personally think this is the worst of the three. That doesn't mean it isn't good. I would get a 4th one. I didn't like the ending. It didn't fit with the story and didn''t seem to be an end. Other than that it was a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Arty is back","review":"Artemis Fowl is a 13 year old genius. Butler, his bodyguard,has been trained in a school for bodyguars. Holly Short is part of the L.E.P-recon fairy police. Foaly is the L.E.Ps technological mastermind.In Artemis Fowl The Eternity Code, John Spiro tries to steal Artemis'sC Cube. John Spiro's Bodyguard kills Butler, and they escape. Artemis preserves butlers body, and gets Foaly to send Holly Short to him. Holly brings Butler Back to life, but it takes 15 years off of his life because she didn't have enough majic to do it without the body helping. Can Artemis get the C Cube back?I think this book was wonderful. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes science fiction, or fantasy. If you have read the other Atemis Fowl books, then you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colfer Still Has It, Just Not as Much","review":"I enjoyed this just as I did the previous two books in the series, but it seemed to be a little lower on the scale. The first is by far the best, but the second was quite good as well. This one started off well enough, but after Butler \\"ages\\" things seems to get a little off track. Once the book gets back on target it seems a little too predictable at times. It started off so well and I was really looking forward to it, but I think the lack of the underworld's involvement in the story hurt. There were parts that kept me yearning for me though so overall I give this book a good rating and I will read the 4th installment for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I originally was skeptical about reading this series because I heard that it was a mixture of fantasy and science fiction, and those aren't my favorite genres. However,when my sister brought it back from the library I decided to try it. I literally couldn't put it down! The story was well written, it was very funny, and it was much better than the average dime-a-dozen fantasy or science fiction novel. I haven't yet read the first two but I will shortly hopefully, along with the later ones too, of course! I wholeheartedly give this book five stars. My only regret is that I didn't read Artemis Fowl and The Arctic Incident first."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same, which isn't altogether a bad thing.","review":"Artemis Fowl - The Eternity Code is the third Artemis Fowl book.This is clearly a teen book and not aimed at adults, but I discovered it on a list of books for \\"those who were going through Harry Potter withdrawals.\\"It isn't Harry Potter by any stretch of the imagination. And it isn't perfect. But it is very readable and with the exception of the over-the-top dwarf character (Mulch Diggums) it is constructed well enough that the story is fun and surprising.I found the second book in the series slightly more enjoyable than the first. This one was good as well, but \\"killing\\" characters that do not end up dead at the end of the book is becoming a bit of a literary crutch for Mr. Colfer.I've read through the third book now and have ordered the fourth. They are not great works of art, but certainly readable and worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, fun character","review":"None of the Artemis Fowl books are as good as the Harry Potters.

With the same tempo and tune dominating each song, and with lyrics that mean nothing (that is if you can understand them), this album has no originality. I realize that originality is not what punk is known for, but this is pathetic. Punk should move you to action, whether socially, through the lyrics, or physically, through the music.

Vance even puts doubt to the feeling that we, earthmen, have the superior culture, and that is centuries before we even contact the others, which is showing quite some foresight indeed. All is done within the usual style of the master and it makes you wonder why 'The Dragonmasters' received such acclaim, while this book didn't. Did Jack Vance insult too many artcritics with this one? Have they the ability to read between the lines as well?

We are big fans of anything serial killer plus lots of blood and gore. We didn't know what to expect with this movie but we were pleasantly surprised. This movie was great!! There is a psychological thriller going on while at the same time there is plenty of blood and violence. I'm not going to give the end away, but there is even a twist at the end, we didn't see it coming from a mile away.On the negative side, this movie was done on a low end budget and you can tell in some of the effects but they are still very effective. Also, the premise is a little unrealistic but just go along for the ride and you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchable but not especially good","review":"This movie was just ok. On one hand, the production values are quite high especially relative to what I expected. The cast also isn't half bad, and it's a bit fun to see the little girl from one of the latter Halloween movies (part 5?) all grown up. So with the production and the cast, it's good enough to watch and you won't necessarily regret having done so.On the other hand, the story isn't that good. From nearly the first five minutes, the entire movie is completely predictable so don't expect any surprises. It's also not particularly effective; the pacing is slow and the conflict moments lack impact.If you're looking at this for Tiffany Shepis, know she has a very limited role as a mother figure, not the role she typically plays and which has earned her some measure of fame.Recommended as a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well","review":"I bought this movie because I'm a huge Lance Henriksen fan. The movie is kind of mindless. I would have gone a different direction with this movie. I'm not wanting to reveal anything about the movie.

But I wanted to have an electric kettle for my two annual tea parties, so I did keep and use it.I used it *only* for these parties, of which I have two every winter. On each occasion, I used this kettle to boil perhaps eight pots of water. And the kettle lasted no more than three winters (possibly two--I don't recall exactly when I got it) before it stopped working. Now the light doesn't come on, and the water doesn't get heated.So after no more than 48 uses (2 tea parties x 3 years x 8 pots of tea), I have an ugly, dead electric kettle.

Even the faxed document comes out to be with disappointing poor quality.This product appears to have the right idea of including highly integrated office automation functions.

There are several good ones available from Amazon.com and they allow you to play DVDs from anywhere in the world.

What else could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Show on Television","review":"Two and a Half Men is one of the funniest shows on television and is destined to become a classic. We've watched the shows on TV, and the DVDs at least 2 times since they finally came out.Basic story line is that one Brother, Alan is getting divorced, moves in with brother Charlie and brings his son Jake for the weekends. They become a sort of dysfunctional family and the show takes off from there. The acting is great, the humor is definitely adult and risque but lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE ONLY SHOW I WATCH WHERE I ACTUALLY LAUGH OUT LOUD!","review":"THIS IS THE FUNNIEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN.

I have loved it since it's first show. The entire cast make a great ensemble, working off of one another in great comedic timing. I have checked after every season to see if they will begin selling the DVD, I am sorry they have not yet made the series for public sale. I hope when they do, they put all of the current seasons on DVD and sell all of them in a boxed set. My vote would be a resounding yes for getting the DVD's out to the public.

The hijinks 2 men and a kid or really, 3 big kids, get into are hilarious and it's written from a man's point of view. I find myself learning about the male psyche and laughing hysterically at the same time. The first episodes obviously explain alot of stuff, what Charlie does for a living, how Allen ended up at his house, where Rose came from! It's a little cheesy but irresistible not to like. Besides any show where you can see Ducky, is worth watching, Jon Cryer is a great actor and my favorite brat packer of all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Debbie and her 2 1/2 men","review":"Myself and my 14 year old son love this show.

His sense of humor is fantastic, my 14 year old is so impressed with his style. Jake the kid on the show is excellent and right on time with his smart mouth and comebacks. Great show, great set of videos.

Watch out world when he is truly discovered, I wonder if it will ever happen? He is the most taleneted lyricist, poet if you will I have heard.Hauntingly beautiful.Every song is amazing, truly a remarkable album. Reminds me of the first time I heard Chris Isaak in Paris before he was anybody, but still blows him away.Ballad of Georgie and Young Turks mixed and swirled(Rod Stewart). I am in love, not just with this album, but with everything that this album makes you realize how much you love..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a rainy morning...","review":"I first heard David Gray's hauntingly captivating voice on NPR when my alarm radio was sounding one rainy Monday morning. In my sleepy incoherence, I was sure it was the voice of Dylan but was confused as I imagined him not with his one-man-band instruments but rather surrounded by technical music making devices. As I continued to remain in this state of waking, Gray's lyrics and easy sounds traveled with me through my wanderlusting imagination as I pictured myself in a string of enchantingly unconscious travels. Now, when I listen to David Gray's White Ladder, I am reminded of this rainy morning and long to crawl into bed and return to those travels in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Morrison would be proud","review":"Heard Gray for the first time on a local independent station and fell in love with \\"Babylon\\" . . . if you had any doubts about Gray find this song and listen to it. Between \\"Please forgive me\\" and \\"This Year's Love\\" the poetics are certainly reminiscient of fellow Irishman Van Morrison. Gray goes so far as to quote \\"Into the Mystic\\" in one of the tracks! Definitely worth a listen - lyrically loaded for a freshman album. Future work will most probably improve upon the instrumental quality - while definitely formidable, the voice and lyrics deserve better. Mark my words . . . a possible legend in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gray's Babylon and Beyond","review":"David Gray is a wonderful talent I just discovered from the U.K. Somehow I'm not surprised that someone this good and this talented was forced to cut the album himself in his own flat and then release it himself. It is a sad commentary on the music industry that those who \\"self-publish\\" deliver a better product musically. Gray was deservedly up for a Grammy with the single track of \\"Babylon\\" on this disc. Once you hear it, it is almost impossible to turn off. In fact, hubby has started complaining because I play and replay and play it again so frequently. If I had to pick another artist who reminds me of Gray, it would be James Taylor. Gray is more original than Taylor though as the work is all solely his whereas Taylor relies heavily on songwriters, such as the late Laura Nyro for his biggest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"A local radio station in Vermont began playing David Gray's 'White Ladder' and immediately it caught my attention. His music, lyrics, and style will work it's way into your soul. Ireland surely should be proud of this very talented musician. If you want to enjoy and relax to some great music, get this CD. It is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID","review":"It's a bold statement, but truly - this is unlike almost anything I've ever heard. It's pop, but not quite. Alternative rock, yet quite mellow. Folky - just a twinge. But it adds up to a sound quite enjoyable and unique. The tracks are crisp and catchy, and listening almost makes me feel... \\"clean\\" at times. It's simply really clean music. And if you are ever able to take advantage of those special features on the enhanced CD -check 'em out. There are a few live clips from shows, and just seeing them once gave me a better appreciation for this guy's energy, if you ever doubt it from just listening. Certainly, some tracks are better than others (it starts off quite strong and then sags a tad in the middle), but finding an album this solid nowadays (in this world of synthesized boring bubblegum cheesy-pop), is extremely refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD","review":"No, I have no affiliation with DG but this is clearly the best release I've EVER heard from a solo artist except possibly for Paul McCartney, my personal music god. This CD is a little dark, a little moody and a little mellow, but those are not drawbacks. It's just how it is, and his lyrics and melodies and production are all unique and simply fantastic. All very personal songs. I'd call this CD as close as you get these days to a masterpiece. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Talent","review":"Having only heard of David Gray for the first time a couple of weeks ago I was introduced to him via the single Babylon. I delved deeper into the album and found what looked to be a familiar track so I immediately listened to it.It turned out to be an absolutely brilliant version of the Soft Cell track \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\".Since then I have played it to friends and we all agree that David Gray is well worth getting into if you want to \\"chill out\\". Russell Hall 07/05/2000"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"This CD is in a class of its own. Every song is perfectly blended. I purchased this CD for \\"Babylon\\" and got a whole lot more. I am looking forward to hearing more from David Gray."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gray is THE MAN","review":"I love David Gray. Enough said. His lyrics are wonderful, his style of music is phenomenal, and the whole deal about him recording a CD without all the fanfare... Seems others must like him like Bonnie Raitt.. remaking Silver Lining... which I must add, he's much Bettah! Track 1 is one of those songs that remind me of summer, cruising down the interstate as fast as my foot will allow... :) If you love Irish accents, love poetical lyrics that are instantly adored, here's your next CD :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Music","review":"I think I first heard his music in the film Serendipity. He has one of those unusual voices that for some reason provoke reflection. If I remember correctly from reading about the CD, he produced it himself and created all of the music. I really enjoy listening to it. Anticipating more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected...","review":"...and that about sums it up! I loved the song, Babylon, and purchased this CD because I felt that the writer/vocalist of that song must surely be able to compile a memorable CD. The fact that two versions of Babylon are on the CD should have been a tip of sorts. Clearly, the version I enjoy so much is one that has been worked with in the studio. Some producer somwhere obviously felt the need to remix the song in order to give it the style and feel that made it the hit it was. The remaining tracks reveal the mediocre ability of the artist. I really was ready to love this CD when it arrived, but after five listenings, my feelings remain the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's awesome","review":"i bought this for my wife for Christmas and as soon as i heard it i knew it was gonna be in my CD player for a long time and we'd have to go and buy her another copy. This is simply one of the best CD's i have ever listened to. it ranks right up there with the first DMB CD (Remember Two Things). if you like anything that DMB has done or if you just like good music you cant go wrong with this CD. if you dont believe look at the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drum Machines are best used in moderation....","review":"If you liked the early David Gray for the raw emotion and stripped down delivery of those great songs, don't buy this album expecting more of the same. From the first song, the replacing of the rythym section with a drum machine and keyboard is apparent, and annoying. You can tell the songs are quality, if you can get past that, but I find this album unlistenable as I am continually trying to imagine what the songs would sound like with a human backline."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Ladder","review":"David Gray has stolen my heart.

David Gray has had a long, mostly unknown career, but all that changed last year with the amazing success of \\"Babylon\\" on the US radio and MTV. I'm always cautious about buying a CD based on 1 song, but when I bought it Mr Gray did not disappoint. This is a CD that is worthy of being in my collection, next to classics from all eras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"David Gray's White Ladder is absolutely the best CD I've heard in years. There is not a song on there that I don't like. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G and unoriginal","review":"David Gray seems like a very nice guy. But his music leaves much to be desired. This record sounds like a drum machine track was set to keep pace and these mediocre songs were recorded over that. The songwriting is pedestrian and his quivering voice is annoying. As a fan of singer-songwriters, I was recommended this CD and could not have been more bored. What a disappointment. I'd recommend this only to those who find something insipid like Jewel to be \\"deep.\\" For the rest, go buy an Aimee Mann or Elvis Costello CD instead. Hell, reach back further and buy Joni Mitchell or Bob Dylan album. Can't go wrong on any of those. Even fans of that dreadful Dave Matthews shouldn't be fooled by this. DON'T CLIMB THE 'WHITE LADDER'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to be different but...","review":"I first heard this album several years ago, in 2001 in fact, and fondly remembered \\"Babylon\\" and \\"Please Forgive Me\\" ( the video to the latter is pretty cool ) so as I hear Babylon more and more on the radio I got caught up in it's beauty and ordered the whole album. My girlfriend and I agree the rest is whiny and dragging. 2 tracks does not make a whole album."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, REPETATIVE, UNIMAGINATIVE...STINKS","review":"Here's what ya do. Play the same three chord progression over and over. Every now and then throw in a minor chord to make the song appear to have a chorus or a bridge. Moan the lyrics, attempting to do a bad impression of either Dave Matthews or Bob Dylan. Get some critic enamoured with your words of longing and love, hope you get a good \\"alternative\\" review. If you do your home free....for at least a few albums, and then hopefully disappear.This poor guy does not have an origional musical bone in his body. He's the darling of the moment, and without a mention from Dave Mathews would have gone nowhere. I'm trading this one in at the record store asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Money","review":"I Loved the first single Babylon. But that's it. The rest of it is boring.

In the mood of Simon and Garfunkle and the real all time greats. Buy this album! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong collection of songs","review":"David Gray is a great songwriter and singer. This CD was a very pleasant discovery. The standout track is Please Forgive Me, which received a great deal of airplay in Ireland (where he is huge), but the standard is very high overall. Occasionally the home production detracts somewhat but mostly the spare sound highlights his vocals well. I will definitely check out his earlier stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great Ablum","review":"I absolutely love this album.

It is the all-time best selling album in Ireland (seriously!!), eclipsing even the likes of U2, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. There's a reason why; buy it and find out for yourself. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"White ladder to the top ....","review":"Mixing techno funk beats with traditional folk guitar, Britain-based David Gray delivers an album with soulful lyrics to drive to, to cry to, to keep in the background. Without fail, a CD that emotes personal and vulnerable song writing set against the backdrop of clever melodies. Gray's voice is reminiscent of Bob Dylan, but it's his modern-day twist of synthesized beats that separates him from just another guitar strumming raconteur. Selections like \\"Babylon\\", \\"Sail Away\\", and \\"This Year's Love\\" are reflective of Gray's great poetry. Though the album as a whole proves to be seamless, some tunes stand indistinguishably similar to the next, providing a rather even, presumably repetitive at times, set. However,if you're looking for a mellow Sunday morning album, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I had never heard of David Gray until I caught him on Letterman. I had heard \\"Babylon\\" on the radio but it was the live performance that really drove it home. This album is pure joy to listen to. The opening track \\"Please Forgive Me\\" is one of the most plaintive and endearing odes to love I've ever heard, and the driving bassline and drums make it a pop gem. \\"My Oh My\\" has a wonderful dreamy quality to it. The rest of the album is equally superb, with the alternate version of \\"Babylon\\" being especially welcome. One only hopes that Mr. Gray continues (he's been around for a while so why shouldn't he) to redefine pop music for the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, buy buy buy","review":"When first hearing \\"Babylon\\", I thought it was a breath of fresh air for the monotonus music scene here in the US. \\"White Ladder\\" is a good album, but what makes it great is Grey himself. It is what he injects in his songs that has people comparing him to Bob Dylan and Van Morrision. On hearing the first track, my first thought was, \\"Damn, he really is a dead ringer for Dylan.\\" ^_^, well, before I digress, \\"White Ladder\\" is one of the best albums of the year. The only reason why it dosen't get a 5 is because I just don't believe in giving perfect scores.Also, you should definitely check out some of his earlier stuff, like \\"Flesh,\\" \\"Sell Sell Sell\\" and \\"A Century Ends\\", which is supposed to be as good (if not, better??) as \\"White Ladder\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy this CD over a glass of wine","review":"I just recently found out who David Gray was about 4 months ago. Never heard his name or his music. A friend of mine insisted that I listen to his cd while we enjoyed a bottle of wine and great conversation. I don't know how to describe his voice or music. It's beautiful though. It draws many emotions out of you. \\"This Year's Love\\" is my favorite. It's quite addictive and I find myself playing it over and over again. I don't know what to expect with his new album, but if it's anything similiar to this one, it will soon be a new favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better live","review":"heartfelt and gorgeous soundscapes that take you into other worlds.

I had the good fortune of seeing David Gray open for Shawn Colvin several years ago and was struck by the simple and honest approach. This CD, much like the live performance is a testimonial to his quiet confidence. The music is presented to stand on its' own merit, it is that good. No puff, glam or overblown attempt at grabbing your emotions - it will take them anyway. You will enjoy this and he will be glad you did! Water in the desert for weary travelers -ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better in the \\"Flesh\\"","review":"This album is simply brilliant! I listen to it every day. I had never heard of David Gray and someone gave this CD to me and it is a revelation. It is soulful,powerful, and quite poetic. I have listened to \\"Flesh\\" and that too is amazing. You must see him live, though, because he is even better, awe inspiring!!!! I am in love!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing album","review":"while in no way suggesting that david gray is just another variation of the coldplay sound, because he is DEFINITELY not, this album, for me, put me in the same kind of headspace. wonderful use of piano, guitar, voice, and everything else at his disposition, White Ladder is top of the cd pile type stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...So that's David Gray","review":"I heard of David Gray before, but never really knew his music or anything about him. That all changed last Wednesday. On my friends' recommendations, I went out an purchased the White Ladder album and I was totally blown away. His voice and lyrics complement each other so well. If you listen carefully to each song's lyrics, you understand his perspective. Each track is excellent, but we all have our favorites. A few of mine include \\"This Years Love\\" (AMAZING!), \\"Say Hello Wave Goodbye,\\" and \\"Sail Away.\\" But, these are just a few. Pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Years Love","review":"This is one of the years best albums (i'm not sure when it was first released so i'm refering to 2000). 'This Years Love' is a beautiful piano ballad and is probably my favourite on the album. This enhanced version of the CD includes both versions of 'Babylon', and both are brilliant. Every track is good but two that stand out for me are 'My Oh My' and 'Please Forgive Me' which are both simply stunning. A great album from a great guy. Well done Davd Gray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This album is pretty amazing. Babylon is great but my favourite on this disc is Nightblindness. The songs tend to repeat the same formula and I don't care for the use of electronica, but all in all this is a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"White Ladder\\" Nothing Remarkable","review":"Wow. It's rare to see an album rated a clean 5 stars across the board, and for that reason alone I was willing to give this record a listen. Add to that the facts that I love the song \\"Babylon\\" and that Dave Matthews, whom I respect, claims to have listened to this record almost exclusivly for months. Armed with that information, I was prepared for a record that would sit at the top of my collection for a good, long time.Ho-hum. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Perhaps it's just the hyperbolic whiplash inherent in overexpectation. Perhaps it's that David Gray writes lyrically mediocre songs then records them with undistinguished musical backing. Perhaps it's his grating voice, which works well on a single song, but annoys on an entire CD.I won't dispute the hundreds of other reviewers here and elsewhere who loved this album unquestionably. I'll just assume that I'm missing something and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh yyyyeeeaaaahhhh!","review":"this cd is great! his music is so deep. \\"this year's love\\" gives me chills! get this cd!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary Masterpiece","review":"I wanted to write a review on this album because I have been listening to it for many years and I can\`t help to love it everyday some more.This albums is brilliant, David Gray is considered as the best songwriter since Bob Dylan and I do believe he is one of the greatest indeed.

So light even if the topics can be dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan-Like","review":"With today's music in the whirlwind it is in, David Gray brings back a sense of realism with his lastest album White Ladder. The recording has a \\"live\\" sound to it because of it's simplicity. Gray is a true poet and musician and his album gives you that inspiration. It is simple and pure with no money or contracts backing it up. No offense Moby. White Ladder has a folky-blues sound to it and if you search hard enough inside yourself you can almost feel as if you are sitting in the living room with Gray as you hear his lastest creation.

Truely a CD that you can listen to from the beginning to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Listening","review":"Though this is David Gray's 4th album, it was the first that I have heard. I heard him on a Dave Matthews live album, and was intrigued. The next day I went to the record shop and bought this record. I certainly am glad that I did. The entire album is soft, mellow, and could put you to sleep. However, the album is anything but boring. Gray's mix of folk, electronica, and rock is irrisistible. Tracks like \\"Babylon\\" and \\"Sail Away\\" could be Top 40 hits, while others like \\"This Year's Love\\" are nothing but beautiful. His songwriting is good, if not great, but the style on this album is what makes is worth buying. The moods and feelings he evokes with his voice and his soothing music styles say more than his words can. The album can be depressing at times, but he always lifts you back up. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gray or Mikey Graham? Who can tell......","review":"Listening to this album on a hot lazy afternoon is possibly the most exquisite experience one could ever be fortunate enough to undergo! This album collates some of David's best work to date and as such is like musical heaven. This years love is possibly my favourite track, the songs lyrical undertones come across with the subtlety only a genius could command. Overall I find the album can only come a very close second to that recently released by the artist Mikey Graham (meet me halfway) in terms of musical accomplishment, with each album serving only to further enhance the enjoyment of the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best musician i've discovered this year","review":"I fell in love with \\"Babylon\\" the first time I heard the video on MTV2 (I was washing dishes, facing away from the tv). I didn't know what the song was about and didn't care -- the music was beautiful, raw, simple. I finally bought a copy of White Ladder a few days ago and the album is everything Babylon promised and more. It's uplifting, edgy, romantic, melancholy -- pure emotion given voice with simple arrangements. Gray doesn't hide anything behind the synthesized pop machines that are so prevalent in modern music, and that's a blessing for us all. What an exquisite album from an incredibly talented singer/songwriter. I've become an instant David Gray fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"When I first heard about this album - it was from an email message from Dave Matthews- so I thought all right- I'll check it out. I wasn't prepared for what I was in for. The music of David Gray is absolutely stunning. Babylon just grabs you- as does all the other songs. This CD definitely belongs in your cd collection- its mellow- but at the same time- extremely catchy- oooooohhhhh! Will you stop reading and just order it now! You wont be disappointed! A worthwhile investment! Peace love and DMB- KAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is a master piece. Words cant describe it.","review":"Before I heard of Dave Gray I thought jeff Buckley was my musical saviour.IF your open to being musicly touched this is the one for you.I will personally guarantee it and if your not happy Ill give you your money back.I LIVE in sydney and if you know of any other artist like dave gray please e mail me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It","review":"As a professional musician, I have listened to enormous amounts of music in my life, from every genre and in every style imaginable. That said, I can honestly say that I was pleasantly surprised by this album. The more I listened to it, the more it grew on me. There are no bad tracks, and they flow seamlessly (dare I say organically?) one into another, from beginning to end. It is *not* the kind of album you buy for the hit, then use as a coaster a few weeks later (although the \\"hit\\", Babylon, is, in fact, a great tune). This is the real deal. This is music. I already know I'll still be listening to it twenty years from now. That *never* happens. I seriouly can't think of a single bad thing to say about this album. Buy it and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"This is an album that will be in heavy rotation on your CD player for months. David Gray has a genius for putting together rhythm and poignant, searing lyrics. He's really putting all of himself in the songs, and as a listener you only know that you are grateful to him and that you've found something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't miss this album","review":"It is no wonder that David Gray was the first musician signed by Dave Matthews himself to his new record label. Every single song on this album is original rock, and his voice is perfect for his music. \\"Babylon\\" is such a cool song i just listen to it over and over again. Get this album there is a reason why David Gray is all over the States now. Don't miss out on one of the best CD's in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop playing this CD","review":"I wish radio stations would play something this extraordinary. I got turned on to this CD from my son, who's a 28 year old attorney. I am from the Dylan generation. And David Gray is able to cross all those lines and more and at the same time establish himself as a new presence in music. He's simply great, and I have listened to and loved all of the great singer-songwirters of the last half of the 20th century. He's perhaps the first great one of the 21st."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Captivating","review":"Gray has done what seems to be increasingly difficult to do in the modern music industry: create quality music. \\"White Ladder\\" is such an enjoyable work that I cannot stop listening to. His voice and the instrumentation are so perfectly suited for each other. Nothing is superfluous or forced about this album. I know after hearing this album that I will always be the first to get to the record store to buy any new album he puts out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't keep it around...","review":"Since I received this CD I can't seem to keep it in my office. Everyone is borrowing it. I had heard Babylon on the airwaves and loved it, but was not dissappointed by anything else on this CD. Excellent words and music. I happened to catch David Gray et al. on Austin City Limits and was further impressed. He has a great drummer. It was very interesting listening to the interview on ACL as David spoke of his influence by Dylan, Morrison etc. and how the best tracks on White Ladder had happened when he gave up emulating other artists and just went with songs whose lyrics had just been written the night before and were kind of put together in a jam session. That's truly what creativity is all about--just going with what you feel. He has truly found himself in this album. I can't wait for more. I read all the reviews before I purchased and I am so happy that I did and appreciate this avenue for comparison and customer input.Definately a great buy, a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than I'd hoped","review":"I've been a David Grey fan for a couple of years now, and was pleased that he had a new album coming out. After seeing him live in a small club (I've never seen an audience cheer so hard for an encore), I knew I had to have the new album.I was a bit put off at first by the techno beats he'd been using on the songs I'd heard before buying it; Mr. Gray has always been very straight-forward in his musical stylings -- nothing artificial or contrived. But that fear faded at once when I got the album in the CD player. Start to finish, this is easily up to par with his previous three albums -- maybe even better, which is saying a lot. The music is smooth, atmospheric, and heartfelt. The electronic portions fade right in; they're used as an effective tool, rather than simply to make the music seem trendily cool.It's been a long time since I latched onto an album this quickly. If you've heard anything at all by Mr. Gray and liked it, get this album. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and well done","review":"This is an excellent album. David Gray's voice is soulful and hypnotic. When a tune is done you want to hear more. Best cuts are Babylon and Sail Away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"I bought this CD because I was considering going to a David Gray concert in Seattle, and had never heard any of his music. I loved the CD, but then found out that the concert had been sold out for months. It's a wonderful CD, and has a thoughtful Cat Stevens/James Taylor kind of quality to it. It's the best CD I've bought in years, and I recommend it very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gray's White Ladder...","review":"is a wonderful collection of songs. I had bought it for the song \\"Sail Away\\" but found many more to love. His remake of Soft Cell's \\"Say Hello Wave Goodbye\\" (one of my favorite Soft Cell songs) is especially well-done. I was not disappointed at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's simple....","review":"nothing more to say really other than this cd is simply a must have. One listen and I was hooked.. hard!'Say Hello, Wave Goodbye' & 'Please forgive me' are my favorites tracks but every other is wonderful.Although I dont agree much with the comparisons to Van Morrison (the god) and Dylan, I suppose it doesnt hurt to be mentioned in that company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladies & Gentlemen We've Found A Winner","review":"David Gray is amazing if you but one Cd let this be it. I brought this Cd and haven't been able to take it out of my player it is the best cd I've bought in a long time. Just take a chance and buy it I'm sure you will be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"The best thing about this CD is that you can use your \\"back\\" button to get a truly hidden track just before track one. But that song, like the rest of the album lulls and relies on a cheesy machine to back up what essential aren't very good songs. Maybe he's done better, maybe he's done worse. I'd never heard of him before and I'd rather I didn't have the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"the cd, well its boring. i know that few people will read this being that it is so far back in the review section, but this cd is boring and redundant. without the help of Dave this man would be no where. his cd is alright, and babylon is a good song the first 5 times you listen to it, but it gets boring and the rest of the cd is very similiar. if you want a good new artist, listen to Jack Johnson, that is worth the money. i am either going to let \\"white ladder\\" sit in the back of my cd collection and get no play, or get rid of it... i really dont see what all the fuss is about. this man's album will be gone in a couple of years. i will give him this much, on stage it looks like he loves what he does, but i sure dont... DONT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD, buy brushfire fairytales by JACK JOHNSON is worth the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot get it to Charge IPOD Touch","review":"This unit packs a wallop of sound!

I don't think it's worth of spending X2 as much on Bose unit, I would rate it second right after Bose. All the other units don't even come close to what this Klipsch can deliver at this price range. Comes with neat remote. Usually my best second half don't agree with my electronics purchases ( I buy a lot) but this time is different...If You're looking for speaker system for Your iPod this is it!!! Buy it and and don't think You will regret this purchase after You set it up (very easy) and listen to it at home...Happy Holidays everyone and lets hope this coming new year will be better than the last one for all of us here in the US and all over the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not charge 4th gen ipod nano","review":"sounds great but does not charge the nano 4th generation - not sure why apple has changed voltage on new products - BIG hassle to have to charge unit on USB cable since aftermarket chargers don't even work with nano 4g"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound until iPod Locks up","review":"What a waste of money this was. My iPod locks up every single time I use it in the iGroove. It may play for 15 minutes or it may play for an hour but sooner or later the iPod will freeze completely and nothing I do will have any affect. I have to wait for the iPod to charge down then after a recharge it will work flawlessly (until I put it back in iGroove).Pass on the iGroove. I didn't expect audiophile sound for the price but I did expect the thing to work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something else","review":"This unit WILL NOT charge your IPOD TOUCH. The adapter plates don't work with the TOUCH either. I would of thought that the manufacturer would of had this issue addressed buy now. I waited awhile before purchasing in hopes of avoiding this issue. I was wrong!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this product 5 months ago. Immediately, I didn't like the power cord. The connection will not fit properly (I'm assuming this is supposed to be a breakaway cord.) You must position the cord perfectly flat and level to maintain a connection. The sound is good and I felt I could deal with the issues with the cord. Now 5 months later, when I dock my Ipod I cannot get any sound. For a while I could unplug the unit and then the sound would work. Now nothing and the product is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than I expected!","review":"I bought this for my bedroom and I was initially concerned that it would be too bulky. It's really a little streamlined dynamo and I love it! The sound is great for the room I have it in and it's incredibly easy to set up and use. Overall a great purchase and I would recommend it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Avoid Avoid","review":"This looks lovely and worked like a dream and then, one day, it died. Outside of warranty. Amazon don't want to know and Klipsch UK aren't interested either. You get what you pay for. Save a little longer and get a Bose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"Bought this for $69.99 during the deal of the day sale, now it's on a lightning sale for $70.00 - must be on sale so often because it's not fully compatable with most of the newer ipods or iphones.Regardless of that, it BROKE in the first week of use - somehow the internal electronics shorted out and it went to FULL VOLUME, sounded like the speakers blew out so we un-plugged it. The controls on top of the unit never worked again after that so we sent it in for refund.I would not suggest buying this for anyone with newer apple hardware. I would not suggest buying this for anyone who wants a powered speaker setup that will last longer than a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"Hi, I bought the system less than 7 months ago. First of all, when you turned the sound up, there was background hissing. Then the volume became frozen at a lower level. I cannot turn it up or down. The last problem is that I cannot turn it off either with the remote or on the unit itself. I have to unplug it to turn it off. It is unbelievable that after just a short time the unit is operating so poorly. I would never recommend buying this product. What a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use with Nano Chromatic","review":"Does not recharge the Nano and drains the battery very fast.But the speakers themselves are nice and clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for a Klipsch product","review":"I was really disappointed by the Klipsch docking station, especially considering the generally high quality of Klipsch speakers. This product doesn't produce balanced sound. I wasn't expecting something like the more expensive Bose docking station, but I had read from other reviews that Klipsch would still have very good sound.Consider buying Klipsch's speaker system with subwoofer for the computer, just as I have for my home computer. It's just a little more expensive, but the sound blows the Klipsch docking station away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"I was happy for the first 10 hours of play with the system but then the volume control stuck on HIGH which can be more than problematic. I always had a high opinion of Klipsch products but that, too, has changed.

It has great sound and a small size. I have it on my desk at work. Highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal at the current price","review":"Pretty decent sound, but not necessarily representative of what I'd expect from Klipsch. If I'd paid $150 or more, which was the price when it was originally released a year or so ago, I wouldn't be very happy, but for about $75, it's well worth the money. Also very nice looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dead and gone","review":"I was loving the Klipsch groove for 13 months until today. Sound died this morning and now all I have is a rather large ipod charger!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great while it lasts","review":"I've had this for a little over a year and was very happy with it. Great sound for a small unit. Then this week it suddenly stopped playing. The lights come on, but no sound from the ipod docked or when plugged into the back. I guess that's why it has only a 1 year warranty. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Klipsch v AltechLansing","review":"Having owned Altec inMotion speakers for XMRadio/Pioneer Units, decided to try the Klipsch iGroove SXT Speaker. Looks good, but ends there, the iPod Touch 3G falls out of the dock (does not lock), the power supply failed within hours of setting it up - sent it back and ordered the Altec inMotion Compact iM310 for the iPod. The iPod does not fall out, the unit is totally portable/foldable, deep bass, it charges the iPod, and can be used with batteries, unlike the Klipsch plus a 2 year warranty to boot - what a great deal only $65 v $150 for the Klipsch from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Low Amazon Price","review":"HUUUGE sound for such a little device. I had no idea how tiny this thing would be but it's so easy to carry around from room to room. I got it for my mom and she brings it with her in the kitchen, in the bathroom while she showers, and in her bedroom. Fantastic product and the price on amazon is like half the price of what best buy sells it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as my Bose!","review":"I bought this for work. I'm a Dementia nurse and music is the best \\"drug\\" for my patients. The sound from this machine is exceptional.

It's everything I hoped for, especially given that it was about 1/3 the cost of similar Bose player!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Gift","review":"I received this as a gift and plugged it in within minutes. I love that there are only a few buttons to work with and was so amazed by the sound quality coming from something this compact. I was dancing for joy.Because of its small size, I can take it from room to room increasing the volume, still obtaining high-quality sound.The iGroove fits nicely on my nightstand, so I've set the alarm to it and wake up to excellent, crisp, clear sounding tunes. This is the perfect gift and I love it. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo.","review":"I am very disappointed. I got this as a gift for Christmas.

It played beautifully & charged the iPod with no problems whatsoever!! I loved that little system!I usually dock my iPod at night & play quiet music while I sleep, then undock & take the iPod to work with me for a full day of listening to music. Never had an issue in 2 months & now suddenly the unit is completely dead. I paid $170 for this system & for it to be dead after 2 months is simply unacceptable!!Will be returning to BestBuy since they are supposed to honor the manufacturer's warranty.

Genette's insights improve the reader's, not only into works both know, but above all, perhaps, into those as yet unread by either.Of all recent French theorists, Genette is closest in spirit and method (as well as accessibility) to mid-century American formalists. And though his work can be exploited by cultural studies and even gender theorists, it remains sharply focused on the alpha and omega of literary study: the text.David Lee Rubin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a companion to anything!","review":"If you are a classics scholar or student, you might find this book to your liking--although I'd recommend you browse through it in a bookstore before buying it online, sight unseen. Just keep in mind, it is NOT A COMPANION to Greek Tragedy as it claims, which to my mind implies that it is a reference book about the tragedies and their authors. Instead, this book is simply a short collection of seemingly random and unrelated essays about select tragedies. This book looks like someone's attempts to get tenure in their department more than anything else. If you're writing a dissertation on Euripides or Aeschylus perhaps you'll find a tidbit of scholarship in this book that will make it worth the price, but if you're just a fan of Greek Tragedy there are better books to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a tasty hot sauce that's actually HOT","review":"This is not hot sauce for the faint of heart.

Miller's brutal observations on the human condition are not for the faint of heart. His scatalogical references to such minor relics of American pop culture as \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\", Dr. Bellows from \\"I Dream of Jeanie\\" and the Starland Vocal Band leave the reader feeling a sence of purposelessness in the shadow of this brilliant social commentator. My God, he is so brilliant! And, alas, I am capable of little more than counting the change required to pay for his book, which will surely go down in history as the most enlightening document ever produced by mankind. Let us all bow at the feet of Miller, for he knows things that we could never even imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy","review":"This book on tape is a must have. It is much funnier than Dennis's previous work. This is a great commentary on the world as it is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book contains about 15 funny pages","review":"Once again Dennis Miller has written a book about his unfunny view of everything bad in the world.

It is good to get at the library, because once you read it you will be glad you didn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, Funny, and Brutally Truthful","review":"I am a loyal fan of Dennis Miller Live on HBO, and never miss an episode. When I found out that he had written a book, I quickly got to my local book store and picked it up, Ranting Again. I wondered why it was Ranting AGAIN, and then I found out that he had written yet another book before that. I haven't yet picked up The Rants, but if it is anywhere near as funny as this book, I know I'll enjoy. This book was hiliarious, and Miller's language and vocabulary are always amusing. A great read for anyone in need of some humor and painful honesty.

However Dennis, like so many millions of Americans, saw the true light on September 11, 2001. Dennis is \\"dead on\\" with this book and Dennis, like his hero Howard Cosell, tells it like it is. If you can't handle that, then I would suggest that you follow the Theme from M*A*S*H and realize that suicide is indeed painless. Dennis also takes his usual common sense approach to this book, pricking everyone in his unique style of ranting.

This collection of insights on pertinent social topics is at times funny, at times hilarious, and always thought provoking. I can't agree with everything he has to say but I do respect his points of view, mostly because of the fair, rational way he gets his point across.

The author touches on many universal subjects that are true to parents from around the world.

But my good friend Jeff , who's taste I trust, told me that I had to read this book. He said it was totally phoenomenal and really not that expensive (which it wasnt).Oh God..what a revelation. I couldn't put the book down. As I lay in bed, next to my lovely wife Laura, I almost felt guilty starting this book. But the upon reading the \\"Universal truths #2...Expecting father shalt let himself go and grow a beard. Heh heh... I couldnt help but laugh uncontrolably.

I found it amusing, at times moving, and occasionally, it really rang true for me: I certainly remember \\"the power of a two inch paper stick,\\" as I am now pregnant! I enjoyed reading bits to my husband as well. I find pregnancy wonderful - but weighty - after all, my life will change for always after the birth of our child. Books which treat pregnancy, childbirth and marriage with irreverance, humour and sheer silliness really help!! If you like Reiser's show, Mad About You, you will most likely really enjoy Babyhood - it is a fun counterpoint to the many weightier tomes on pregnancy and childbirth! (And you will find yourself buying at least one of these, as Reiser points out!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book's large type made it much easier to read","review":"This book's large type made it much easier to read that the version printed with a more stingy type. The fact that Paul has the consideration to print something for our less-sighted bretheren shows the true nature of this sub-humanitarian, although the book itself is a tribute from his big heart to our less-intelligent bretheren. Also, maybe in large type the peculiar liverpudlian inflections are more easy to remember. Despite all of his work for the death star, this guy still has his finger on the throat of america and won't stop doing it until he's met all of our expectorations. It's sure sad about his wife; While they may once have said paul is dead, his wife is now. Maybe future pop scholars will label this book, Parenthood, as commedia before the purgatoria about Linda Hunt's timely demise. May I suggest I title? Ex-Husbandhood? And keep the large type for the next work because I like to read this bard's books in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Dads....","review":"This is such a funny, funny book that is not just for dads.

Whether Paul Reiser is writing about baby names, cloth vs. disposable diapers, or going out on his own with the baby for the first time, it's all funny. Yes, the book is a few years old, but it is still my favorite parenting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I don't care what Entertainment Weekly says, this was a great book!! Paul Reiser shows us once again he is the master of marital and baby humor. It has creative titles and it makes you wonder \\"How did he know that?\\" From his wacky view of baby toys to the classification of people in the baby's life, it will have you laughing till you cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a doubt , the worst of Reiser's \\"hood's\\".","review":"From start to finish Reiser's cynical book on life were an excellent cure for my insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for new dads","review":"I happen to love Paul Reiser. I think he's hilarious! I really enjoyed this book and I don't even have kids. If you would like to get a Father's Day gift for a new dad or if you happen to know a man who's about to become a dad then I would definitely recommend purchasing the AUDIOBOOK version of this. Most men don't have the patience to read so I could see them enjoying the effortless listening aspect of the audio version. I read the print version and I really liked it. Paul talks about the decision to have a child and the whole pregnancy journey from the male perspective. Let's face it, there are lots of books written for women on the subject and this is probably the only one I have ever seen written for men by a man. Women will enjoy reading too b/c I think it gives some insider perspective as to how a man views having a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This book is hilarious and a great sequel to Couplehood!\\"","review":"I was watching Rosie O'Donnell the night Paul Reiser was on, and I saw THE BOOK. A week later I bought the book and as I have never done before read the whole thing at once. This book gives a closer look at parenting from a whole new angle. It keeps your attention and time flys by. His words like \\"the Gendlemans\\" are hilarious. I would rate this book an infinite if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"La Cerise on top","review":"I fell for this band on You Tube in an airplane video using Lambe An Dro.

When I saw that he'd done the same with the music of Scarlatti, one of the greatest keyboard composers ever, I couldn't order it fast enough. And I'm really disappointed. All the same things - multiple instruments, different effects - are there. But the magic of the earlier recording is missing. I can't figure out why this should be. Is it that Scarlatti is less tolerant of the James treatment than Rameau? Was it an inappropriate choice of Scarlatti pieces for Jamesising? I don't know. All I know is that it just doesn't do it for me. Perhaps It will grow on me with time, but the Rameau hit me right away and the pleasure of that recording has stayed with me for over 20 years. I don't get it - in every sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stackable storage container for LEGOs","review":"These bins stack very well (only with other bins of same size), hold lots of small to medium pieces, and don't have any corners that things get stuck in.

You just go around shooting. I like stratagy games like Metal Gear Solid though. But I am telling you this game isn't worth buying. It gets old really fast. It is exactly like DOOM except against humans and better graphics of course. But remember how DOOM was so awesome for the first 5, 6 maybe 7 days then it got really, well then you didn't play it anymore. Well that is how this game is.

This book is also better organized than the others I have read - being organized into chapters with headings such as \\"relationships\\" and \\"free will\\". However, rather than being purely devoted to progression as one might gather from the title, this book focuses on the complementary aspects of regression and progression in healing. Various case studies are used to illustrate the various themes of the book, which give an illuminating insight not only into how one can view one's future lives (being able to see a number of routes according to which option we take now) but also into what future life may be for all of us in 50, 100 and 1000 years. A wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great introduction","review":"I found this book great for those who are wanting to increase their awareness of past lives.

But why put a number on it? - Antoniette has a voice that can rival powerhouses of any age group.In today's musical landscape, that alone should be enough reason to pick up this CD. And if you want more justification - try the fact that the music is good. The songs are lyrically and musically inventive, drawing listeners into their mystique and there's a modern romantic tone that runs throughout the album, tying it together and making it memorable.Think Norah Jones, Alanis Morissette and Toni Braxton fused - and you'll have a good sense of Antoniette's vocal quality.

Instead of the lucid expose that so many of these reviews promise, this book presents us with a whining, tattling exercise that does no service to anyone or anything, and serves only to feed the self-serving desires of the author.The prose is itself slang-ridden and nearly impossible to read. One wonders whether this is the work of the co-author, trying to make the piece seem edgy and relevant. It ultimately acts only as an off-putting, succeeding in alienating the reader, making it difficult for us to form a closeness: though we might wish to. A tragedy such as this is deserving of a far better voice than is provided by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be better accounts","review":"Brown's work is nothing save self-serving, poorly written, half-thought out tripe: I would call it pablum for the masses, save that this seems to overstate the value of the work. There is naught of value here. This marks nothing more, or less, than a voyeuristic/self-indulgent (depending, of course, upon one's point of readership) excursis upon a tragedy. Brown does no service to the memories of those whose lives were senselessly disrupted. Much of his writing is spiteful, presenting himself as a figure of authority, qualified to comment upon the role of violence in modern American society.What credentials does the author present? This I ask..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, oh why?","review":"This book proves that being there is not enough to make a compelling book. The resulting book is almost laughably incompetent, and the voice we get from Mr. Brown is one of whine and neurosis. I'm glad he survived. I just hope he never feels the need to share again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Account","review":"Brooks Brown speaks genuinely about the Columbine tragedy. I give him the highest rating for his effort. I am thankful to Brooks Brown for finding the courage and willpower to share his personal experiences and opinions and I do feel they are worthy of contemplation in supplement to other accounts regarding the Columbine tragedy. I also appreciate co-author Rob Merritt's collaborative efforts in co-writing this book with Brown. I would close by stating that I truly hope that writing this book has helped Brown to find some sense of closure. I think that what Merritt and Brown have done here will help many others and that makes their efforts worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"No a true account of what happened inside","review":"If you're looking for a book that goes in-depth about what happened inside the school and how events occured, this is not the book for you. This book details the relationship of a friend of Dyland and Eric's. It is his account of what happened (he was not actually there at the school, he had already left), His relationship with Dylan and Eric before the shoting, what he felt and what he has gone through since.Not your typical \\"true crime\\" type novel with details of events that happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Brooks Brown tells about the experiances he had when he was friends with Harris and Klebold. He also explains what led up to the killings and the signs that the killer's displayed that were missed by their parents and friends. It was also a very easy read and simple to understand. I have had the book 3 months and have read it several times. I highly recommened this book to anyone that wants information on who Eric and Dylan were from someone who knew them best."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Easy Answers: The Truth Behind Columbine","review":"This was a very interesting account by a young man who had some insights that few have of this most tragic event in our history. As a school administrator it was a wake-up call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was a great book to read. I don't know everything there is to know about the Columbine Massacre, but enough to know that some have bits of the truth, but also their own ax to grind (\\"Bowling for Columbine\\", \\"Elephant\\"). This book was a quick read and kept my attention. It certainly fits in with all the different data sources, notwithstanding the conflicting stories that \\"officials\\" have given. I'm afraid that more and more of this is going to happen (just two days ago, a similar situation was averted). I hope that books like this wake up society to actually find out how to PREVENT such disasters. I think many of us \\"know\\" what the issues are, but are too afraid to do anything. This book helps keep that focus. It's amazing that the author kept going after all the problems. At the end of the book, it seems like anyone would give up, but the author gives hope to us and is trying to continue himself. Thank God for people like this. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Brooks Brown takes you into the world of Columbine and his teenage years in a way that feels realistic and engrossing. If anyone is interested in this subject they should read this book. And this book tries to explain the reasons why Columbine happened but it's doesn't give definite answers. That are some things that are left to wonder to the reader why this happen and how we can stop it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Out of all the books on Columbine out there, I rather read a book from someone who was there and lived through it. I'm glad I did, because this book was excellent. I literally could NOT put it down. I liked it so much that I recommended it to my teacher when we covered Columbine in class, and now he's reading it. This truly is the truth about Columbine. There's so much false information out there. This book is a breath of fresh air to anyone who actually researched about Columbine in search for the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Perfect","review":"I purchased this for my Laptop and it worked perfectly.I had previously purchased an other brand from another supplier and I had all kinds of problems with my system. I finally decided to chuck it and purchase this one and I have no regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work - yet","review":"I have been unsuccesfull in getting this item to work. My computer states that it can accept up to 1 gig of memory but when I install this, my computer will not work properly. I even updated the bios because I read that sometimes newer memory isn't manufactured the same way as the stuff that came with it even though it's technically the same type of memory(SODIMM). Not sure what to do now because it's been so long since I first bought the memory that I don't think I can return it. If I could just test the memory in another computer to verify that the memory is actually the problem...that would be great but I haven't been able to get my hands on the same type of computer that uses this style of memorey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I am saying this...","review":"I am a staunch Julie Garwood fan but I did not like this at all! It was so stilted and I could never quite get caught up in the romance or the suspense - not thrilling at all. I have it bookmarked in my Kindle (I'm 70% done) and haven't been bored or listless enough to go back and finish it up which is quite unlike me. I remain very surprised at this.I would definitely recommend Julie Garwood (I have some favorites by her - Honor's Splendor and Prince Charming) but perhaps not this genre. Because I love her so much I'll try another as the description for this book lists this as her first romantic thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is my first Julie Garwood book. I am a great fan of Romantic Suspense. I found the book very good! I just could not put it down. I am really hoping that Ms. Garwood continues writing in this format. I would put her up their with my other two favorites Linda Howard and Heather Graham Pozzessere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to Julie Garwood?","review":"All my Garwoods are spotted with pool water, bath water and coffee. My daughters and I love these comfort books--they probably have calories. The three of us have shared some hilarious Garwood book reviews. OK, it's not the Bible or even Shakespeare, but Julie is our best friend; we know what to expect. We're not quite sure just what it is about Garwood's medieval Scotland that hits the spot but it really does; no man could ever understand.Heartbreaker is a departure -- a stalker story that Grisham and others have done already, and much better. The characters are mere sketches. We know that Julie can make her people quite real (at least until the story is over). Heartbreaker's Laurent is not believable or lovable. Nick would be much better in a kilt. If there was humor tucked in there, I must have missed it. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"When I read a Julie Garwood novel, I expect strong, believable, and admirable characters. I also expect the characters to be be interesting and unique. With Heartbreaker, I thought that the characters were not any of these things. The dialogue was typical rather than using her usual wit, and the characters were trite. This could be because I usually read a lot of contemporary suspense novels and I was sad that my favorite historical writer gave up on the genre. For whatever reason, unlike all of her other novels (I particularly recommend Honor's Splendour), I was not gripped or entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing \\"thriller.\\"","review":"I'm a longtime Garwood fan, but this book was a disappointment. The \\"bad guy\\" character was unconvincing and there was very little of the classic Garwood romance wound into the story. It was either a bad romance novel or a very bad murder mystery -- take your pick. Garwood should stick to the historical romances, her true forte."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many cooks in the kitchen","review":"The premise of this book is exciting, but you really have to dig through too many substories (the neighbor's lost dog? give me a break) to get to it. While she tries to wrap all the ends together (the wedding, Nick's previous service as an FBI agent, etc.) it just doesn't gel. If you like this type of writing, try Jayne Ann Krentz instead. There, the humor is clear, the characters are clear, the plots are clear. Garwood's book is like trying to see the road in a storm when your defroster is broken---hazy at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbroken","review":"Oh, Julie Garwood where have you gone? Our hero is straight forward, straight shooting cop who happens to fear flying. Our heroine is a saint. Leggy blonde raised in Europe by her wealthy uncle who is later sent to boarding school in a NUNNERY! She dabbles in modeling until her brother finds out and ships her back to the nunnery. A nunnery! She is written completely without flaws and we are supposed to empathize with her desire to preserve the town of Holy Oaks in which, apparently, every woman is jealous of Saint Heroine.Julie Garwood was asking too much here. There's some killer, some local pervo, an incompetent sheriff and zero romantic zing between Cop and Saint. A profound disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaker....","review":"This book was not a good romance novel at all. This is the story of Nick, the FBI agent who has been called in to help protect his best friend's sister from a killer. I won't go more into the plot because it has already been discussed by the other reviewers. My issues with this book was that it dragged on and on with useless information. There were so many stories and information given that went absolutely no where. It would have been better if some of the fluff was left out to focus more on the relationship between the hero and heroine. Their romantic connection was none existent. You could fit all of the romantic interactions between the couple on 2 pages. As a mystery, I guess it was okay. But I expected a Romance and there was very little of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Being an avid fan of Garwood's, I was terribly disappointed in this book. I would wait for months on lists at book stores for my copy of her next book to come in, eagerly awaiting day. However, this book lacked all that her previous ones had. There was no passion, depth of character, and none of the famous humor I had come to expect. Her past books made me smile, laugh out loud at the antics, and always had a lot of thought into them. You cared about the characters. This book had nothing to offer. I can only hope that her next offers more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy From NH","review":"I have loved all of Judy Garwoods books...This one was a total let down. I could not seem to get into it. I was so disappointed that I was not able to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Heartbreaker","review":"I bought this book believing that it would be another sure thing by Julie Garwood. It was a sad disappointment. I'm not sure exactly what happened with character development, but I didn't feel that I knew these characters until more than half of the book was done. I normally read this author's books in one sitting. I found myself putting this one down again and again. I'm looking forward to the next one, but probably will wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaker Audio Cassette Book","review":"I have a problem with this cassette. It is just static. The seller did not even rewind the tapes. There is nothing to listen to. I am most disappointed in this purchase because it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmoving romance and iffy plot; stick with \\"Mercy\\"","review":"The romance just didn't feel that real to me, and the big twists were just too unrealistic and implausible. Predictable killer as well. \\"Mercy\\" was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the only book I've ever put down !","review":"I am a huge fan of Julie Garwood's writing...Ransom is one of my all time favorite books, as well as the books involving the Clayborne family. So, I was sadly disapponted in this book. I found it disturbing, upsetting and very difficult to read. While Ms. Garwood's books have always entertained and inspired me, this book was simply too dark for me to enjoy. I hope she will take us back to Scotland or to the Montana plains on her next book, as this one was simply not one I could feel comfortable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"Being a very good fan of Julie Garwood, I was very disappointed in this novel. It's taking romance and blending it with mystery and detection (and what's supposed to be thrill) and not doing it well. If you have an inclination to blend romance and thrillers, try reading Nora Roberts or books under her pseudonym JD Robb. They are excellent. This book reminds me of those old mystery books that give you diverting clues and then spring on an ending that none of the previous 150 pages supports. Try her strickly romance...they're good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"If your thinking of reading a julie garwood book I would recommend any book other than this one. I've read all of Julie Garwoods books and this book is not one of her bests. What i love most about her books is that they can make you laugh out loud, cry, and feel every emotion that the character is feeling. She has a historical suspense book called The Bride, which is way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing contemporary debut","review":"I eagerly awaited Ms. Garwood's contemporary debut, but have to say that I was disappointed. Neither the hero nor the heroine are endearing -- they are both caricatures with no personality to complete them. Frankly, Father Tom and Noah were the most interesting characters and they weren't around enough to keep the plot from dragging.I can't put a finger on exactly what went wrong -- the book opened well. But there were too many pages spent on subplots that weren't really relevant and characters (like the FBI guy in charge) whose presence was useless as a plot device.I'd steer clear of \\"Heartbreaker\\" until released in paperback, or read it at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Drags on Too Much!","review":"Although Julie Garwood's plot for Heartbreaker is very good; her writing defeats the entire concept because the story just drags on and on way too much. As I was reading, I kept thinking, \\"Get to the point!\\". The way the story is written, she could have said it all in 50 pages instead of over-describing every minute detail.I finally just gave up and skipped to the section that told who the creep was, which I had guessed early on anyway.Another disappointment with her style of writing is that her characters have flat personalities, they are like cardboard cutouts - they have no depth. It's as though she stands back and watches them and never really gets inside of their emotions. She doesn't allow the reader to feel anything. Laurent was asked if she was scared, she just answers, \\"Yes, I'm scared.\\". . . and nothing more, there is no indepth description of how she feels. Very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmm....Wow!","review":"If you like a little mystery/action along with the romance, definitely get \\"Heartbreaker\\"....and then when your finished with this one...pick up \\"Mercy\\". You definitely won't be flipping past pages...every sentence is suspenseful...sizzling....hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inept attempt to hurdle genre stereotyping","review":"Julie Garwood stocks her pathetic thriller with cardboard characters from past romance novels. She places her trademark larger-than-life hero and heroine in realistically horrifying circumstances and their thoughts and responses seem ludicrous in this venue. I was greatly disappointed. If you have ever read anything other than sentimental romance, and can compare this novel to other books of the genre, you will be disappointed as well. Julie Garwood should stick to what she does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I had heard good things about Julie Garwood, so I looked forward to this book. What a disappointment! The story is obvious, and Laurant and Nick are cardboard characters. They have no chemistry, yet we're supposed to believe there's this love between them that they have to fight to resist. Plus, the use of cliches is distracting - at one point, she stated Nick \\"had the body of a Greek god\\" and a few minutes later when Laurant tried to seduce him, Nick \\"looked like a deer caught in the headlights.\\" For some reason, I kept picturing a Greek god caught in the headlights. And the humor with the old ladies fell awfully flat. I heard her historical romances are better, so maybe I'll try that. And the FBI in this book seemed awfully unprofessional.Finally, the \\"false suspects\\" - the property buyer who was foaming with rage and the kid who flattened the tires, were so obviously false as suspects they seemed ludicrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaker","review":"Typical mind numbing romance, girl meets boy, course she doesn't like him very much , but end up together anyway , romances are so stupid., can predict the outcome without even finishing it. Wouldn't have read it if not for bookclub. Thank god we don't read this trash as a rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner for me","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Julie Garwood. I purchased it after seeing how many reviews it had and looking at the overall star rating. I wish I had looked a bit further at the lower star rating reviews.I did not find this to be a \\"real page turner\\" or one that I simply \\"could not put down\\", but instead I found myself bored with the characters and the slow moving story line. It took about fifty pages for the story to really get going. I just had a difficult time engaging in the story or caring about the characters. I didn't \\"feel\\"the chemistry between Laurent and Nick. I did like the author's description of Kansas City (State Line Road and Ward Parkway) it was just as I remembered it from years ago.Will I read another book by this author? Yes. I am going to give \\"Ransom\\" a try. Hopefully I will like it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"bought this thinking it would be as good as the historicals. not even close! I will not waste my money or time on these books again. where was the deep attraction, the sizzle between the h/h? Very little went on romance wise. I won't waste time or more money on her modern stories. Go back to the writing of historical. Should have stayed with what works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbraker","review":"I loved the story. It made me want to go back and reread other books she wrote with some of the same characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent....Outstanding!","review":"How anyone could give this book anything lower than 5 stars is beyond me. This was an incredible story. I have loved all of Julie Garwood's historicals and this one is at the top of my romantic suspense list. Whatever Julie writes, I'm going to buy. Nick is called by his priest friend Tommy to help him when a man confesses 'Bless me father for I will sin' The sin he is to commit is to kill the very priest's sister Laurent. Laurent a beautiful and kind woman and Nick is the man that is going to protect her. He will spend every moment with her. They are both attracted to each other but he tries to ignore it as she is his best friend's sister. This story moves quickly and there are no boring parts. The stalker's identity actually caught me by surprise. The entire book was great... the ending was outstanding. I was sorry it ended but I will never forget Nick and Laurant... or Tommy and Noah for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"First book by author","review":"i thought this book was excellent compared to the many other books that I have read. I must admit though, this was my first book by this author, and I will continue to read other works by her. It was suspenseful and kept you wondering. It seemd that it could happen. Overall it was a good book that read quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!!!","review":"this is the first Julie Garwood book I have read, but it won't be my last! The plot was well defined and well written. Being catholic myself, I was thrilled at how 'normal' the character of Father Tommy was. This is only the third book I have bought in hardback. Couldn't wait for the paperback. This is a must read for all murder/romance book lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaker","review":"Julia Garwood is one of my favorite romance authors. I was a little nervous about reading a contemporary from her. But, it was great. I couldn't put it down. Her characters had so much personality. I loved how she named one of the charaters Noah Clayborne. Any relation? I enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot. When you think she's given the 'who dune it' away, just keep reading. I found Heartbreaker to be entertaining, with gripping suspense and twist and turns that were not predictable. I have shelled out the hardcover price on other books of this same type and was disappointed. This one didn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"I just picked up a copy yesterday. I was so surprised to see it out already. This book was a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. I love all of Julie Garwood's Historicals, and I was a little weary about a Contemporary, but if you read Julie Garwood, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK! WOW! It was incredible! I plan to reread it tonight! :) Ms. Garwood is a fantastic writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I was looking foward to reading this book since I heard it was coming out. When I finaly got it and read it I was very disapointed. I found Nick and Laurant's relationship taking a back seat to the \\"murder mistery\\" wich I found lacking. Their relationship never takes of until the end and by then you have skipped so many boring pages that all you want for the book to end. Don't take me wrong the book is good if you are not expecting a romance novel, wich in my opinion this is not. I found their relationship stale and missing that all important spark of passion. Laurant, I found, to be a one dimensional character never having any deph, never growing. Nick was missing that air of power and sensuality that most of Julie Garwood's male characters have. I have read all of Julie Garwood's books and this sadly is one I'm not re-reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrifying?","review":"A blurb on the cover of Heartbreaker describes it as being \\"electrifying\\". Not to me. I like my thrillers to thrill, my romances to be romantic, and my suspense novels to be mysterious. To me, this book was none of the above...I found this book very boring...None of the characters add thrills, suspense, or romance to the story. And, never for a moment, was I excited, terrified, or immersed in this book.I've read Ms. Garwood before. Her male characters are usually charismatic, her heroines entertaining, her love scenes, sexy. I saw none of that, in this book. To me, two stars may be high. But, the book has a good flow, and the writing itself, is fine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sadistic killer","review":"I mean, what is up? I enjoy Julie Garwood's books, or at least, used to enjoy them. Her last few books have been an extreme disappointment and this one clinched it for. It's very unbelievable. I find the love that \\"blossomed\\" between Laurant and Nick so unrealistic; the descriptions and dialogue were juvenile....this one isn't even worth borrowing at a library. A total waste of time. I don't know about you fellow readers, but reading about sadistic killers brutalizing women isn't my cuppa tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not her usual style","review":"First of all, let me say that I liked the book. I just didn't LOVE it, as I have all her other books. I've re-read them all, and will again, but I'd be surprised if I re-read Heartbreaker. I missed the humor that permeates her other books -- I've been know to laugh out loud at times. While reading Heartbreaker, I chuckled once or twice, but that was it. And while her other books have had \\"bad guys,\\" they were secondary to the plot-line, and usually the impetus for the two characters to admit their love. In Heartbreaker, the danger is on almost every page, and colors almost every scene. This, in turn, limits her secondary characters -- they aren't as vivid or interesting because they are needed to move the serial murder plot-line along. Again, I liked it, but if you read Julie Garwood for 1) her humor, or 2) a light-hearted love story, think twice about buying this. Get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where oh,Where did our Julie Garwood go?...","review":"Okay, I am probably the first person to try to sell someone on Julie Garwood, but this book was really disappointing. The last couple of books she has written make me think Julie wrote the first couple chapters and then handed it over to someone else to finish. Where is her style? Normally, when you finish one of her book you feel like you just took a deep breath and you just feel better about life. She really makes you believe that true love, respect and committment can still be found in marriage.For this book, everything was very loose and you never really get a real romance between Nick and Laurent. The story line was unbelievable and just not her forte.Julie...Please do us a big favor...We love you, go back and write the type of books that only you can write...About Love and Hope and the beleif that happily ever after can really exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I usually love her books but this one left me dissapointed.

Too much character development is crammed into the pages when the characters are introduced. I also did not have any motivation of continuing with the book after discovering the murderer and it wasn't that tough to begin with. Just put the first and 2nd chapters together, tweak your brain cells a little and you will get ur murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreak High","review":"I have never read Julie Garwood before, in fact I didn't read her now, I listened to the audiotape during my commute to and from work. A mystery or suspense thriller usually makes good company. I wasn't necessarily expecting a literary masterpiece, but the description of the story, written by a \\"New York Times bestselling\\" author sounded worth a try.It turned out to be \\"trying\\" at best. Longer than most 10th grade writing assignments, but hardly more sophisticated, the novel was at times excruciating to listen to. Predictable? Yes.Wooden? Like an oak. The heroine and hero were Barbie and Ken, but less dimensional. Paper cutouts with dialogue supplied by a 14 year old who has watched primetime often enough to get the sex scene down is more like it.The only good thing about the book is the hope that it should give to all unpublished novelists--if they wasted paper on this...we could get our grocery lists published!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISPLEASED WITH AMAZON","review":"I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH AMAZON. 2 TIMES NOW I HAVE SENT FOR BOOKS, I SENT FOR UNABRIDGED BOOKS AND BOTH TIMES I HAVE GOTTEN ABRIDGED BOOKS WHY WOULD ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND SEND FOR A HALF BOOK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had just finished Saving Grace, which I really liked, so I picked up Heartbreaker and was very disappointed.

Funny, and a great mystery that I couldn't figure out under the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaker","review":"I liked it a lot. It is my first suspense book, and truth be told, I only tried it because it was penned by julie garwood. I usually read romance, and since this was romantic suspense and written by julie garwood, I knew that even if i did not get captivated by the suspense, the romance would not let me down because i know garwood's history on that. And i was very surprised.. it was wonderful.. just the right amount of suspense and romance. She has turned me around that i'm now looking for other notworthy authors who write romantic suspense... but i doubt anyone writes it as well as garwood. can't wait to read \\"Mercy\\" .. and can't wait for garwood to write about Noah .. i really hope she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"Since this was my first Julie Garwood, I didn't know what to expect but I liked what I got and would certainly read more by this author especially her historicals. Heartbreaker is not a thriller but it has a good storyline with a decent amount of suspense and excitement. This book had excellent characterization which I think is half the battle won because if you don't like the characters, you just cannot get involved in a story no matter how interesting. The dialogues were witty and even funny at times and overall, it was a very easy and entertaining read even though the romance was a bit limited. Looking forward to more by this excellent author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best","review":"I enjoyed Heartbreaker. It was predictable, sure, but the story was very enjoyable. I found Nick and Laurant very believable in their affections. I thought the entire story had enough romance & suspense to keep the reader entertained. JG's humor came through only a little bit though, especially toward the end there when Nick was yelling, worried about Laurant. But yes, I'd definitly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Change of Pace","review":"I was slightly disappointed at Garwood's \\"For the Roses\\" series. However, I love so many of her other books I was anxious to see how she would design a contemporary hero/heroine dynamic. I was wonderfully surprised reading \\"Heartbreaker\\". The pace is quick, and kept me interested. I laughed out loud, cried, and really enjoyed the chemistry she created between the characters. Good Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine Tingling from Beginning to End!","review":"Fabulous! I could not put this book down. You can feel the hair on your head and arms raising from the minute you sit in the confessional until the very last pages of this great book.

I loved how the main characters Nick and Laurant interacted together and with the supporting characters, Tommy and Noah (I hope that in some future book there is a story for them too.)When a killer enters Tommy's confessional and gives advanced warning to wanting to kill his sister Laurant is the start of this romantic mystery. After this the FBI is called in and they start the search for this unsub (Unknown Subject).The story was great, I had no idea who the true killer was, till Nick figured it out - very near to the end of the book. I really enjoy reading and this is definitely one I will be reading again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Garwood does it again","review":"Usually I am not a reader of romance novels. However, yet again, I lost another night's sleep. Julie Garwood has a wonderful way of creating characters that you fall in love with and miss horribly when you close the book. I was worried with Heartbreaker because it had a modern setting, but I enjoyed every word by the time I was finished. The only bad part is that I now I want to go back and re-read all of her books. If you love Julie Garwood or are new to her works, make sure that you read this book. It is worth a few meager hours of sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed Reader","review":"I've read all of Julie Garwood's books and enjoyed most of them. But this one left me cold. It wasn't romantic; nor was it really suspenseful. In contrast to the funny and charismatic characters Ms. Garwood usually creates, Nick and Laurant might have been cut from cardboard. I started it about four different times but couldn't finish; finally, I skimmed to the end. A disappointing effort by a normally fine writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking. . .","review":"when I wasted my money buying this and my time reading this?

Fully 20 of the 50 DVDs proved defective. Perhaps even more annoying than the wasted money was the wasted time I spent having to re-record the same tape on to a new DVD(in real time) over and over again due to these defects. A little online research reveals that this is a common problem associated with Sony DVDs manufactured in Malaysia and not a problem with those produced elsewhere. I don't find information regarding the site of manufacturing in the product descriptions so I'm not taking a chance with any more Sonys. I'm told that there are a couple of highly regarded brands (Verbatim and JVC) that manufacture in Taiwan and Japan and that these have much higher quality ratings so I'll try those next since I still have a lot more tapes to transfer to DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAIL!","review":"Honestly, I have tried to give Sony blank media product a fair chance, but every time, it comes up wanting.

I tried two different software programs and even replaced my desktop PC's DVD burner in case it was failing, but continued to have bad luck with them. My laptop's DVD burner software sees these discs as 8X rather than 16X like they're rated, and the odds of them working seems to increase at burn speeds below 8X.

Its great because it has its own power supply, which allows for no loss of speed. I run a multi card reader, ipod charger, 40gp portable HD and I usually leave the last slot open for my flash drive. Using my old hub, without an independent power supply, I could not connect those items without one of them screwing up from lack of power. This FIXED ALL MY PROBLEMS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This is a great little hub. Compact and really sturdy. It comes with a power supply, but I never really needed it. It powers my portable hard drive, my mouse and other peripherals with no problems.The cord is short, but I believe it was meant for laptop use anyway, so it works out perfectly for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased with Item","review":"I am the new owner of a aluratek 4 port hub. Sad to say that when I plug it into my computer while plugged into external power it shorts my usb connector and shuts down any of my 3 pc's. I suspect it is just a defective unit. I'm not going to worry about sending back, just get another one down the road. Also the cord on this thing is so short it's useless. I am very displeased with this device. I will add that it does run my portable hard drive and charge my phone at the same time w/ no external power source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but has some issues...","review":"The first problem with this device is the cable is about 2 inches long. I started using this device and I rarely turn off my PC so I figured everything was working fine...that was until I rebooted my PC (Intel D865PERL motherboard, Corsair RAM) and it froze up after displaying the type of RAM I have. It was about a month since I rebooted last and started using the Aluratek hub so it took me a while to figure out it was the USB hub. Soon as I unplugged it my PC booted right up and I was able to plug in the hub again after I was booted up. I'd give it 4 stars if it wasn't for the cable length, no extension cable being included, and the lock up problem on reboot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned for exchange","review":"I had to return the item because it stopped working a few days after I received it.Hopefully they will give me another one.Victor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - works...","review":"I was wary given some reviews, but didn't really want to spend a ton of money on something that should be so simple.I use this for a laptop that has only 1 usb port on the docking hub.

I think you'll find it very refreshing: unlike Mr. Graham who almost didn't survive the experience, I don't recall Mr. Lamb ever having spent eleven months in a Hanoi-run re-education camp to get the truth about Vietnam!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a country, not a war...","review":"Vietnam is a country of 78 million living in an area a bit larger than the size of Italy. The people and the landscapes of this nation are both extremely diverse. But to many, Vietnam is simply a war, a chapter of history, a place of terrible memories.Lamb does an excellent job of showing, through his words, Vietnam's beauty and diversity. During his travels from Hanoi to Saigon (HCMC), he interviews Vietnamese people from all walks of life. Some remember the war vividly, some were not born yet, some could care less. For most Vietnamese, the American War is something that has long passed. Lamb illustrates what Vietnam really is, an amazing country with some of the FRIENDLIEST people on Earth. If you can not go to Vietnam (but by all means, GO! I just returned and I found it to be most amazing!), please read this book. I think you will quickly learn that there is a LOT more to Vietnam than the American War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vietnam Now","review":"Very good book providing the reader with a current look at the Vietnam of today and how much has changed since the war years of '65-'74.

It pinpoints our major problems and suggests fresh and new solutions, in a way that empowers us and shows us how WE can achieve them.The author writes anonymously to show that with truly good leadership the people can progress into a new era free of conflict and division. That's because good leadership merely shows the way and enables the people to get there on their own, and when they get there they can say, \\"We did it ourselves!\\"In other words, we do not need another power-seeking pretender who wants to play conquering hero or savior or king. We can SHARE the \\"throne\\" as the equal joint heirs we are destined to be.If you can see how much conflict and division partisan politics and religious bigotry cause, you will be very interested in what this book has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hipocrisy & Hucksterism","review":"When I read in previous reviews that the author is 'humble' I can only wonder if the author of this insidious book wrote the review himself. In a nutshell: there will be no second coming of Jesus -another is already here, a true prophet. Guess who it is? Why, the author, of course. The hipocrisy is in denigrating, among many, those who abuse religious beliefs out of greed. No, his new path is to abuse religious beliefs to sell books.

Well Major Norton, just produce the evidence and you can prove your case and stop slamming your questioners.

Our daughter followed the suggested letter in this book, sent for all appropriate applications and actually did quite well in the scholarships she received. She managed to keep her out of pocket expenses quite low for a 5 year degree.

Of course, it's hard to tell since we can't tell what the stage looks like because the entire video is in super close-up.I would recommend this video just for the music if there were no other choices for Giulio Cesare.

But it does not discuss them in a brief or interesting way. I found the text sometimes repetitive, sometimes wordy, and frequently dry.Plus, the non-process writing advice is either highly abstract or narrowly focused on a hypothetical scenario used throughout the book.

I downloaded this on my kindle and usually read a few chapters every night at bedtime and I found myself reading longer than planned each night.

Also try 'MAP OF BONES' by J.Rollins, like the 'Da Vinci Code' on steroids.

It was exciting and fun, lots of cool creatures and adventure. Super fun to read, thrilling--and that's about the gist of it. Amazonia is perfect \\"Airplane\\" fiction--nothing profound or literary about it. Just an adrenaline rush. And I'll be honest--I really like airplane fiction, so I'm not talking down about that genre at all.The only thing I didn't like--and I'll give it a four star rating because of it--was that the hero seems to be the only person capable of heroic acts. Now, I realize that he is the hero and with that comes heroic acts--but he is traveling through the jungle with a bunch of highly trained army rangers, who don't seem very competent around the main character.Other than that--the book was great.I did notice some very similar elements to this book and Avatar. In fact, some of the similarities are so uncanny that if I were James Rollins, I would call up ol' Jim Cameron and ask him about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Inplausible","review":"Admittedly, I purchased this book as an easy read for a vacation in Central America. The basic story line was intriguing: an expedition disappears, without a trace, in the uncharted Amazon. For the first 200 pages, the book was difficult to put down, as the expedition enters the rainforest and begins its quest. But, as the mysteries are revealed the drama fades. The characters don't react as real persons to what they are subjected to, instead soldering on in a cliched way. Bizzarre creatures take over the story. Despite the sometimes tedious and unnecessary detail and the collapsing and unrealistic plot, I read on to the end, hoping the story would redeem itself. I wanted to find out about the mysterious Ban-ali tribe that haunts the book from its inception. But, the mystical Ban-ali tribe, when they are finally revealed, are uninspiring, one dimensional and never seriously developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I got three of Mr. Robbins books on the recommendation of one of his family members I sold a book to. Amazonia is my first read and I may not read the rest based on this book. It is too long. The creatures are far-fetched and unbelievable. Why the plague is spreading all over the U.S. despite the fact that the body was flown to Florida is mind boggling. I keep putting the book down and picking it up again because I hate to waste good money not reading something I have paid for. There are too many characters wasting too much space that I don't care anything about. What's with Tor-Tor? Could have been an interesting character but all he does is chuff. Sorry. So, far, this author is not all he's cracked up to be. This book is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat and plodding","review":"I expected to read a sciencific fact-based book with lots of suspense, intelligent characters, and steamy atmospherics, but I got a plot,--or should I say plod--that was completely flat, with stock villians and insipid heroes. For an example of sterotypical characters, look at Rollins' depiction of the U.S. Rangers. If I ever get stranded in the jungle with these guys (and one gal)--then, I hope to be rescued by Black Hawk Down, or Big Bird! The science is virtually non-existent; the research into the Yanomamo and other indigenous people of the Amazon is weak, and the American scientists are portrayed as shallow seekers for a big Cure. The plot goes in leaps and I was unable to acheive the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" that is essential to an engaging adventure novel. I like Lincoln Childs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much science fiction","review":"I expected the books to be more like a Cussler novel, this was my first time to read a Rollins book. I found it too unbelivable and had too much science fiction in it for me. I have a few more books of Rollins that I was given, I will be reading those to see if the same style follows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabs you from page 1","review":"Like all of James Rollins' books it presents a fascinating premise within the first couple of pages. One of the things I like about his writing is that there is very little \\"fluff\\", that is he sticks to the story and keeps it moving along at a fast clip. Every chapter was different and fascinating.I like the way he often uses actual places in his books (although the Amazon doesn't seem too mysterious\\". In this book, I assume the plants and shaman medicines described are real, as are many of the dangers normal to that part of the world.The only negative comment is that this book (as well as Subterranean) stretches the imagination a bit too much for my liking. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the read and finished the book in a few days, I have a hard type imagining a 100' long alligator, for example.Don't let this deter you though. If you enjoyed any of his other books you'll not be disappointed with Amazonia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quest for drugs.","review":"While a little soft on the discussed science, this was a rollicking good adventure story. There was a lot of action to keep you intrigued, a little plea for environmental awareness and just a smattering of love interest. The descriptions of the amazon was galvanizing and allow great visual stimulation. While the plot had enough holes in it to drain pasta, it still provided an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure fare!","review":"I haven't read James Rollins's work, however, after reading Amazonia, I am a new fan. I love the adventure/scientific/apocolyptic genre of novel, and this one fit the bill. The plot was coherent and well written. The characters, though slightly stereotypical, were believable. Nate and Kelly were a good romantic duo, and Tor-Tor was the coolest cat/main character I've seen in a while. I loved the description of the jungle and of the animals. I also appreciated the obvious research that Rollins did to write about the Amazon. Though I felt the end was kind of weak and hastily thrown together, it did not dull my enjoyment of the total work. This one would have been great at the beach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extreme action","review":"After reading several of this author's works, I felt compelled to write a review. The book is interesting, but gets much too out into left field in the activities of its players. Not in the fantasy department, but in the extreme actions the folks can manage to pull off. This is a failing in all of Rollins' books, it seems, and really detracts from the story line. These do not come up to Jeff Long and Childs & Preston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya...Right???","review":"One word describes this book:ridiculous- Deserving or inspiring ridicule; absurd, preposterous, or silly.In all fairness to the author this is the first book of his that I have read and perhaps I should have investigated more into his writing style. This book reads like a silly Hollywood movie. Most disappointing is that the story line and conceptuality of this book was very good but Rollins wears the reader down with absurd coincidences, unlimited resources and unbelievable creatures. Had he been more realistic in these areas this would have been an absorbing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"After reading 'Black Order', I feel in love and decided I wanted to read all of Rollins' books. I chose 'Amazonia' next based on its good reviews. I feel like I am missing something from this book that most of the other reviewers loved. I found this novel to be incredibly boring and cliched. A lot of the story, writing and dialogue was so cheesy. For example- there was one part where someone tossed something (can't remember what or why) to another character and when they caught it they said something like \\"Junior year- varsity baseball\\" I have heard this dumb line in so many 80's movies it made me cringe when I read it.The plot was slightly narrow too. I was really looking forward to different plot lines tying together like in 'Black Order' and a big surprise ending but there was nothing of that here.I'm not giving up on Rolling though. I am going to try 'Subterranean' next."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites of All Time","review":"This is an incredible book. The characters are extremely well developed and you feel like you know them and are right along with them experiencing the adventure.The story begins with a Green Beret emerging from the jungle sick and feverish. What catches the eye of the commander back home is that he regenerated a limb that he lost in earlier combat. Of course that sparks a mad rush to retrace his trail to determine what caused his limb to regenerate.A team of Green Berets and scientist begin to explore deeper and deeper into the Amazon. Along the way they encounter frogs with teeth, giant caimans, giant jaguars as they push closer to the secret.Edge of your seat writing that forced me to almost read the entire book in one sitting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good popcorn book","review":"Take this book for what it is. It's a by the numbers action/adventure story. It you can get past that and suspend your disbelief (especially when it comes to Tor-Tor) you'll really enjoy this tale of non-stop jungle adventure. There is plenty of action, violence, and gore. I listened to the book on cassette and the reader does a great job of using different voices, expression, and inflection. It would make a great popcorn movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, You will love it!","review":"Amazonia by James Rollins is one incredible book. It grabbed me from the start and the action and intrigue didn't stop until the end. Just when you think you know whats going on, there's another twist. This book is entertaining and a definite page turner. You will want to read it in one sitting. Good luck trying to put it down. This book is incredibly well researched. Anything that seems almost unbelievable in the story is so well described and explained that it becomes very believable. I don't want to give away the story but it is an adventure from beginning to end! Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Amazonia for yourself and while you're at it, pick up Excavation, Subterranean and Deep Fathom. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazonia- Taking a look!","review":"This is an insightful book, filled with lots of adventures, his writing style leaves you at the edge.

Not a worthwhile read and it may be time for me to give up on Rollins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Amazonia is my favorite James Rollins book, by far. The whole premise being the book is something that I not only liked, but is completely plausible. As one would expect from James Rollins, the details in this novel are over the top. The reader gets every detail that they could possibly want, and then some. That's one of my favorite traits about Rollins, he always gives every possible detail the reader might need in order to completely enjoy reading his novel.This is a book I would love to see in a movie, written/produced by James Cameron... this would be great as a 3D and Cameron is just a genius at making movies with this kind of content.It's a long read and sometimes the details do bog you down, but it's worth turning the pages because of the non-stop action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic Books Are Deeper Than This","review":"Actually Amazonia reads like an extended episode of Jonny Quest, only not as sophisticated. One of the characters (and I use the term loosely) travels with a pet jaguar. The military contingent are equivilent to Star Trek's \\"red shirts\\" -- expendable extras who exist only to get killed. In Amazonia, they are killed by giant mutant creatures. The sections involving an obligatory and chiched romance and the author's occasional lectures on the value of the rain forest (spare us, please) are absolutely must-skip reading.I know it's supposed to be mindless fun, but this is all a little TOO mindless. I'm a big fan of Preston and Child thrillers and this falls far short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazonia is \\"AWESOME\\"!!","review":"I read all of James Rollins books & Amazonia is my favorite!!

However, my appreciation for the fast-paced prose quickly went downhill after the introduction of the Army Rangers into the story. As a former army captain, I found the Rangers entirely unbelievable. Jim's depiction of them is full of implausibilities and downright inaccuracies. Page after page of mischaracterizations eroded my willing-suspension-of-disbelief until I finally put the book down unfinished. If Rollins includes military characters in future stories, I hope he does some basic research first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work.","review":"I ordered Amazonia hot off the press as soon as I possibly could - hardcover, no less. Needless to say, I was disappointed. It was not, in my opinion, of the same page-turning, nail biting quality of his other novels. I'm a science fiction buff, but even I found the premise so hard to believe that it almost ruined it right off the bat. The plot was weak, the characters unbelievable, and, well, that whole giant panther thing was just too much. I think I'll wait and see if Mr. Rollins comes back down to earth before reading another one of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am an unhappy customer...","review":"My beef is not with the product, but the business entity that sold it. The product description clearly states pack of ten, which I indeed thought was too good of a deal to pass up. However, I only received two cameras. I emailed Electronic World last week and no one has responded. My event is now less than two weeks away and I have many other agendas to tend to. This should not have happened to me and should not happen to anyone else, ever. I don't want my money back; I just want my other eight cameras.

I have read at least a dozen books on running and training from coaches like Dellinger, Lydiard, Bowerman, etc and runners like Rodgers, Liquori, Shorter etc and Jack Daniels book is the best of the bunch. For years I have trained by the seat of my pants trying to incorporate all I have read but with little real understanding of the affects of the different types of training I was doing. Daniels simply and clearly outlines the parts of training and their purpose. The training schedules laid out are easy to use and adaptable to any level. I feel like I now understand my training and my race times are faster. I am recommending this book to all my running friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Middle School/Elementary","review":"I purchased this book as a resource for 7th grade students to use in creating a puppet show about Monet.

He was a jerk to her about the littlest things and she nagged him about the things that she never complained about before. Watching this season only made it more apparent that their marriage was in trouble. I think about two months after I watched it, Jessica asked for a divorce. This season must have been just thrown together to create an \\"end\\" to the series. It didn't just end the series, but their marriage as well. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I half paid attention to this while I watched it. This season lacks good drama and often strays away from attracted people to the show in the first place - watching interaction of Jessica and Nick.

This introduced me to Robert Ludlum, and from that time on I have read all his books. Unfortunately, over time, he became long-winded, and it was almost a chore to read his books. This is one of his earlier works, and I have the same excitement I did when I read my first Ludlum. I have been drawn into the story, and can not put it down. This is one of his earliest works when he was still on the way up.

Intricate plotting is only worth following if the themes and characters are worthy of attention. This book is some kind of desperately single-minded, looney-left hate fest. OK, you can say Hoover was a monster, and say it again 10 times, maybe even 50 or 60 times, but that does not a book make.

I rented this to watch with my son as a reward for getting through all five books. Long story short, the film only marginally approaches the original story from the book series. It was a major disappointment for me. I really shouldn't be surprised considering almost every other film adaptation of a beloved story ends up being a disappointment. This one was particularly egregious. I don't get it. You don't have to write an original story. You have an instant hit and all you need to do is put it to film. Just follow the story as written. If you want to create art, go write an original story. If you are putting some other author's work to film, tell the author's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie for kids","review":"Our 9-year old thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

It was full of magic, fantasy, wonderful effects, great acting on all actors behalfs. Nic Nolte's part was supurb. I couldn't have thought of a better actor to fill that part then him. I mostly enjoyed how the movie tied the past, present and future all together. And helped a boy find his place in the world.

The animation is fantastic and extremely believable. The acting is wonderful. This is the second time I have seen Freddie Highmore's acting on screen and I think he is destined for great things. The plot line does not require too much thought, which makes the film all that much more enjoyable. The characters are funny at times, you will jump at times and you may even cry a few times. This is a film you will want to see again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliches Are Cliches For A Reason","review":"As I went to see this, I wondered; Why do they keep making fantasy movies with child protagonist(s)?And then I saw the movie, and I realized it's because it works.The movie was fun. Not too serious, just serious enough. Freddie Highmore starts off slow, but ends up impressing with some serious skills, playing both Jared and his pacifistic brother Simon. (Special note to his performance in the scene when Jared goes to rescue Simon from the goblins.)I thought the end was a bit corny and predictable, but overall, I found the movie light and enjoyable: Everything you could expect from a film of it's kind.On an end-note: After I saw the movie, I just had to try crackers and honey. It's actually quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"It was alright, but I think the movie itself could've been better.

I really think the producers outdid themselves brining this story to life.I have one minor complaint, but it should not matter if you read the books first. My complaint is that there were important aspects of the books left out. ***SPOILER ALERT**** For example in book one, the part where the Bogart ransacks the kitchen is completely omitted. There are other things, but I will not go into that strict of detail.Read the books first, then enjoy the film..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderwick Chronicles","review":"The movie was great!

They spare no expense when it comes to beautiful CGI effects but clearly have both a sloppy screenplay and poor director. Quite a few of these actors are big names with consistently good performances so I couldn't believe their cheesy acting. I am a huge movie fan and love a good cinematic interpretation of a book and believe whole-heartedly in the director and screenplay writer's creative license to make changes to the story to better fit the screen.

My husband and I enjoyed it as well. It is a movie that we all have watched more than once. It definitely holds your attention from beginning to end. My older daughter has always been fascinated with fairies, and while this movie didn't have fairies in it, it did have a secret world of magical creatures. My kids loved it because of the mythical creatures and it left them wondering if they could possibly be real, just not visible to the human eye. It is a movie that keeps your interest and doesn't have any bad language or other things that you really don't want your kids watching. I think both girls and boys would enjoy it, and if your kids are into reading, there is a whole series of books on the Spiderwick Chronicles. My girls love Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide. We rented it from our library and the kids loved it so much they asked for it so we could have our own copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and Entertaining","review":"The scary parts launch quickly and without much build-up. I was on the edge of my seat. I knew the kids would prevail but the question was \\"how.\\" My nieces and nephews all liked it.

This excellent mix of some of their most slammin' anthems is hurt only by the fact that with 17 tracks on one disc, some are no longer than 3 minutes!!! 2 discs with all their long mixes is what we should have gotten, especially since some of these mixes are near impossible to get any other place!

Sure, the Irish and the Scots migrated to the upper eastern coasts of North America and so their music still echoes there, but rather than evoking the eclectic musical mix that came to be distinctly Americana, this music wafts from a different shore. Heavy on the squeezebox, most likely you'll imagine Irish bands and pubs before you'll imagine Ol' Nick the Sea Captain or Old Cape Cod. Well-crafted, but not what I expected. I do like this CD. It's just that I'll most likely play it when I'm in a lively Celtic mood and ready to dance the Maypole; not when I'm cooking New England clam chowder or steaming lobster and dreaming of buoys bobbing peacefully in the bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baseless garbage","review":"I read this book.

However, this is quite simply my favorite movie of all time.The plot is often silly, and there are a few genuinely bad cringe-inducing moments (Kevin and the prostitute, anyone?). Critically, it's a mess. And yet, it is overwhelmingly \\"real\\" as both an emotional piece, as well as a nostalgic treatise on all that was the 80's. The actors all have limited range (the brat pack were *not* thespians) - but luckily enough, the casting is dead on target (when else was Rob Lowe ever believable? ).A thoroughly charming film, one that makes a not-so-bygone era come refreshingly alive again. Absolutely silly, and absolutely wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only brat pack movie I realy liked...","review":"Okay boys and girls.. I grew up in the Washington DC area and spent many a night bar crawling in Georgetown. True in DC legaly you can't (or couldn't) call a bar a \\"B-A-R\\". But outside of that, I remember many of the antics that these charcters got up to. Contrary to what some of the other reviewers have said about this movie this is, or was how I remember Georgetown and the DC surburbs to be in the 1980s. I was there and some 20s year later I still can't believe that era...All in all a little campy and several generations too far in the past for the current era. But over all a pretty good film.

Nothing new here, not too interesting or enjoyable either, so it did nothing for me. It's not very funny and at times turns into weak melodrama, revolving around tired, been-done-to-death cliches with lifeless characters.

I hadn't seen this movie since the 80's and aside from the cheesey hairstyles, clothes, this movie has a pretty deep message about growing up. One of the saddest scenes in this movie is where Rob Lowe comes back to the old frat house and is welcomed by his \\"brothers\\" with open arms. They end up playing a game of football and Billy (Rob Lowe) asks one of his friends if it's possible for him to get a job coaching at the college, and his friend says something like, \\"yeah we need someone like you around here to get us some good drugs\\". How awful! He's trying to do the right thing and constantly gets slammed and makes the wrong choices. And then of coures there's Demi Moore's charecter who is a drug addict, and the love triangle thing, it's just good but VERY SAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The fire still burns ...","review":"After multiple viewings over the years, this movie only gets better. The 2.35:1 wide-screen print of this film is a first for me and it presents the movie the way Joel Schumacher intended. (I immediately trashed my old \\"pan & scan\\" version on VHS after watching this DVD.)The video transfer is clean and the variety of audio and subtitles is excellent. The making-of featurette is somewhat short (8 minutes) and the filmographies are incomplete, so I'm only going with ****four stars. Haven't listened to the director's commentary yet but I'm sure it will add another level of enjoyment to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't held up too well","review":"Well, having just watched this again for the first time since 1985, I found it pretty trite, surprisingly old-fashioned, and lacking in the script department. As usual with a big ensemble cast, the characters are all stereotypes. Rob Lowe's rosy cheeks make him seem like he should have stuck to after-school specials, even though the girls of the time loved him. Only Demi Moore's acting stands out a bit here, and, true to form, she is probably still the biggest star of the bunch almost 30 years later. Evidently this got savaged by the critics of the day. They were not wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"I've just finished reading this and i'm a little shellshocked. Not because I feel Grant has been villified but perhaps merely because it shows such a debonair and enigmatic idol of mine as a true fallible human being.Like the other reviewer commented, I too thought it seemed to be written with a fair amount of objectivity. It did not come across to me as a bitter and delibrate attempt to trash or undermine Grant. It does come across, however, as a bit of a tacky and harrowing romance novel, even the presentation of the book conveys such an image.I think if you're a Cary Grant fan that wants to find out a little more about Archie Leach and is willing to accept the fact that their view of Cary may be tarnished in the process; then go ahead and read this, it is an interesting and (from what I can tell) balanced read.Let's all hope he was happy in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the effort","review":"The book provides no valuable insight into what made this star who he was.

The book should have never been published ever as Christian Fiction.The writer should not change Christians' beliefs so freely.Brothers and sisters are common words in the bible. Priests call us brothers and sisters, and that does not mean we are biologically related. The bible has mentioned Jesus as firstborn; but that does not mean there were more children. Also, if there would be more children, we would know about them from the bible. I was shocked and very disappointed that this story was ever published as Christian fiction.

It basically did not do as advertised. It was supposed to trim the whiskers above the surface so that they don't curl back in under the skin like lift and cut or close shave razors do. This Wahl basically took off a top layer of skin and lifted pulled and chewed out most of my whiskers while just laying some down without cutting them at all.I've decided to go to the disposable type black men's bump control razor I can get at Walmart.

As for effectiveness, I suppose they do the job alright, but taking everything else into consideration and by comparing these with the Gabriella brand (which is WAY cheaper, lighter, and sturdier), they aren't worth it.

Kurlansky tendentiously offers us more of the same, only more tediously.At 464 pages, the book is too long - but not nearly as long as the longwindedness of the generation of 1968.I recommend the book - as a wonderful example of self parody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Though the female form is, generally at the muscular level, the same as the male, it was informative to the effect of the proportion of each muscle group within the overall muscular system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable horror","review":"Amityville-It's About Time is a fun movie for horror fans.

The teen daughter turns seductive-also a victim of the clock's doings.

The opening sequence is gripping, but the movie starts going downhills after that.Skip It."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sequel","review":"Fifth instalment of the Amityville series and quite easily the worst of the series. The acting is what caught my eye most of all- poor, unconvincing unknowns were just, it seemed taken off the street with someone prompting the script to them through the film. The effects, I expected would have been a little more improved since Amityville's predecessors but they still had a very cheap look about them. On the positive side this film is watchable, but overall, all we are seeing is a repeat of the famous, eerie Amityville house we have seen in the last four films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amityville Time","review":"The seller was very wonderful to mail it so quick.

I bought this cd mainly cause it had a song featuring Lindsay but lindsay dosent even sing on the track. I tried to get into this album but it was worse than the 3LW xmas album and I thought that was impossible.If you want a good xmas cd look for Sarah mclaughlan or Jessica simpson also Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, and Celin Dion.

His hilarious escapades, often underscored with scathing insights by the narrator, lead to a climactic finish.

But that's besides the point. If you're looking for hard facts and statistics, look elsewhere. Not the book for you.It was, however, an entertaining read. You won't enjoy this if you are too serious a person because it is somewhat ridiculous, in an unfortunately truthful way.I suppose it would be good to know that I am not a smoker.

The pages, even whole chapters are filled with this mindless dialogue which is very irritating to read.

I had to spend quite a bit of time explaining to him we (mom and dad) will not die and go to heaven just yet. He was so concerned we would not be around, and started asking so many questions about DEATH. My whole purpose of buying this book was to teach him about the sport, since he is getting so interested in it, and the experience was not even close to it.

There is no question that Lyden lived overcame a traumatic childhood and it is interesting to read about it. But her conclusions seemed, well, inconclusive. In the end she waxes poetic but doesn't really make any clear point. She accepts her mother and misses her mothers manias and she repeats how content she is with her own life. It seemed more like she really didn't know how to synthesize her story and that she was trying to convince herself and the readers that she was \\"at peace\\" then it actually seemed true.

Ms. Lyden's story did not answer the questions I had about her feelings about the real possibility that she could fall prey to the genetic disease that her mother suffered from. Nor did she leave the reader with any sense of sympathy for her. I felt that she portrayed herself as a martyred character who had an inflated sense of self.

I was advised to read Lyden's book (as well as other titles) for a writing class I was taking. Some of the titles on the list were very engaging reads (Tobais Wolff's 'This Boy's Life' and Jo Ann Beard's 'The Boys of my Youth,' for example.) This was not. I couldn't even get through the first chapter. While I respect a writer for sharing something so personal, I found this writing to be extremely self-indulgent. Now there are those for whom this type of writing works. I am simply not part of that audience. I would have given this zero stars if I had that option.

Good premises, but wrapped in almost inane language at times.Try to muddle through the story and live by the lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"great message, hokey dialogue","review":"There are many sound success principles in this book. Build trust, accentuate the positive, redirect the energy when mistakes occur. Praise progress, catch people doing things right. There is meat to be found in this book, if you can dig it out of its somewhat sappy coating.Through the fictional story of Wes Kingsley, Whale Done! identifies proven principles that motivate killer whales at Sea World, and illustrates how they may be applied to benefit your relationships at work and home.

I am very glad I picked it up. The positive reinforcement idea has been in my mind all day with the simple phrase \\"whale done\\". I liked the idea of 'One Minute Affiramations' in the \\"One Minute Manager\\" and this book seems to focus and expand on that. The simple concept of trying something different in the \\"Who moved my Cheese\\" was great, but with this book it points you in the right direction or re-direction. Dr. Phil was right on with the \\"Doing What Works and Doing What Matters\\" but \\"Whale Done\\" focuses on the trust issue first, and then getting into specifics. I now spend more of my time looking for the opportunity to catch people doing something right and hit them with instant appreciation.

If your short on time, just read chapter 2.However with that said, the information is solid and helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whales 'OVER' done!","review":"First off, the book is OK and stresses being positive and looking for those positives in your daily life. Great! I am a believer and the book reminded me that we should work a little harder to practice the positive at home, work, and in almost everything that we do.With that said - so what? Most people instinctively know this stuff but cannot find a practical use for it in such a simplistic manner. After all what am I supposed to say when an unthinking employee, just contstantly forgets a task that I have assigned? \\"Whale Done Joe! - you have blown off that same task for the 4th day in the row now - I AM REALLY IMPRESSED THAT YOU STILL WORK HERE????\\" Give me a break. Blanchard would never have got this book in print if it were not for his earlier book successes. Spend an hour in the corner of the library and consume this thing if you must, but remember to only think 'good thoughts' even if you feel your time could have been better spent reading the Sunday comics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic book that should be no more than an article","review":"Written as a fictional story with unnatural dialogue, very simplistic message, does not even scratch the surface of human motivation.

So when Wes Kingsley visited Sea World and saw how the trainers could move the large whales around, he was in awe.In Whale Done: The Power of Positive Relationships by Ken Blanchard, he shares some insight into how working with these animals in a positive method has a whole lot of different result than the tradition methods.This book gives you tools that will enable leaders to look at the job \\"whale\\" done versus simply \\"gotcha\\".So don't swim with the sharks, float with the whales and understand the importance of positive relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Make A Big Splash With Me","review":"As a manager for many years, I got nothing out of this book. I don't see how workers are like whales. It just doesn't make sense!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rather Silly Idea","review":"Here we have a book about an old idea: positive reinforcement. In other words, reward people when they do good as the whale trainer does when he gives the whale a fish for jumping through a hoop. I wish life was this simple and managing people this easy, but dealing with complex relationships is far harder than giving simple rewards. The basic premise of this book is that people are like whales.To assert that managers can command people to do what they want by simple rewards is silly, naive and just downright dumb! No company that I know works this way. There is office politics to consider, personalities to contemplete and power players to acknowledge. This is what it is like to work in an office, which is much more complex than the simple reward system that Blanchard advocates. People are more complex than whales and while this book may be a whale of an idea it is not a book that carries much weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a waste of time","review":"This book is fluff and a way to make a quick buck for the author. It's makes Who Moved My Cheese seem like an epic novel. The print is about an 18 point font - like a Dick and Jane book. The concepts are simple-minded psycho babble. Save your money... here it is in full:Provide positive response to good behaviorRedirect attention of animal when bad behavior is exhibitedPlease... if people were as simple as animals, i.e., WANTED ONLY TO PLEASE, then maybe this would work. I guess it could be applied when training a pet, like a dog.. or maybe a 1 year old child."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Side Of The Story","review":"After I read this book, I watched the Discovery Channel's program about killer whales. They showed the whales swimming in packs and how they combined their efforts to kill a baby blue whale. This is the kind of behavior that Blanchard does not address in his book Whale Done. He has a simplistic view of whales and people. He thinks of only domesticated, well-trained whales that appear in shows for entertainment. Here he misses the mark completely!! He thinks that by being good to whales you will bring out the best in them and he applies the same sort of unreliable logic to people. I suppose giving the killer whales that were about to kill the baby whale a small treat would have spared the baby's life. Nonsense!!This book is flawed, simple and out of touch with reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babble","review":"This book reads like it was written on a two hour plane ride. Suppose the author is looking to cash in on his name in the field. Disappointing and a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about being positive, what a clever way to put it!","review":"Positive relationships are such common sense yet people take them for granted everyday. This book is great because it gives such a different perspective on the power of being positive through building animal relationships and how that can relate to everyday life.Animals and children are the best examples of basic forms of communication and how being positive and always treating them with respect can shape them for a lifetime of success. This book ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok at best...a bit too elementary","review":"Book could have explained the same theories in a third the pages with much less insult to my intelligence.

The book will also provide the networking professional with some new hints and proposals.Since it is fast (you will be able to skip one page or another) and easy to read (read it wherever you want: in the traffic jam or in the airplane) I can recommend it to nearly everybody.Young readers: pay attention, some networking techniques won't work like they have been working in the days when Mr. McKay was young. But the principles of networking are certainly still the same.Maybe a 200 pages version would be sufficient, but the 100 extra pages give an insight into the life of a very interesting person, which I would be proud to have in my network!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd rate this book a 6, if they'd let me!","review":"Should be required reading for every person of high school age or older.

I think the writer had good intentions but failed to write the book correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Yarn","review":"I've read and own several books by Harvey Mackay. I personally think he is a good writer and extremely streetsmart, though I am not so sure if he'd survive in Asia. BUT this book, is not one of his best. This is more an autobiography of Mackay's networking than the art of networking itself. No big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T STALL: BUILD YOUR NETWORK TODAY!","review":"This is the best networking book I have ever read. Networking is the key to my business where I put together groups of executives who help each other. Whether in business or not, these ideas are for everyone. I have When you meet a couple you have not met before, ask how they met and they will begin to tell you the story of their lives, you quickly have new best friends. Someone I know reads the \\"Who's News\\" column in the Wall Street Journal daily and set up a system to track anyone he ever met. He is very successful and loved by all. Mr. Mackay is on the right track. Start early and network often. His ideas about how to stand out from the crowd are good. And, although it sounds like a lot to do, start slowly and add one program every few months. You will be glad you did. Networking will help you in other ways too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating","review":"This book helped me appreciate the value of relationships that I haven't been maintaining--hopefully in time to salvage them!. It also helped identify some connections that ought to be formed and reminded me that while a network can be beneficial to me, it's really the service I can provide for the people in my network that makes life rich and fulfilling. Sounds sappy and obvious I know, but Mr. Mackay's book can help you to internalize these lessons in a powerful way. Lots of great stories too, and a very readable format."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reflection of communication for our times","review":"Despite all the technologies facing us and plenty of opportunities to be impersonal, Macakay points out that personalised communication still rules the day. It reminds me of that adage \`Don't burn your bridges...'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author more concerned with how he is perceived than what he teaches","review":"I found this book to be very poorly thought out. The author spends too much time trying to convince you that because his Rolodex is full of names that he is protected from any type of calamity. What he fails to understand is that relationships take time and effort to build and maintain. Sure, he's a nice guy on the surface but he is too worried about his image to really care about people. I will not be taking his advice and regret the time I spent reading his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read.","review":"HM does it again. I loved his Swim with the sharks and this one is great too. Very well written. Again, this is worth the time and money spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well rounded reinforcement of what you probably know...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and believe, at least for me, that it is truly the only networking book I'll ever need. The stories are relevant analogies which add to the author's message.With that said, most of what is covered are common sense ways of networking, which I found to be the underlying message of the book - \\"treat others with dignity and respect, show genuine concern in them, their careers, and their families, and stay in touch.\\" Apply these simple concepts and you will have all the contacts you will ever need.There are some unique networking approaches Harvey shares with the reader. Those are worth the price of the book alone. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others based on my belief that it serves as reinforcement of what most of us really know."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worth the time to read","review":"This book has way too many useless stories about his life and friends without any real substance about how to build a network. Even worse were the stories about how networking is important. I know it's important or I wouldn't have bought the book. It does seem a bit dated at times, but is mostly relevant if you get by the other stuff. I feel like this book is the product of an author who has had successes in the past and wanted to write another book to make more money and brag about how good he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"I found this book filled with far too much fluff and not enough valuable information. The author told far too many stories and never really got to the point. Generally I enjoy storytelling as a method of learning but this was over the top.

As a beginner, I really love this book because it answers the following questions using real and good stories:1. What is the network.2. Who should be in the network.3. How to meet a new people and make him/her part of your network.4. How to let others to remember you.5. Where to start your networking.6. How to keep your network.I really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Title say it all","review":"You don't necessarily need to read this whole book, you can just look at the tile and know the main concept, the thesis of it.

The bottom line - don't get too comfortable. EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Tools, Easy to Read","review":"This book was a faster read than I anticipated, but I think it should be put on the required reading list at every high school, college, trade school and public library summer reading program.If you're not one of the lucky few born with the innate ability to network far and wide, this book is one of the best I've found for learning and mastering the basics. The author writes with an open, friendly style and shares equally from his successes and failures.Regardless of your age, what industry you're in or your personality, this book has tips and tools that can help you improve your life. It's worth every minute it takes to read and act on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"The idea is networking, job searches, and being able to advance yourself or land a job in case of being laid off is far easier when prepared in advance. This is excellent advice and this book gives pointers in how to prepare before you are forced to change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This is a behind the scenes look at some of the most inspiring movements of our generation. You cannot read the pages of this book and not feel the importance of the moment and the power of the ideas. This book gives you a better understand of the climate at the time of the fall of the eastern block and the fall of communism in Eastern Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - a classic","review":"Sig's book has been a long-term favourite for many interested in labyrinths, and his sense of playful fascination with these tools sweeps you along. I'm surprised to see another reviewer say it is only good for beginners, for as well as successfully introducing the topic to readers, it is also the sort of book that will keep you working with labyrinths for your whole life, and has more passion for you finding your own way of working with labyrinths, than all the other books I've read on the topic (and I've read plenty!). It's been a key book for the Pagan labyrinth revival, but is carefully aimed to accommodate people of any faith and show how labyrinths work inside any spiritual tradition. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Written by One Who Knows","review":"Much good information by someone who probably knows as much about labyrinths as anybody.Discusses them from all angles - historic, scientific, spiritual.

It goes great on anything and has a fresh taste like no other jalapeno sauce out there. The Insanity Sauce is not for the timid but goes great in chili, soups, rice dishes, pasta, etc. The Roasted Garlic is great on just about anything. The bottles are the larger 5-ounce size so you definitely get your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: synthetic","review":"I liked the style of this hat so I ordered it, I did not read the description fully, because I missed that it's synthetic.

I wish they made this in 100% cotton, because otherwise, it's a nice hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Advice","review":"Excellent Book! A lot of great ideas to get the house in order. One of the things I especially like are her suggestions for including kids of all ages in practical matters around the house. Get your two year old to clean?! She offers many idea on how to do it. From that angle, her ideas are rather \\"Montessoriesque\\", giving kids a challenge and a sense of accomplishment when their task is acheived.I do agree, however, that some of her idea will not work with every house and family. (She really does like those disinfectant clothes. Not very economical.) But, if you take what you need and adapt if for your own needs, this book offers much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A planning reference for novices","review":"Overviews are interesting and informative. You can skip to the clearly labeled reference sections that suggest age-appropriate chores and routines. Includes reminders like \\"if you open it, close it.\\" The only down side is you still have to do the work of creating a system that will get your kids to comply.Although it would be helpful for parents of children at almost any age, it's great for parents of young children (preschool-age) so the children can get started in a routine that stays with them and progresses as they mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save time and your sanity!","review":"As a mom with two boys, 4 and 6, this book was very helpful in making our house more organized with specifics to include the whole family. Before I read the book, I spent a lot of time cleaning and organizing in addition to everything else. The age index details out what chore kids can accomplish at what age. Now I include the kids with specific chores in a chart, and the chores get done. This book would be a great Mothers day gift! Having recently moved, the tips for organizing each room help me set up rooms that work! This book is great for every room in the house, with time saving techniques that work. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gray String Tags","review":"These tags are of great quality. One of them went thru the wash and it was still intact. They seem to have a plastic coating on them. Make sure that you have a fine tip paint pen to write on them. Regular markers (even a sharpie) won't work. The ink will rub off. It has to be a paint pen or something similar to that.

Ace bunny killer. An absolute classic of relentless and unceasingly catchy guitar rock. While the lyrics are comparatively highbrow, Chris Bailey's vocals are practically feral -- combined with Ed Kuepper's crushingly powerful guitars and a set of LOUD, LOUD speakers, and you've got a record to reckon with. At this point Bailey and Kuepper seem telepathically entwined; when they later had an inevitable falling out over artistic differences (or whatever...), the band went soft and postpunk, and while that stuff ain't bad, this record is amazing. One of the few seminal punk albums that still holds up when you're all grown up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on! Erm, where we goin'?","review":"Could have been a killer album if it the tempo's hadn't been so rushed, and the vocals so overheated. And the recurring use of the phrase \\"Come on!\\", is really annoying. Very flawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Debut","review":"At times lyrical, this first novel of Lewis DeSoto begins with a great deal of potential. Here are two women who have lost--parents, husband. Here are two women in apartheid South Africa, one black and one white. DeSoto describes grief poignantly without being over the top, but he fails on two points: his dialogue is wooden and he often isn't as subtle as he could be, pointing out his lyricism to the reader too blatantly.DeSoto has a solid start though--he will learn to develop characters through dialogue and create believable conversations. He will draw in the scenery without making obvious metaphors. After all, if he can create sorrow in such a fashion, he can create life.A bit lengthy, this novel is still completely readable and worth the read. The chapters are short and despite my frustrations, I did have a hard time putting it down. There is an investment from the reader into these pages and I know DeSoto is a valuable author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful African voice","review":"DeSoto's writing brings Africa alive ... both in landscape and in the human relationships that defined apartheid. The loss in this book is tremendous and continues to break your heart right up until the end. DeSoto's strength is in his descriptions of the land and in his characters. In the framework of South African apartheid, he describes the impact of both nature and nurture on how we develop our personal relationships in the world and the price we pay when we go against all we believe is true. The back drop of the story is the landscape of a disappearing Africa; the contours of the land are loved and revered and hated, at times, by the characters. DeSoto does an excellent job of describing the different views of the land - depending on which side of the apartheid line that you live.A truly beautiful debut. I hope that DeSoto has many more books in him! I rarely give out five stars to any book but I think Mr. DeSoto's next one may deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had a hard time finishing it","review":"This book moved slowly, and didn't keep me interested very well. The symbology was not very subtle, the author just laid it out in front of you, not letting you search for it at all. I thought the second half was better than the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing read","review":"Not only was the story depressing the main character was pathetic and stupid. I know that sounds harsh, but while I want to applaud her for trying to run her farm after her husband's death and for seeing past the color of a person's skin, given the times and circumstances, staying was a death wish.I'm sure many others liked or even loved this book. However, I'm just not one of them. Not only did the main character not set well with me, the writing did not engage me in the story (jarring switches in the point of view and long, overly detailed descriptions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go and buy this book","review":"This is one of the very best graphic novels that I have ever read. Each story is a stand alone story but they all tie together to paint a picture of the world of \\"Common Grounds\\" a coffee and doughnut shop that is neutral ground for superheroes and super villains. If you pay close attention you will see that the stories are connected but in a very subtle way. I found the story \\"Where Monsters Dine\\" to be the best of the bunch. The tale revolves around four super large monsters that discuss just who the real monsters are. I give this book five stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but not great","review":"The sad thing is this could have been a great graphic novel if the stories just weren't so short ... the one about the waitress who wants to be a famous actress was good but the others ..... basically this is way too many short stories that have the POTENTIAL to be good if they were only explored in more detail. The stories are too short and end too quickly - a bit like getting a bite of a good meal then having the rest of it suddenly whisked away from you .. as far as the \\"average day in the life of a superhero/superheroine\\" type comics/graphic novel feel that this book strives to accomplish, the \\"astro city\\" books do a far better job of this sort of thing, which I would strongly recommend to any readers interested in that kind of story... to be honest I'm really surprised this graphic novel received all the hype that it did from various famous persons in the comics industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor PDA, Batteries drain fast.","review":"For a palm-Pilot they could have done a better job. it is not worth the price i paid.

It's also a pitchintg hazard becaue it's hard to get fingers behind the bins to get anything out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wanted this to work!","review":"Once my daughter grew an interest in Polly Pockets we somehow started to accumulate tons of miniature little shoes, clothes, pocketbooks - if your child has Polly Pockets you know exactly what I mean. I spotted this case at a local consignment store with a $5 tag on it. It seemed like an answer to our Polly Pocket storage issues. I have no idea what this really retails for in the stores. Paying $5 was too much! The drawers are not easy to pull out and you can only put one or two items in each drawer otherwise things get trapped behind the drawers. Don't let this thing fall on its side because everything flies out. Why is there a handle on this thing? You really cannot take this thing anywhere. Congratulations to those who find this product worthy of 4 or 5 stars. This isn't working for us. One star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parent","review":"I was very disappointed in this product.

Great performance material on almost every track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have just returned from another world outside of our own.","review":"The qualifications of a good book may well be one that I 'just couldn't put down', but in the case of Elminster in Myth Drannor by Ed Greenwood, it soon became a frightening experience to pick it back up again. To venture within the limitless, surprising, alien world of the true-blood elves of fair Cormanthor knowing that soon I would be forced to leave this mystical realm again and return here where no Mythal stands guard over our own prejudices and arrogant machinations. And where perhaps, no gods draw near to listen to our plaintive cries as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greenwood has done it again!","review":"Elminster is a delightfully colorful character with a magical life a reader could best experience by the illustration of Ed Greenwood. Excellent story and great reading for FR fans!

Along one of his journeys he encounters many death-defeying feats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ed Greenwood has done it again.","review":"I give this book 5 stars, well possibly 4 and a half for it started to lag near the end when El was wandering aroung as a phantom. This novel gave a good look into Elminster's past during his first mission as one of Mystra's Chosen and the persecution that he faced by the xenophobic elves during his time in Cormanthyr. After reading this novel I'm only left with one question. Who is the Mentor, and why was he so readily accepted by the elves?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I read a lot of fantasy novels, but I have not read the Forgotten Realms books in a long time. I thought I would give this book a shot and I enjoyed it. It is a solid book with typical fantasy characters and story. I recommend the book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow, boring, not a good read.","review":"Too many elves, not enough Elminster. Having Mystra getting him out of practically every tough spot in the book after his wining lowered my impression of Elminster. Hopefully, the next book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and boring as usual from Greenwood.","review":"The whole Elminster series is very disappointing. This series was my first taste of Greenwoods writing and since it came out in hardback, I assumed it would be a good read. Shame on me for judging a book by its cover. Everything else I have read under the D&D; umbrella by the varying authors has been a good read has ranged from good to fantastic.These Eliminster books do not flow and lack depth. I had to struggle through them and then sold them on eBay. These are the only D&D; books I have read and sold. I am sure Greenwood is a good guy but not a good author.If the Eliminster books are your first taste of the D&D; realms, try some other authors as well. Any of them will be better than this. This is most defiantly NOT the best and brightest star in the D&D; realm of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel!","review":"Well, I enjoyd this book.First of all, it's a great sequel of the First book (Elmister, the Making of a Mage), wich was also great. Other reason for wich I love this book, is that it represents the worst part of the elves. Were they are sown as I partialy see them (the ancient elfs at least). They are too good, for human beast with a lot of hair. Still if you like elfs, don't discard this book, becousa as it has to be, there are good elfs too, wich help El in his quest. Great book. I recomend to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I love Greenwoods Elminster line. It is the best. YOu will never get bored with this one as the plot keeps building and twisting. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great. Great for Forgotten Realms background.","review":"As with other postings on Ed Greenwood's material, I agree that he tells a good tale, but can be somewhat scattered in his approach to storytelling. Elminster in Myth Drannor is a great story, providing excellent background material for the Forgotten Realms setting in one of the, until now, most mysterious settings. Often referenced in other Greenwood and Realms' books, Myth Drannor is an intriguing look into the inner workings of this elven society while still letting the reader learn more about Elminster.Ed Greenwood does a good job overall, but again, he can be too jumpy in his storytelling, not letting things flow as smoothly as they could, and can become slightly confusing. Overall, a very good book, but could be so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"More in Cormanthyr than here","review":"If you're looking for elf lore, don't look here. Although I applaud Ed Greenwood's pioneering works for Forgotten Realms, and I'm sure he was an excellent DM, he didn't do his homework on established elven lore ... the Reverie, male vs female roles in nobility, and where did this fascination with mushrooms come from? And the sentance about a second human mage dropping his disguise countered all that Ed had led up to about the challenge Elminster faced in getting into the city in the first place.I do support Ed's vision of the politics of bickering, quarreling elven houses. Sure, they sound like drow in that regard... but remember the Crown Wars. Power corrupts, and elves are not immune to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great middle","review":"The beginning was ok, and the ending was a little less than I had hoped for, but between the first few pages and the last few pages it was awesome. Politics, elfs taken off their high horses :) Good stuff... It was a little decieving though, he was in the City of Cormanthor the whole time, but it wasn't Myth Drannor until the last chapter. I thought it was going to go over the fall more than the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"GODS, I love Elminster!!!","review":"I do not think I have seen a better character than Elminster in I do not know how many years. I can understand why EG does not want to release the Old Mage. If you have any doubts about RPG fantasy, read this book and reconsider..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good books have good characters...this doesn't","review":"I found myself really wanting to love this book and walked away quite disappointed. First, it wanders all over the place. Second, the character developer is just poor. I would have assumed that Elminster was the main character that the author wanted the reader to like but he really came out as a lackey who tripped into situations and needed his butt to be saved by others, consistently. Lastly, while the author strove to use dialogue that reflected the \\"era\\", he slipped several times using modern colloquialisms that stuck out badly.For me, this was oka writing, okay dialogue, poor character development and just an okay story. I felt empty when it ended like nothing was resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Ever Doubted Why We Should Be On The Moon.....","review":"What an exciting and educational collection of essays. Some of the essays are from famous space writers such as Andrew Chaiken and Robert Zimmerman. They even included Alan Steele who is one of my all time favorite science fiction writers. This book makes you think about many of the issues we will have to consider if we are to settle the moon. Some of these subjects include how to get back there, lunar manufacturing, spiritual aspects, as well as what it will mean to mankind. One of my favorite essays was on the \\"Overview Effect\\" by Frank White, which tells how the perspective of mankind can forever be changed. I thought this book was a fascinating read and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean, family fun!","review":"As expected, Michael Landon delivers!

Entertainment...that's what the world needs more of.

McDonald is also a clearer writer with a better command of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best explanations and best accompanying CD I've seen","review":"This book is the perfect place to start learning about quantitative finance and derivatives. All you need is some basic calculus and the rest is easy. This book is definitely for those who need to understand the mathematics behind finance but it is presented in a way that the understanding comes very naturally. The mathematics is presented in a very intuitive way.There is also an accompanying CD. This contains Excel spreadsheets for almost every chapter and model in the book. This is the best such CD I've seen.

The author goes on and on about abortion, teen sex, and the consequences of each. I am a Christian and I don't need a 300+ page book to tell me of all the arguments against abortion and pre-marital sex. This is like preaching to the choir, if I wanted to read on the subject I would buy a NONFICTION book on those subjects.The plot is blurred many times in this book, not knowing if the author is wanting to solve the mystery, convince the \\"liberals\\" abortion is murder, or convince teens how wrong sex is before marriage.In a nutshell, I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to be entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book","review":"First I'd like to say I was surprised at the way this book went. It was a tad bit slow in the middle but once he picked back up I enjoyed knowing the characters and watching them develope.I find it funny how some think that the issues he talked about are \\" right winged conservative\\" when in all reality they are Christ like views. As a Christian I like to look at things as Christ would ( thus the word Christian) and not in the political realm. But of course leftist tend to place all Christians in a box. Which is hilarious when reading those review that state that because its exactly what the character was struggling with!

God's revelations are perfect and when this author adds to them, even in a novel he can cause others to dwell on things that are not true as though they are. Even if Mr. Alcorn's speculations about heaven and life after death prove to be true (and we won't know in this life), is he wiser than God who kept silent on the matter?

Randy Alcorn walks the reader through a complex, yet very plausible, murder mystery while providing Christian models for everyday behavior. He approaches quite of few of today's issues with grace and style without swerving in his convictions. He provides insightful views of the afterlife to include that of an active productive joyful heaven where learning and growth never cease to the contrasting hell as the complete absence of God.

The stances on many of the \\"touchy\\" modern-day subjects Christian face were empowering and encouraged me to examine and bolster my positions.

She is so in love with him, that it hurts; and the way ms rivers describes that made me fall in love with David! Bathshebas story is all about Gods mercy and his neverending grace. Bathsheba and David commited a terrible sin, and had to pay for it dearly; bathshebas own family disowned her and she was spat upon is hatred, plus her first born son died and she had to watch her beloved love, david share his affection with dozens of other wives and concubines!

However, I realized sometime through the book that our author sounded like she quite possibly has Borderline Personality Disorder (I have a parent who is), and upon researching-- it was confirmed.As I got further into the book, my dislike for the protagonist grew.Finally I was disgusted by her behavior and more so, attitude, and after mulling it over for a couple days, stopped reading.I read a lot of memoirs, and like gritty, dark, HUMAN Stories where someone overcomes hardship and triumphs.This was just the long-winded ramblings of an overgrown adolescent, a spoiled and narcissistic woman, full of misery and complaints-- and self-created hardships, stuck on repeat. Shameful to admit, I stopped Caring what happened to her!Like nails on the chalkboard, so are the days of Elizabeth Wurtzel's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bore","review":"At the outset, I found this book readable because of Wurtzel's laughably bad writing. It was almost fascinating how someone with nothing to recommend her could be so grandiose and egomaniacal. At one point early in the book she even compares herself to a vietnam vet, and says that if you haven't been a vietnam vet, that you don't know what it feels like to be her. Excuse me, but has she ever been a vietnam vet? However, such stupidity, after page 50 or so, simply becomes intolerable. To think that drivel likes this gets published, and sometimes even praised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I've never read Elizabeth Wurtzel, but had the misfortune of hearing this stupid woman speak recently at a college. She was supposed to talk about this book -- instead she went off into a rambling, mumbling hour-long rant about how too much attention had been paid to the victims of 9/11, and how no one appreciated how much SHE suffered because her apartment had a few pictures knocked off the wall by the explosions. Even the most self-absorbed student was left wondering if she had a screw loose. Why are people like this indulged? Do they really contribute anything to society, or do they just consider everything and everyone in it as somehow revolving around and reflecting them? Maybe Elizabeth Wurtzel will discover one day that happiness lies in not always thinking about herself, but I doubt she has the intelligence or taste to grasp that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexy does not a writer make","review":"There's no question that she's sexy.

Read the quotes Wurtzel made regarding 911 before buying this, or any Wurtzel book. Having enjoyed Prozac Nation, I was horrified to read her comments regarding the tragedy. I don't know if they were made for shock value, or if she was simply stating how she truly felt. Any admiration I had for her as a writer, has been erased by my disgust upon reading these excerpts. This may not be the place for political commentary, but I want people to be informed before contributing a dime to this woman. By the way, I'm a liberal, and a firm supporter of women's rights.

Her first book, Prozac Nation, was a rambling story of a typical experience with depression that she felt was spectacular solely because it happened to her. In More, Now, Again , Wurtzel tells the story of her (rather uneventful) addiction in a manner that suggests that she has Been Through It All. I am unimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable!","review":"Years ago, I read Prozac Nation. I found the story very interesting. Wurtzel was intriguing. But this book? Well, it lacks everything that Prozac Nation had. The writing is poor. The stories are not very exciting or interesting. Wurtzel seems to enjoy writing just to entertain herself.I could not make it past chapter five. I was bored while reading the book, and my life's too short and my free time is too rare to try to force myself to read a below-average book. I decided not to waste my time. I wouldn't waste yours either by reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phooey","review":"Reading this book was one of the most agonizing ten minutes of my life. You get a little ways in, start skimming, see it's she same old whine, whine, whine, and then toss it across the room, run after it, and begin stomping. Wurtzel is talentless, pathetic, and gives a whole new meaning to the word \\"narcissism.\\" I can't imagine why anyone would want to read her drivel. She's one of those people who are famous for being famous, so I guess we'll be subjected to more books like this ... but I won't. She gives depression a bad name, and I know a little bit about depression, being subject to it myself. I only wish she'd been INSIDE the World Trade Center instead of just fairly close. She says she enjoyed the show from the outside.

I considered the book to be on the scale of \\"The Bell Jar\\" and equally important in the literature on depression. I am, however, taken aback by the comments made by a reader that Miss Wurtzel made about the September 11 attack. Please tell me she did not really make those insensitive comments!! She is a New Yorker! I am interested in reading this book, but I will not if she has no compassion for the Americans that were murdered in a senseless tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please just stop","review":"I had no idea anyone could be this self involved...how many books about herself are we all going to get? 12? 20? Reading this was truly an ordeal; I should have known better. People who actually do something other than stare at their reflection and sigh deserve memoirs and biographies...she is just wasting perfectly good paper.She was published initially because there was sex! and drugs!...etc... and she looked pretty in the photo shoots - I guess we just need for her to wrinkle up and then we'll be spared yet more of this inane self pitying dross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run screaming from the room . . .","review":". . . if anyone recommends this book. The writing is horrible, and Wurtzel is a petty, spoiled, navel-gazing, self-impressed airhead. I agree with other reviewers that people who suffer from depression and addiction deserve sympathy and support. That doesn't mean you have to *like* them, or read their mindless self-indulgent drivel. Wurtzel does not make herself into a sympathetic character, and comes across instead as so self-absorbed that she needs to be taken down a few pegs.Sadly, her book is also a disservice to everyone suffering from addiction; anyone who thinks Wurtzel is typical is likely to have little empathy for drug users. To get a fair, honest and compassionate picture of addiction and recovery, read Shavelson's HOOKED and Frey's A MILLION LITTLE PIECES.Feel bad for Wurtzel, sure. She's human. Read this book? NO - run screaming from the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"and a calliope crashed to the ground","review":"...this one can write and tells funny though unedited stories of what a train wreck she is and you got to dig the courage to say that in print when all the rest of us are train wrecks but walk around in docker pants talking about the lakers game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Stupid...","review":"both for the contents of the book and the author.

ALL ADDICTS ARE SELF ABSORBED. I have much experience in my life with addiciton, and give any addict a book to write, it will be about their pain, their stories, what they experienced. Addiction is about an individual. I found her story fascinating, because it proves that no matter how much money you have or support you have, until you hit rock bottom, until you are ready to give up and let go, you will not recover. It will not work. Elizabeth is an example of how hard addiction is, and her book was a good case study on the workings of a selfish addict, which is what an addict is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less, later, nevermore","review":"Another installment in the ongoing psycho-autobiography of a one-woman Jerry Springer show. If you liked the previous volumes, you'll like this one too. If you were morbidly fascinated by the previous volumes, then you'll likely find this one delivers diminishing returns. Although I'm mildly curious as to what she'll do for an encore. My guess is that the installment will feature Elizabeth Wurtzel turning tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self-destruction personified","review":"After reading this book, I truly believe that God, fate or whom/whatever likes to curse people that are given the brains/looks/charm to get whatever she decides she wants. This ability to use/abuse one's recources thereby inevitably ends in the hell of disappointment, or in a drug rehab facility. As Oscar Wilde said, there are two tragedies in life: not getting what one wants, and getting it. That would be the story of my life! If this is the story of your life as well, read this book and *try* to heed it's lessons, especially if you have a spoiled/elitist bent and don't think things that are bad happen to people like you. They do, and usually, they are of your own making... and without the assistance evil intentions or bad luck.

But a fearless and brilliant one. Great work."},{"rating":"1","title":"puhleese","review":"This woman would be pitiful if she were not so apallingly arrogant.

She boasts that she is the leading non-fiction writer of her generation and that she is the 'prettiest girl she knows.\\" This is good because no one else thinks so. She may have a ph.d. in the reader's digest or in junk food, but she certainly is not worldly, knowledgeable or scholarly. I haven't read one good review of any of her books. How in heaven's name could this sloppy work have been published? The publishers were evidently high as well.

Only someone with a strong grasp of the language and a unique writing style can make a tale of their day-to-day life interesting. Ms. Wurtzel succeds on both levels. Some writers send most of us to the dictionary over and over to look up words that turn out to be pompous instead of necessary. When Wurtzel sent me to the dictionary it was for a perfect description of a situation.The subject matter is not pretty. Addiction is ugly, and Wurtzel shows us that. She shows us flashes of a beautiful life, interspersed with long stretches of appaling mediocrity, and peppered with periods of disgusting depravity. If you want to understand what it would be like to live as an addict-a clinically depressed addict-then you should read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hard.......","review":"to imagine someone more self-involved than Wurtzel.

Or in her case get me some more coke. I am in recovery myself, and I find this book to be more reflective of someone who has borderline or some kind of personality disorder, in addition to substance abuse. The only way to say this is that the author is simply unlikable. Not at all like the other books I have read about recovery. This woman needs to get over herself. She is at least 30 in the book and she keeps refering to herself as a girl and as having boy problems. Some feminist she makes. She is not someone that I would aspire to be like in my recovey, as a career women or as a so called feminist. When she said she would be more honest as a stripper she got it right. People read her books because she was attractive not because of her writing ability. Lets see how she does as she ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Memoir of Self-Absorption","review":"The only distinction of this memoir is that it is unusually self-absorbed even for an addict.

I loved \\"Prozac Nation,\\" but since then, Wurtzel has revealed herself to be a very pompous and marginally talented writer. I got very sick of hearing, in this book, how \\"smart\\" and \\"pretty\\" the author is, and began to feel like \\"More, Now, Again\\" was a therapy project assigned to get Wurtzel to realize what a lovely person she is deep down. This book is neither enlightening nor especially well-written; if you're looking for an honest, powerful memoir about drug addiction, read James Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" instead. That way, you can avoid this arrogant, self-aggrandizing display."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"For the price I guess this is value for money.

This lady writes in such a lyrical fashion (without being artsy, fartsy)that she conjures up, for me, not only the pictures of the house and land, but the colours and smell of the jasmin and roses, the luscious aromas of cooking the local dishes and the wonderful tastes of the local wines. A word of warning, don't read this book in bed at night or the urge to rush down to the kitchen for a snack at midnight will be almost irresistable! Even if I never visit Tuscany, she has made me feel that, in reading her book, I've stepped into a brilliant, colourful 3D picture, where all of these things have happened in virtual reality.

It even contains some practical, fun recipes for those inclined to Italian cuisine (I'm a bit of a chef myself--so this was my favorite part of the book).Appropriately sentimental and obviously educated, the author's voice comes through distinctly in every chapter. Unfortunately, that voice is often pretentious (as the French would say LE TROP!)and would shake me away from the reverie of particular passages. But we can forgive her over-the-top gushing quickly enough a page or two later.All in all, this is a popular, modern classic travel memoir sure to especially please Tuscan-philes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Lyrically written but ultimately quite disappointing. Unfortunately I have to agree with other readers who found this book pretentious and self indulgent.A vastly superior book about authentic Tuscan country life and food is Elizabeth Romer's The Tuscan Year.Tim Parks, a British author, and Paul Hoffman, the former Roman bureau chief for the NYT, have written a number of books about their lives as expatriates in Italy--Parks lives in the Veneto and Hoffman in Rome. Their books are keenly insightful and thought provoking and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favourably slumming it in Tuscany","review":"This is the worst of the self-indulgent 'favourably slumming it' travel books I have read. We are meant to feel that the author has established a link with her environment and feels 'at home' in her holiday home environment, wheras she really is just another rich American pretending to be noble by doing some token manual labour whilst paying the locals for extensive house renovations. As an academic the author writes in a very pretentious style, and the inclusion of 2 chapters of recipes was a joke. Easily the worst travel book I have ever read. Look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sure isn't the movie version!","review":"Having seen and enjoyed the movie years ago, I was intrigued to get the whole story. Books usually tell it so much better. This one doesn't. So, if you're looking to read a better version of the movie, this isn't it - go buy the script.There's no drama, no character development, no humor, no love story! It's just imagery, imagery, imagery. BORING. It was good for putting me to sleep, but that's about it. Here's the cliffsnotes version of the book: Two professors go to Italy, buy a house, fix it up, visit it every summer and Christmas and serve lots of dinners to lots of other people, all who have no story to tell either. You also get a lot of descriptions of doorways and vegetables.

I'm all about memoirs - especially ones that take place in Italy (example: Marcus of Umbria, Extra Virgin). This one was a true snooze fest. It was all - look at me, blah blah, look at my wonderful house, blah blah, look at my perfect life, blah blah blah. I couldn't even finish this book. I felt the author was so self-absorbed and just annoying, and it really surprised me that I felt this way.Maybe one day I'll try to pick it up again and give it another shot, but for now, I'll just pop in the DVD if I'm in the mood for a little Tuscany!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall in Love With Tuscany","review":"Frances Mayes has written a beautiful memoir about her home in Tuscany. Along with Mayes you experience all of the crazy unsettling ups and downs of purchasing a home abroad and attempting to renovate it on American time.Both humerous and faithful to Tuscan life this book inspires new life, new dreams and new hope even in the deadest of hearts. Mayes will leave you hungry physically and emotionally for a life well lived. She introduces characters who adapt to the whims of an American woman with no idea of how Tuscan life really works until she becomes absorbed in her new life and home.The book is FAR better than the movie and the recipes included will leave your taste buds in heaven. I recommend fresh air, a sip of Tuscan wine, good cheese, olive oil, and a dinner of sage and butter pasta and I believe you will melt into this book like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unbearable to listen to","review":"I'm sure this writer is a very nice person, but she should NOT have been the reader on this book. There are some Southern accents that are musical and lovely, but this one is nasal, twangy, and worst of all, just deadly monotonous. No matter how lyrical the words are, the reading is a flat drone that makes it almost impossible to even understand what she's talking about some of the time. All sense of the magic and beauty of the place she's describing is gone. Compared, say, to Peter Mayle's own reading of his book \\"A Year in Provence,\\" which is utterly delightful, this audio book is shudderingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been promising!","review":"Under the Tuscan Sun provides with a few fragmentary glimpses into Italian life but unfortunately, having grown up in Italy I can tell it fails to grasp the heart, spirit, culture and true essence of Italy. Still, F.Mayes is a pretty good writter and she could have written a great book if she had placed Italy in the Center of the story instead of focusing excessively on herself, her opinions, her house, her taste ... Also, a touch of humour like Peter Mayle's would be useful. Unfortunately, Ms Mayes takes herself and everything about her life extremely seriously, whereas Mr Mayle has a noble humbleness that renders a humorous view on life possible ! If you'd like to learn more about F.Mayes, her house, and her taste on food, then this is the book for you; however, if you wish to read about genuine Italy, another book would be more advisable, even Goethe's travels to Italy written ages ago !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!!!","review":"I bought this book to read during my trip to Tuscany. Everyone told me how great it was....and the first couple chapters were ok but I quickly got tired of hearing her drone on and on about the great meals with endless bottles of wine and her perfect contadina. I wanted to know more about her and how she came to this point in her life...her relationship with Ed, her family, her exhusband...she touches on it and goes nowhere. Her descriptions of play by play of the housework were excruciating. How this is a best seller is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like the Movie","review":"I bought this book after watching the movie which I loved. I usually find that when a book is made into a movie, that I prefer the book. Not in this case though. The book is so very different than the movie. It reads more like a travelog, not much of a story. I also thought the chapter with the recipes was weird.If you just want to read a travel diary than you won't be disappointed. The author makes Italy sound wonderful. If you are expecting a story similar to the movie, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Pretentious","review":"This is a horrid book, badly written, poorly edited, and tedious to read. There are endless descriptions of the things she buys, the food she eats, her boyfriend Ed's muscles, and the hardship she endures having to schlep back to her bayside house in boring old San Francisco. We only get Italy filtered through the self-absorbed eyes of Ms. Mayes, a thing she herself complains about of D.H. Lawrence: \\"I forgive him now and then when he totally disappears from the text and just writes what he sees.\\" Hmmmm.Particularly offensive were her observations about Roman Catholic saints: \\"Oh, here is where they put their awe\\", and \\"here is where they put there memories and wants\\" as if she is some 19th century anthropologist speaking of a primitive culture far beneath herself. What arrogance. Well, Ms.Mayes, I know where to put this book - in the recycling bin, in the hope that it will be reborn as blank paper in the typewriter of a real writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated consumerist sludge","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but was terribly disappointed. For all the nuance of Italian life this volume conveyed, it could have been a book about home repair in Terre Haute, Indiana. The author comes across as an upper class Southern belle twit who is inexplicably employed as a creative writing instructor at San Francisco State, a gritty blue-collar campus. She's so involved with her job and students there that they merit no mention at all, except perhaps as impediments to her yuppie quest in Tuscany.This book is a triumph of marketing over substance. I was hoping to learn something about Tuscany or Italian mores, but all I got was the author's self-indulgent small talk. She did, however, answer one question for me: Who can possibly afford to shop in Florence?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Absorbed Twaddle-No Peter Mayle!","review":"I have read a lot of the \\"lets move to a foreign country and buy a house and live in it\\" books over the years, and this one is by far the worst of the bunch. Indeed, about half way through I just put the book down and could not finish it...it is just that bad.A lot of the other reviewers who did not like this book have summarized quite well the points which also strike a chord with me, so all I can say is if you want a good book about country life in Italy, get \\"Extra Virgin\\" and have a good time reading the book and at least you can identify with the writer, and actually learn something rather than be slathered with pretentious musings. I for one am not interested in someone who is so self-absorbed. Most persons who have typical jobs and responsibilities and budgets to manage just have a hard time identifying with this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"under the tuscan sun audio cd abridged by frances mayes","review":"i found the story line very good, but they really needed to find a different person as a voice for the audio. not much flare to the story as it was read and i'm sure it would have been alot more interesting with a different reader. i listen to lots of books on audio, it surely could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"re: the audio version..read in a twangy, dull monotone.","review":"I looked forward to the audio version of Under the Tuscan Sun, but after just 5 minutes, I knew I had made a mistake. I would suggest listening to a portion of Under the Tuscan Sun before purchasing it. It is read in a monotonous, heavily accented manner which becomes annoying pretty quickly. Too bad! Toujours Provence is much more enjoyable if you're looking for something along these lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring after a few chapters","review":"Gets boring and very predictable after the first couple of chapters. A very American view of Europe I would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"If only I hadn't seen the movie first - which although it wasn't that great a movie still gave me a preconceived idea of what the book would be about. If only the author hadn't mentally wandered off all the time on this tangent and that instead of sticking with the trials, tribulations, and fun of falling in love with an old ruin of a house and bringing it back to life. If only I had been able to finish the book... I read to the middle of the book and finally gave up. It just wasn't interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the Tuscan Sun","review":"I bought this book from Border's because I wasn't sure I would have time to see the movie. The book has Diane Lane on the front making one believe this book is \\"something\\" like the movie. It is nothing like the movie. I was very disappointed and returned the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fugly American","review":"The author narrated the audiobook herself and I thought perhaps her droning monotone was why it came across like someone reading a grocery list to a tape recorder. Zero personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about finding and reveling in happiness","review":"Only the cynical would not enjoy this charming book. I loved it! I've never read a book that made me feel so strongly about enjoying and appreciating my life and having the courage to go after happiness. It's vivid discriptions awaken the senses. I love Frances Mayes style of writing, fluid, colorful and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, disappointment ahead!","review":"Having failed in my search for a copy of this best-seller in my local library I went ahead and ordered this book from amazon. I've enjoyed visiting Tuscany and I heard that this book was interesting. I've never been so disappointed in a book. Dull and pretentious are the first words that come to mind. Unreadable is another. If you are actually interested in a an american professor's mid-life crisis and her reawakening in Italy - go for it. Otherwise go no further, hit BACK now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wannabe Martha Stewart of Tuscany","review":"This book recited endless variations of \\"Look at me, my wonderful life in my Tuscan house which, with my wonderful husband I did a wonderful job of renovating, my endlessly wonderful cooking and eating (here are my recipes), my shpping, my appreciation for the food and sensory quality of Italy as only my husband and I know how. Aren't you fascinated by my exquisite experience?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Remodeling Detail","review":"I picked up this book when it first came out and couldn't get through it because of the painfully detailed descriptions of the remodeling. This is less a book about beginning a new life in Italy and more about the remodeling of a house which just happens to be in Italy. I picked up the book again last week and did manage to finish it. I'm really surprised that this became a bestseller and would probably not read other books by this author. Julia Child wrote a wonderful, wonderful book called \\"My Life in France\\" that I would definitely recommend as a great example of travel writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primi, Secondi, Mindless Pap","review":"This memoir reflects upon a wondrous journey to a fertile and passionate place, a place which oozes life well-lived, Tuscany. Unfortunately, the journey was taken and commented upon by the puddle-deep Ms. Mayes, a pompous, self-absorbed West Coast pseudo-intellectual who is quite impressed with herself, thank you very much. Her mindless quasi-philosophical musings irritate more than enlighten. Her distant, almost clinical analysis of the lovable and idiosyncratic people around her in Italy infuriates, and confirms, again, that she is missing the point by a mile. This is a woman who doesn't know where she is from: Georgia, Italy or San Fran. As she writes, she tries to find balance between the three and sell its reasonableness. She fails. Her truth is not to be found in Italy. That said, the recipes are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-absorbed treatise","review":"I read this book at the urging of my daughter, hoping to learn something about the Tuscan area, people and culture. What a mistake! This was the longest bit of ego-centered writing I have ever had the misforture to read. Ms Mayes is so determined to impress readers with her intelligence and cosmopolitan attitude that she fails to to give us any really interesting or useful information about the region (other than the recipes). Her character description is so poor that I learned more about the tmporary Polish workers she hired than I did about her husband/partner (I don't know if they are married or not). He comes across as a lackey, doing odd jobs for her. On another subject, she attempts to give a scholarly review of the religious history and practices of the region but what comes across is her total lack of understanding of the Catholic faith.My advice: buy a good travel book if you plan to visit Italy, and leave this book for the dust bin where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"I like the way the author describes the process they go through for the restauration of their new home. You live through their anxieties regarding the installation of their floors, the opening of new doors, specially when you are dealing with people who have no sense of rush, but prefer to take their time and enjoy their work. I also think she has a great gift in depicting not only the people, but also the countryside, the history of the region of Tuscany. The way she talks of the markets, it makes you almost smell the tomatoes, the basil, taste the pasta...! Reading this book has not only made me a better cook... it has also made me look forward to spring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My book club all agreed, why was this a NY Times bestseller?","review":"Our group of 10 found this book to be boring, inconsistent in the writing, and too much like A Year in Provence to be original. Why would this be a bestseller? Nothing ever comes to a conclusion, characters appear and then are never heard from again, the writing seemed to have been fleshed out from magazine articles and tinkered with, when one should have left well enough alone. Not one we would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, painful, awful","review":"This book was a horrendous waste of precious free time. Mayes is pretentious, boring, and a bad writer to boot. I have no idea why the book was so critically acclaimed. The renovations are so laboriously described, I wanted to scream. Her sprinkling of cute little Italian words everywhere is so very precious--it's like Mayes is saying, 'Look at me, I speak Italian! Aren't you jealous?'. Well, I speak French, and this book is merde. I almost bought the book, but luckily ended up borrowing it instead. If I had spent money on it, I think I would have to write to Mayes and ask for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Frances Mayes has an unimaginative and dry writing style that makes this book painful to get through. It was selected for our book club and no one finished it. I finally stopped after reading three pages about a fence. The writer is pretentious and the writing is dull. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, pretentious, pretentious...","review":"I couldn't get past the author's pretentious and self-important attitude coming through in her writing style. I had to force myself to finish the book. Definitely stick with Peter Mayle. A much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and Dull","review":"I was excited to read this book after all of the rave reviews it received. Unfortunately, I had problems finishing it and began forcing myself to read it thinking it would get better. It didn't. It was very repetitive and often described the same thing over and over. At times the author comes across as an arrogant know-it-all, as though she's the only educated and cultured American who travels the right way. She sends out the message that she's the greatest cook who ever lived, that it turns you off to the food she's describing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother - pick up Peter Mayle instead","review":"I read this book when it was first published, so some of the details have escaped me, but the bad taste it left in my mouth remains. I picked up this book because the jacket claims some similarity to Peter Mayle, whose stories of living in the south of France are truly entertaining and original. Mayes, cleverly, borrows many of the charms of Mayle's writing and changes the scenery (not much) to Tuscany. If only her crime stopped there. Alas, no. She insists upon polluting the landscape with her aristocratic, narrow-minded lifestyle. Thus my spoiled appetite. Thank goodness her attitudes and perspectives are rare, indeed, in San Francisco.Stick to the real thing - Peter Mayle - and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Book","review":"This book was a total bore, and a struggle to complete. I found the details of the renovation project to be tedious. I'd rather take a quick tour around Home Depot. I also didn't care for the author's condescending attitude to the locals, workers, etc. I've been to Italy a few times and found this unrealistic and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--not what I expected.","review":"I thought the calendar would have pictures of Bramasole, which I was very interested in after reading Mayes' two books. But it only offers a few outside shots of the building. Where are the kitchen they labored over, the fireplaces, etc.? I'm not interested in pictures of grapes, vineyards. I wanted to see THE HOUSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Innocents Abroad\\" live!","review":"Talk about a typically clueless American. I threw this book away in exasperation after reading about half."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS--WONDERFULLY WRITTEN","review":"Frances Mayes' is a terrific writer. Her book, Under the Tuscan Sun, has inspired me in more ways than just visiting Italy---although I am anxiously awaiting my trip next year.Her easy, no nonsense approach to writing about her daily activities, finds, pleasures, problems etc invites the reader to sit, relax and feel like you're talking to your best friend about her trip.I absolutely loved the book. I've been tempted to take up creative writing and I would love to be one of Frances Mayes' students at SF State.Ms. Mayes' has a beautiful way of expressive vocabulary.The book gets FIVE STARS in my Opinion!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an adventure to stimulate the lust for life and joy in Italy","review":"Frances Mayes has written an incrediable book about the love she has developed for Italy, its people and the vast history that that is forever being re- discovered while restoring her wonderous Italian villa .This is wonderful reading for anyone with a dream of creating a life outside of America! I hope that she will write another book to continue where she left off in Under the Tuscan Sun. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brava Signora Mayes, brava !!!","review":"This book will undoubtedly create an immense amount of \\"envy\\" of Ms. Mayes. The life, the food, the excitement of rebuilding the past and creating a home in what is certainly one of, if not THE most enchanting place on the planet. Even if you don't like challenges or work or travelling, how can one not feel the immense desire to walk in Ms. Mayes footsteps. Go for it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in audio book, both story line and reader","review":"I love listening to audio books and have listened to many, but this was very boring and the reader's voice was very annoying. I could not go past the second tape. I kept waiting for a plot, but it never happened. Was more like a travelogue and diary of the house restoration and not what I was hoping for, after seeing the previews to the movie. A friend had related the plot of the movie to me, and it doesn't remotely resemble the book. Perhaps I should have read the description of the book more carefully before selecting it at the library. It was not at all what I was looking for. I'm so glad I didn't purchase either the book or audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good the bad and the brutto","review":"I was torn about this book, there were sections of it that I truly enjoyed reading, which was during this spring while on a month and a half exploration of Italy.But somewhere towards the end there was something in the tone of the narration that was starting to bother me. Upon reflection it occurred to me that it seemed somewhat self congratulatory and lacking in any real humility.It was kind of an anti-\\"Europe through the back door\\" approach that made a point of always emphasizing the joy of things only available to those with substantial wealth, whereas for me the most beautiful enchanting experiences in Italy were the things that money can't buy.As for the recipes, I personally thought there were way too many of them, but then I'm not much of a cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried","review":"I rarely don't finish books. I think I made it through 200 pages of this one before I finally flung it across the room. The author does a good job of describing food and recipes and inspired me to try some of them. That was why I gave the book 2 stars. If it had been written as a cookbook with some brief diversionary stories about Italy I would have enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the author bores you with long, drawn out, self indulgent episodes about her summers in Italy. I finally thought to myself, if someone like this cornered me at a party I would deperately be trying to get away from them. Instead of being transported to a idyllic place, I felt like I was trapped in my living room with an annoying neighbor with boxes of vacation slides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully descriptive experiencesof author'slife inTuscany","review":"The author, a creative writing teacher at San Francisco State University, draws us a poetic picture of her experiences in Tuscany. Frances Mayes' lyrical descriptions of her villa's renovations combine with delicious recipes for the regional cuisine to make your heart and soul long for the sunny Tuscan skies. Her adventures exploring the nearby Tuscan countryside, from ancient Etruscan tombs to Renaissance churches, fill you with wanderlust. A beautiful country tale artistically told by an American who loves what she sees and where she is. Her story took me away, tempting me to travel to the book's location to search out her villa, her gardens, her Italian Tuscan sun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I was really looking forward to this book because I enjoyed the movie so much. This is the first time in my experience that the movie was better than the book. The author goes overboard in her descriptions to the point of being distracting from the actual story. I do not recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the movie at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuscany is calling my name...","review":"This book was completely different from the movie - but I really liked it! It didn't hurt that I was reading it when it was cold and gray out (and dreaming of Tuscany).The author writes a lovely story of how she and her husband find a beautiful home in Italy and restore it (it's in shambles, just like the movie). The descriptions of Italian culture were riveting and, of course, lots of mouthwatering descriptions of food and alfresco meals. The biggest problem of the book, I think, is that it's more of a diary that rambles all over the place. But other than that, it's pure delicious escapism, and who doesn't love that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Editing","review":"I have this book in a physical form, but I bought it so that I could read it on my kindle. Obviously, I like the book, but I was really disappointed with the editing on the electronic version. There are typos, bad characters where accents or special characters should be, bad formatting... for the price, I really expected a more polished product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book if your not in a hurry","review":"This is a pretty good book...It's not perfect but Frances Mayes does a great job letting us(the reader) see what she sees and tastes what she tastes. I found the recipes a bit much..I am not one to read recipes unless I am acually going to make something..Overall great book...a great book for a long train ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good food, with a side order of snobbery","review":"Not that this book needs one more opinion, but what the heck. Frances Mayes is a talented writer, born to a life of privilege she never once acknowledges. All I wanted was one sentence saying, God, I am SO lucky to be able to do this. But it never came. Although there are some great sentences, and the food descriptions are lush and sensual, when it comes right down to it, Mayes is pretentious, condescending, and incredibly self-absorbed. Pity the workers who've built Bramasole into a pleasure dome . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burt Wolf-esque, Bob Villa-ee, Martha Stewart-does-Tuscany","review":"I wanted to travel, but with neither the time nor the money, I instead ordered Under the Tuscan Sun from Amazon. Transported by the pages of this book to Tuscany, I peered over the shoulder of an insightful English prof as she tackles the tedium of a major renovation project i.e. turn one ancient stone farmhouse into a cozy vacation home. Mayes sprinkles Italian words, phrases, recipes, history, and architectuere into this narrative like so many almonds in biscotti.She renovates and (I guess simultaneously) writes of her adventure with a Martha Stewart-ish enthusiasm for a Bob Villa-scale project that even Burt Wolf would enjoy visiting.This book was fun to read. But I couldn't resist adding a modicum of humor to the customer comments at the Amazon site after so much syrup had been spilt. I'm sure Martha would rinse a clean towel in warm water and clean up the mess. Me? I just add jokes on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"You too, can write a book!","review":"How is it that this even got published? I am a voracious reader, even books I don't really care for I finish just because I want to see what happens in the end. But I just couldn't do it with this one. How can you be so possibly boring?? Have you ever been stuck on the phone with someone who just loves to talk about themselves? You listen, occasionally give a few grunts as acknowledgement, and sigh in relief when they finally run out of words and use for your ear. This book was that, in text form. Frances Mayers needs someone to talk to, I guess no one would listen, so she wrote it all down in book format. If this is all it takes to publish a book, maybe I'll become a writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could Italy be boring? Ask Frances Mayes....","review":"This was such an incredibly self-absorbed, boring read. When I buy a book to be taken away to another place - I don't expect to have to skip chapters because I just can't make it through. And remember - she's talking about ITALY! Peter Mayle is a much more enlightened and talented writer - although he writes of France and not Italy - his books are so far beyond Frances Mayes that he is in another league! Read Peter! Trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunny,Inspirational and refreshing! Read it this summer!","review":"As Ms.Mayes says, this is a book about the simple life in Italy. A life so simple that in its simplicity and beauty is always charming. I have read many books that describe in words and pictures the wonderful places that one can find everywhere in Italy,but \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" rather than photograph peoples and places inspires the reader to rethink the notion of a voyage or for that matter of a vacation. After reading \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" I got the final push that made me buy a small apartment at a beachfront and transform it into a little mediterranean paradise (it is in the caribbean, actually.) Mayes racount of how she converted an old house in the Tuscan Countryside, that she found and bought in shambles, into a second home abroad full of light and aromas is an entertaining and inspirational reading... and the recipes, excellent if you are into cooking or just enjoy a good meal, a sunny book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MARTHA STEWART DOES ITALY","review":"A book about the simple life? Maybe, if you have tons of money to carelessly fling about. Simple planks make lovely shelves.....yeah, right. It would probably cost a hundred bucks per plank to get something that doesn't look like a recycled pallet.I was swept up occasionally by some poetic descriptions, but the effect was lost as she kept going on and on and on and on....Ms. Mayes seems rather emotionally detached from people. She appreciates them in an aesthetic sense, but I get the feeling that she would ditch her husband if he didn't match the decor."},{"rating":"1","title":"No insight, substance or even humor -- not worth the time","review":"The author has no insight into the people or the countryside of Tuscany. She rambles and rambles without providing substance or interest. I was very disappointed having hoped for something as fun and insightful as Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence. I am leaving for Tuscany with a group of friends and told thme not to bother with this book.I love to read but this was work..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough about Italy and too much about Mayes' feelings.","review":"Sorry, but I just don't get it. The first chapter or two were entertaining and enlightening. The rest is a boring, self-absorbed account of the author's feelings about the good fortune she has had to buy a house in Italy. I learned very little about the Italian people and more than I ever wanted to know about Ms. Mayes' eating habits and flea market finds. Definitely not for the person preparing for a trip to Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Seller in US?","review":"The book is totally disappointing. I started off enthusiastically but had to force myself to continue after the first ten pages. I really have no idea why it is still topping the best seller list! I hate to say the following.....but the author cannot write."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, So. It made the train ride a little less dull","review":"Under a Tuscan Sun was a moderately enjoyable book, although nothing to rave about.Although well written it had that undeniable trait shared by most American travel / overseas books; it was on the whole ignorant of all things foreign.I found many of the author's observations condescending and cutesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Italian Phrase Primer might have been a better title.","review":"I found this book to be very aggravating with Italian words and phrases constantly interjected. It totally took away from the momentum. I would not purchase another book by Ms. Mayes. She got extremely lucky when this book placed on the bestseller list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bascially \\"A Year in Tuscany\\"","review":"I, like many other readers, was put off by the author's flippancy at spending money. The book was full of complaining about the costs of extreme renovations and their inconviences. I was also quite irritated when the author insinuates those that try to get a crash course in Europe, i.e. those who CAN'T afford an Italian farm house and the ability to spend 3-4 months away from there domestic jobs, are inferior to people like herself. Additionally, I found her writing to be rather unstructured. Perhaps, I would have enjoyed this more if it had been written by a poor, struggling graduate student sleeping in hostels and taking odd jobs. If you'd like a book with a similar concept (foreigner moves to another country to fix up rustic farmhouse), I would recommend \\"A Year in Provence\\" by Peter Mayle."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the movie-not the book","review":"This is one to slog through--she lost me half way through the book with \\"I almost stepped on a soft,dead rat...\\" please!! I would not but another F.Mayes, ever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basta cosi!! (Enough already!!)","review":"The book started off as a charming discourse on life in Tuscany, but I found myself by the first third of the book yelling, \\"per l'amor del cielo - for the love of god - quit going on and on re. the perfect tomato and eat the f**king thing already!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring to finish","review":"The book started out interesting, and I did enjoy the descriptions of the renovations and the countryside. However, by the time I got to the middle of the book, I was bored! Maybe I should have kept reading, but there are too many other fabulous books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book I ever wasted time reading","review":"I can't believe that this book was on our best-seller list in the USA. No wonder the European countries percieve us as unintelligent and mediocre. I am also baffled that this woman, Frances Mayes, is an instructor of creative writing. I felt ill (embarassed for her) when I read the descriptions of the countryside or maybe a description of one on the men working for her. I almost threw the book out the window of the train on the way to Venice, but decided that I paid too much for it in Florence. I also felt that I should at least give the recipes a chance when I got home. Did anyone bother to edit this book? I can not believe the grammatic errors! I can never again, unfortunately, read about the Etruscans and their tombs. It was overkill. However, even though I did not enjoy the book, it gave me the confidence and the reassurance to know that I can do anything and could get some kind of praise or recognition for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuscany is for hose bags","review":"Don't be fooled by the repressed bourgeois hype - Tuscany is not all that special. The people are really uptight and annoying and narcissistic and foolish and small and petty and not sexually attracted to me, which is really problematic. I don't have these problems in Albania."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for book aficionados","review":"I highly recommend this book. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. The scenery depictions are so well written you feel like you can actually feel and smell the Tuscan sun and air. I couldn't put this book down and when I had to, I didn't want to. The best part of the book is that there are recipes and I love to cook. Buy the book. You will not be disappointed. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring ...","review":"After many brave attempts to read this book, I had to concede defeat after page number 62. It took me a good one week to reach that far. I have been to Tuscany and to be honest, the book doesn't seem to do any justice to the beautiful place. The prose is verbose, lackadaisical and (worst of all) bereft of any humor. On many occasions, the writer makes sudden tangential diversions (with unknown characters) confusing and subsequently irritating the reader. And, did I mention that there are many recipes in book? Totally unacceptable for a memoir-based travel book.If you have seen the movie already, then the book might be a little difficult (and boring) to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't get through this book!","review":"I'm listening to the audio CD right now - but, it's torture! I find myself falling asleep at the wheel while it's playing in the car...so, I\\"m going to have to find something else to listen to...and fast!I was expecting a fairly similar story-line to the one in the movie. No way Jose! The only thing in common is that she bought a \\"fixer uper in Tuscany\\". No divorce...no lesbian friends...no romance...no funny repairmen (yet)...no joy...no dancing...no sex. Instead, the author narrates in her very irritating Southern drawl complete with very noisy saliva smacking (it' hard to ignore). She talks on, and on about a dry well...or repairing a stone wall...or blah, blah...blah... I keep hoping it will get better...but, it's just more of the same, so I'm going to cut my losses - and try to sell the audio book on e-bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tuscan Sun Shines Elsewhere","review":"Someone gave us this book--and that's the only good thing we can say about it. Apparently this type of book--overwritten, cloying, simplistic--easily fills the void in the American spirit. By reading it we become \\"spiritual voyeurs\\", content to witness anothers foreign achievements, however meager and poorly written they might be. Yes, we should have books written by authors residing in foreign climes--but not druidic, pseudo-poetic extrapolations like this! But the obvious success of Ms. Mayes' nonsense (with recipes!) has made her rich and that is what America exists for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Every time I mentioned this was my book of choice for the week, everybody's response was: it was a great movie! Meanwhile, I was struggling to make it pass 1 page a day. It might have been the portion where she is interviewing the contractors or the part where she talks about how she cleaned the house. I just could not continue to read it because simply put: it was boring to ME. I realize this book might appeal to others as a collection of memories from a life experience. My expectation in a book might be more into the essence and story and less on the grueling details of how to clean Bramasole."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the movie","review":"I bought this book because I simply adore the movie. This book is not the movie. The movie took a few lines from it here and there, but it is not the same story. There is no Katherine, no Marcello, no Pawel, no Patti, etc. The entire plot of the movie doesn't exist at all in the book. If you loved the movie and you're wanting to dig deeper into that story by buying the book you'll be disappointed. But if you've never seen the movie, and you just want a snap shot of an American's life in Italy it's not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"Charming and beautiful, Frances Mayes' \\"Under The Tuscan Sun\\" captures the spirit of Tuscany in wonderful flowing words. I could taste the wine and the food and see the olive trees in her terraces. I've fallen for Tuscany. Other readers may hate this book, but this one made me feel good. Life is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, patronizing, self-absorbed, but good recipes.","review":"This affluent Californian pretends to \\"experience\\" the people of Tuscany without ever bothering to really know any locals (except for the expatriates, whom we presume she can see in a mirror). She is just a bit too precious and really seems like Martha Stewart in Italy. As an Italian-American, a cook, and an architect, I find Frances Mayes a comical American who never really knows anyof the Italians living around her, gets hoodwinked by every contractor she encounters, and carries the renovations to absurdity. At least she has some good recipes in the book. It was a waste of my time to read this syrupy baloney on Wonder Bread when I craved a taste of real prosciutto and fresh crusty bread. On her next trip, she should truly befriend a few Italians without hiring them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martha Stewart in Tuscany","review":"This book was boring, whiny, and obnoxious. This rich b****h buys a Tuscan villa, and then writes hundreds of pages listing all of the other things she buys to furnish the house: The title of this book should have been \\"Shop 'til You Drop in Tuscany.\\" Throughout all this shopping, she feels sorry for herself and whines about how her Tuscan home doesn't boast the niceties of her other home in San Francisco. When actual Italians make cameo appearances in her self-centered monologue, they are quaint little stereotypes. And often the author is just plain wrong about her facts: For instance, in a chapter about visiting the Maremma, she goes to Montalcino, which ain't the Maremma. I suppose there are Martha Stewart-esque Italophiles who will think this book is \\"precious,\\" but otherwise, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Italy?","review":"I slogged through this book hoping I could learn something about a part of Italy that I have only passed through. Instead I was subjected to the mid-life crisis of a pampered, spoiled woman for whom everything must be JUST SO. She doesn't experience Italy, she engineers \\"experiences\\" of \\"Italy\\". I rolled my eyes at her dismay in having to take her wedding guests to a downscale, unatmospheric, but tasty pizzeria when all the others were closed. Hey, if the pizza's good, who cares? One summer in Naples (my fave) and her fairy tale image of Italy would crumble like a rock slide on the Tange. (Might have to try her hazelnut gelato recipe, though...) Paolo Tullio's \\"North of Naples, South of Rome\\" isn't about Tuscany, but it's a more insightful and realistic introduction to rural Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the Tuscan $un","review":"I just have to echo the reviews of Mike from Abingdon and Cary from San Francisco. I lived in Florence for several months and was given this book as a gift. I found this work rather self-congratulatory and superficial, and her attitudes toward the Italians and their culture at times condescending. It is a book about spending money, lots of it, with little literary value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"I am glad I didn't spend money on this book, it was loaned to me. The first third was of interest - how to negotiate buying a house in Italy vs my own country of France. It then became the story of a wealthy American couple pretending to have spent their last penny buying this farm but still managing to go there from California three times a year, spending what must have been a fortune installing a central heating system. What happened to the fireplace? They pretend to live like the locals and certainly don't blend in. We learn that the author owns a Sub-Zero refrigerator in San Francisco, how relevant is this to the story? we also learn that Ms. Mayes's mother had a cook. In brief, I found this pretentious and not worth the paper it is written on, made a great tax write-off though for the Mayes...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous and self serving","review":"Frances doesn't belong in the country I recognize. She is extremely patronizing toward Italians and appears to be a spolied rich girl. Who is Ed? Is he her boyfriend; future spouse; current beau?She makes it seem all of if all of us can simply purchase a home in Tuscany. It is second nature! We all have off four months a year We were all left huge inheritances. Frankly after reading this book I can't stand the woman. She is also quite condescending toward Italians (my heritage) and Ed. It's all about Frances and her petty problems.I can't believe they made a bogus movie based (losely) on this book.Please visit Tuscany and you will see it's different that this self-indulgent tripe.By the way we visited Cortona and spit at her house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH PLEASE!!","review":"The \\"emotionally stingy\\" comment is a bit over the top don't you think? Please stick to the actual \\"review\\" of the book and help the rest of us make a decision PLEASE! It's only a book, not the United States Constitution!Many of the other intelligent and thoughtful contributions are well worth the read and I thank you many of you for helping me to decide whether or not this book is worth the purchase.I sincerely hope that Tuscany is much friendlier than the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuscany, The Return","review":"After reading Frances Mayes, Under The Tuscan Sun. I once again I was thrust into the wonderful sights, sounds and tastes of Tuscany. It has been 15 years since my travels to Italy, however, Frances' descriptions of Tuscany are so vivid that once you begin to read you will be drawn deeper and deeper into the most wonderful memories of previous journeys. If you have never traveled to Italy, Frances' book describes the \\"good life in Italy exactly as it truly is. Her descriptions of the towns, the people and the food is incredible. All I had to do was shut my eyes and there I was again in beautiful Tuscany."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayes should have hired a professional reader","review":"The book may actually have its merits but you will never get to appreciate it if you attempt to listen to her boring monotone delivery on the CD. I couldn't get through the second CD without screaming for relief. Seems almost like a parody of books on tape(CD) as no one could possibly do a better job of suppressing your imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Lackluster, Little Humanity","review":"Wish I'd read the customer reviews BEFORE buying this book, there are many who found this book as lacking as I did. Hoping for an adventure, a touch of the romantic, mixed in with delightfully simple recipes. Reading this was LABOR -- while Ms. Mayes has the knack for painting a picture with her descriptions, there is just a lot lacking in her book. Unfortunately, I bought both books at the same time. Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Totally Dull Account of a House Renovation in Tuscany","review":"I began reading this book with much anticipation being a lover of Italy. But what a complete bore - pages and pages of description of clearing fields, shoring up walls, striping floors. It was a big yawn and an act of will just to finish the book. Something makes me suspect that it became a bestseller because of the similiarity of the author's name to that of Peter Mayle who writes those delightful books about Provence. Believe me Mayes is not in his class. If you want to read about the renovation of a house read Tracy Kidder's book,\\" House\\". It's vastly superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Memoir - \\"My home, well ONE of my homes!\\"","review":"I have NOT seen the movie, so this review is only based on the book.This book was highly regarded by a few family members as a beautiful read. Sure, the descriptions are lovely and well written, but the whole idea of a memoir is suppose to be interesting--this is not. I love travel memoirs, reading peoples travel stories, but this was like reading a guide to restore a house--very dry. Ms. Mayes writing reminds me of David Sedaris mocking a wealthly tourist, \\"My home, well... ONE of my homes\\".I have decided to give the book another try. XM Sonic Theater is playing the book and it is being read by the author. However, Ms. Mayes monotone voice and lack of live storytelling makes the story even worse. I understand why authors have voice actors to read the books.The book is written lovely, but does not exceed the expectation I was excepting."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLE QUICK SUGGESTION!!!!","review":"Look at the reviews. You either love the book or hate it. There doesnt seem to be much of an inbetween. If you are thinking of buying the book then go to the bookstore and sit down and read the first chapter or two. If you think you can handle more of the same then you'll probably like the book. If you keep thinking....whens the story going to begin and when am i going to stop hearing about the house....youre out of luck...put the book away! I like detail....but this book is like talking to that one person that will never let you leave a conversation and has to tell you about people you dont know and are so descriptive they have to tell you the name of ever intersection they passed in their story. I think this will probably be the first time I've EVER said this.....THE MOVIE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh..","review":"Ok, so I'm not the best person to review this book. I don't like fiction.But, this book had a lot of hype and someone gave it to me so, not to be left out of the conversation, I read it.Sweet (ugh), and simple which I find boring.... and useless.At any rate, I'm not a good one to review fiction and obviously a lot of people liked it enough that it was made into a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously boring","review":"this has got to be among the most boring books I have ever read. I had heard such great things, that I suggested we read it for our book club. 50 more pages and I seriously do not think I can finish it... YAWN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Running Away to Italy","review":"The lanuage and visualizations are stunning. I enjoyed the pictures the author paints not just of the country itself but of the food and the people. The base story is a bit hard for me though, most of us that have such trials in our life can't afford to \\"buy\\" happiness so it makes the heroine a bit tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"It was one of those books you want to get back to, preferably with a comfortable chair and long, cool drink. She is fantastic at making you 'the person over her shoulder', tho I also noticed that the italian neighbours were described in more detail than poor Ed. The book sort of tailed off, and I would have appreciated a more rounded up version. Otherwise enchanting and put the creativity back in my kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book makes me hungry","review":"I was amazed at the strong opinions (both positive and negative) about this book. This is the kind of book which makes me want to settle in with a cup of tea and a cookie so I could read forever - I truly wish I could write half as well as Frances Mayes! I enjoyed her descriptions of the area, of remodeling (ugh!), and of hunting for just the 'right' item. Mostly, though, I enjoyed her descriptions of the food - they made me hungry and also made me want to head straight for the kitchen and create. This book will be my Christmas-gift-of-choice for my food loving friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted and Condescending","review":"A friend of Italian origin lent me \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" and was in raptures about the book. Sadly I found it tedious and contrived. In describing Italy one would assume there to be energy and colour. Ms Mayes' writing is the antithesis of the culture she seeks to be embraced into."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I left this book in a hotel in Fl while on a business trip and ordered another one...its a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious read. Unorganized material.","review":"I found this book tedious. Perhaps more work should have been done rather than simply copy the author's scrapbook memoirs into book form. Not enough care was taken in the organization of the text. In addition, the workers and their names, the contractors, those that did the work, and those that applied for the work, they're ALL there and are taking up too much space and time for no reason. Some are such unnecessary characters. So a contractor seemed to be charming, but she didn't hire him... I feel like the author would list everyone she met in the street if she only had their names in her scrapbook. Why was this book on the bestseller lists?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I had to choose between Provence and Tuscany...","review":"I have a feeling that the author really liked the Provence books by Peter Mayle. Although I enjoyed the book, the characters were no where near as colorful and the situations not nearly as amusing. I appreciated the fact that she didn't spend too much time on her personal situation, some authors just bore you to deathwith the banal details of their lives.The most enjoyable part of this book were the recipes and the descriptions of the wonderful food and wine. Obviouslyan accomlished chef with an imaginative palate, she made my mouth water with the details of Tuscan cuisine.The only thing better in the book were the recipes she added. I can't wait for summer! I'll also be on the lookout fordiscount fares to Italy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but uneven","review":"While the description of the auhtor's Tuscan life is interesting and enticing, she only touches the surface in describing the true local color. This is perhaps understandable because she only spents summer and christmas in the farmhouse, and didn't have enough of a submersion into the local way of life. Passages about her day trips to the surrounding areas are particulary weak and reads like a running description of what one can see from a speeding auto. Because of these weaker chapters, the book as a whole lacks coherency and development. In any case, if you want to know what it is like to own a farm house and _attempt_ at living like a Tuscan, this will be a good read. If you want a really good book on how to submerge in a foreigh culture, stick with Peter Mayle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the Tuscan Sun","review":"The story line is good,the only thing that didn't get 5 stars from my wife and I was that the author read the book.

This book will NOT decorate my bookshelf, it's going to be recycled at the Goodwill. I gave the book 2 stars: one because someone actually published it and the second because I really gave it the time to finish it, hoping that I would find a plot or story that I could talk about with my fellow readers. To think I actually recommended this one, well, better luck next month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow beyond endurance","review":"This book is pretentious, shallow, badly written and snobby beyond endurance. I wish I had borrowed the book from the library instead of wasting money buying it. Hopefully, the people of Tuscany will not have too many more rich and condescending writers snapping up their properties, thus saving us from another infinitely boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Not Read","review":"I didn't finish the first 20 pages of this book. The author seems very much a person who went to Italy to purchase a house and fields just to say she did (and does) it. No real interest in the history or culture of the area from what I read. Another reader said, \\"overeducated individuals with exagerated views\\" and hit it right on the head.To me anyway the book appears to be in the same vein as \\"Without Reservations.\\" With that one, as well as Tuscan Sun, I went looking for a light summer read and this was disappointingly not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go see \\"Tea with Mussolini\\"","review":"This poor book. The author tried to write \\"A Season in Tuscany,\\" but, alas, she is no Peter Mayle. She wanted to write \\"Villa,\\" but she is no Tracy Kidder. If Mayes wanted to explain how to fix up a villa, she didn't go into enough detail. For example, I'd like to know if she put in surveillance cameras. And one does bristle at the comments about the indigenes. Perhaps we have poorly prioritized our use of time, those of us who read the whole of this dreadful book and then spent more time reviewing it. I don't have time to write more. I have to finish reading the last 20 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're into home repairs, you may love this book.","review":"I read this book since I studied in the town the story is based in. She is a very vivid and brilliant writer, I would say quite the imagination though. It's way overly romanticized. She mostly writes about fixing up the house she bought in Italy. What really makes it any different from buying a house in the US? Her romantic notions of Italy did bring me back to the simplicity of life in Italy, but overall, it just feels self indulgent on the author's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the Tuscan Sun","review":"The title of this book encompasses the essence of the book. Frances Mayes retires to Italy and obtains a rural farmhouse and olive trees. It is not a story but more of a biography of the struggles and joys of restoring the farmhouse in Tuscany. In addition, we get to follow the trials and tribulations of working with the Government and several diverse cultures from the workers to the subcontractors. It is the details that make the book so interesting.If everyone had, the wherewithal and the finances to accomplish this then there would be no need for the book. This book gives us dreams, hopes, and recipes. Also enjoyed the audio version.Be aware that reading this book will make you want to eat Italian.Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this book desperately boring and only ever made it to the half-way point, as much as I tried. The only reason I saw the movie was because I was curious to know how they would make a story out of it. I, too, am saddened about the \\"renovation\\" to the load-bearing wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and dry.","review":"Most definitely NOT a page-turner! I found this book to be dull and passionless. She tells her story in a dry, emotionless style which is devoid of insight, creativity or humor. (She teaches creative writing?!) That this book is a best seller can only reflect Americans' love of anything Italian! Our book discussion group read this book based on its popularity and our love of Italy. Well, half of the group couldn't even finish reading it due to total indifference and boredom. We unanimously found it tedious and difficult, if impossible, to \\"get into.\\" And those persistent souls who determindly finished the book found no shred of insight explaining the author's motivations for buying and restoring this house. I'd have to say this book is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"self absorbed and repetitive -- a real disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed with this book -- it's so self absorbed that the reader is unable to create one's own sense of life under the Tuscan sun! For a poet, Ms. Mayes doesn't seem to be aware of the \\"objective correlative\\" -- in which the writer is supposed to create an image for the reader, not belabor her own viewpoints, including the way Ms. Mayes feels every single time she contemplates how ancient Tuscany is. When she steps out of the \\"me\\" box, however, as when she travels to the Etruscan tombs, the books is quite good -- too bad those instances were so rare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Begins well, ends in self-absorbed rumination","review":"This book began as an entertaining description of a woman refurbishing an abandoned villa in Italy. The author brings alive the Tuscan countryside and makes one want to visit the area as soon as possible to revel in the sunshine. The book, however, could have been remarkably shortened if the author had kept her own fanciful ruminations about life out of the text. She seems to look down on the people around her, especially their religion, which is ironic since she takes D.H. Lawrence to task for being guilty of this same attitude of superiority in his book about Tuscany."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated, smug and verbose","review":"I bought this book with great expectations, having read and loved Elizabeth Romer's \\"Tuscan Year.\\" Mayes' writing, however, is humorless, self-conscious and DULL.

I'll take Mayle over Mayes any day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dreaming of a house in Italy","review":"We went to Italy on our honeymoon and I had just finished this book when we arrived in Cortona where we tasted the delicious pastas in Trattoria Dardano and walked in the mountains surrounding the city. Yes, life there must be as Frances Mayes describes it, simply wonderful! I 'd like to recommand also \\"A house in Italy. The several seasons of a villa in Umbria\\" by Lisa St-Aubin de Teran. Certainly as captivating as \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Italian real estate agent's dream","review":"Frances Mayes sweeps the reader straight to the heart of Tuscany in the middle of summer and makes the reader long for a Tuscan home of one's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and stiff -- a disappointment.","review":"Here is writing about Tuscany that exhibits all too many of the worst aspects of travel writing. The author maintains a superior, snooty, \\"aren't I great\\" tone throughout. The characters in her book fail to come to life -- often described simply by their nationality, e.g. \\"the Poles\\" or their occupation. If you are really interested in finding out about Italy, I suggest that you buy both of Tim Parks' books -- \\"Italian Neighbors\\" and \\"Italian Education\\". Parks has a sense of humor and and a novelist's deft touch of character and description. You'll have more fun and learn more from a chapter of Parks than with the whole of Mayes' book. Indeed, when her own powers fail her, Mayes quotes Parks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable easy read, despire my envy.","review":"I enjoyed this book very much as I am an Italian and thrive upon reading stories from my great-grandparent's country. The author portrays her experiences very honestly which is refreshing since many books are claiming to be fantasies of Martha Stewart. I now long to visit Tuscany and leisurely enjoy the food and atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tale of the Tape","review":"The book is a completely lightweight trip through Tuscany, clearly tailored for what must be the burgeoning Martha Stewart demographic. All well and good, but be forewarned: the tape commits the (usually) unforgiveable mistake of allowing the author to read her own material. Authors author and performers perform; when one mistakes oneself for the other, the result is nowhere more painfully illustrated than in the ghastly narrative in the audio tape version of \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Droll . . . . .","review":"Excited to be taken to Tuscany without leaving the comfort of my couch, I was very disappointed. All the complaining at the beginning of the book about the high prices of homes and the \\"struggle\\" to obtain their dream just made me laugh - please, most of us don't even vacation in Europe let alone purchase a home there - get over yourself. I agree with the review sighting Bob Villa goes to Tuscany - the whole scene regarding their remodel was just too involved - not the Tuscany I was interested in. Eating, and more eating, gardening and shopping. Racing around in small cars - and Ed - beloved husband and companion - I think not - just \\"some guy\\" that is occaisionally commented on.This book is boring, difficult to get through and leads nowhere. I wasted my time. Nice recipies though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Magic Here!","review":"This book misses the mark--from the mispelled words to the inability to connect to the magic of Tuscany. I expected to find the spirit of the Tuscan people--but really, the book is too condescending to capture the real thing. If you want a real good read, try Peter Mayle's books on Provence and you will know why Ms. Mayes just does not do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful images","review":"I loved reading this book -- such beautiful images that you can almost see in your mind's eye. But I loved hearing Mayes read the book to me even more. There is just something special about hearing a book read by the author. You get an insight into how the author intended the words be read -- what to emphasize, what to stress. People who think this is a book about fixing up a house have missed the point. It's a book about how different the cultures are -- U.S. and Itlay. We can take note of those differences by a comparing something many of know -- hiring contractors, doing renovations -- to the same experience in Italy. The renovations are really just a medium through which to describe the differences."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-indulgent, snobbish, awful book","review":"I read this book after reading a good deal ofmPeter mayle's books and expected to like it. First of all, I was very exited abiut the recipes, But that was the only part of the book I enjoyed. Ms. Mayes just gloated about her money and time. Don't expect me to pity your pine nuts was not a good harvest this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Narration","review":"Please leave the narration of audio books to professionals.

I plan on studying in Italy in a few years and this is a great way to get to know the country!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to your writing, Frances.","review":"This book and film are probably wonderful escapism for women who read house and kitchen magazines. The descriptions of gardens, food and construction are vivid, but without much substance. The abridged version, read by the author, is a trial to listen to. She reads in an adenoidal, flat voice with almost unrecognizable Southern pronounciation. She should be quiet and express herself only in writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Read","review":"I admire the tenacity of those reviewers who actually got through this book. It was horrible, horrible, horrible. An entire novel about mundane chores we all do around the house-- pulling weeds, scrubbing floors, painting. True, we don't all do it in an old villa in Tuscany, but honestly--does it really matter? I couldn't understand how a movie could be made from this book... an hour and half of Diane Lane cleaning house?? But, other than the title, the movie shares no similarity to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subject 5--Delivery 0","review":"This is a wonderful, wonderful, journey, adventure, book. By all means, it should be read....just not aloud by the author. Why do people think that if they write a book they have the skill to read it??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascination followed by tedium and some confusion","review":"The book starts off well, and the archaological part of it, i.e. finding the artifacts, unearthing the stone sink, were fascinating. But after awhile I became distracted by the writer herself. Who is this woman? Who is this Ed guy? Her husband? Her boyfriend? I'm guessing the latter since she tells everything in the first person -- \\"I'm buying a house.\\" \\"I'm on the plane to Paris.\\" It seems pretty clear that the money is all hers. Poor Ed feels like an afterthought, good thing he was so handy around the house. The same goes for all the other people in her story. Okay, maybe it was just meant to be a travel guide, but couldn't she fill us in a little more on the actual life forms with whom she came into contact?Having said that, there were times when I bought into the mood she created entirely and forgot the above objections. After all, who doesn't dream of a fantasy home in Italy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I hate to jump on the pile, but this was a disappointment following the movie. Expecting details regarding the characters and situations in the movie, it was a letdown to find the book was a dry and somewhat self-absorbed account of buying, restoring, and life in a villa in Tuscany. Without an interest in nest feathering, I wouldn't have gotten past the first chapter.The author could have found a very similar getaway only 50 or 60 miles north of her primary residence in San Francisco and saved herself a ton of money. Not as interesting a place to shop for cheese or to sip wine with expatriots, but much more convenient to \\"real\\" life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expert prose but no page-turner","review":"The idea of an exploration of the simple life in the picturesque Tuscany from the view of the American rich and well-educated, sprinkled with local color in form of authentic recipes sounded promising. But although the descriptions of land and people were rich and often poetic, the book just couldn't hold my interest. There were just too many details about the reconstruction too much own shoulder patting and too little \`action'. It was like watching a 4-hour uncut home video from a friend's vacation: Interesting mostly for the people in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure it's a beautiful...if only I had the patience","review":"I tried and tried to read this book. But it quickly bores me. Frances Mayes writing is beautiful but verbose. Everytime I try to read it, I'd zone out and have to start all over again. Maybe some day, when I am truely desperate for a book, I might pick this one up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich, smug American gloats about her vacation home","review":"This book was so hyped that I hoped it would be good, but the best that I can say is that it is fairly well-written. The writer is terrifically proud of herself. She drops references to her privileged childhood, successful (but part-time) career, and stunning San Francisco home as often as possible. As other reviewers have pointed out, she has an art-colony view of Italy, where she hangs out with other leisured expatriates and micromanages her environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Italian Fairy-tale Written by a Non-Italian","review":"Being 1/2 Italian, and having family in Northern Italy, and having visited Italy 6 times I have to say... buy this book ONLY if:1) You've never been to Italy, and2) You love to cook (and read recipes), and3) You want to read what it's like to be able to afford a home in SF and renovate one in Tuscany, and4) You want to cling to a fairy-tale vision of Italy, or5) You're on a deserted island with nothing else to read.However, if you really want to know what it's like to live/be in Italy, and what Italian culture is really like, I suggest you read any or all of Tim Parks' books (\\"Italian Neighbors Or, a Lapsed Anglo-Saxon in Verona\\", \\"Italian Education\\", or \\"A Season with Verona: Travels Around Italy in Search of Illusion, National Character, and...Goals!\\"). Tim is an Englishman who married an Italian woman and moved to Italy and had kids. Parks' descriptions of Italian life are real... Mayes' descriptions of Italian life are a bit too syrupy for my stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother - there are many better books","review":"I enjoyed parts of this and \\"Bella Tuscany\\" on a superficial, escapist level. I like sunshine, travel, Italy, good food, shopping and nice houses so these can be a pleasant escape from grey, rainy Scottish winters (and summers!) However, I have to agree with many of the negative comments made about the way the books are written and the way the author comes across. At times they can be deadly dull, unbelievably pretentious, as well as patronising and humourless. If you want to read about house renovating in Italy try \\"A Valley In Italy\\" by the fascinating Lisa St Aubin De Teran instead. Also, as many reader have previously mentioned, Peter Mayle and Tim Parks are much better on adjusting to life in a foreign country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuppie observations from a long-time tourist--not a resident","review":"I lived in Italy for years, and hoped to read about the experiences of other Americans who have also lived there. This book offered no insights whatsoever except the author's self-absorbed interest in getting her house in order and sharing with her other yuppie friends a Martha Stewart like \\"image\\" of Italian life. She seems to have made no real Italian friends, and has no real understanding of what it is to really live in Italy 12 months a year--not just jetting in for the odd holiday. God help the lovely town of Cortona which will undoubtedly be deluged by similar Americans more interested in creating their own cardboard facade of Italy. If you want to read observations of foreigners who have really LIVED in Italy, read Tim Park's Italian Neighbors or Mary Taylor Simeti's Persephone's Island instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Dreary........","review":"The book is plain dull and annoying.Mayes desperately tries to make herself sound educated and cultured by quoting Horace and Plato in situations that don't really seem to warrant such a quote. Her descriptions of the luscious Italian countryside are dry and unimaginative, and what she talks about is simply uninteresting.Italy is an amazing country, but this book doesn't do it justice at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pasta and Vino Anyone?","review":"All this book did for me was make me hungry. The author incorrectly categorized this piece as fiction and literature, when in fact it is a glamorized cookbook with some house restoration spices thrown in. I am going to cut out the recipes (most of which look quite appetizing) and use the rest of the book for firestarter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Massive Case of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\"","review":"Verbose, clich��-ridden, superficial, and materialistic, this book stars not Tuscany but Frances Mayes, who treats Italy like a gigantic mall. In her view, Italian architecture, food, wine, art, history, and even people exist only as products to decorate the author's personal Disneyland. The book's success can be explained only by marketing hype and critics' reluctance to speak the truth. Fellow readers, the emperor is naked. Save your money, and a tree. If you want to read about Italian food, go to the real authorities: Marcella Hazan or Mayes's own source, Elizabeth David."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about consumerism goes abroad than about Italy","review":"It seems sad and strange that this book should be a best seller. The author writes mainly about her material acquisitions--the villa, the linens, the pottery, the furniture. Her contacts with Italians are of the depth of my contacts with my plumber, real estate agent, or checkout clerk. She makes up for this by \\"imagining\\" the lives of people she sees--a condescending exercise that violates the integrity of these people's lives. Even the main characters, the author, her husband, her daughter, are described as roles--poet, gourmet cook, department chair, mill owner's daughter--rather than as people with emotions, quirks, sorrows and joys. \\"Insights\\" into Italy are from \\"book larnin',\\" not from experience.For an entertaining account of remodeling an Italian villa, \\"Valley in Italy\\" by Lisa St. Aubin De Teran is very entertaining. For insights into Italians and life in Italy, \\"Italian Neighbors\\" and \\"An Italian Education\\" by Tim Parks are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another view from a Yuppi/semi-expat. turned anthropologist.","review":"I found the book extremely patronizing and gushy. I love Peter Mayle's account of Provence. He's funny and never forgets he's a Brit in France with his own quirky views. Mayes might as well refer to the \\"Natives\\" when she speaks of the Italians...does she ever really connect to anyone beyond the expats in the region? Let's face it, Tuscany has become the Florida of Europe, full of upper middle class expatriates who've bought up just about everything there is to buy and experience life as a semi- to permanent vacation. The book reads like Martha Stewart's guide to Italian Home renovation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon Tree","review":"The cover of mine was decorated with the actress from the movie so I expected it to be the tragic romance with a happy ending on the DVD. Instead I got a description of a couple of college proffessors who cash in their investments to buy a million dollar run down house in Cortona Italy in which they only planned to live in 3 months out of the year.It doesn't tell a story so much as it describes one, like an outline with too much external detail. It has no dialouge whatsoever so it's very one dimensional. The only thing I got out of it was a strong desire to go buy a lemon tree and see the landscapes of Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Mayes would put it, noioso (boring)","review":"I hoped this book would be beautifully written, a quick but satisfying read. When you're writing about Italy, where can you go wrong? Well, Mayes showed me exactly how you can turn an interesting life story into a boring, monotonous book that won't end - just like those summer days in Tuscany. I also thought that Mayes' descriptions of the Italian culture were sometimes condescending. Oh, those quirky Italians with their weird manners, tiny fridges and no sense of time! Speaking of fridges, why are there two long chapters devoted solely to recipes? Not much happens in the other chapters, either.Italy deserves to be described by a better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Absorbed under the Tuscan Sun","review":"After I read and enjoyed Peter Mayle's books, my wife recommended this book and its sequel. I was terribly disappointed.Frances Mayes writes with none of the liveliness of Peter Mayle. Her writing is ponderous and clipped. I found myself laboring through the book, and was reminded of a movie in which I've looked at my watch to see how much longer until the credits. Rather than describe colorful characters and their interactions, she describes her renovated house and her reaction to it - both more precious than I could stand.No one seems to have edited this book. I found numerous cases of repeated facts and statements from one chapter to the next. I wondered if these had first appeared in a serialized version.Overall, none of the joy and magic of Peter Mayle's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Condom","review":"My wife and I have never used condoms are entire marriage, and since we were both virgins when we got married, we have never had a need for condoms.

But I'm also glad that I gave my daughters a book for THEM (not just me) that the author suggested. The book is GIRLTALK: All the Stuff Your Sister Never Told You and I could tell they really liked it because I kept finding it all over the house! Pipher is quoted on the cover saying \\"I gave my daughter Girltalk when she was a teen. Carol Weston's writing is solid, sensible, and kind. I recommend this book.\\" Hey, I recommend both books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of the Century","review":"I am a college student majoring in education and I read this book for my class. Pipher did a wonderful job with this book. She touched base with every possible thing a young teenage girl could go through. Reviving Ophelia should be required for all parents to read. I think that if parents were to read this, they would understand their daughters a lot more. I would recommend this book to anyone who is female or a parent! I personally do not enjoy reading, but I could not put this book down. Pipher is a extrodinary woman and I wish that I would have had the opprotunity to read Reviving Ophelia when I was in high school. I would have understood myself more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviving Ophelia with an inward look","review":"I am a female high school student who would fall into the range Mary Pipher has coined, in this book, as \\"intelligent girls.\\" Until I read her book I was confused as to why I felt so insecure and lacked a sense of belonging in social circles, although I have been active in everything I can possibly manage in and out of school. Reading this literature not only helped me look within myself for answers, but it showed me a vivid contrast to other girls' situations through the accounts of numerous girls Ms. Pipher wrote about. I have begun to understand what I, and other young women, go through in the process of growing up, and I am thankful to have had the privelage of reading this book because I can now work on preserving my sense of self and I may hold myself accountable for contiuing to grow in confidence and morals dispite a society ravaged by pressure to be \\"perfect.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for parents.","review":"Perhaps only those of us women who had particularly rough experiences during our adolescence will truly understand the importance of this book. I hope not. Reviving Ophelia opens up the cloistered and torturous world of the teenage girl for all to see. Through many case studies and short discussions at the end of each chapter, Phipher shows what diversity of experiences girls encounter and how they deal with it. For those of us who have been through traumatic teen years, it is enlightening and provokes reflection. For those of us who also have daughters (and sons) approching this period of great change, it is more -- a wakeup call. I would encourage all parents of pre-teen girls AND boys (your boys will be interacting with these girls too) to read Ophelia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking ideas.","review":"Read cautiously because this book looks at the problems of SOME young girls, it by no means addresses the majority of healthy young girls. If you're a parent of a girl it is a good idea to look through this book so that you can know the possible problems facing your daughter and what to look for. I would have liked this book better if it focused more on solutions and the positive side of the story, as it can be rather depressing and scary. For help with your day to day interactions with your daughter (and son) I would recommend: Perfect Parenting - The Dictionary of 1000 Parenting Tips by Elizabeth Pantley"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Aid or Preventive Medicine","review":"Mary Pipher gives clear analysis and healthy advice to parents of adolescent girls, teachers and others. \\"Reviving Ophelia\\" is written with diction that is comprehensible to kids as well as adults, so the subjects of physiological, intrapersonal and social growth can be discussed with girls (or boys). Issues such as sex, drugs, anorexia, bullemia, overeating, bullying, violence, and other delicate subjects are dealt with anecdotally and analytically. I enjoyed reading it, including some parts with my 12-year-old, who has been asking me lots of questions, most of which are talked about in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Project","review":"I am a college student majoring in education and I am reading this book for my class. I thought the book was very helpful in realizing that teenagers always change and no 2 are alike. The parents also have a big roll in the children's life. When you are teaching or parenting a child, you have to let them express themselves and try to help them cope with the many changes they are facing. If you don't, they will rebel and turn totally against you. We must all work together and work for the same thing, the success and growth of the children. We need to help them be the best they can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much needed discussion muddled by political rhectoric","review":"The topic of the book is extremely important. The objective of the book - understanding the challenges of adolecesents was right on track.The author uses case studies to illustrate the various catagories of problems and situations facing the subjects.Unfortunately, the author blames the bulk of the problems for young girls on society.The bottom line is a call for the government to fix the problems, the very problems that left leaning influence has brought our country.This call for reform is from an author that is herself a left leaning feminist.I had hoped for more help as a parent on how to help growning girls adjust, the author offered little hope that parents could do much.A dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"True selves can be saved with the proper understanding.","review":"I am a college student and I had to read \\"Reviving Ophelia\\" for my education class. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and it helped me better understand who I was as an adolescent. The real life stories helped make the book more interesting. It showed that bad things really can and do happen to young, adolescent girls and it's not just things you see on television. The book shows how society can unintentionally be so cruel to young girls and encourage them to be someone they are not. Pipher taught me that it is possible to help girls,who have adopted a false \\"identity\\", find their true selves again. It helps to have an understanding of what the girl is going through. I would recommend the book to any parent who has a daughter, any adolescent girl, and any adolescent boy for that matter. I believe the book will help any of these people better understand adolescent girls. It was truly an amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to what she has to say","review":"I read this book a year or two ago, and really enjoyed it. At first, the case studies discussed seem a bit extreme, but the feelings that Pipher writes of are present in even the most \\"non-dysfunctional\\" of girls. Teenage girls and parents of teenage girls should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"I loved \\"Reviving Ophelia.\\" I only wish I had read it earlier because I might have been a bit easier on my parents. There were so many moments where I felt as though Dr. Pipher was speaking directly to me. If you read the book, you will find that Dr. Pipher does not try to pathologize the adolescent experience of girl--quite the opposite, as she also describes in detail the girls who had healthy teenage years and the reasons for their positive outcomes. I have recommended this book to countless people, and all but one found it fascinating as well. (I don't think it was a coincidence that the one person who hated it was a member of the male population. It is very easy for guys to criticize this book because they have not grown-up in this world as girls.) Reviving Ophelia is truly a must-read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so glad I read this book","review":"I borrowed a copy from the Library, and after reading the first chapter I purchased a copy so I could highlight and underline the wise advice that this author gives for parenting the adolescent female. I found this book to be enlightening, not only for raising my two (adolescent) daughters, but also for understanding much of what I went through as a teen. Anyone who has a daughter, was a daughter, or cares about a young girl going through adolescence, a most turbulent time, should read this book! I've read it once for myself, and now I'm going to read it again for my girls - with the highlighter! Thank you, Mary Bray Pipher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As a 16 year-old girl, i resent Mary Pipher's portrayal of girls as victims. It seems that her objective is to get everyone to feel sorry for us poor, stupid girls. I'm sick of people telling me how unfortunate I am to be an adolescent female growing up in the 90's. Every generation has its problems,including Ms. Pipher's. She acts as if no one has ever heard of a teenage girl having problems before now. The truth is that adolescence is hard for EVERYONE, including guys. Sure, some may have a harder time than the rest, but it is silly to assume that this is the case for everyone else. Mary Pipher is just having a little pity party to remind everyone that girls are extremely delicate and should be kept in glass cases on the shelf right next to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"Very well written.

I would balance this book with the rest of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial pop psychology.","review":"Because the title, \\"Reviving Ophelia,\\" is easily the most interesting and thought-provoking aspect of Pipher's book, reading her work is extremely disappointing. Her analysis is superficial, informed only by the most obvious observations and supported by an insubstantial, vague, and apparently untested theoretical framework. If adolescent girls are this easy to understand, we certainly do not need the likes of Dr. Pipher to help us understand them. I recommend that the reader simply contemplate the title without purchasing the book, thereby saving both time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not worth the cover price","review":"I was anxious to read this book after having it recommened highly to me, but I was very disappointed. The book seemed to be composed mainly of case studies, with no conclusions or recommendations, or even adequate explanations of behavior. There was a lot of talk about the authentic self, which seems a bit of psycho-babble to me. Tell me, what does that mean? All the book did was point out OVER and OVER again that girls are doing unhealthy things and in some unhealthy relationships. I simply have to turn on a TV talk show to see that. How about a little depth? Also, how about not making all those girls out to be VICTIMS. Where is their responsibility in this?

Unfortunately, it offers virtualy nothing but a look at the author's own \\"demons\\" and a biased look at what she thinks a woman should be.

It is unfortunate that so little is written about the female psyche. It is more unfortunate that this book is so widely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More foder for Operah, Montel Williams, etc.","review":"This is the best kind of book for daytime talks, and I don't mean this in a kind way. The author make all kinds of outrageous one sided accusations like if girls are healthy, it is probably the result of the mother, if they have problems, the fathers are invariably at fault. The book is filled with these instant cheer and jeer generators, which only serves to take the reader away from real thought and either confirm all man (fathers) are bad or confirm that all female psychologists are man-haters.

The truth is that this is feminist agit-prop that fits the \\"women's studies\\" department mandate to try to find a reason for existing. Tell a group of people raised on self-esteem and Oprah that they should be even more in love with themselves. . . and they will respond with adulation.

Have a little faith in your daughter; the author seems to have little in the female sex as a whole. Most teenage girls, at least none of the ones I know, are weak, desperate, and easily manipulated. In the book, even intelligent girls cannot remain strong enough to withstand peer pressure or the evil media. Girls are \\"walking targets\\" who have such low self-esteem that they will do virtually anything to be accepted. This book was written almost ten years ago, and maybe things have changed; there's a lot of evidence today that boys are the ones who are in trouble.Maybe the whole commercial \\"Girl Power\\" movement did the trick.

They could learn alot from reading this. They would find out that they are not alone in thier struggles and get support from the author's comments. Unforntunately for parents, most of the problems girls have can happen to their daughters. Parents could learn from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think all parents of teenager daughters should read this.","review":"I am a colloege student majoring in education and I read this book for class. I am happy I picked this book. I think it is a good book for parents to read so they can better understand their teenage daughters and the things they go through.I wish my father had read this book,maybe we would have a better relationship. When this assignment is over I am going to give the book to him to read so he can understand my younger sister better. Hopefully it will make her teenage years more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I realize it was written MANY years ago, but I was saddened to see only a worldly view of raising girls. I was hoping for a more spiritual/Christian standpoint. This book is certainly out of date, but I expected that since it was written in 1994. I do not necessarily agree with all of her diagnosis or interpretations of situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was interest, but it was repititous.","review":"I am a junior in college,and I have read this book in my Education 2403 class. I have enjoyed reading this book because by becoming a teacher and dealing with girls in your classroom, this book gave some very good examples to watch out for that will benefit you in the classroom. I believe that this book will be a great help for adolescents to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's enough for me.","review":"Quote from the book:\\"Girls who stay true to themselves manage to find some way to respect the parts of themselves that are spiritual. They work for the betterment of the world. Girls who act from their false selves are often cynical about making the world a better place...Only when they reconnect with the parts of themselves that are alive and true will they again have the energy to take on the culture and fight to save the planet.\\" (end quote)Save it from what? Your cynicism or your ego?Any book with a paragraph like that in it is going straight in my trash can. Girls are people, not martyrs. Human beings, not tragic fallen angels. And frankly, I prefer to treat them as human beings.I did slog through some of this book. I found it interesting that the girls who were the most inventive, creative, and what I would call \\"alive\\" were often the girls she considered \\"false.\\" Maybe she just wasn't seeing their true selves because they didn't fit into her tiny little \\"ideal girl\\" box."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are not helpless saplings","review":"This book in not an eyeopener. Pipher is simply stating the obvious, over and over again. It does not take a Ph.D to realize that society harms girls like myself. She also portray us to be helpless victims floundering in a misogynistic (a word she throw around too freely) culture. As a psychologist, doesn't she realize that depression cannot be blamed on the world? It is a chemical imbalance of the brain, proven to be severely intensified by changing hormones. She generalizes, stereotypes (the rich girl, the poor girl, the anorexic girl, the smart girl), and does not seem to see her clients as individuals.As a teenage girl, I was not impressed. I am not a sapling in the wind, I am something far more resilient and righteous. If you want to read about the way adolescent girls feel and are, why don't you ask one, instead of hearing a story filtered through the mouth of someone intent of saving \\"saplings.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully there are better books for our girls than this ...","review":"While the book had some insights, I nevertheless found it simplistic, unscientific and disappointing. Whoever gave Mary Pipher her Ph.D. must be cringing. The usual suspects are to blame for the problems plagueing our young girls, including the 'feminist' fan favorite, the 'girl-poisioning' society. If you like this kind of pop psychology, then this book is for you. If you are a more serious reader, then move onto something else and save your money. I particularly like the section in the book where Dr. Pipher mentions that '...she knows very little about [the psychology] of boys...' and then spends the next several pages proving it. It can be argued that growing up today is harder than in previous generations and our young girls need help. Sadly, so does this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, ok","review":"Recomended by my therapist, A-typical '90's blabber about how horrible things are for our kids, schools, peer pressure, TV, lookism, sexism, etc.Can't stand the woman's writing style. While I know my therapist says she just wants me to be aware of the fact that their are many girls out there who cut, do drugs, drink, get pregnant, etc. and come from good families. I think the book sucks. Not one single strand of hope to be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book offended normal teens such as myself.","review":"This book was very false. It was offensive to normal teens such as myself who don't need to be 80 pounds to be happy. It gave a false image of the normal teen and was more like reading a novelization of Dawson's Creek than a real book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reach Your Daughters Well","review":"Reviving Ophelia, written by a Unitarian Universalist (like me) child psychologist, is a revealing look at the issues faced by teenage girls. On the recommendation of a friend who is the mother of a now 19-year old daughter, I read Pipher's case histories of various patients. Appropriate parental response is critical when problems like depression and bulimia surface, lest a beautiful 12-year old (which most are) be lost. Right behind this I read Tom Wolfe's \\"Charlotte Simmons\\". The years between 13 and 20 are certainly treacherous for a girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It portrays teenage girls as nothing more than slaves to a male dominated society with no brains of there own. I found it extremely negative, and only focused on teenage girls from dysfunctional families. For more positive reading about teenage girls i suggest the book \\"Raising our Athletic Daughters\\". That is a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this mirror YOUR life?","review":"How come almost every girl in this book is so unintelligent, materialistic and unhappy? And why does everyone in this book succumb to social pressures? In real life, most teenage girls are strong, smart individuals. Why does Ms. Pipher think her mostly weak, unstable patients are identical to every other girl in America?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those of us that are raising daughters","review":"I have a daughter that is four years old and I am expecting another child in July. I have to admit that I hope it is a boy after reading this book. I was required to read this for my education class. I choose it for obvious reasons. It was very eye-opening for me. Pipher tells us story after story of young girls and their endured trials and tribulations of adolescence. I feel powerless in a way for my daughter now. Pipher gave many positive examples of support systems that we can create for young girls, but the truth to me is that no matter what kind of parents we are, our culture is going to grab our girls and put them on a roller coaster that we can not barely stop. What a great book! I will not be sitting in the background in awe of the turbulents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REVIVED AND LIBERATED!","review":"Males and females: READ THIS BOOK!! It will change your life. It is both liberating and validating. Finally, someone took the time to document what every woman feels as she matures. Pipher explains and provides coping mechanisms. While her examples are indeed extreme, I am only too sorry that other \\"therapists\\" wrote reviews discounting her book and denying the fact that women are slowly poisoned by \\"rules that keep changing.\\" Finally, I attended an all women's college in New England, and this book was required reading for all incoming freshmen and graduating seniors - need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding our daughter so we can guide her.","review":"Reviving Ophelia was important for me to read because, as a father, I was confused by my daughter's actions and her reactions. My wife shared this book with me and another book called \\"For All Our Daughters\\" by Pegine Echevarria. Mary Pipher opened my eyes to the issues confronting not only my daughter but her friends. I didn't realize all that she was dealing with. More importantly it has made me more aware and compassionate to her needs. She is a great kid and I admire her, although I do get confused by her ups and downs. This book and the helpful how to information described in Ms. Echevarria's book will enable me be more understanding to my daughter...I hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, but I wish ......","review":"that someone had warned me that it was the same book that was published in the USA the year before.... Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls by Mary Pipher.This one was published in London. Reviving Ophelia: Helping you to Understand and Cope with your Teenage Daughter by Mary Pipher PH.D"},{"rating":"1","title":"losts of sad stories-- no useful advice","review":"Itis frightening to me that so many people find this book helpful. Anyone who found this book helpful should be seeing a therpist and not spending time with a book. The girls in these stories are not typical. You could read this book or you could watch some daytime talk show like Maury Povitch, Phil Donahue, or Jenny Jones - the information is the same. Let's give the majority of our teenage girls some credit please. I see a generation of intelligent,strong self assured women with more going for them any generation before them. Lighten-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for us","review":"All I can say is I had problems with a good kid. The school's guidence counsler recommended Reviving Ophelia. I couldnt put it down.It doesnt tell you what to do but it does give an understanding of what young girls are up against and what may be going through their heads.In our case it was spot on. With this knowledge you can pry and get a feeling what might be in your kid's head.Some people are giving this book a basic rating. I dont know how they could unless they have an ax to grind or bigger issues than those in the book. As a layman I'll take a book of case studies over one person's opinion any day. No mold fits allBest to you and your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviving Ophelia","review":"As a young female myself,someone gave me a copy of this book and about 6 months later I picked it up and read it. This book was a very very good book. I have to admit that I have probably read this book 14 times. The short stories in here about other young girls probably helped me through some of the hardest times I have been through. I have never been more drawn to a book as I was to this one,in fact I still read it regularly.The stories in this book will make you laugh & cry,and there are stories to which every teenage girl can relate. I loved this book!To me it was a rainbow after a storm. I think this book is something every teenager should read!! It is truly inspirational,and will help you get through your dark days (the ones we all have :0)****I particularly liked the story of Gail,as I could relate in so many ways****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't Be Necessary.","review":"This book is rather entertaining, but unless you are someone who has low self esteem and is really struggling with being an adolescent girl, then you probably shouldn't waste your money. Nearly every example in this book deals with a girl who has major problems and isn't a strong, individual person, which is fine, but don't assume this is what most teenage girls are like. Many reviewers have stated that this book has helped them, but- as a fifteen year old girl myself- I was surprised and slightly insulted. However, maybe this book will help you if you're heading in the wrong direction...? What do you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Start asking questions...","review":"This book is not to provide the parents of teenage girls with all the answers. Instead, it's a call to all of us to open our eyes to the pressures and concerns of our teenage daughters (and sons, for that matter) and start asking the questions. It is arrogant and dangerous to assume that our own daughters will escape unharmed from this difficult time.I was especially surprised while reading this book how my own adolescent \\"challenges\\" came back to me. As I look back on my life, it's amazing how many important, pivotal moments occurred during the fog of my teenage years. It has given me renewed passion to do all that I can to be supportive, understanding and available for my children.I recommend this book to anyone who isn't afraid to look back at their life and look forward to our future. Ask the questions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's true...I never want to be 13 again!","review":"I'm sure every woman can relate to this book in some way, perhaps not as a candidate for a case study, but in some tiny way. I remember feeling the \\"trapped\\" sensation as a young adult, when my impression of the life I was \\"told\\" to lead by friends and society collided with the reality I \\"knew\\" existed. Anyone struggling with an identity crisis may find some answers in this book. This is ideal for young adults and adolesents, but the content is important and should be understood by mothers and fathers alike: don't let your little girl slip into societal obscurity. This book is about breaking a stereotype...the stereotype that has left women crippled in American culture for hundreds of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview on today's Environment for pre-women","review":"I read this book 2 years ago - when my daughter was 15. A real eye openner for a 40-something father. It is not a 'scientific' review of personal disorders, but does a nice job outlining some of the (unfortunately) common problems that today's girls face. So many of the new freedoms that western women have at their discretion create problems for emotionally unprepared youth - boys and girls. Girls seem to face the more difficult challanges.I recommend it often to friends as they grapple with issues with their teenage daughters."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},j={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(x,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-f30beafe"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/60.md","filePath":"guide/60.md"}'),C={name:"guide/60.md"},L=Object.assign(C,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
