It's accurate enough and gets the job done, though it can be annoying to calibrate because it requires a 500g weight and not many people just keep those on hand.

The problem, the ONLY way to calibrate it is with a 500g weight. My calibration weight kit does not contain this, and to purchase this weight is 2 to 3 times more than the cost of the scale.

I'm a fan of BOTH classical/barogue music and beat/percussion-based music, but MIXING these two genres as fluidly as on this CD seemed implausible... The incorporating of powerhouse drummer Lombardo's cuban-style percussion into Vivaldi's crystalline music somehow works seemless on this release, and they even get away with \\"jamming\\" on one of the Vivaldi pieces; even the soprano-singer improvises in the most joyful way!! You really get the feeling that they were having fun with old maestro Vivaldi, while respectfully aknowledging the genious of Vivaldi's art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely wild","review":"If your one of the few, like myself, who enjoys both classical and metal, this CD offers some nice ear candy. When I first read that Dave Lombardo was venturing into classical I thought I needed glasses, but as I read on it sounded like a really cool idea and became less hard to believe. As it turns out, Vivaldi blends quite well with modern percussion. This is a very cool CD. I don't think it will appeal to very many people, so it will probably remain in obscurity, but it may very well become a novelty in the cult classic realm. The only complaint I have about this album is I feel there should have been fewer vocal arrangements and more instrumental pieces. If your in the mood for something different, try this on for size. Just keep in mind that for most, it will be an acquired taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting down with the 'munks","review":"I love me some Chipmunks, but I don't think this is their best. I know the \`munk haters out there are thinking all sorts of smack, but you need to give props to Alvin and crew where they are do. Good music and entertainment in a high pitch is still good. They have smooth harmonies and funny parody moments (done better in Chipmunks in Low Places than in this album) and tend to cover very good music making all their CD's a fun listen. The remix of Witch Doctor alone makes the album worth purchasing but, and this may be more of a comment on the style of music rather than the Chipmunks, but the dance music gets old fast. Overall, it's a great album but it just doesn't have the endless replay-ability of their other albums. My favorites were Turn the Beat Around, Witch Doctor and Play that Funky Music Chipmunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very good album!","review":"I love this album! It is one of the best ever!

After purchasing several Philips Box Sets of Mozart, I am convinced he was a genius of many categories. He wrote great music in just about everything; from Operas to the Smallest Chamber Pieces, there is something astounding in everything he composed; what versatility and broad appeal.

Since he (at the time of writing the novel) knew of no such person, he could only write of a woman who's passion cried out in futility for fulfillment. The novel takes place in three (maybe four?) vignettes, with Therese first being accused of poisoning her husband, then moving to Paris and becoming a lover of many men, and finally her one truest act of love toward a young man who is drawn to both her and to God. The novel may offend Christians (since there's no cute or easy ending), offend protestants (since Mauriac sees Christanity and Catholicism as synonyms), and offend non-believers (Mauriac, for all his literary brilliance, is a Jesus freak at heart).

To take it one step further, in my opinion, his earlier '69 BSO version IS THE \\"Carmina\\" to get!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I am sorry but I cannot reccomend this recording, even if Hampson and Gruberova are in it. Whose idea was it to put so much difference in the level of sound between the soft and the loud parts? If you set your system to the soft parts something will break when the loud parts show up. Be careful and don't buy this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Effective as a Sleeping Aid","review":"What happened, Senor No-Name? It's such a shame your talent had to end...Honestly, this single is the current Prince standard. Decent, better than a lot of other stuff on the radio, but makes you long for even a hint of the edge and vitality of his earlier, vastly superior work. Hopefully the album it's on is better than the lackluster 2004 effort, Musicology, but don't expect it to be. The lower your expectations are with Prince these days, the more surprised you're likely to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"in any language this song stanks","review":"Prince needs to take His Wig/Weave Money&ask R.kelly for Some Help at writing&Production of a song. this Song sounds 50 other Prince songs in the same vein.Prince has turned into a Long term Lounge act.dude ain't been happening in almost 20 years out of the studio.He is still trying to be like Michael Jackson with His corny short film.if it wasn't for the fact Prince had some jams back in the day&Still can Play Live then dude would almost be forgotten. memo to this cat:find some funk&some Smoking Slow jams,but leave the tired Lounge Act alone.in any Language this song is Stanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu Power Valium","review":"This is tripe. It sounds like a third rate Julio Iglesias impersonator trying to write a Sade pastiche in the manner of Prince, except that that at least would be funny to listen to - even for ten seconds. This isn't. It's painful. And boring. And leaden. And so utterly, utterly predictable. To call it elevator muzak would be disparaging to James Last.Consider the sort of lead-off singles Prince has released in the past: Sign O The Times, When Doves Cry, 1999, Kiss, Alphabet Street. Then consider Prince's greatest ballads: Sometimes It Snows In April, The One, The Most Beautiful Girl In The World, Wasted Kisses, Crucial, Adore etc, etc. Now, potential buyers, ask yourselves this - can this really be the work of the same person? Answer: yes. Should you buy it? Go figure ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"slavery still exists. See for yourself","review":"This ninety minute documentary, filmed in 1964 and released on video in 1982, contains a remark at the beginning of the video that the slavery shown in the film still exists. The film proves its point. The filmmakers actually buy two African women from an African slave trader for 300 pounds apiece. They also show female slaves being bargained for in Saudi Arabia. Not all of the slaves are African.Most slavery, as it has for centuries, originates in Africa and ends in Arabia.A fictional dramatization of the problem exists in the movie Ashanti, to which a number of big Hollywood stars lent their names and their presence, including Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov, William Holden, Rex Harrison, and Omar Sharif."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick to the point","review":"The product was delivered to my home in less than the estimated time (7 days) and was in good condition.

There are not enough diagrams, and the author focuses too much on the history of discoveries as opposed to the actual discoveries. I wanted to rank this book a 0/5 but that was not an option. The book was so horrible that a majority of the time, I could not read it...I thought it was extremely dull and dry...And I normally love biology!!! My professor wanted us to use the Reece Biology book, but the department would not approve it, so we got stuck with this cr@p. If you're looking for a good biology textbook, this book is not for you. Compared to the Reece book, the Freeman book makes you feel like you are reading each definition on each page in the dictionary and are being forced to memorize it. I had the opportunity to read a chapter or two of the Reece book, and I can tell you that it is 1000X more interesting and readable than this Freeman book."},{"rating":"1","title":"book review","review":"product was charged to my account, i never received it, i tried to email the person about their refund policy and i never got a reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are good","review":"It absolutely isn't their best, but songs like \\"Hey Cuz\\", \\"flowers\\" are one of my all-time favourite songs.

The singing and song writing are occasionally interesting but the general atmosphere of boredom and sloppy indifference ruins the experience for me. This sounds as if several of my musically less than talented friends decided to form a band and a week later recorded an album. It's not charming, just weak and one more reason to hate indie pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is beautiful, he is gorgeous, the movie is laughably horrible","review":"I can't believe this movie has an average of more than 4 stars! The lead guy is gorgeous to look at (like Carey Elwes), but the acting is pretty painful and the story is like a mishmash of fairy tales and hallmark cards.

First of all, the acting is horrible!!! I lost all interest after the first 5 minutes due to the monotone dialogue that the lead actors delivered. There is absolutely no chemistry between the prince and \\"princess\\" and it is painful watching them attempt to get through a scene. I am a huge sucker for fairytale romances but this is terrible; no horrible! The final straw for me came after listening to the boy/nephew talk. He sounds like that annoying kid from the Nickelodeon \\"Fred\\" movies!! Wow. How in the world he got cast is beyond me. Horrible! Terrible!

This combines healing from a hurtful past, the joy of Christmas, and of course, romance. The cast fit perfectly together. How the characters evolve through the movie was perfectly written and played out. I'm glad it's on DVD so we can watch it over and over.

Truely not a must see again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it one big finger","review":"Since I figured the whole thing out about a third of the way through the film, it lost any possibility of being \\"gripping\\". And, since even the most dedicated person to any cause -- especially one who is also a passionate jazz pianist -- would be spilling his guts long before having the first finger chopped, snipped or sawed off, I also found it unbelievable. Not to mention that at its heart is some pretty far right wing thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it one BIG finger!!!!","review":"The summary of what this movie is about is very misleading. This Pianoist is a crazy leftest to the extreme. This guy wants to poison the American food supply yet the director makes it out as if we are supposed to be sympathic towards him.

When compared to the emissions of the natural world, our own are less than one tenth of a percent. Our obsession with beef represents a greater danger to our environment than do our industrial activities, by the authors logic. I would definitely NOT recommend this book for those of sound mind. Brainless liberal zombies, carry on, all hope for you is lost already. A teacher I had once long ago, said that he was not impressed with this book and wished that they could have done a little better checking facts and present the information more factually, without the subliminal agenda.

As a student, we are expected to take this author's word for it that everything he has presented is true and accurate, and that he is simply a repository for all of this accurate information.

I find what most such texts are weak on are providing clear, tangible ideas and discussions the students can relate to in order to be good environmental stewards with good relevant critical thinking skills, whether in their personal or professional lives.The other text we took Chapters from was \\"Environment\\" by Withgott and Brennan, which is also pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"fair enough","review":"The book took a little longer than expected to arrive but within specified time.

Technically she is brilliant but it often seems that she's playing on paper-thin slivers of delicate china.As for the Penguin Guides, yes, Uchida is given a rosette for this playing, but as it takes just one of the Guide writers to award a rosette, it doesn't mean unanimity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ordered two CDs of Guadalupe Pineda Arias de Opera, instead I received ONE CD of Tania Libertad Arias de Opera.","review":"On November 6, 2010, I ordered thru Amazon two CDs of Guadalupe Pineda Arias de Opera each for$19.84, sold by Dispatches_From_Texas_USA.

Everything was neatly wrapped up and finalized at the end of The Fury, but the cast of characters was brought back more because the fans wanted it rather than there actually being more of the story left to tell.Nevertheless, I did enjoy Dark Reunion. The Tyler aspect of the story was a completely unexpected but welcome surprise. I love Bonnie's abilities, but I wasn't in love with how they were used in this specific book. It seemed to allow a lot of easy access to Elena for whenever the other characters didn't know what to do.Overall, Dark Reunion was amazingly fast paced, but the least bit confusing. It provided a great chance to revisit with the characters and was a decent addition to The Vampire Diaries series even if it did lack some of the deeply emotional thrills of The Fury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"I enjoyed the first three books but I thought that this one was a bit lame.

I thought it was so great, I cried. That part where Stefan was so heartbroken over Elena at the end, then she came back was so moving. The part I didn't like was that Elena came back human. How much sense did that make? It's not like she could go back to her town again, anyway. I never thought of the possibility of a 5th book, but that would be so great!

However, there's a major flaw: presumably to render the length palatable for TV audiences in the late '60s, the performance cuts out the important Sextus Pompey subplot. If this role (and that of his pirate allies) is excised, we lose some crucial political, military and historical detail which enrich the play and the characters of both Antony and Octavius. Check out the text for details, and you will see what I mean. So, loss of a star (and I nearly made it two) for such thoughtless interference! My first choice must be with the BBC Shakespeare version, beautifully and thoughtfully directed by Jonathan Miller, with Jane Lapotaire and Colin Blakely both first-class.

I fully expected only piano music and, being more of a strings person, this set was among the last that got listened to from my entire collection. Well, surprise! It wasn't just piano -- it was chamber music written almost in a concerto style with many strings and wind accompaniment. This volume is now among the most cherished of my collection. So, whether you like piano, strings or winds, this volume will satisfy all. Mozart truly composed to please every ear.

If you follow what it says, you will be able to sell to top officers. You can also use the ideas as you work around the rest of the organization. The VITO letter chapter is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"Are your sales in a slump? Chances are you're selling to the wrong people. In this A-to-Z primer, Anthony Parinello explains how to get your foot in the executive suite. To be successful in sales, he says, go right to the top. Although well organized, the content at times reads like a stream-of-consciousness speech. Many of the \\"secrets\\" Parinello reveals are plain common sense - it's hard to believe that anybody in sales wouldn't know them. His advice about using the Web for research is dated (when was the last time anybody used the term \\"information superhighway\\"?), but the principles he outlines are timeless and make this a great read which we recommend to performance-oriented sales people and sales managers. Overall, this inspirational, motivational account should fire up sales people and help them see the forest, not just the trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Successful","review":"After reading this book, I had mixed emotions about the tactics discussed.

Maybe if your are selling used cars.How about presenting a value proposition???If you are smart, you will look elsewhere like the Sandler Method of sales. Find out what is important to the prospect and explain how you can help them with those important items. Novel idea, huh? Well, the scum that wrote this VITO book didn't think of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called 100 Cheesy cold call techniques","review":"As other readers have indicated, this book is cheesey. And the techniques are fundatmentally flawed. The book is so poorly written as to be almost laughable.For many if not most of you, VITO doesn't want to hear what you have to say, and he's not the guy making the decision. Parinello is just plain wrong. He has a few valid points, but they're so interspersed with garbage that it's hard to cull them out.You won't be worse off for reading this book, other than the time you've lost. You'll pick up a few important sales concepts. But how are you going to know which ones they are?Finally, I'll say the author is somewhat bold in his claims. Like one of his claims to write back to every piece of correspondance he receives.

The person who has the final veto power, regardless of where they show up on the organizational chart. Finding out who that person is and making sure I include them in my sales process can make a sale that otherwise wouldn't happen.The book is filled with specific advice and guidelines. I especially like chapter 4's portrait of VITO. It helps me better understand how to deal more effectively with this key person.Chapter 21 is another favorite of mine. It answers the most common questions that come to mind when we start applying what the book teaches. That helps make the book even more practical.I'm glad a colleague of mine recommended this book to me.

Carmen is not for her. She sounds so soft, that no man's heart can sense the Carmen's traditional dangerous fire.The Orchestra sound is spectacular, but lacks of the grandeur that Ozawa has in Philips' Carmina Burana, for example. I am big Norman Fan, but I think she was born for singing spirituals, or Isolde or Poulenc Songs. The Figaro Countess under Davies is absolutely delicious. What can I say? Carmen is not for her.But she is a wonderful singer. Period. My Carmen is Julia Migenes and Placido Domingo under Lorin Maazel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this recording","review":"I have no idea who was the \\"genius\\" who thought of Jessye Norman as Carmen. It is a pity that such an important singer as she turned out such a disastrous performance. Everything is wrong in her portrayal: sense of style, characterisation, charm...,the Don Jose and the Escamillo are hardly better, only Mirella Freni, even well past her prime, gives any pleasure. Ozawa conducts a grandiloquent, verismo Carmen, like they used to do in the 50's. Even if you are a fan of Norman, I would strongly recommend to stay away from this recording. If you are looking for a truly great recording of Carmen look no further than Teresa Berganza/Claudio Abbado in DG, the best recording ever of Bizet's masterpiece. Other good alternatives are Victoria de los Angeles/Beecham and Tatiana Troyanos/Solti, but Berganza is the most passionate and magical Carmencita of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dull","review":"I have given this recording more than just a few chances and I just cannot help but almost falling asleep everytime I listen to it! And Carmen is supposed to be a fun opera, so there MUST be something wrong here!There are a lot of good recordings out there and many time-transcending Carmens who's seduction skills will work their magic on you MUCH better than this one!

I will admit that I listen to mostly No's 8, 17, 19, 22-27 (22 & 23 are superb. No. 22 rocks! ) most of the time. But I listen to the other discs also, and I can tell you they are all excellent. I listen to these nowadays while writing in the mornings and they are great companions....If you're serious about the Concertos, then this collection is just right for you. Brendel is on the mark almost all the time, (I own six performances of No.20 for example, and his cadenzas are the best) and Mariner and the Academy, well, I almost hate to admit it, they are better than anybody else I have heard in this type of collection. --- Email me if you find a better collection !Mozart never ceases to amaze me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy, inaccurate reporting and terribly disappointing","review":"Here is all I needed to read to realize what a lazy, slap-dash book this is: Golenbock calls the most important player in Mets history, their only true Hall of Famer, by the WRONG NAME! Tom Seaver's birth name is GEORGE THOMAS SEAVER. Golenbock calls him THOMAS GEORGE SEAVER.There are many other errors as well, as pointed out in previous reviews here.As a life-long, die-hard Mets fan, I looked forward to this book.Unfortunately, it was obviously rushed to print in time for the Mets 40th anniversary season, because the mistakes and laziness are obvious.The author and his editors should be embarrassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're looking at the wrong Mets book","review":"Golenbock must be living on his reputation - how else to explain such sloppy, inaccurate work. Want the book on the Mets? Try Amazin' Met Memories by Howie Blatt. You won't be disappointed. As for me, I bought this one, and I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lazy writing on Golenbock's part","review":"For the Mets history prior to 1984, the writing is palatable and alot of facts presented are interesting. However, in comparison to some of his previous works that I have read (The Bronx Zoo, Esposito, Number 1), this book is sorely lacking in both accuracy, editing and overall writing proficiency. I was a Golenbock fan as a youth when I read \\"The Bronx Zoo\\", but it seems as the years pass by, he sort of views his writing ability anymore as one who merely has to put his name on the cover, and the book sells itself. Well, luckily I was at St. Vincent de Paul when I found and bought this book, and for the most part, outlaying $2.99 was well worth it for the first part of the Mets history. However, if faced with the prospect of paying anything than $5.00, I would steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismaying, not Amazing","review":"It took me almost a year to read this book because I kept getting bored, but being a longtime fan of the Mets I kept coming back to it, hoping to get to the 'good parts.' The part of this book that recounted the 1986 team's exploits was good, but not great. The rest of the book was OK, but not good. That's not good enough.Golenbock's book is very repetitive. Passages are quoted almost verbatim from previous passages. The 2000 Mets and beyond are recounted only through the words of Al Leiter, making the last 70 pages entirely unreadable and unenjoyable. Whole years and eras in Mets' history are brushed by, with almost nothing being written about the early '90s teams, or late '70s teams. The whole awful Vince Coleman experience is done with in 3 sentences.Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This","review":"I'm a huge Mets fan, and if i had to summarize this book in word, it would be \\"uneven.\\" Because it's an oral history, you frequently only are presented with one viewpoint. That's understandable, but it's Golenbock's job to then bring up the counterpoint, which he does not often do.The book is rife with spelling errors and factual mistakes. Who edited this? The last few chapters covering the Bobby Valentine era are pretty much an Al Leiter showcase, as NO other players from that era are quoted.Poor showing by Golenbock. Suitable only for the diehard Mets fan who just wants a refresher of what he already knows/read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golenbock is better than this","review":"In his customary fashion, the author wrote forty-five informative and entertaining chapters. Unfortunately, the book has fifty-one chapters. The last five must have been sub-contracted, as they bear no resemblance to the rest. Only one subject, Al Leiter, is interviewed for the last six chapters, and the clear writing and insights disappear. There is no ending - he just stopped writing.This shopper will purchase future books by the author only after waiting for reviews and careful inspections, steps not needed until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange","review":"Let me get this straight. Golenbock interviews six or seven Mets, quotes EXTENSIVELY from past Met biographies and autobiographies, and turns it into a book.

These were his words: \\"the LAST PERSON\\". This film's researchers did not do a balanced job to bring out this irony.The film's producer in the discussion, wishes to create a feel good, self serving, smoke screen about these facts.

There is absolutely no point in expecting this item to support cushions. There are too may folds in it to be able to provide what it claims.

I purchased both the chair support and the couch support. To feel any sort of difference in the chair, I had to double the seat pad back onto itself. It covered less area, but it doubled the amount of thickness. The couch support was a little better --- mainly because its folds are further apart.And, just one minor thing --- the vinyl covering has a really STRONG plasticy smell.Overall ... my impression was that a BIG cardboard box - folded up - would have provided just as much support."},{"rating":"1","title":"this product SUCKS!!","review":"OMG Very disappointed.

One of the other reviews says that Darrin doesn't sing on track 6....this of course is true because Darrin is not in Goldfinger and the Mushpotatoes....consequently, Darrin doesn't sing on any of the songs. I cant bellisima is NOT a great punk/ska effort as it was said to be by one of the other reviews...because it is not a punk/ska effort in the first place. I just wanted to make sure that no one else gets all excited about a previously undiscovered goldfinger album, spends like 25 dollars to order it, and then listens to only part of the album before smashing their stereo in a beserker rage.this has been a public service announcement from a concerned listener like you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could get my $21.99 back...","review":"After reading 3 reviews, I decided to buy this CD and I did ... Thanx a lot for guys wrote the reviews making it sound like it was a CD of well-known punk/ska Goldfinger. This is Goldfinger & MUSHPOTATOES (which is really hard to see). Darrin doesnt even sing song #6 like the other review says. If you are expecting this to be one of \\"Punk\\" Goldfinger CD, it is not!!! So DON'T BUY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as self titled","review":"I personally think self titled is GOldfinger's best CD, but I guess this is a good punk effort.

There is NO EXCUSE for crappy color and sound quality in this day and age!!!!And there are NO SUBTITLES/CLOSE-CAPTIONS!!!!!! Again, in this day and age, not having subtitles, or close-captioning at the very least is RIDICULOUS!!!!!! It is insensitive to the deaf and hard of hearing community (many of the latter of which are us aging baby-boomers, so it is age-insensitive as well).Fortunately, I still have the VHS and will keep that so I can view this wonderful movie on a BETTER QUALITY, though out-dated, format...at least until the tape pops...Geeesh...save your money and stick with the VHS if it still available."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor resolution","review":"Poor resolution and the screen can not be expanded. The sound was ok but still the quality of the image at some point was just blur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design","review":"We make a lot of fries at home...this cooks them evenly and allows them to get just as crispy as you want. The pouring side is perfect for serving directly from the tray.

I am a home builder in the Northeast and use Bostitch guns and only Bostitch. Reliability is reason # 1. They work day in and day out. Reason #2 is the availabilty of nails. Everyone carries Bostitch nails, not the case with other brands. I have 4 of these siding nailers, 2 being the N64c's. I favor the older models because the nose is very easily adjusted. On the 64s you have to use a wrench, loosen 2 nuts, slide the nose, then retighten the nuts. Very time consuming and hard to get an accurate slight adjustment. I can not understand why they made this change. Other than that still a great product. They work great on wood siding, but could work a little better on Hardi-plank cement board. When the pressure is on the low end sometimes doesn't countersink. But, all of the manufacturers have this same problem. If you are going to buy a utilty nailer/siding gun, go for the Bostitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 STAR!","review":"About these old-style Paper Mater Union Pen and Pencil Erasers (#70522), I am ecstatic over finding them finally!

That will be especially nice in the winter. We found it easy to install. It does need the additional screw that is suggested for stability. I gave it four stars instead of five because I think that screw should have been included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted over 18 years","review":"The aluminum tip has finally cracked so it is time to replace this one. Lasting over 18 years comes to a cost of less than a dollar a year; that seems to be o.k.; though the last one was a lot cheaper. I hope that the makers have not lessened the quality of the product, but it has definitely lasted way over six months. The aluminum tip does have to be periodically adjusted to keep it working properly, however, one needs to be gentle in handling it.Our mail delivery time is very erratic on a daily basis so this product saves a lot of extra trips to the mailbox. It is truly more practical than the new electronic alerters. Most of our nearby neighbors seem to depend on it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mailbox Alert","review":"WoW!

THEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO MY NINETY YEAR OLD FATHER IN-LAW MOVED IN WITH US. HE LIKED TO GO AND GET THE MAIL. IT IS GREAT TO KNOW THAT WHEN HE CROSSES THE ROAD THAT THE MAIL IS IN THE BOX.

I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE LOOKING TO SAVE STEPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"If you have one of these that has lasted twenty years, it's not the same thing as this piece of junk. Mine lasted six days and the flag broke off at its base. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works OK","review":"After I got it installed it works OK. Somehow it doesn't quite fit on my mailbox where the previous model did. With further guidance from vendor I had to drill holes in mailbox and install this on a sort of angle. It uses a strip of plastic to lodge between the door and the box. Don't know how long that will last and the flag is at an angle but it does seem to work, if imperfect. It does alert you when mail has arrived just be prepared to do some work first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mail Alert","review":"This is our second mail alert; the first one lasted 15 years. Mail alerts are very handy and saves many unnecessary walks to the mailbox. Also, it is easily installed. This time we bought 2 and we're giving the second one to our son and daughter-in-law who have just moved here from another state."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Reason The Tab Breaks","review":"Some reviewers have noted the flag tab breaks prematurely. The tab is designed to hold the flag in the down position with the mailbox door closed but I have been using the same flag for over 30 years. When the original unit's spring failed, I ordered a total replacement unit and when it arrived I saw the aluminum was about half the thickness of my original and the tab could easily be bent. I simply repainted my old flag and switched it onto the new base. I now repaint it and replace the spring as needed.The manufacturer took a good innovative product and found a way to cheapen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great!","review":"it works so well!

Three workouts included; 30 min, 45 min and 60 min so you can always find the time to do one. Kakuwa's attitude is infectious; she is sunny, encouraging and supportive. The workouts are a combination of african, latin and caribbean dance. Loads of fun and the time flies by. My new favorite workout DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good intermediate cardio workout","review":"What I like most about this workout is that there is the option to try a 30, 45, or 60 minute routine. The 30 minute segment is too easy for a non-beginner, but the 45 and 60 minute routine gets your heart rate up. At times, the moves are a little repetitive, but what's great is that if you are a fast learner, Kukawa \\"keeps it moving...\\" she doesn't slow down to over-explain the moves. I like that because a lot of DVDs take too much time showing how to perform relatively simple moves. Also, I like how the performers were not \\"Hollywood Hotties,\\" but just regular looking people. The last thing I want to look at when I'm working out are several pairs of silicone implants! The music would've been better if it were live, and I would've liked to hear a little \\"cultural\\" explanation of where some of the moves derived from. Overall-- a great DVD to add to your repertoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kukuwa Dance Workout","review":"I'm not exactly a beginner and the 30 minute segment got me sweating. It has fun combination of simple dance movements. For those who don't dance -me included- the steps are easy to learn after a few times. Remember this is not a dance video.

Graphics are nice, the social subcultures are nice, and the game is great overall. I only miss the region overview, but I'm pretty sure if they copied THAT many elements then EA would have had pretty good grounds for a lawsuit/cease and desist order.Now onto the reason I rated this game a one overall:I just paid the price of a full game so I could have Starforce installed on my computer. Just the other day I was deleting Starforce because it came on another game of mine. This form of copy-protection is nothing short of malware, and I've already had one dual-layer lightscribe DVD drive reduced to a worthless piece of scrap metal thanks to it. I'm getting tired of having to find cracks for Starforce games I buy legally just to avoid severe hardware damage... To the point where I've decided that I'm not going to buy Starforce protected products anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starforce=Coaster","review":"Starforce....nothing else need be said.

I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice. It would not run. I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again, it would not run. When I went to the knowledge base, technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card, the game will not work on your system. In short, if you have an \\"over the counter\\" system, you cannot run this game on your computer. I find this ridiculous and disappointing. I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play. Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With It","review":"This game sucks. It tries to be Sim City with extra features. Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average. In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student. The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive. I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was better - but can't play on laptops!","review":"Read the Specs carefully before Buying!!! It requires a 3D Graphics card with T&L...that;'s nVidia or ATI. Most laptops to my knowledge, mine included, have Intel graphics cards which does not support this T&L.; So when I installed my game and went to load it...it crashes before completely opening, so i have never seen the inside of this game. That really bites, esp if it is worth playing.You can check your computer's graphics card by going to start> run> dxdiag and that will basically tell you all the information about your computer and its hardware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, poor execution","review":"The problem with this game is that it seems good, but it gets boring very fast. You don't really se any new development after the initial buildings. Your neighborhoods are boring looking and everyone always seems to be fighting. It's also hard to stay under budget. It seems almost impossible. Overall, the game could have been good, but it's not. Buy Sim City 4 instead. If the first person view was in Sim City 4 it would be the perfect game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided Copy Protection","review":"This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I've ever experienced. I bought this game new at a local store because I've been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card. Got this game home and it installed just fine, but when it came time to launch the game, it said disc authentication failed. Tried it with the other disc, failed again. Went to the company's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them. Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starforce = Hardware damage","review":"Don't buy it unless you want the Starforce malware on your computer. I understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy, but not at the expense of replacing the drivers I need(ed) for my DVD burner. Check the search engines and see for yourself. Would have otherwise been a great game, too bad it isn't playable because of this malware."},{"rating":"1","title":"great fun, but severely lacking in replayability","review":"I would recommend this game as one to either rent or buy used. I love the idea behind the game. It's my job to get certain peeps to move in, and it's also my job to keep them happy and employed. The games does an outstanding job explaining to the player exactly what is needed in order to progress. So what's the problem?The problem is that there are a limited number of goals in this game, and while it is great fun getting to the point where the first elites are finally moving in, there really is nothing more to add once that point is reached. The fun curve has a severe and sharp downward curve once this point is reached, and I haven't had the ambition to pick up the game since.This is a game that is well worth a $20 bargain bin price tag, but the $50 I paid was way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Sorry, I really wanted to like this game but compared to Sim City and other city builders, this game is not good.

I use them but no matter what brand I buy they seem to never have graphite which runs all the way through. I'd forever be sharpening these pencils but they turned out to be worthless junk that never lasted more than a day. Someone suggested that I buy some art pencils and I did last week. The graphite is consistent in its volume and application...yet the pencils had no eraser. I decided to pony up the cash for a box of these Sanfords and have not been disappointed. They're a great addition and they erase far better than the cheapo erasers that come with standard pencils. I'm happy about the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous men's watch good for any occasion","review":"I own the Tag Heuer Kirium WL121F.BA0705 with the blue face.

Even if it does, it's not a good buy. I normally shy away from ready-to-use products, but I saw the spray bottle at a nursery and the label said it treats up to 35 medium sized plants, which would do me for a couple of months. Bayer lied, unless there's a caveat is in the words \\"up to.\\" I managed to spray nine eighteen inch high roses with mainly new growth and not a lot of leaves. Well, maybe there's another caveat in the term \\"medium.\\" I could have covered ten except the thing stopped spraying before it was empty. Anyway, a buck a plant. Like shooting aphids with silver bullets.So off I went to Walmart to buy the concentrate, which makes ten gallons.

Dunsby gives a detailed history of the work itself and the modern expressionist era that surrounds it, and a very useful interpretive and intentionally incomplete analysis of each of the twenty-one melodramas that will help the performer or the listener gain a better understanding of the work that shaped contemporary classical music.

It was never performed during Mozart's life time thereafter.The cast here is simply fabulous, and the arias are quite virtuosic even if Mozart composed them at the age of 15.

By now, I must literally scrub it with an abrasive sponge in order to get food off of it when I use it. Simple things like tilapia are sticking to it.

It heats up uniformly even in an oven that heats unevenly compared to some other non stick pans. It works great for cookies, cinnamon rolls, biscuits, etc. It's very noticeable to feel how well it resists bending. The non stick coating works great, so far.I do have one slight problem with it. At a certain angle in the right light, the coating seems to have imprints of the swirls/circles where the cinnamon roll/cookie has been even after washing the pan multiple times by hand. This is very minor, but enough for me to give it 4 out of 5.UPDATE 10/11/2011This cookie pan is terrible now. It buckles at 350F after a couple months of usage. At first it never buckled, then one day it buckled after a batch of cookies.

I don't know, I just didn't like some of the percussion or something. Also I was pretty surprised to listen to the Halloween theme. It started out with an instrumental version of Mr. Sandman, which was alright, just rather unexpected. Then it kicked into the regular Halloween theme which like Tubular Bells was not the greatest version. I already had Tubular Bells on the Pure Moods CD, and the Halloween theme from Halloween: the Best of John Carpenter, so I wasn't as dissappointed with the different versions as I might have otherwise been.

I used them twice for cupcakes and I did not like them at all. I felt like they conducted too much heat and cooked the outsides a bit too much than other pans. Plus if you want to make your cupcakes/muffins a little bigger, then just spread out into a funny shape instead of rising like a dome. I recommend the Calphalon Classic pans. They are more expensive but much better in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pan!","review":"I love this cupcake pan! It's a nice, heavy duty pan that seems to keep my cupcakes perfect.

They were great at start. All muffins came off easily and neatly. I had thought they were the best muffin pans in the world. But soon, after 5-10 times uses, they became very sticky, and completely different from what they were. I had been using warm/hot water and dish detergent and hand washing them, and never used nonsticky spray on them as instructed, so I couldn't figure out what was the problem. No scratches, and there may be a very thin layer of grease. Was this the problem? I wonder whether the other buyers had the same issues after using them a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice.","review":"Arrived pretty quickly.

If you ever thought being excited about a pencil eraser was impossible pick up one of these and watch your face begin to smile. It leaves nothing behind, won't rip your paper when you are vigorously removing angering math work and doesn't fall apart or chunk. They also last an incredibly long time.

There is a quintessential serenity about Antony Pay's performance of the Clarinet Quintet that defies any kind of criticism. Also included on this generous disc is the enchanting Horn Quintet, given an ebullient account by Timothy Brown. The last work is the Oboe Quartet, deliciously performed by Neil Black.

But in my estimation at least, his Don Giovanni is a complete failure. Weak orchestra, sketchy cast, total lack of any real drama or tension in the direction. I really can't think of any thing about this recording that would merit someone spending any amount of money for it. Stick to Furtwangler's 1953 recording or better yet any of Karajan's (1985 is the best, but the 1970 and 1987 Salzburg Festspiele recordings are also quite good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily the worst album of their discography","review":"I am a very commited Lillian Axe fan, but this album should have been left in the past.

Although not a how to book with step-by-step demonstrations, it nonetheless contains an abundance of technical information. Alison Hobylyn completely opens her worldliness of artistic skills in a delightful commensense manner covering both watercolour and pastel materials, composition, drawing, perspective, and creating mood in a painting. The uniqueness of Hobyn's teaching approach is her ability to use examples of her sensitive painting style and vision to demonstrate the ideas she presents. Anyone searching for the window into the heart, soul, and expertise of a talented watercolour and pastel artist should most definitely read this excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice design. Quality product","review":"I bought this rack to allow me to know what cables I had, and make them easy to find and use. The rack installs easily (although no installation equipment is provided) and is strong enough to hold 50' CAT 6 cables coiled up. I no longer have three paper bags of cables lying around. Well worth the money for that alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought and false","review":"The language may be poetic but it is totally overdone. I can't believe that these characters would really speak like that. And Bowlyn and Nance have an affair! Give me a break. I am sure that in post-civil war America a middle class white woman and a recently freed slave would have sex. She never would and poor Bowlyn would have lynch mob on his mind more than sex. I don't know who this Gibson woman is, but I got a feeling that she ain't black. This scene is just too false."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice revisit, tin the end too preachy & simplistic","review":"Interesting to see Flynn back after all these years.. definately a more seasoned MacDonald, but not his best. I would think Wise Saws to finish off the time compendeum novels might be better, but last i checked that was onoy available in e-book, for a high price. This novel brought back favorite characters, but ended up being a bit too didactic (preachy). Buck passes Flynn was my fave, along with the original Flynn, and then of cause the intro to Flynn in Confess Fletch. Flynn's Inn being the most contrived..and hardly worth the print in my estimation.. no.. if you want more Macdonald.. i actually think he was at his best in his early days.. find some of the earlier prints, than this..

Even worse, the politics presented just reinforce my belief in how miserable this world is due to PC. To add insult to injury, the mysteries Flynn is trying to solve are trivial (essentially there for McDonald to wrap his politics around) and Flynn's wry attitude are taken to such an extreme that they go right past \\"two-dimensional\\" and into \\"one-dimensional\\" (i.e., the characterization are worse than flat). I suppose if you're a die-hard Flynn fan, you'll want to read this.

I especially like the songs from \\"Tad\\", \\"Mark Lanegan\\", \\"The Afghan Whigs\\", and \\"The Walkabouts\\". The \\"Mudhoney\\" one is good also. To tell the truth, I'm kind of suprised Sup-Pop never did a \\"Best Of\\" type thing, or anyone for that matter. Also, all these songs were released in 1990-91, and after my copy of this, there's only 499,999 others, so happy hunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Debut","review":"In this, Vince Churchill's first novel, he shows a talent for pacing, drama and balls-out action that many popular thriller writers never achieve. The idea is a great one - a plague on a distant colony world which transforms its victims into raging, mindless killers. A rescue mission set up by Earth's government, involving the toughest team of mercs in the galaxy. Betrayal, pain, regret, loss, the cleansing power of violence, the ache of remembrance - and enough non-stop action to keep James Cameron in business for his next three movies. The last fifty pages of this stunning debut race along so fast, so furiously, so cathartically, so violently, that you'd better hit the bathroom before you get to 'em...'cause you're not gonna want to leave your seat until you wrap up this tight, tense book.Kudos to Vince Churchill - he's produced a fabulous first novel.

I'm about half through (still no zombie action) and I hit a graphic sex scene... Sorry but I aint gonna finish this one..If I was looking for that, I got plenty downloaded.

And it cleans up beautifully. It is heavy, so keep that in mind, but I prefer cooking in heavy vessels.

It offers a wonderful discourse on differential diagnosis for various aspects of neuroradiology and various CNS disease states.The text is rich with detail and focuses on the most important aspects required for remembering the pathology. The text is also extensively and internally referenced where additional cases can easily be looked up in order to jog one's memory of former pathology. I would highly recommend this text, as others did to me, for aspiring neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists. This text is truly multi-functional as it offers a wonderful integration of neuroradiology, pathology, clinical presentation, and epidemiology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grunge? False.","review":"This album recieved such great reviews from everyone here on amazon, so I figured it would be worth the five dollar pricetag. I popped it into my stereo and was overcome with a wave of dissapointment. There is no comparison between seaweed and nirvana, soundgarden, or any of the more hailed grunge bands of the early nineties. Seaweed is like listening to a bunch of drunk strangers in a garage somewhere learn how to play together. While Seaweed did represent the Northwest scene, this album sounds much more like punk to me than grunge. The riffs are too fast and irritating and the lead singers voice is too whiny to be called grunge. Instead, I would say this band is a cross between emo and punk with a very small bit of real rock-n-roll mixed in. Unless you love seaweed, this album is far from memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Seaweed Album","review":"This is the Seaweed album that everyone should listen to. It's their pivotal work between THEIR era and the latter half of their troubled 90's. Songs like Losing Skin, Kid Candy and In Fainess are great hard-rockin' masterpieces that explode with their (and our) generation's disappointments and mistrust, and it harbors only a couple of the songs one is expected to pretty much ignore, the least out of any other album. Of all the music I've bought of them, This is the once and future classic. Spanaway is good too, but doesn't even get close."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate soloists.","review":"Even if the conducting may not be to your taste. Even if the singspiel version lacked the elaborate recitatives but substituted for by German spoken dialogue, this version is still very attractive in that Cortubas, Norman and Trayanos gave outstanding performances, especially the young Jessye Norman as the secondo donna Arminda.Prey and Unger did not gave their best performances here. Helen Donath may not be as good as Gruberova's Sandrina in Harnoncourt's Italian version of the same opera.But Norman and Trayanos gave very touching portrayals to the two 'secondary roles'. The young Norman is such a sweet yet rich sound that you really need to hear it if you are interested in her singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold in your record library.","review":"I love this CD. Maybe, we can't compare this opera with Don Giovanni, Cosi Fan Tutte or the Magic Flute; written when Mozart was older; but all the musicians in this album are fantastic.

I especially purchased this Oxo product due to my previous positive experience and the innovative suction cup holder to hang the squeegee when not in use. The suction cup did NOT work for my travertine tiles! It keeps falling down after several hours. I called Oxo and was told that their suction cups only works with non-porous surfaces and would not work with travertine or marble. The packaging did NOT state this disclaimer. What a disappointment! I am sending it back and getting something else.I FOUND A WORKAROUNDFor those who already bought this and experience the hold issue with non-glazed tiles, one way is to stick the suction cup onto the side of the tub. This works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"This is third OXO squeegee owned. This one was awful, rubber was not level with middle not reaching the glass.

A few quick swipes with the squeegee on the door prior to getting out takes care of the water running down on the floor. It also is very effective on the tiles. The suction cup holds very well on the tile unlike many others. I would highly reccomend this to anyone. Awesome squeegee for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, hard squeegee","review":"Looks nice, but works awful.

I guess I should mention that I hate a dirty shower/tub surround. Although the OXO was at least double the cost of my first squeegee, I decided to buy one and try it in our large shower with clear glass doors. The OXO does a great job, although as other reviewers have mentioned it could be a couple of inches longer. If you first spray your wet enclosure with Fresh Shower or some other brand of daily cleaner and then squeegee the tiles with the OXO, your enclosure will sparkle. In my opinion, the OXO squeegee is the best you can buy and pretty much leads the pack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislabeled and Misled","review":"I ordered this specifically because I didn't want some of the smaller options.

Pushing harder seems to help a bit once the blade gets more wet.I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality","review":"I was surprised at the quality of this item since it's imported.

You have to press very hard in order for it to clean the area without a big streak in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Squeegee for Bath and shower","review":"This unit replaced a 7 inch squeegee I have used for several years. It is far superior with the wide face, flexible rubber blade that is stiff enough to retain its shape and the short handle makes it easy to work with. Very pleased with the silicone suction cup hanger that fits nicely on shower tiles and is so relaible that I have no problem with it falling off due to leaking air around the edges. Nice product and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lifespan","review":"I cannot recommend this product. The black rubber (or rubber like compound) starts to deteriorate quickly, leaving hard to remove black streaks over white ceramic tiles that I'm still trying to get off.

Start by inserting the A/V cord's eighth-inch plug into your iPod's earphone jack. In it goes, schnickt. Couldn't be easier.Here's where it gets a little tricky. In order to make your TV play back the iPod signal, you've got to redirect the outputs. You can't just plug the yellow RCA plug into the yellow RCA jack and the red into the red or the white into the white. No. Those geniuses at Apple send the video signal over the red RCA output. (Normally it arrives on yellow.) The sound comes through the white and yellow plugs.I ended up going to an Apple store and testing this on iPod after iPod. They all have this quirk. It was intentional. But hey, it's proprietary. Woohoo. So here's what you have to do:* Plug the red RCA plug into your TV's yellow RCA jack.* Plug the yellow RCA plug into your TV's white RCA jack.* Plug the white RCA plug into your TV's red RCA jack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belkin rules, apple not so much","review":"This is a great cable. It does what it should, it does it well, and it stands up to abuse.

Water was coming out of the top, where the handle pulls up. I called the company and they promised to replace it. A week went by. No faucet. I called again and they claimed to have no record of my phone call. So another customer service rep said she would send out the faucet. Another week goes by. I call again. Still no record of my call and yet another person said they would ship the faucet \\"right out\\". I just got an email, again almost a week later, saying they can't ship me a new faucet because they no longer \\"do that\\".Ironically, one of my neightbors saw this unit in my bathroom and loved it so much, he bought the exact same one. His has also completely fallen apart. I think it's safe to say this is a defective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks with cheesecakes","review":"My issue with this pan was that it leaks.

Gandhi was a great man and, fortunately, he wrote his mental processes down for us to read, today. He believed that we should all stop being ignorant towards one-another, over misunderstandings about religion or skin color and work together to form a more harmonious union as the human race. Gandhi was a Humanitarian and read many Holy Books, therefor understood that everyone can worship their God and live their faith, cooperatively with those of other faiths. Gandhi is a must, for all intellectual minds...and should be for those who are still living with propaganda-filled thoughts of hatred towards others, because they are different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic French Freakbeat and Folk-Rock","review":"This isn't just one of the best French rock albums ever. This isn't just one of the best rock albums from any non-English speaking country. This is one of the best garage rock albums produced anywhere. Drawing on the music of Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and the Kinks, Jacques Dutronc adds an ironic wit that a generation of indie-rock hipsters would kill to have, and creates quite possibly the first great post-modern rock album. It helps if you speak French, but in any language \\"Les Cactus\\" and \\"Les Temps Sont Flous, Les Gens Sont Fous\\" are nearly perfect freakbeat stompers.If you like this, I also recommend Serge Gainsbourg's pop-art masterpiece Initials B.B. and Francoise Hardy's gorgeous pop collection The Vogue Years."},{"rating":"2","title":"ME ME ME!","review":"It is a really fun, exciting album.

My husband told me that he would be happy to eat vegetarian meals if I fixed them. So, not being a cook in any way, I set out to find recipes I could try. I must have purchased ten cookbooks. Most are decent. Some things good, some things not so good. But EVERY SINGLE recipe in Everything Vegetarian turns out perfectly. Most recipes have a Mediterranean touch, using toasted cumin seeds and the like. And Mr. Weinstein explains clearly each step in the recipe. There is never a question of \\"What does THAT mean?\\" or \\"Where would I find THAT ingredient.\\" He tells you everything. I genuinely wish I could find this man and kiss his feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the most colorful cookbook i've cooked from","review":"i just started my vegetarian venture so this is a cookbook i picked up. the book gives really good side tips about food that are not common knowledge. i have tried a few of the recipes and they turned out fabulous. so no damage there. the only down side is there are absolutely no pictures of any of the recipes. so if your ok with cooking blindly then this is one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"I was looking forward to receiving this cookbook based upon the majority of other reviews. I was disappointed to find it has the most basic recipes that can be found in any cookbook or don't even require a cookbook. Examples: Fried Potatoes - Starchy white potates, oil for frying, salt for seasoning. Spinach Salad - 3 cups spinach, balsamic dressing, sliced mushrooms, hard boiled egg. And a chocolate chip cookie recipe that can be found on the back of any bag of chocolate chips. Nothing new or innovative here. Also, there's no nutritional values for the recipes, but if you consider french fries and chocolate chip cookies \\"vegetarian cooking,\\" you may not be interested in the nutritional content of the recipes. Unfortunately, I think this cookbook will end up in a garage sale or donated to charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Way to Expand Range","review":"This equiptment does require a solid speaker/amp set up. This will give you the capability to blow out cheaper speakers due to a lack of internal limiting circuitry. Not a complaint at all though.The range on this thing is very good, also allows you to EQ recordings you make to CD, Tape or MP3 if desired. Made the music sound much bigger and sharper. Especially feeling my CD's were flat in sonic output. If not desired, the bypass button will stop this effect with a single touch.Mine was built a year or so ago, sat around in it's box and yes, got \\"sticky\\" before it was sold. I quickly resolved this by blowing dust with aerosol out while pushing the buttons in and out. Not a problem since.Smooth operation that doesn't impart a \\"click\\" onto your recorded media when reproducing and fine tuning things live. Plated plugs and a turntable ground wire in the rear all plusses aswell.

It is written just for their level about struggles that all preschoolers can relate to. Each page has a bible verse, a prayer and a story about other children who are doing something they shouldn't. It teaches things such as; sharing, taking turns, treating animals kindly, etc, etc. Then there are 4 questions that ask the child questions about the picture. My 3 year old loves this book and totally understands what it is trying to teach him. It has also been a great book to open up discussions with him about right and wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a choice for syrian hamsters","review":"This wheel is very nice, however, it is much too small for syrian hamsters.

My son loves all the pictures and images of 'frogs', 'trucks' etc--and counts along with the DVD and identifies the numbers/objects/images. I like that this DVD uses real images and real music in the backround, rather than cartoon characters, loud noise, and gibberish in images that go 1000 mph! If they are going to watch something on 'the screen' make it something of worthwhile substance that teaches them something good! Young Minds is a winner in our homeschool family, we've really enjoyed it and see results!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"This is a nice summary of the fundamentals of Modal Logic. He does a great job explaining the philosophy behind the concepts and the history of the ideas. But, his explanation of the proofs is scanty at best and he lacks clear examples and illustrations. If you want to understand the philosophy then its solid. If you want to be proficient at the proofs then keep looking. Also, it lacks an answer key which adds to the difficulty of the exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry fans ....","review":"I really do not like the way Dame Janet sings Mozart, I love her Schubert and Faurè on Hyperion collections and I also love when she sings many other lieder (or songs), but to opera Dame Janet Baker is not what I excpect from a singer, I only loved the performance of Lucia Popp, her voice is quite angelicate. I prefer the recording of Sir J. E. Gardiner with Mrs. Varady as Vitelia and Anne Sophie Von Otter as Sesto. But the best Vitelia you will find in Della Jones' interpretation for this role, under Hogwood, ....I have never seen someone like her singing this role, that is one of the most exquisite and dificult roles in the universo of the Mozart operas. And, of course, Colin Davis is not a really good conductor on Mozart ... he loses himself easily in the huge universe that Mozart is."},{"rating":"2","title":"POP-ularity","review":"For a band out of obscure Mississippi, this is a definite breath of fresh air. This album provides all the right ingrediets to get your booty shaking and you WILL be singing along with all the hooks (which run rampant throughout the whole album). After seeing the band live numerous times, I was skeptical that they would be able to recreate the electricity of the experience on disk. Well, they did. The star track, \\"Communicate\\", soars with memorable hooks and melodies that will leave you humming after first listen. When you think that you can't get more dancy, you do- with \\"Hot Machete\\" the band takes dance pop to the next level. This is THE disc to buy if you love pop rock and great hooks. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM CATALINA PRODUCTS","review":"I bought two Tensor floor lamps which had Mica-like lamp heads. I used only the specified 50-100-150 single bulbs. We noticed a smell and hint of smoke and discovered that the bulb was melting and had blackened the lamp head. We had a hard time finding how to contact Catalina Lighting (no phone number) but finally contacted the customer rep. After many days, they acknowledge the issue (sent them pictures) but will no longer respond. We complained to the South Florida BBB but they already have may complaints against them and never respond (according to the BBB). My opinion, it the products say Tensor or Catalina Lighting, move on to another product that won't catch fire and with a vendor that will stand behind their products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution before buying Tensor Products","review":"I can not recommend any Tensor or Catalina lighting product due to their horrendous customer service! If you attempt to contact them about a warranty issue, they promise they will take care of it, but they never send you the paperwork necessary to process the return.When I called their customer service department in Canada to complain, they got extremely nasty saying \\"its only a light\\" and \\"I do not get paid enough to deal with these problems\\" In summary I believe that Catalina/ Tensor products are poorly made, and the company does not stand behind its products"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Warner Brothers DVD restoration in 2007!","review":"In general I like the Digi-View Cartoon Craze DVDs.

There are cheaper ones out there, but they are not anywhere near as well made as this one. I have been using it for a month now. I had a problem with tendinitis in my heels, which caused me to stop running about six months ago. I have been doing Heavyhands exclusively, which is great for my upper body, but I wanted to strengthen my ankle area and maybe have less pain in my heels when I get up in the morning. Well, now the pain is almost gone and I have the wobble board to thank for it.I should mention that this wobble board, as compared to the cheaper ones I have tried, has a greater surface area, an anti-slip surface, and sits higher off the ground than the competing wobble boards. This makes it more challenging to use. When I use it in conjunction with my Heavyhands workout, it really ramps up the intensity. I'm in better shape than when I ran every day. I may never go back to running now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great board and video","review":"I have read where there was a problem with the DVD, but that problem must have been corrected.

It's an esoteric commentary about various versions of manuscripts written in the 11th Century and copied later which happened to mention Emma and Edith. It gave detailed comparison of each version of the manuscripts and compared the various perspectives of each author and their political agenda. It had little to do with Emma or Edith. It's like reading a book titled \\"Eleanor Roosevelt\\" but it's actually about all the books written about Eleanor Roosevelt which compared the virtues of these books but said very little about Eleanor Roosevelt herself or her life.

Drawing on the Anglican trilateral- authority of Scripture, Tradition and Reason as one thing about which Episcopalians still agree, Temple's approach is scholarly and pastoral as he dares to take the Bible seriously---not literally! He unpacks the topic of scriptural authority and invites people on both sides of this debate to embrace not merely a change of mind (he concedes that is not likely), but a \\"change of heart\\" and mind based on honesty and integrity in our dealing with this issue and how we decide what is \\"right and wrong\\".

It is the first study to supplant von Beckerath's \\"Untersuchungen zur politsche Geschicte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in Agypten\\" and takes into account virtually all of the evidence to come to light in the 33 years since von B's seminal work. My only complaint is that it does not treat any of the Nubian textual material which, although scant, does offer some worthwhile insight into the period. But, what can you do? The price is a bit on the steep side... which will probably preclude the non-specialist from picking it up. However, for the student of Egyptology, this is definitely a must-have for your reference shelf (assuming, of course, you don't have access to a good Egyptian-focused library)"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and slow, not worth watching","review":"This film is not worth watching, as it is not written well, the characters are not well developed, and altogether it does not hold your attention.I turned it off after a whole hour of waiting for something interesting to happen.What also got me T.O.'d was a quite graphic scene of a dead baby-cow. Unnecessary.It is not the worst movie ever, but I'd say, find something else to watch.A great movie from the Czech Republic is 'Kolya', for instance. 5 stars out of 5 for Kolya."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not stay together","review":"The screw holding the knife to the frame of the knife that it swivels around will not stay tightened. The knife I bought has another screw that has the same problem.

Also, I have had this item for no more than one month"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use, very disappointing.","review":"I had high hopes for this knife, considering smith and wesson's long history of creating these products. I had only intended on using the knife for utility, such as opening and braking down boxes. But I cannot easily use it for anything.The real issue, is the knife is very hard to open, especially with one hand. Pressing outward on the thumb stud will not open the blade. I have to use two hands, and push on the rear thumb guard, while pulling the front thumb guard with a second hand. The thumb stud does not seem to serve any function whatsoever.Any folding blade should be cable of opening with one hand. If not, I'd recommend a fixed blade. And I would recommend looking past this knife for another option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute but Sad Story","review":"I am going to read this story to my second graders even though it is a bit sad.

So far, two weeks into the class and everyone loves them. I'm using these pastels to draw the locations on the skin so everyone can see where all the muscles are.

Today, I was just doing a search to see if I could find the original on the internet, and I see they're still making it, with only minor design modifications.I still have it, and it still works.

I'm giving them 4 stars because the price just can't be beat. Otherwise they would earn 2 or 3 from me. They are plastic and look very sturdy, but I think (in contrast to what the other reviewer says) have a plastic-y sound. They are a little big for preschool, and in my opinion would be way too big for a baby. They are about 10 inches long with a bulb about the size of an elongated grapefruit. For the size of the bulb, there isn't a lot of \\"fill\\" to make noise. I'm sure they will work fine and look like they'll hold up well, but I wouldn't expect much more than a cheap toy from these maracas.

I happened upon it by luck - obviously they aren't making this CD anymore - which is quite a shame because Schiavo's work on this CD is excellent, even better than the other CD I have by him (considered his \\"Demo\\"). This particular CD was a bit pricey (well, okay, a lot pricey) because of the \\"collector\\" status it has garnered due to lack of production - but all in all, I think it was worth it. I do feel, however, that the label should consider re-releasing this CD so that other people can enjoy it as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I own vol. 1 already.

I have an obsession with coloring to relieve stress, and this book delivers exactly what I need. Gorgeous mandalas, only one per page (no front-and-back coloring) so you can easiy display them.

The book is divided into several sections for easy reference, contains an episode guide for the third Doctor's era with reviews of each episode, and provides a really nice overview of the era of the third Doctor and the events of the time period during which the episodes were produced and aired.Personally, I wish the book had included more information on the discoveries/recoveries of lost Pertwee episodes, as well as their restoration to color; since, the stories behind these are very fascinating.Overall, this is a very well researched volume; and, I highly recommend this book as well as the rest in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Americana Big Wheel - Just Spinning Not Moving","review":"I was able to put it together without any difficulty. However, I was disappointed in the quality - it is all plastic and the front wheel tends to just spin without griping the surface. You have to give it push from behind or the rider just sits and spins. We tried it on a concrete side walk, a black top driveway, and on hardwood floors with the same results of spinning without moving. I probably would look for another brand next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"not our typical Michener book, it is more the making of a Michener book, in this case the making of Mexico, and how he overcame a 30 year writers cramp to do this, well worth the read to any fan of his Mexico novel or to aspiring writers, not for a casual read otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual Michener book","review":"This was not a novel about a place/ time or even really about Mexico. It was really about the writing process and how serendipity sometimes changes everything. It was good for what it was but for Michener fans craving more along the lines of Hawaii,Chesapeake, Covenant this will dissappoint. It is much closer to Iberia - my least favorite Michener."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"My Lost Mexico\\" should have stayed lost","review":"This is one of the most-tedious, boring books I've ever tried to read.

After watching it all the way through I realized I have never done the full primary series and have never seen it in it's entirety in any book I have read on the subject...which I found a little unusual. I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of moves I found to be repetitive or just to difficult for me to do. The complete series is pretty long and takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete. With that being said, Richard Freeman is very thorough and moves at a good pace. The video is broken down into chanting, breathing, standing and sitting poses.If anyone knows of any Ashtanga videos that are broken down into 45, 60, 90, and 105 minute guided practices, please let me know. If there isn't one, it would be a great idea cause sometimes it would be nice to have shorter options when time doesn't permit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I bought this DVD and have been very pleased with it. Not only is it less expencive then some of the other DVDs on the same subject, but it is very informative.I think that this is a great DVD on Ashtanga Yoga. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instruction","review":"This is a very good CD for the more serious yoga student who really wants to learn the Astanga Primary Series. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. No fancy studio, scenery or music in the background - this CD is purely about the breath and movement. I have been using it every day for the last few weeks at least partially, and feel that it has helped me to bring more depth to my practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy It","review":"I'm a great lover of yoga and exercise tapes. But dont let this front cover lead you astray. It looks like it was filmed in the 70's, the sound quality is bad, and it is incredibly boring and unsettling. Perhaps I'm just spoiled with all the new dvd's with backdrops of hawaii, but this purchase was a huge disappointment. incredibly expensive, not a good quality, and really outdated, i would not recommend this. I wouldnt even give it 1 star I dislike it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow Crazy Hard","review":"The poses in the latter half of this tape are incredibly advanced. I laughed out loud when the instructor said it might take \\"a few weeks\\" to master one of the poses that, to me, is near impossible. A few decades more like it.

However, most adults will feel their brain cells dieing from reading this novel.As for the love scenes, I truly enjoyed her \\"other\\" books, most of them were filled with passionate, erotic and yet tender love making. In this book however, too much talking takes place that distracts and annoys the reader. It was just way too irritating, the whole story, the characters, the bimbo'ness of every character....... it was like.. erm reading about a desperate 16 year old valley girl from California in lust with a 18 year old surfer dude... \\" like duh!~\\"Do try reading her other books first, this one was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"P.I.

I have enjoyed all of the the McCloud Brother stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRRITATING READ","review":"This book is far from romantic or erotic. There were too many sex scenes & at such ridiculous moments that it totally took the thrill out of their perilous situations. The sex scenes were so rough & lacking in tenderness that they appear to be quite brutish. Davy & Margot were such unlovable characters that I did not really care what happened to them. Davy's behaviour appears to be borderline abusive. I won't be surprised if he ends up being a wife basher. The only saving grace is Mikey. This was a very disappointing read from the author of the superlative \\"Behind Closed Doors\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I could not get into this book at all, I found it really boring, I agree with the other review that said it was irritating.

But if you are like me and enjoy a book with a story line and real charactors that keep you involved in the story and romance as a side then don't read this series, I read the first book and sent the rest back. I love to read books with romance but this was just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it written by the same author?","review":"I bought this book thinking I was going to get a great, intriguing story.

But in all the wrong ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Pond...","review":"This was Pond's second release of the three that spanned their all too brief career. It is quite experimental and a little less accessible than their self titled first release, but certainly worth checking out. The hooks, the melodies and songwriting, all synonomous with Pond, are presented. Sideroad and Glass Sparkles in Their Hair are the true gems on this offering, but it is quite good from start to finish. Also recommended: Pond's self titled and Rock Collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Commercial","review":"This is a band from my city.Friends told me - You have to listen to this - they gave me two cds by Pond -I've been so disgusted after them - the first was not so bad - but this - this is just a commercial music played from good players(it seems) - but the fact is that this sound is boring,pop and absolutely commercial.For example,you have to compare a band as Gravel or as Skin Yard or as My Name with one as Pond(or Gnome) - Pond is a nightmare in front of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Upset!","review":"By reading the comments of others, I bought this CD to get \\"I've got a Treat\\" only to dinf that it not on the CD!!!!

This book, however, reads like an edited version of a TV introductory cooking show (which it probably is). His former books introduce the cooking of Mexican and Oaxacan cuisine with admirable quality and depth.The book is primarily basic corn kitchen and a few standards. Consisting of, essentially 34 recipes with two or three variations on each, the book is far less than it appears.He has some good sections on ingredients, but rarely complete: for example he has a section on tequila which never mentions pulque or mexcal (from his beloved Oaxaca) and while he calls for such things as avocado leaves and epazote he does not provide a source. On the other hand, he has a good section on internet resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic and EASY","review":"I saw Rick on PBS and ordered the book.

I'd like to see more cookbooks written in this manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Plate At A Time- A little disapointing","review":"I had seen Mr. Bayless on television and purchased this book because of that exposure. While the dishes in the book seem authentically Mexican, and the ones that I have made are quite tasty, they are but a fraction of the really great meals I have had in Mexico. Much of the book is a dialog on where and how the limited number of dishes originated. I personally think that the buyer of this book has had a \\"good deal\\" if he spends no more than $12.00 - $15.00 for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning tool!","review":"Living in Southern California, I've been seeking traditional recipes for those dishes I've enjoyed at restaurants for years. This author makes the tradtional easy for those of us who weren't raised to make tamales or other mexican fare. Every recipe I've tried has been received with cheers by all.

Best Sunblock Yet!","review":"I tried this product at a friend's house, and it so far surpasses any other sunblock that it is ridiculous! It is not thick and goopy, it absorbs very easily into the skin without leaving a greasy film or white haze. It glides on and has a very pleasant almond smell. Also, I have incredibly sensitive skin, and this product did not cause breakouts or other irritation, which is quite the feat. I cannot wait to have some of this stuff for myself. Wonderful product! Just wish it came in higher spf too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Its not really a moisturizer but more of a sunscreen. Its acceptable coverage for winter but not enough SPF for summer.

She is able to move the blocks around to make the different musical sounds and is able to start the music herself. So far this toy seems to be withstanding all of her tough play and the music quality is great. Not only does she like it, but Mozart is much easier to listen to the 100th time around than some of the other choices. I also like the fact that the product has a phone number to order replacement parts (just in case she destroys one of the blocks). All in all, a great toy that teaches exactly what it claims to teach while being easy enough for a young child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toy","review":"As a teacher, we have heard over the past few years how classical music helps stimulate the brain. My son recently turned 2 and we bought this for him. Yes occasionally, he likes to stack the blocks, but he loves changing the order of the blocks to make various melodies. The bright colors are great for teaching colors. I will ask him where is the blue block...and so on. Each block also has 6 shapes. In time I am sure he will learn his shapes from this toy as well. He is already calling the circle a \\"ball\\" and pointing to the other shapes asking, \\"That?\\" To which I will name the shape. Daddy also loves this toy. They will sit together making different sounds and melodies. They also like that they can hear a beat when the put the block in and try to match the melodies together before they play the whole line of blocks. I liked this so much; I ordered 2 more for our 2-year-old and 3-year-old nieces!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't lean to hard--","review":"This toy is really cool. The music isn't typical annoying childrens music but don't let your kids lean to hard on the block or the sensors where you place the block will break. Why?? This is a childrens toy-- Shouldn't it hold up to a little pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective right out of the box","review":"Well ours worked for about 10 seconds and that was it.

However, Neuromith stopped making these products (hence, the low, low price) and cartridges. So, if you want a cheap toy, great. But you'll get no support from the company. Unfortunate, because they really did have a wonderful line of toys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the old model","review":"We own the old model of this toy and after seven years it has started not working correctly. So I decided to get another one. The new model is chintzy. The sound is computer generated and lacks the clarity and depth that the old model had. The base toy and blocks now have a cheap lightweight plastic feel. This model has three music style settings on the back instead of a place for cartridge, so it is quite limited. For the money, it just isn't worth it. Wish I could find a \\"new\\" old model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to be a hit!","review":"We bought this for our twin boys for Christmas and it has been a hit. They are 1.5 yrs old and they are very interested in how the blocks make music. they take them out and hold them to their heads to hear it, which is funny bcs now they think all their blocks should make music. I think this toy will be enjoyed for quite a while and was a good purchase. The only 'down' side is that it is so well built that the blocks have totally dented our coffee table as the boys have banged them down on it while playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 days of weight loss","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 books I have from Linda Spangle.

Good job and thanks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just begining","review":"I just got your book yesterday. I am on Day 2. I am using this as a guide to follow me through the diet that I cannot ever seem to stay on, but have always done well on. Well, after I got your book in my hands, was the day I vowed to never see the numbers I seen on the scale that day. I feel like 100 day commitment is not too much, and it is almost like a hand guide to keep with me along with my trusty notebook to journal my journey on. I PROMISE to come back in 100 days (well 98 now) and repost my review and update on my diet journey and weight loss. So far, I am motivated...motivated enough to read this everyday for the next 3.5 months of my life. I figure if you start, and continue to go...your results will far outweigh having to keep restarting over and over. This time, this is for GOOD! Be back in a few months! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Daily Guide","review":"on Sparkpeople there is a group that uses this book as a guide.

I strongly encourage you to read her insights and follow her suggestions.

Every day for 100 days there are a few paragraphs to read followed by some questions for you to answer in your journal. The information is so inspiring and practical. I could relate to it so well that I swear the author knows me and wrote this book for me. It's like having your own personal weight loss coach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding easy to follow!","review":"I love this book. I am on day 29 and I enjoy doing the daily lessons.

Before buying Ms. Spangle's book, I knew my issues with food were emotional, but I just wasn't sure where to start dealing with them. This book got me started and now I look forward to each day's mini-lesson. She doesn't approach the concept of weight loss with restrictions and all the things you can't do - she frees you to explore all the things you CAN do. I'm so very glad I bought this book - it's worth so many times what it cost.I have already recommended this book to several others I know. I'm even buying an extra copy for my mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended, appreciate her approach","review":"I thought this was a very good book, with quick, easy, practical lessons. I found it motivating and insightful. Not every lesson resonated with me and I found some of the examples to be irritating and irrelevant, but I'm only one part of her audience and I'm sure those lessons and examples spoke to someone else. As far as the lessons go, you can do as much or as little as you want with them. Some days, I wrote a lot. Some days I wrote just a few sentences. If I missed a day, I just picked it up the next day. If you can't commit to that, I'm not sure if you're ready to commit to long-term weight loss or maintenance. The most important lessons, I think, are around managing long term weight loss. It really is a rest of your life challenge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost weight","review":"I have lost 17lbs already and I am on day 28 - you still need a food plan but this really has helped me along the way. I combined it with counting weight watchers points. The book really helps you think about weight loss differently - it is not just a diet you do for a few weeks, it is a life change that needs to happen to get back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR A HEALTHIER LIFE!","review":"This book is truly what it claims to be. I believe everyone should read this before they even try on their own to lose weight; especially if they are emotional eaters, or for some reason have had weight issues and don't know why. This book really gets down to the why and how to reprogram your thinking process about food. It's changing my life and I'm not even close to reading 100 days worth yet. I intend to read it several times. ... A great daily devotional (learning & training tool) for any one that desires a healthy approach to food and lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent example","review":"Lots of filler in this book, but, sprinkled through it are some nice tips.

Call me crazy but I would hate if someone put a cold wipe to my behind and so I always felt bad for my son when he was used to having warm wipes at home and then cold ones on the go. He hated it, and I didn't blame him.

It keeps the wipes warm for about 4 hours.

Unfortunately my experience with the Warmer was not a great one. After only 4 or 5 uses it melted and I also has this horrible smell that came after micro waving and YES I did read and follow the instructions carefully. I even put it in the microwave for 5 seconds less than recommend.I am sure this would be a 5 star item if there where some improvements made to the heating pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This DVD is a mix of concert footage and behind the scenes interviews with Josh. If you're a fan, I recommend the purchase. If you're not, give him a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Of Encouragement","review":"This book was such a blessing to me after miscarrying my last three pregnacies. The grief and tremendous pain that I felt after the death of my babies left me empty and alone. The author shares the experiences of her own miscarriages and the journey from spiritual pain to healing. The author also shares her thoughts concerning the reaction of others to the subject of miscarriage. This helped me to understand some of the comments made by others and to forgive their lack of knowledge. It was comforting to connect with someone that understood how I felt and to find out that my thoughts and feelings were normal. A lot of people don't realize the loss associated with miscarriage which makes it sometimes difficult to find support during such a time. This book was my best friend when I needed it the most. Thumbs up for this author for exposing her most intimate feelings so that others can be helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious Theme Will Appeal to Some, Not to Others","review":"I ordered this book several weeks ago, before the review alluding to the heavy Christian theme had been posted. I, too, wish I had had some indication of the book's very religious content. I think a statement on the back cover of the book best sums up what potential readers may want to know: I Can't Find a Heartbeat invites all who are grieving the loss of an unborn child to sit at the feet of Jesus and allow Him to heal your broken heart.I had a miscarriage several months ago, so naturally I could relate to Melissa's struggle to find comfort and answers. I just couldn't personally relate to the very religious journey she took in order to find both."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twelve Days of Christmas","review":"Certainly worth the price is the Canadian Brass version of \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\" - track eleven. Everyone I've played this for enjoys it, whether they are classical fans, Christmas music fans, or neither. A real treat for classical fans, though. The other tracks are what you would expect, brass Christmas standards. There may be an issue with the audio mix, though, as I could never get the voices (on the tracks with a choir) to sound right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Brass!","review":"This album met my expectations.

Sadly, the product didn't work at all for me...It comes with a measuring cap, with markings on it so you know when to stop pouring, and you simply swish it around in your mouth for a minute. It doesn't taste bad, it really doesn't taste like anything at all, and it's a little thick. (non-toxic too, if you swallow it) No numbing, no stinging, nothing.It's supposed to put a barrier above whatever in your mouth is causing you harm, so it can heal itself, much like a liquid bandaid... which is a great idea, but again, it didn't seem to work at all for me, and I still got some sharp pains from my wisdom tooth.Maybe you'll have better luck, but I wouldn't buy this again.

The characters are well drawn, the context is laid out nicely and the analysis is first rate. It is a sophisticated study without resorting to academic jargon. I normally don't write many reviews, but I had to when I saw that only two had been written so far. I really doubt that a better work of American history will be written this year. James Green is definitely a historian to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical Chapter in US Labor History","review":"A compelling evocation of post-Reconstruction era Chicago that assembles the complicated facts of this epochal moment in US labor history into a coherent narrative. Mercifully bereft of moralizing, but shows compassion (and contempt) for all the right people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good topic, super boring writer","review":"Interesting book, good history collection, nice details but bordering on too many really.

I would like to buy it and read it on the kindle, but the digital edition is MORE EXPENSIVE than the paperback!

Unfortunately, the author tends to repeat details over and over in subsequent chapters. Had he excised them, the text would likely have been at least 50 pages shorter and flowed better. His need to repeat characterizations of events and descriptions of people took away from the narrative. It's unfortunate since the topic is more timely now than ever.

This dark heartbreaking debut is one of the very best of the 90's. Jeremy's subtle, hidden, soothing voice strains in agony of \\"I feel wrong\\" in Round. The beautiful Seven kicks it off perfectly with it's pouding drums and racing guitars and \\"saw it on face the fool\\". Pheurton Skeurto is one of the most enjoyable tracks with its piano shuffle and Enigk's audible voice \\"How will they know just where to find? under this bridge I lie down\\".

I first thought the genre of emo was based upon bands like Dashboard Confessional, Taking Back Sunday and Saves The Day. But that doesn't fulfill the description of what emo really is. Sunny Day is emo,whether you hate to hear the term or not. They are amazing.

Helping to create that ever growing popular \\"emo\\" genre we hear so often today, Sunny Day Real Estate created a sound that no band can completely re-create. Although the band has long been over, Diary is an everlasting album that not even an obsessive fan like me can get sick of. Song About An Angel, will forever be that song I still get emotional about with Jeremy's powerful vocals and those clever lyrics that keep you questioning, \\"what the hell is this band talking about?\\" \\"Seven,\\" starts the album off with an incredible, high-paced song, while \\"sometimes,\\" a mellow, soft ballad, ends the album. These two songs describe the whole feel of the album. The songs seem to switch back from these two sounds, always keeping you interested, creating one of the best albums of the 90s in my opinion. Diary is a must buy for any fan of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahead of its time...","review":"I have recently stopped listening to EMO/scrEaMO and all the sub genres due to the saturation of self inflicted lyrics about the same old crap that are written by guys who should be to old to write about highschool romance.

To me, this is SDRE's worst studio album. That's right, I even prefer The Rising Tide to Diary. Diary is just a mish-mosh of sounds; nothing gels; no melodies stick in my mind. I should probably give it a one, even. Diary is a very forgettable-sounding CD. I was completely disappointed with it, and puzzled at how so many people gush over this. Perhaps it is because my introduction to the band came with LP2. Then I bought How It Feels To Be Something On. Then I saw them play live on The Rising Tide tour. Then I bought The Rising Tide. In my opinion, if you want an SDRE album that represents their best work, get LP2 (the pink one) or How It Feels To Be Something On.

Demeter is willing to help Lina for a price: Lina must trade places with Demeter's daughter Persephone and travel to the Underworld.There, Lina masquerades as Persephone and meets Hades, the god of the Underworld, who is a hot Byronic sort of hero. The two begin to fall in love, but can their budding relationship survive both lovers' insecurities, or the revelation of the truth about Lina?This is a sexy and fun love story, mostly lighthearted, but you might need your Kleenex by the end!Oh, and the dread steeds and Cerberus are hilarious and cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lusty and Romantic","review":"This is the second book to P.c cast goddess series and so far its one of my favorites. It is Romantic in a non cheesy way and Passionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew Hell could be so inviting?","review":"I love PC Casts Goddess series and this one is no different. It finds our heroine trading places with a goddess and visiting hell, literally. Who knew hell could be so inviting? Hades is strong, sexy and dangerous. All the things that make a woman swoon. This is another in a long line of good books where the heroine and the man come together and its sexy, fun, and at times laugh out loud funny. Ms Cast has a way of telling a story that pulls you in and makes you feel like you are there. I recommend this one to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this Book!!!!","review":"I have read a great deal from this author and normally I think her storylines are decent. She has great character development and the way she describes the breathtaking scenery is amazing. But this book... just made me angry. I have always wanted to read a book that had Hades as a character, just to see the different angles the author could have... But this was awful...She made Hades a sniveling little twit who might as well have been a virgin and who was riddled with compassion. I suppose that is what I get considering this is a romance book and someone would have to fall in love with him and vice versa. But still, this book was very disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves Springs Forth","review":"I love the idea of P,C. Cast again intertwining historical characters with strong modern day women. What a spell she weaves with her twists and plots. Finally someone who appreciates poor suffering Hades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodness...","review":"This book is filled with so much goodness.P.C. Cast does not disappoint. Do not let the price tag fool you, this book is worth so much more than that. It is priceless.5 Stars. Experience it.

I cant wait to read another book from this P.C cast..Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remaining a PC Cast fan for sure!","review":"I fell in LOVE with PC Cast first book, Goddess by Mistake, and have stuck with her ever since. Persephanie and Hades is one of my favorite myths. I have been wanting to do a retelling of it myself, but it looks like she beat me to it...though my version was a little darker, so I still may give it a go.This was a wonderful love story I think. It told the REAL meaning of love to me. I will admit I was a little thrown with the end, but it works and was still a wonderful take/tale. Playing with the Gods and Goddess's will always be an adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the lot","review":"Quite the best of Cast's Goddess series -- all the same plot so only read this one. Rife flaws (parochial Italian-American heroine, unconvincing shallowness of the gods) are overcome by the strong romance, although the depiction of hell is mildly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goddess of Writing !","review":"\\"Goddess by Mistake\\" was wonderful, and this one is a very close second. I fell in love with Hades, and the ending was great. I read it all the way through in one day, and the only bad part is that we have to wait awhile for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"This book has not made me a fan of P.C. Cast. I doubt I'll read anything else by this author. The writing was clunky and disjointed, the main characters were barely fleshed out in the most elementary of ways, and the sex scenes were laughably boring. Not worth the time I spent trying to finish it. Unless you enjoy mediocrity, I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best thing about this book is the title. And that's not saying much.","review":"Hades, ruler of the underworld in mythology, is handsome. He has a palace. See Hades. See Hades' palace. See the \\"mature\\" heroine win Hades' heart with her kindness and good spirit. See Hades and Heroine have silly and predictable misunderstandings. See all work out well in the end. Ta da! Romance writing is easy! We can all do it!The previous reviewer hit the nail on the head here when she wrote that this is a fill in the blanks romance novel. The premise seemed so promising but I'm so disappointed with this dull attempt at a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junkey junk!","review":"These \\"Goddess\\" book are idiotic and lewd at best. Of course many other women like soft-porn romance novels. Hopefully, some will be encouraged to read some good fantasy after reading these books. But if you haven't read them, don't bother. Really!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the series - Love the protagonist and the romance!","review":"This book was the best of the series. I actually didn't like any of the others, except maybe Warrior Rising. If you like Greek mythology and a complicated romance, this is for you! She writes the best intimate scenes! I'm also in love with the protagonist; she is a strong woman that knows how to handle her business while coming across as extremely humble."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fantasy and good escape fantasy!","review":"I love these whimsical escapes from reality stories. Stop over thinking it people...it is after all fantasy and it is where people like to get lost and imagine that we could be right there.I enjoy how Cast takes mortal beings and envelopes them into a new take of Mythology. The begining allows you to see yourself as Lina would so one can appreciate her nature when she does travel to the underworld. I enjoy the steamy scenes and the rejections and read them to my husband who also finds them -of course-delightful. P.C., I think you are doing a nice job of entertaining us. I enjoy the animal tie ins and have to say the accuracy you speak concerning horses in right on. Thank you. and to others ...it is a great read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blackberry 7230","review":"I order a blue one and got a black one.

The selections are well mastered and the selection of artists is very broad. The accompanying instrumental music will satisfy anyone interested in that musical era. I find that the more I listen to this CD the more I want to listen to it. It has it all together for my musical taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't grow much this first year","review":"It still looks pretty much like the small plant that was shipped after being in the ground for over six months.

It's still alive and healthy enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for Hites Nursery","review":"I was very disturbed after receiving this product.

This is a great series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-dramatised, Silly Muck","review":"The acting was somewhere between awful and terrible. It was over dramatised and silly with a story line that silly. It fake blood flew all over the place and made for a boring spectacle of ridiculousness. Some people may see this as just a bit of fun. To be fun it needs some substance and this lacked any. It was trying to be 300 and didn't even come close 300 had a story line and the flying blood contributed to the story. It was fun because it had substance and was well written. Don't bother with this nonsense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"I read all these really high 5 star reviews and I'm honestly scratching my head. The plot is too plain, the characters all speak like they're in any high school (yes your kids speak like this). Sure I can see where people are into the sex and violence, but there are better movies and series for both. It honestly works out like a poorly written graphic novel. I watched this because it was highly recommended by a coworker, a coworker that I can no longer accept the opinions on media from. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but it looks like I'm in the minority. Save your money for a series with a good story like Game of Thrones."},{"rating":"1","title":"300.... the series","review":"After watching the excellent BBC production Rome seasons 1 and 2, I decided to purchase Spartacus season 1. And I could not even make it through the first very terrible episode. Every single scene has this annoying 300 slow-down/speed up cheesy blood effect and the producers didn't even bother shooting anything on scene instead taking the lazy route and using CGI in every background. There was no outstanding acting like I would expect from something like this. The show was so despicable I ended up throwing the whole package out my front door. What a waste of money and time.Don't waste your time with this, either watch BBC's Rome series or watch the 1960's version of Spartacus instead. This is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"If you love period pieces, you will enjoy Spartacus. The writing is great and there is nothing like the old English tongue!

I rented the first episode of the first series and just did not enjoy it.Other reviewers have mentioned the gore aspect. Imagine a sword cleaving human flesh and switch to slow motion as blood flies through the air. I didnt find it artistic - just bad taste and needless.The story seemed like a soap opera set in a past time.As the title of my review suggests, I would recommend paying 1.99 for the first episode and decide for yourself. I will not be buying any more of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I watched it every week on Starz. It is an awesome show. The DVDs came with some cool special features.

Beavis and Butthead types will love this, but if you're more into stories with substance - skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spartacus","review":"We had enjoyed \\"Rome\\" and bought \\"Spartacus\\", but it is a disappointment. It is cartoonish in its production values, which might have been the way the producers wanted it to look, but it did not appeal to us. Also, far too much gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spartacus","review":"This is probably the worst DVD I have ever purchased.It has nothing but extreme violence, sex, and lots of blood. The story is nonsenical and the acting atrocious.Not living in the U.S, it was not worth the postage to return the item to Amazon, so I threw it in the trash.How much demand is there for such garbage?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I purchased this series based on the good reviews - bad decision. I ended up only watching 3 episodes and then stopped. This is not Rome or anything close to it. It's a cheap production that has some dim-witted actor playing Spartacus when the historical Spartacus was far more. Don't waste your time with this series - read Barry Strauss's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEMETRIUS DOES DALLAS.","review":"When one of the series stars calls herself \\"Lucy Lawless\\" you know better than to expect a worthy remake of the Kirk & Kubrick klassik. In fact it looks like a Tijuana Bible adaptation of \\"300\\". No subtle imagerie here. Bodies explode as if they were balloons filled with blood; its contents gushing out like animated Rorscharch inkblots. To savor the moment, the action freeze-frames itself so you can see the carnage in all its gory. And when things get slow, there's always some complimentary never-too-unexplicit fornisessions among the cast.Not that it's all sex and violence. There's love as well. In its most tender dialogues, the faithful wife kindly tells her husband \\"Go kill 'em all!\\". He dutifully complies. Awwww..!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I haven't been able to watch this product. i didn't realise when i purchased it, it wouldn't play in my blu-ray player. i then asked to exchange it for a regular copy and i was more than happy to send back the orignal one i had received. but instead i received yet another blu-ray copy and haven't been able to get in contact with the seller ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bloody and Graphic.","review":"The story and premise of the show sounded great. I am a huge fan of shows like Gladiator and others. This one was not worth it with all of the Sex and Blood. You can make a great cshow without all of the added garbage. I know some people think you need this in the shows to make them sell but you dont. I would definetly not recommend this show at all as it is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spartacus","review":"I wish I could write a review, but I can't because I never received my dvd! I will not shop thru Amazon anymore. They cannot guarantee you will get your product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those of you who like to see the rough side of history...","review":"It is a great story, with superior actors, and a fascinating look at one possible example of how living in those times might really have been. It is bloody, and it is lurid, but it feels so right of an example of gladiatorial life in the Roman Era.Now I've watched every episode on cable TV, and I can hardly wait for the next season. There are re-runs on TV, so why would I spend my money on this product? The answer is simple. This series is one of the very best to be on TV since Babylon 5, and I feel it is my duty as a consumer of entertainment to put my dollars down to show my appreciation of what they wrought. It is only by showing this debt of gratitude that producers will be willing to make more shows of this quality when they see that people appreciate their efforts. Will I watch these episodes on DVD, you betcha! It's pleasant to usually get even better video quality, and no commercials to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Andy Whitfield is greatly missed!","review":"FAbulous writing.....amazing costumes and characters....the cast sucks you in.

The DVDs all work great, very little scratches, and have no problems playing. I made sure to buy from a company who would refund or exchange my purchase within two weeks to a month, just in case.If you're concerned about whether you will like the Spartacus series, don't be. The acting is superb and the story will have you hanging on the edge of your seat in suspense. If you love the Dexter series, Spartacus will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spartacus","review":"First off received this and Gods of the Arena at same time ordered both together and saved some money. They came extra quick and I didn't pay extra for shipping. Very pleased. If you like the show it is great to catch up to the new Vengence season although I don't like the new actor playing Spartacus now. The series is dope man, not the best for kids though, too bloody and too adult xx for the young, great for adults who don't mind a little. One of my favorite shows now and great to keep even if you have on demand cause it won't always be on there."},{"rating":"2","title":"combinación perfecta de acción y drama","review":"serial muy absorvente, llena de acción, intriga, mentiras, sexo,y drama.bien elaborada. efectos especiales diferentes, similar a la película 300.recomendable sólo para personas con criterio formado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome (and I'm a girl!)","review":"I had no idea what to expect when I watched this and oh my goodness it sucked me in. Wonderful (yet somewhat sad) storyline, beautiful actors, fighting, blood, and sex. There is tons of sex but who is complaining, right? If you have a free weekend, watch it. But, you will need several hours - you won't be able to stop at just one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome indulgences.","review":"This series has all the awesome indulgences you could ever wish for. Blood, sex, fighting, sex, blood, sex, arenas, sex, more blood, more sex, realistic fighting, realistic sex ... and an enticing and exciting storyline to go with it. What more can one ask for? This blows character-driven movies - you know, the ones with stupid people doing stupid things so the storyline writers have something to write about - out of the water. This is EXCITING and it moves as if it has a life of its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Gift","review":"I got this as a bithday present for my dad. His favorite historical character is Spartacus so I really thought he would enjoy the show and I figure I can get him the other seasons as gifts for other occasions. He absolutely loved it so I am happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I Thought The First Episode Was 95% Bad. This One Is Even Worse...","review":"Having seen the first episode of this series, and put off by the vulgar language (not because I don't use it, but because I don't think they spoke like that in Ancient Rome or in ancient times, for that matter), obvious CGI backgrounds and CGI-style blood a la 300, I decided to give it another shot. The second episode is even worse: in addition to the profanity and CGI backgrounds and blood, this episode also includes vulgar sexual references that you'd expect to hear in \\"Two And A Half Men,\\" \\"Family Guy\\" and \\"The Sopranos.\\" Also, the guy who plays Varro resembles the silent Marx Brother (I think his name is Harpo). Unnerving, in addition to the rest of this garbage. Skip this one too...ah, skip the entire series. It's a waste of time. I'm not even sure how bloody accurate the series is to history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art-house style with gratuitous sex","review":"I'm not a prude, and have nothing against a sex scene that builds and fits the story and plot. However, I hate gratuitous sex, which I define as that which not only doesn't contribute to advancing the film, but acts as a distraction from the story. Spartacus: Blood and Sand takes every opportunity it can to show breasts, show complete nudity, and have explicit sex scenes that would earn an X rating anywhere else. The effect is to come off as very crude.As for \\"Art-house style\\", the show frequently represents a long duraion of time by showing the the main character running/fighting/etc. in place while running a film reel behind him. This could be done to speed along the show or to reduce production costs, but I got the sense that it was done for that art-house effect.All told - a very disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn and blood","review":"This show is nothing but a cover for throwing every naked woman they could get to sign their contract on tv. Even during serious conversations there are a dozen naked women dancing in the background and having sex every chance they get. When no one is having sex or stripping, there are gladiators Of course doing what gladiators do. Violence is expected, but honestly all the naked women make this little more than a man's masturbatory fodder rather than enjoyable historical fiction I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"juvenile attempt to horrify","review":"the stop-action filming just to demonstrate spurting blood and decapitations,etc, detract and therefore negate the intended violence. Perhaps it is just a man thing, but this was just plain boring, somewhat like the offending repetitious dialogue in the Scorcese gangster movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"if you are looking for things like good writing, good acting, respectable production value, and believable action sequences, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.what you will find here is nothing but terrible dialogue, pretty actors delivering some of the most stilted and awkward performances outside of a kindergartner's christmas pageant, bullet-time overloaded sword and sandals fight scenes, and softcore pornography.usually i'd tout the pornographic aspect of the series as a redeeming quality, but in this case, it isn't enough to make up for the deficiencies. in all, this is an even less intelligent distant relative of xena: warrior princess that takes itself far too seriously for its own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylized extreme violence.","review":"I am a middle-aged former military guy who likes quality movies, with a preference for action-oriented movies and war flicks. I watched the first 30 minutes or so and was pretty disgusted. It's stylized with slow-motion action to highlight sword thrusts and blood spurts. Blood appears to be added by computer to almost every scene, sometimes covering a good percentage of the screen. Worse than 300. This is not Russell Crowe in Gladiator or Brad Pitt in Troy. Don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joseph2012","review":"I loved this series. Andy Whitfield was magnificent. He portrayed Spartacus with a anger and determination that was impeccable. We lost a very good actor but his performance will live on. The last episode with the gladiators taking over was the best. Watch all episodes first , but hold on tight for the finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spartacus Blood and Sand...One word...AWESOME!!!","review":"Simply put, I think this is one of the best adult series on any network! It has all of the ingredients one could look for in a drama: politics, betrayal, love, sex, nudity and violence; all in appropriate amounts. I am sure the writers have taken some artistic license when depicting some things surrounding life in Rome, and I did initially think the special effects with the blood was over-the-top. With that said, every episode transports one to Rome and the life and times of Spartacus. The writing is amazing and the acting is top-notch! The first two or three episodes are the foundation episodes, and the story builds from there. If you liked the HBO series Rome...you will love Spartacus Blood and Sand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"I don't own this great show on dvd , yet! But soon I will. The show is awesome, I can't get enough of this action packed series. All the good points of the movie have already been said by other reviewers.

I'm a big fan of action and violence, but I couldn't make it 10 minutes before quitting this show. The dialogue was laughable; the costumes ridiculous (what the heck was Spartacus (almost) wearing?); the (massive amounts of) fake blood splatter looked cheesy, and detracted from what otherwise may have been some decent action.Maybe it gets better after minute 10, but I'll never know.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Porn","review":"I expected way more from this series, It was just an Xrated movie, with about the same story line.

Another Female perspective...","review":"I had heard this compared to 300 which I personally did not care for. Way off! Spartacus takes the scenes from Rome and The Tudors that alot of people really liked and builds an entire series around this. Well Directed and Acted with plenty of Action, Suspense and from a Female perspective \\"easy on the eyes\\" Spartacus DELIVERS! You will find plenty of Deception and Drama as in The Tudors and Rome so you really cannot go wrong! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty TORTURE!","review":"If you like BLOOD, GUTs, bare butts and full frontal nudity! There's lots of them here....I fast forwarded through the entire season and can still follow the story. Enough said, any more will be giving the series undue reverence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Bang","review":"I began watching this hoping for something like 300 which I loved. Then came the Big Bang where Spartacus has a very detailed sex romp with his \\"mate\\". I concluded the rest of the series would be porn just like this and turned it off and sent it back to Netflix unviewed. I am sick of this junk in moves from Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas's naked behinds to Pretty Woman the sweet romantic prostitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Christian's. BLOOD, GORE AND NUDE SEX SCENES, ENOUGH SAID!","review":"Got this because we love history and romans etc, but was dissapointed in it and sorry I chose it. Way too graphic and this takes away from what little story line there was. More for a violent typical man's taste, but I guess some wome will like this since the guys in it are really buff. Not for me or any real Christian family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure sausage fest!","review":"I was very excited when I saw this coming to TV so I eagerly tuned in...What a mistake....This was clearly nothing more than an excuse to have as many naked penises on screen as possible. I quit after a few episodes because clearly all the excessive male nudity was targeted at women or gay men. You got men kissing, men rolling around on the ground \\"fighting\\" naked of course, full frontal male nudity but only partial female nudity. If you like looking at naked men this Blu-ray is for you but for straight men its just another reminder of all the people desperately working to push a gay adgenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent show","review":"Highly recommend this show... And the prequel too (which should still be seen *after* this season 1 to avoid spoilers)... Can't wait for the third installment Sparticus: Vengeance.Graphic, violent, excellent..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season","review":"Yes, there's sex, violence and cussing in hefty amounts (JUPITER'S ####!!), along with some homosexual elements. But in the end, the story is good, the art style is great and Andy Whitfield was incredible. If it wasn't for his cancer he would've likely had an outstanding career. Also the extras are worth watching.The biggest downside is the slow motion being mixed in too much in the fight scenes.Bottom line, if gratuitous sex and violence is likely to turn you off to watching something, then leave this alone. Otherwise, it was an outstanding season (though more entertaining than the type of sleep inducing drama that wins awards)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spartacus Unchained!","review":"This show is absolutely spectacular - it is very interesting and portrays the Roman empire as it might have been - the human drama and depravity - the interaction of greed, envy and lust mixed with the need to survive their own culture is well portrayed by the actors - it is easy to become swept away with the almost constant action of story! I have thoroughly enjoyed Season One!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I do not like the series, but this is the best of many series at this time.

Andy passed away from cancer before he could reprise his role for the second season and it was a blow to the fans and the storyline as well. If you know nothing about this series but are interested in Ancient Rome and an accurate portrayal of that time, you must see the entire collection. The first three seasons are available on dvd now and even though I did not miss an episode when originally aired, I still puchased the discs because the series is incredible!!! The fourth season is due out sometime in early 2013 and this will be the final chapter to an absolutely enthralling story. Be forewarned though; it is quite graphic in its depiction of violence and sex. It is NOT for the squeamish nor the prudish."},{"rating":"2","title":"KICK-ASS SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this series! ACTION, DRAMA, & TWISTS. What more could you ask for.

The first minute really said it all: coarse language. I personally have no problem with profanity (I use it almost any chance i get), but I don't think that kind of vocabulary was used in Ancient Rome. The sex I had no problem with either. The scenes with Spartacus and his wife had beautiful music and were well-filmed. I like how Spartacus really cared about her and said that throughout. My other problem with this episode was also with the obvious CGI backgrounds and CGI blood, which looked like something out of the erroneous and pseudo-\\"Historical drama\\" 300. Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like Gladiator, 300, & Rome...NOT","review":"If you enjoy gritty, graphic movies such as Gladiator and 300, and quality historical-based TV shows such as Rome, then you'll absolutely hate Spartacus: Blood and Sand. This show is nothing but cheap-looking special effects, soap opera-style acting, and tons of slow-motion blood and sex which looks so fake that it's hilarious (even the naked women look fake, like they're made of plastic). Unlike shows such as Rome and movies such as Lord of the Rings, the budget computer-generated special effects in Spartacus make it look like the actors are running around in a cartoon fantasy world. The writing is poor, the acting is laughable, and the endless slo-mo scenes of decapitation and/or intercourse will have smart viewers scratching their heads and wondering how this show managed to stay on the air. Spartacus: Blood and Sand is more like an R-rated cartoon than a gritty, realistic, adult-oriented action show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did teenagers write the dialog?","review":"While I admit the show is fairly entertaining, the dialog is so horrible I couldn't continue to watch this show.

I am not sure how Amazon handles issues like this, but I will update this review once I find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile entertainment","review":"I received the series as a gift. I could not watch more than the first episode. The blood and gore were just too much for me.

Individual episodes on loadable discs won't play, skip, video but no audio, audio but no video. Also purchased Season 2 discs that are experiencing the same issues. Am attempting replacement/refund with Amazon now. Avoid these low quality poorly produced discs at all costs. They will only disappoint you. This was disturbing since the Spartacus series is awesome. However my attempt at obtaining a complete collection has been made impossible due to the poor production quality. I just hope I can find discs that were produced by a reputable firm even if more expensive. These discs were obviously thrifted in order of offer them at a low cost. In this case low cost equals low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Packaging","review":"This has nothing to do with the series; only the packaging. They put it in a booklet, where you need to slide out the discs from a fairly rigid cardboard sleeve. Guaranteed to get fingerprints and scratches. What idiots designed this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Extreme Entertainment","review":"When I first started watching this I thought, as a lot of other people do, that this was just a corny copycat of 300 and gladiator with more blood and longer sex scenes. But when I watched a few more episodes (its on Netflix watch instantly online) I came to see more plot developing and got more involved with the characters. One of the things I like most about this show is that people die off pretty randomly to the point that I am actually some what surprised when it happens. They really hammer in the setting of Rome being a brutal place which is also what I think makes the show excellent. If you didn't like 300 or gladiator because of the language, violence, or other graphic scenes you defiantly won't approve of the scenes in Spartacus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops all!","review":"I love this show from the moment it aired. My daughter turned my eye to it. And every Friday we were glued. Every Friday...DAMN I miss it and can't wait for the second season. I hope they come harder than the first bringing nothing but boldness, blood and sand. And much much Glory. If people didn't like the show well you should've turned!!! I watch the reruns. And Thank the good one above for SHOWS ON DEMAND. I love 300 so the blood effects didn't bother me matter of fact beside the acting of very very fine ass men. If I didn't see any ass in the show I expected to see the blood. This isn't for the weak or pansy. At all its only for those True Gladiators out there. Can you all say it with me? SPARTACUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what movies are supposed to do","review":"I do not watch movies as a form of Education as the opinion of the producers and actors is subjective and History or facts usually take a beating. I watch them for entertainment, and Spartacus Blood and Sand is exciting entertainment that removes us from the boring sameness of our now controlled lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off to a slow start but heart-wrenchingly wonderful","review":"This show is beyond awesome. I started watching it out of a love for HBO's Rome, and at first I was not interested. It seemed too forced and over-played the first few episodes. But soon throughout the season, you grow entranced by the complicated stories of people struggling to gain freedom, power, or love. There is a lot of sex and gore, but I'm a 22 year old woman and I thought it was artistic and sexy.I really became committed to the characters, and there are plenty of moments that made me teary eyed. I laughed a lot as well, and was awed by the fighting sequences.Overall a great show. Highly recommend it, if you can handle some gore and sex, and can enjoy a historical drama filled with funny, sad, gruesome, and romantic moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I really like entertainment like this. It's very 300-ish [one of my fav movies]. There is a lot of killing, blood [very stylized], sex and nudity though, so get ready.

This series is just amazing!! With the very first episode, it got me hooked up. Blood, fights, drama, sex,friendship, love, it just has everything.

It had me hooked after the 2nd show and I look forward to Gods of the Arena.

And I've seen many great tv series over the past 20 years. Nothing compares to how AMAZING this is. There is only one bad thing that comes to mind when I talk about Spartuacus, and that is how much it saddens me that the character spartacus played by Andy Whitfield (RIP) had passed away after this season. I don't think a single person in this world could have played that part any more perfect. I don't even know the guy and it breaks my heart to think of how amazing of a person he was in the show, and how powerful he was with life, courage, pride and integrity, was able to get taken from this world by a rare form of cancer. Guess it shows you that God doesn't play favorites. Nevertheless, watch this series, it'll change your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to watch instant video on a perfectly able pc.","review":"I will NEVER order instant video again until you can guarantee with a refund that it will play on my computer, which plays dvd's, other online streaming media, hulu, etc. without being choppy, hesitant, etc. I did not even get through the first ten minutes.

It has action, drama for your mama, and ridiculous story line. It's greatest asset is all the characters it has to look into, which it does. Season 2 is more of the same. However season 3 seems VERY weak without the main actor Andy Whitfield as Spartacus and the backdrop of the gladiator games not a centerpiece of the story.Anyhow, the first and second season are nearly flawless in story and entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAGNIFICENT FAILURE!","review":"This is one of the most awful films I ever watched. The film is devoid of any artistic offerings and any ideas at all. ALL those who like to see blood all the time, most disgusting killings and butchering of people and from times to times scenes of sex, can waste money on this.There is neither history here, nor arts. The pity is that the producers disregarded all those viewers who would like to see a new interpretation of the legendary hero Spartacus. But in additon to disregard towards history, one can easily feel a contemptuous attitude towards the viewers' taste.This is definitely the worst film on an ancient theme I can ever imagine (I am not saying an classical film, as that would be an insult to the latter phrase).Please preserve your nerves and avoid this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"Gratuitous cartoony execution. This show is all about really bad CGI, gratuitous sex, and painfully boring slow-motion fights with buckets of blood. The special effects detract from an otherwise listless story."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY BAD!","review":"I admit I only made it thru the first 20 minutes of this disaster! It is really awful - fake backdrops (obvious), horrible stilted acting, the language is ridiculous and almost comical, blood flying around in slow motion, etc.Apparently Starz was attempting to make another \\"Rome\\" and it is a miserable failure.Don't waste your $$ and time.How anybody with half of a brain can give this mess 5 stars is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Best show EVER the dvd's come in a nice book style holder.

Initially the blood splattered on your screen and the slight gaming like sequences might put you off but hang in there it only gets better. If you enjoy a real epic journey, filled with love, lust, hatred, treachery and sex, this one is for you. The sex is basic, graphic and well within the historical timeline.

I love this book. And you should know that I hate to cook. Really. But I do love to eat, and this book marries those two opposing characteristics beautifully.One of my favorite things about this book is that the recipes are simple enough for a true novice such as myself to tweak without fear of crashing the dish. I have scribbled my own notes all throughout the pages on things I have tried and added and truly enjoyed. One of my favorite recipes is for rice with broccoli and parmesano-reggiano cheese. It is so fabulous that even though it is a side dish, I usually will make it as a main course for my family.This is the best cookbook I ever expect to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good.. but wasn't.","review":"Don't waste your money on this one if you plan on seriously building robots or animatrons. It's a decent overview, but it is *not* a hands on kinda book, as it would seem. It gives you a few circuits and a couple of designs (that would be blindingly obvious to any hobbiest with so much as half a clue about electronics or basic mechanical building), but that's really about it as far as practical information. Most of the \\"projects\\" consist of \\"Go buy this toy and add somthing to it\\". Many of the projects are centered around RC cars and the \\"android hand\\" is actually just one of those cheap toy robot hands with \\"air muscles\\" attached to it.Useless. I was quite dissapointed in this book.

Not all the projects in this book are cheap and do require the purchase of the BASIC Stamp but the basic stamp is an important tool in building more complex robots as a person progresses into robotics.Overall it was well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missleading title","review":"The title says robots you can build, yeah this is true if you are an engineer. The projects are not cheap either, almost all require a basic board, which is about $150 . It does give you a list of the parts and there price, but it doesn't say where to buy them from. All it lists is the name and the address of a company, that I think the author must work for. It is good in that it has an interesting few chapters on AI, robots now and in the future, which are very intriguing. I can only recommend this book to those that have deep pockets and know how to read schematics. If you don't have either, then I suggest you wait for the programable leggo robots to come out this Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This isn't a \\"hands-on\\" projects book as the title would suggest.

Isn't that cool?\\" Sheesh. What a waste of paper. I just bought Robot Builder's Bonanza. I've heard good things about that book - so I'll give that a try now.

The early 60's ushered in mink stoles for $500.00, lady-like gowns and proper high heels. Towards the end of the '60's fashion takes on a distinct change, reflecting that turbulent time in the U.S. Gone are the wasp-waist dresses, and in come the \\"hippie\\" styles of striped bell-bottom pants for both sexes, mini-dresses and go-go boots modeled by Twiggy look-alikes. And the prices! A gorgeous pair of colorful leather flats were about $6.00, leather boots sold for $14.00. Of course, some of the styles are positively heinous according to current standards, but many have stood the test of time and would not seem out of place today.

He defines chaos, luck, and karma, and gives readers strategies they can use to exert control over these life forces. These descriptions are interesting, but the most useful section is the seven-step action plan for taking control of your life at the back of the book. This simple guide is useful for anyone making a significant life change, from losing weight to taking up a new career. Shoup cites many examples and clearly believes anyone can change. He is upbeat but realistic about the challenges that change presents. The book offers a process, not a \\"quick fix,\\" but if you or someone close to you is on the cusp of a serious change or needs encouragement to take control, we [...] recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Forever-----Took me FOREVER to finish!","review":"I am a normal lover of the Stone Barrington books. However, this installment of the series was not an enjoyable read for me. I didn't like the book being in England. I'm not into reading foreign books. I didn't like the character match ups especially Stone with Monica - then Sarah - then Arrington. I think it made him look to much like a man \\"harlot\\". I didn't really like the plot of the book (yes I understood it, just didn't like it). Thought some of the things going on were too far-fetched.

His writing style is great too because it is short, sweet, and to-the-point. Oh yeah, did I mention that Stone is the man! He hooks up with no less than 2 women in every book.

It's a relatively quick read, but a read that just seems like wish-fulfillment: Stone somehow knows a LOT about London, is able to find his way easily, and every time he turns around there's someone he was looking for and has now just accidentally stumbled across. Isn't London bigger than that? For some reason, women throw themselves at Stone, and only in the last eighth of the novel does anything like a plot resolve itself. However, the ending is a big \\"so what:?\\" with no ramifications for Stone other than more fantasy fulfillment (women, riches, adventure -- the usual James Bond-like trio). I was hoping for a more character-driven, intelligent book; I was disappointed with this entry in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado about Nothing","review":"This isn't a mystery novel. That is the first thing one should understand if one chooses to read this book. It would barely qualify as a procedural in my opinion. The problems are many. First, the main character isn't described at all untill 3/4 of the way into the book and then the only feature I was able to discover is that he has blond hair. Second, the main guy runs around a lot and has a lot of apparently great meals but that is all. He solves nothing, it is all solved for him. The only \\"murder\\" is solved in a way that would be kind of like playing a guessing game and at the end someone saying \\"oh it was number 13.\\" without you even trying to guess.

The Paper Boy shows us how hard it is to get to the truth about anything. This is a novel that will outlast Dexter himself. Highly recomended along with Paris Trout and Brotherly Love.

Willie is lovable as a singer-turned-con man. It's a fun movie to watch for music fans and fans of Willie and Kris. Real songwriters, singers, and producers will find it a little far fetched..... or simply a parady of experiences. The sound track is excellent, and Kristofferson fans will notice an early version of the song \\"Under the Gun\\" which appeared on his late 90's album \\"A Moment of Forever.\\" Rip Torn and Leslie Ann Down are very entertaining in roles as dastardly promoter and a binge drinking singer respectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film you can enjoy more than once.","review":"This was a great effort on the part of Kris and Willie and also band members that took part.

Every time I would grab it for a middle of the night feeding, the strap would end up out and spread across my bed, and I'd have to roll it back up and stick it back in the pocket. (Where it would stay until the next feeding, at which point it would escape again.)Needless to say, the strap lost the battle at about 2 months, when I cut it off with a pair of scissors after a particularly difficult night.It may be cheaper than the boppy, but I'd spend the extra money to avoid the extra fabric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product wish cover was washable","review":"This is a great pillow.

My husband uses it when he gives our son a bottle. And like pretty much everyone else, I wish there were some sort of washable cover for this, my son is a bit of a drooler when he nurses and while I've gotten used to throwing a burp cloth over everything, it would be more convenient to have the cover on all the time and wash as needed. FYI I know this is also available at a lower price from another MAJOR discount retailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Love This Pillow!","review":"I bought this for my son because he was sleeping in his car seat most of the time due to spitting up issues and sinus problems. I didn't want him to sleep flat because I was afraid he would choke when he spit up. We got this pillow and it has been a great relief...to me, the baby and my husband. He very seldom spits up and his sinuses are usually clear when he sleeps on this pillow. The only downside that I can find, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because you can't buy a cover for it. I just throw a blanket or towel over it and it's fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boppy is better","review":"I tried to use it for nursing but the pillow is so soft, I was better off using a pillow from my bed. The \\"buckle\\" part has velco and it would always get stuck on blankets and other things, it was pretty annoying when my little one would fall asleep and I would have to move the pillow and put her to bed.I haven't used my breast friend but I hear that is great and this time I have two boppys because it was convient to have one upstairs and one downstairs. I wouldnt recommend this one, i ended up throwing it away because it was very irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"No removable cover!","review":"I am returning this product because this version does not come with a removable color.

He has acid reflux bad so he has to sleep on an incline at all times. Well the Boppy pillow wasnt cutting it anymore, he learned to slide himself off so when I woke up his head was wedged in between the corners of the Boppy Pillow. When I recieved the cuddle u cushion in the mail on the outside of the package said helps reduce reflux, so far so good. It helps him sleep more comfortable at night due to the way this pillow is made. I could have not asked for anything better and I wished I had it when he was first born (now 15 weeks. This is a must have pillow for every infant.Wonderful Product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Soft!","review":"It came in excellent timing and it looks way better in person! My baby isn't due until next month so I placed my 5 month old niece in it and she LOVED it:) Idk how long the pillow will last or if it will get flat quickly and I would like a cover for it but I'm happy with my purchase. It was a great price too i think my baby girl will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better that a Boppy pillow.","review":"Similar to a Boppy, but the extra strap is neat if you want to sit your child in it. And it is great for breastfeeding support. I wouldn't go without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Just as good as more well known pillows!","review":"Works just as good as more expensive pillows! I love that it has the ability to strap your little one in while on the floor or where ever. The only negative thing I can say is when you have the strap tucked in the pocket, it eventually falls out if you are lifting it up etc. It would be nice if there was some way to secure that strap while not in use other than just tucking in the pocket. Great value for the $$!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue stars cover does NOT come off","review":"I've been using this to nurse but I hate the fact the cover does not come off so you can't throw it in the wash if milk gets on it. My son recently had a dirty (poop) diaper leak (not a big leak, like a drop or two), and I don't feel like I can spot clean it well enough to ever put my son on it again. I don't use it to set him in like the picture shows because he has a gym, swing, and bouncer for times I need to put him down. I have used it for tummy time to help his neck muscles. He's 7 weeks old. I wish it was at least water resistant since there is no cover to remove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for play and napping.","review":"I thought this would be a good support for play time and napping.

I bought this for my little girl. I used it for her feedings, to keep her in one spot, for tummy time, helped her to sit in there. I found many uses of this pillow and i would recommend to any mother. It wouldnt be wrong. The only reason i gave it a 4 star is because i cannot take out the cover to wash. You will have to be a little careful there. Otherwise..great product, great value, great use. Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Floppy Mess","review":"This pillow is not firm enough. It bends down in the center causing my daughter to sync in the middle and her neck is bent. I have to stuff another pillow under the center to make it keep her body straight. I dont use the strap which makes it frustrating when the darned thing falls out everytime I grab the pillow to nurse. Then I have to roll it up and put it back. There needs to be someway to keep in there when not in use. It does not stay close to my body, most likely due to the floppyness of the pillow, I have to constantly readjust and pull it closer to me to maintain a proper latch. I would not ever recommend this to anyone I care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pillow","review":"I love this pillow! I got it as a baby shower gift before my baby was born. My son was born 2 months early and this pillow was perfect in supporting him and he took naps everyday on this pillow. My son is now almost 9 months old and he uses it as a pillow when he relazing on a little break from his toys and I use it to put it behind him while he is sitting on his own in case he flings himself backwards which he likes to do for fun. I have gotten so much use out of this pillow, it's wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a My Brest Friend for breastfeeding, this pillow is better for a napping baby","review":"I bought the original Boppy, My Brest Friend nursing pillow and this pillow. If you want a nursing pillow, get my Brest Friend. It is the best! Has much more support for both you and the baby (you can walk around with it and still nurse) and the cover comes off for washing. Le'Cuddler is good for putting the baby in it to take a nap or when they are tired of the swing or bouncer, but it wasn't a very good nursing pillow for me. I like the Boppy for tummy time for my son, but again not a great nursing pillow.

I have never purchased tofu or textured protein, and never will. I was very disappointed with this book; Ms. Kofalk stated that even though she isn't a vegan vegetarian herself, she wrote a vegan cookbook so as to not offend. Funny thing is, I am rather offended. This cookbook is of no use to me.Also, I can't help but feel that Ms. Kofalk is perpetuating an image that only left-leaning, naturalist vegan vegetarians will be interested in solar cooking.

What most sticks out in my mind is her marginalia in Mises's _Human Action_. She had the penchant of constantly misunderstanding what Mises said; I think it revealed a lot in terms of Rand's ineptness as a philosopher. Objective interpretation of other texts is hardly her strong point.

If you want good content, not here. If you want good production values, not here. On the other hand, if you want to see Andy Irons stare into the camera for 30 minutes while wearing a hat that shills his own surf company, this is pretty good. What a waste of space. He says like three things the whole DVD, and otherwise, it's like he's auditioning to play the role of \\"Surfer\\" in some 80s movie. Irons has some sort of sidekick in the movie that does most of the talking (and offers the only real instruction), who is equal parts informative and annoying. I kindof felt sorry for him as it was clear the producers (or Irons) made him do all kinds of lame stuff to try to add some comedy to the DVD.

I certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"These were exactly what I needed!","review":"I was trying to make a scarf with a pattern that had a lot of bobbles and my metal hook was not working very well. It would take me hours to do less than 20 bobbles. I bought a $7 plastic light-up hook hoping for better results and was still having difficulties. I finally looked for bamboo hooks in a few different stores and couldn't find any or just none for the price I was willing to pay. I finally found these online and bought them and they were exactly what I was needing. I was able to finish the scarf that night. I was and still am extremely happy with these hooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"I actually bought this item to add $$ to my order to get free shipping - however the needles are hard to catch the yarn as you are trying to crochet.

There are occasional nuggets but they are too few and far between. The author never draws the reader into the story and life of Chase, and instead spends countless pages focusing on a blizzard of details, especially in the earlier years, many of them inconsequential and dull. The last few chapters, including on such dramatic subjects as impeachment and the 1868 presidential election, feel rushed and underwritten in comparison with the laborious treatment of less important earlier events. Blue's book on Chase's political life is much more engaging, even though it hardly touches upon Chase's personal life. I would recommend that book, in conjunction with a reading of Chase's correspondence and journals, over this well-meaning but lifeless tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love this product","review":"I had never used Manic Panic before but had heard good things so I decided to try it out. I didn't realize how small the jar is, and at first I was disappointed, but when I started applying it I realized that a little goes a long way. I have fairly short (But very thick) hair, and I used maybe half of the jar. Although if you have very long, thick hair, I would suggest that you get two jars.Now on to the results:I bleached my hair multiple times before using the dye, and some parts were lighter than others. I think it actually looks better if your hair is more orange-y, not so white-blonde.Also, this shows up VERY blue on cameras, and I don't know why. But in person it's a beautiful blue based green.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this product and will definitely buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I have used hair dye, I used Raw from Hot Topic. The Raw stayed in my hair for months. When I used this it stayed in my for less than a week. I don't know if it is because of my hair or because this brand isn't good. I really like the color of this though. The color is very pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dye","review":"This is a really good semi-permanent hair dye. Semi-permanent! The color comes beautifully when bleached right, and your hair doesn't have to be bleached white-blonde either. Even on darker hair, it gives it a nice tint of color. I love how it's a vegan dye so you can be happy purchasing it knowing it hasn't been tested on animals or anything. It doesn't feel damaging at all because it's so naturally made. But because it's semi-permanent, it does wash off very quickly. I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't mind putting in the time and effort to dye your hair every two weeks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading photo and color!","review":"Manic Panic makes great products but be warned: this is NOT GREEN.

There is a model who is supposed to show correct alignment, author who only talks and gym full of people who try to follow the model. That is not as bad as the fact that camera very rarely shows the model. Most of the time, you can see either the author or crowd. If you have not practiced yoga before, you won't have any clue how to make position he is asking you to do. Instead of this DVD I highly recommend DVD of his student: Desiree Rumbaugh (\\"Yoga to The Rescue - Feel Good from Head to Toe\\"). She perfectly shows ever pose. While you watch her DVD, you do not question yourself if you are doing it the right way. She shows what is right way and what is wrong one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed with this video!! Most of the film is watching the students do the poses","review":"I was very disappointed with this video, rather than a detailed instruction of the teacher doing the poses, (as in the case of say, Richard Freeman {which I would rate 5 stars}) this is simply a very low quality filming of a yoga class. John is not even doing the poses. There is not a film of a professional doing the poses. Most of the film is watching the students do the poses. Very low quality video, I do not recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"John Friend is long winded and likes to hear himself talk, There could me a lot lessof his inspirational blah blah blah and more instruction.

Gris, the bad guy, who has been narrating so far, is now now longer in the right position to keep narrating, nor does he know certain aspects of how the story develops, so the writer, very surprisingly, switches narrator! It's hard to get accustomed to a new one, after having read 7 and half book narrated by Soltan Gris, with his dark humor and so on, this narrator is completely different... but I don't want to spoil the surprise.

Though I haven't used it enough to get any on my clothing, it purportedly washes right out. If you're working really fast the sticky pink semi-solid glue sometimes comes out in gobs but this can be removed. It comes off of laminated furniture easily as well. An efficient and non-smelly way to get out lots of letters at one time. The cap could have been designed better so that it would fit on the end of the stick (like a fountain pen cap), so remember where you place it: The stick begins to dry out (say, after about a few hours or so) when uncapped."},{"rating":"2","title":"nostalgia, revival, whiskey and cars all in one","review":"this hard to find book is well worth the search. if you love the south (carolinas) and can relate to being a poor adolescent with a desire to own your first car, were a little more adventurous than the average teenager, and understand people in a realistic manner come along for the ride. two young men decide that first hudson is worth smuggling a little moonshine for the local bootlegger. hilarious at times, gut wrenching at others. not recommended for the shallow at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistics yet humorous times in the less hectic times of Columbia, SC","review":"If you grew up in Columbia, you can almost identify the characters in this book.

One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap. No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook.

Most important ... you don't need it. My grill cover is on a shelf on my deck where it has been for five years. I noticed it yesterday and it is turning all green. Meanwhile, the grill looks great even though I haven't covered it except the first two weeks. It looks worse when it is covered. The grill is aluminum and plastic. It doesn't rust.

The underside portion that's used to cut a seatbelt is too narrow to catch even an infant's finger. I bought this handle because my grandmother (confined to a wheelchair) needs something extra to grab to get in/out of my Jeep. It helps her to stand and maintain her balance during the transition.

I hadn't thought about the wumps for years, but it all came rushing back, and the book was JUST as good now as it was when I was a child.The Peet family cared for a capybara for a while, and you can read about THAT in \\"Capyboppy,\\" a \\"chapter book\\" for young readers.

I have tried the Remington Travel Shaver as well as the Braun 370 Pocket Go Shaver (each costing about $18.00) and found they required multiple passes to get all the facial hair cut. Given the prices of these shavers that was not a surprise. I was hoping that by spending more I would get a better quality shaver that gave a better quality shave. Unfortunately that was not the case. The AX-1300 shave quality is about the same as the much cheaper Remington and Braun shavers. I have followed the directions exactly was well as other ways (shaving with Lectric Shave, wet, dry etc...). The results are the same. I have to conclude that as a shaver the AX-1300 is not worth the extra $30.00 - $40.00.As far as durability time will tell. The AX-1300 does seem to be better built and fits well in the hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors to be trusted","review":"I own quite a few Corvette books and have a modest working knowledge of Corvettes and Corvette history.

I also found multiple errors in the text, which makes me doubt the accuracy of the data that I do not personally know. I suggest that the Black Book is a better, more accurate, reference.

Simply fill the aluminum cup in the tray with beer, wine, fruit juice, or some other beverage. For extra flavor, add spice as well. Place the infusion cone on top of the cup, then place the chicken on top of the infusion cone. Once the chicken is in place, put the infusion cap on top to lock in the steam. Steam cooks the chicken on the inside, heat on the outside. Chicken is tender and juicy on the inside while the skin is cooked to a golden, crispy brown. Fat and grease drain away from the chicken and collect in the bottom of the roaster instead of the grill.To remove cooked chicken from roaster: Remove the infusion cap. Next, take a pair of tongs and go down the back side of the chicken and slide it off the infusion cone. This is easy to do since the roaster is nonstick.

From there on it becomes a strange monotheistic parody of Northern lore. Drawing heavily from a Judeo-Christian religious perspective, and 19th century style ceremonial magic, itself of mainly Hebrew origin, it is easy to see how it offends many Asatruar. There is little of the Northern Heathen flavour left.Some have asked how Thorsson could recommend it to his followers on the back cover. Apart from the obvious Llewellyn connection, Western ceremonial is a large part of the basis of Thorsson's own neo-satanic or Setian training. The two systems are two sides of the same coin.The book may be useful as an easy introduction to runes for those who are only familiar with ceremonial magic, but as a Heathen, I would prefer them to make the effort to look at the runes without the Judeo-Christian indoctrination.SweynThe Rune Primer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wtf?

Obviously, this was a low budget production and I couldn't afford expensive realistic looking teeth. Based on the price and the photograph (above) these teeth looked like the next best alternative....Sadly, I was mistaken. Not only do these teeth not fit properly in one's mouth, but they are not even pointy, which is to say, they look like dentures that give you an overbite. The teeth you can buy from a vending machine for $1.00 look better than these.If you're looking for a realistic look, then stay away from these ones. If you don't really care, then go for the $0.99 teeth. They're much more worth it.

The book format of the book is similarly lacking, being wholly unnatractive and, at times, mildly confusing.

The second, Eric, a boy in a leg cast who has been away at school for three years and now finds himself in public school with kids he has lived near but doesn't know. The third voice is used sparingly. It is an omniscient voice that opens each chapter and at first, I found myself confused (but intrigued) trying to guess what this was all about. The omniscient POV is used rarely and each time it is used, you seem to peeking ahead to a final conclusion. I liked it as a plot device.

There is a clarity which makes this more of an everyday listening experience while with Karajan I have to be feeling an urgency with an impending despair...if that makes sense.The requiem by Mozart is an apex of creativity and passion by who I believe to be the greatest ARTIST to ever grace this planet.

Must find more medical thrillers by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, I Guess","review":"It's just that F. Paul Wilson has written much better books. This was a paint-by-numbers, standard medical thriller, in which you can pretty much predict which doctor is going to turn out to be evil, who is going to be killed by him, what's going to happen to the hero/heroine way before it happens. Also, people make incredibly stupid decisions, so dumb that you almost don't care what happens to them. Dissapointing, especially for F/ Paul Wilson--I know he can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational medical thriller","review":"Sensational medical thriller that had me truly squirming with fright and panic as the events unfolded.

And it's so nice that my kids can bang & even drop them without the fear of them breaking.I rated this item a four because of the bowls. My only complaint is that the bowls, although perfect for pasta, are not deep enough for cereal...which we eat much more of.Given the depth of the bowls, I still haven't found another set of dishes that looks so attractive and holds up to the demands of kids, I love these dishes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watercolors dinnerware set","review":"Pretty and microware safe.

The bowls are alittle shallow, but great for salads. The only thing I would change would be the mugs, they have a stamp on the bottom stating that they are stoneware. I would have thought they would be made out of the same material as the dinnerware. Other than that I am very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this set","review":"I bought this set last Christmas to go lightweight and unbreakable. When internet research showed me this beautiful and colorful design I was pleased. The mix/match concept is very appealing. The product did not disappoint, it is just as nice as the picture. The colors and design coordinate well with other pieces and linens I have, especially an oriental set of bowls. Consequently, to me they look a little oriental. The mugs are the prettiest I've ever had. I am still adjusting to the shallowness of the bowls....that's the only \\"flaw\\". Love this set and will be ordering some more.

I heard this pattern was going to be discontinued so I bought two sets right away. They were boxed real good so nothing was broken and delivery was awesome. The only down side to this set is the green, it's more of a mint green and not as brillant as shown in the picture but I like them anyway. I also wish there were deeper bowls to go with the set...like a cereal bowl. Overall I'm very satisfied with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelle Watercolors","review":"Cute! Cute! Cute! I love the mix and match look this set offers while still coordinating. The only complaint I would come close to having, is that the bowls are very shallow. They are great for salads, but not for soup or cereal. My solution was to buy the Corelle Snack Pack in white.

No breakage during shipment was a relief! The colors on the dishes were just as we imagined and are very happy with it. We had read the other reviews, so we knew before we ordered that the bowls were very shallow. Now that we have the dishes and have been using them for almost a month, we really have no problems with the bowls. If there is a negative with the bowls it's that the center color imprint has a rough texture to it and I feel as though I am scraping the bowl.

If I had not needed the plates when the order arrived, I would have returned it.Pro: I am very pleased with the colors and like the fact that the cups are ceramic, not plastic.Cons: The bowls are USELESS unless used as salad bowls. Be prepared for the blackboard screeching as described by several reviewers. The saucers are especially bad about making this bone-chilling sound when a fork is raked across the surface.Who in the world would have designed bowls to be so shallow or surfaces that create such an unpleasant sound?

These dishes almost hit all my categories. They have a mug rather than a cup and useless saucer, thin, fit in the dishwasher and cupboard well, and are sturdy and attractive. The one draw back is the salad plate. Corelle has \\"decorated\\" it with beigy splotches that make the plates look dirty.

I have to wholeheartedly agree: on first listen I was slightly bemused, yet strangely drawn in by the awkward beauty of each track. It's short, it's definitely snappy and it most definitely is sweet. It's often surprising (see \\"Iscarabaid\\" and \\"J'nuh\\"), totally unpredictable and totally irresistable. I can listen to this album for days on end, it really is like nothing I have ever heard before.On first listen you may be disillusioned by the awkward rhythms, the swift changes in the structure and mood of the songs, the indecipherable lyrics, the unpredictablility, the mystery... but believe me, stick with it.

I went to a Foo Fighters show in 1996 and learned that the rhythm seciton for that band (well, that lineup anyway) used to play for this band called Sunny Day Real Estate. Since I really digged (and still do BTW) the Foos, I started researching, could't find the albums at you standard mall stores and forgot about it. Then I borrowed a copy of the Batman Forever soundtrack from a college buddy, and heard Song 8 by SDRE. I think I put it on repeat like 7 or 8 times. My roommate hated it. That right there proved I had stumbled onto something good.

First, you need TWO for the Olympus c740...which is roughly $26 at a time. I volunteer for a local football organization that has 3 squads and on game day I take pictures for approximately 6 hours straight. I don't use flash at all, just point and shoot. These batteries lasted for a little over 200 pictures and 9 hours of shooting time before giving out. This means that I would have to replace these batteries for each game day and that is ridiculous. I certainly didn't get over 1000 pics like the previous reviews! I have since purchased 8 of the Monster rechargeable Nihm batteries with the charger and I make it through game day just fine.

They introduce too many ideas/lines of text per page, cramming in lots of events that aren't or can't be represented by one picture alone.

These stories are witless take-offs on the once-popular Harvey comics for small children - Hot Stuff the tough little devil, Wendy the good little witch, Baby Huey, and so forth.

This book is the first to combine the two and thus show NLP in a far more holistic and all-encompassing way than before.The book is very easy to read and, as one would expect from an NLP Master Trainer, is written in such a style that it appeals to both auditiry and visual readers. As you read the book it almost appears as if the author was there speaking to you, which when coupled with excellent diagrams and loads of anecdotes and stories makes this one of the best introductory reads for both NLP and Wilber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pragmatic personal development","review":"Peter McNab has written a inspiring and thought provoking book which takes most of the latest thinking from the NLP movement and elegantly integrates it with Wilbers philosophies.

These are mostly songs of love unrequited and love departed, sung with emotion and sensitivity by one of the most extraordinary singers of our generation. The simplicity and beauty of the solo piano accompaniment by Oleg Boshniakovich only adds to the power of this CD. It's a must for anyone who loves Russian music and appreciates Hvorostovsky's amazing talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"It serves its purpose well, providing a padded and slightly elevated surface in the sink. It has remained clear so far (about a month), not soaking up stains. My only complaint is that it is slightly \\"warped\\" which doesn't really bother me because it is probably because of its thickness, which makes it sturdier. Sturdy means a lot to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I will keep this item but only to put in the sink while washing dishes. I wanted something to just leave in at all times but this has no center cut out to access the disposal (which is obvious but I didn't even think about it before ordering) and it traps food underneath and that grosses me out. It does, however, protect my new sink while washing pots and pans and that's really all I'm worried about. It's also very thick and not pliable in any way so keep that in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pew!!","review":"I couldn't get past the smell...a very strong, noxious, chemical smell. The mats sat for several days but the stink lingered, so I packed them back up and sent them back. I bought aInterdesign 60663 Pebblz Sink Matin the past, and had to throw that out as well due to chemical smell that never went away. I had hoped that maybe that was just a rotten batch that was made in China, because even though there were numerous reviews similar to mine about the smell, the more recent reviews included comments that theirs didn't have any smell. I thought I'd give Interdesign one more try. That's the last one, though. They still make a toxic smelling product."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enthralling look at professional hockey's past, and stars","review":"As a lifetime fan of the Detroit Red Wings, I was overjoyed when I found that there is a recent biography of Howe that is much more up to date than many written in the 60's and 70's. This book gives the reader an inside look at what it was like to get into the NHL in the 50's, and what it took to stay there and become a star. Mackskimming is very candid when talking about the front office's team management \\"politics\\" The reader also gets an up-close look at other great stars of the era such as Red Kelly, Ted Linsay, Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard, and coach Jack Adams. A must read for any TRUE hockey fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book on Gordie Howe!","review":"This book tells about Gordie Howe, one of the best hockey players ever, and his career in the NHL.In the beginning, it tells about his first couple of seasons, and then tells more about his great career and facts about him toward the end.

The personal moving accounts and the insightful revelations about phone calls, reactions and networking are invaluable in understanding the corroboration and teamwork that goes into reporting the news. The added benefit of the book is an up-close look at the humanity involved in being a journalist and the undeniable impact catastrophe has on those who report the news."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect party game","review":"this game takes less than a minute to fully understand and you can play with up to 10 people. it is especially fun if played with friends who know each other and can take a joke. it is a fun game regardless of how well you are doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family fun!","review":"Apples to Apples Party Box EditionWe just got this game and spent hours with our son, his lovely wife and our teenage daughter playing one game after another!

The only problem is that you need at least four people to play. The more people, the better the game.It takes about two seconds to teach people to play. The game moves very fast and is over quickly. We usually play three or four games. Everyone is laughing and we have a great time. Nobody's feelings get hurt.This crate edition is worth the money because you get tons of cards. We go through a lot of cards every time we play, so it's nice to have so many.Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a fun game","review":"I'm sorry, but this is the least challenging, most boring game! One of my favorite games is \\"Taboo\\" but if you play it enough, it gets so you can remember the cards you are guessing (somewhat). My idea of fun games: BOGGLE, SCRABBLE. If you want a game for all ages: give each person an educational book and ask each person to write down 5 questions (they also have to mark the book and page or remember the answers). Each person asks their questions, the others write down their answers. Then each person gives their correct answers and you see who got the most right. It is educational and fun!

This is a great game to play with friends who have a good sense of humor, as the game can get very silly and sarcastic. It's also fun to choose which card to play based on the humor/personality of the judge. You can also skew the rules a bit and have everyone plead their case before picking the winner. This can result in an uproar as your tipsy friends argue as to why \\"Bruce Willis\\" beats \\"Plane Crashes\\" in the \\"Most Deadly\\" catagory.Overall, a great way to turn a blah evening into a fun time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of laughs","review":"This game is as fun as the friends and family who play with you!Better than scattergories"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good telling of a real secret agent story.","review":"The book tells a good to the poimt story about the capture of the imfamous Nazi War Criminal Adolf Eichmann.

What a waste! If you're looking to see Shelties at varies stages of life, or various colorings, etc. look elsewhere. This was the only DVD that I could find on Shetland Sheepdogs, and I wish I'd passed on it. But I wanted to show the family what we're considering. I watched it by myself, and I'm glad I did. The kids would have been bored stiff, and they used ONE puppy throughout the entire video. Talk about boring. I wanted to see litters of puppies playing together, adult dogs doing tricks. Pass on this, buy a good & informative book filled with pictures, and then find homemade videos of real people with their dogs. Much more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute-but not what was expected.","review":"This video is cute but not at all what I expected.

It was 2 months late in arriving, received 2 copies instead of the requested one and was an absolute waste of time as it was advertised. The only info provided was obvious to any dog owne and the dog was a poor representative of the breed. Didn't use any variety of the breed.

He witnesses the rape and the killing and yet he has a 'dilemma' about reporting it because he's good mates with the perpertrator. For me there's no issue whatsoever, the brutality of the crime could not be convered up, so I had enormous difficulty understanding the motives of the central character of this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"meanings","review":"Blackrock was an excelent film it was a touching movie with out beening soppy. it is a powerful film which relates to a teenagers life and choices. the every day choices a teenager has to make, with every action there is a reaction. with every risk there can also come consercenses. this is clearly demintrates in one of the actors Laurence Breuls who played Jared, first demonstration was when jared surfed on the bonnet of a car while it drives around out on control with only a peice of rope to hold on to, that could of had consercenses. Secondly jared watching his mates rape a girl if he had acted, they might have reacted by running away. there are many meanings in this movie that are clearly shown i recommened that teenages watch this movie, even though it is not a new age movie it really makes you question your own morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story behind the story","review":"I bought and watched Blackrock. I came away from the movie as sense of change in the male image,identity and purpose. In addition to, the young girls that were effected by this tragedy, stood up and made their rage known and were not going to let what happened slip by under the covers of male privilage. By no means does this make an excuse for the individual that kept quiet. I did not have the background to the movie and never realized that the horrible rape and murder of the young girl actually happened in real life. This movie is true to life around the world in that people do not value women but perhaps there is an hope for change. Movies that are based on real life do change people's hearts and minds and no doubt that this movie is one of them. I know I walked away with a new preception and I am grateful to all who were involved in making this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!","review":"What a piece of junk!

I haven't had too many problems, except one night I was scrolling through my player for about 10 minutes looking for different songs and just by having the light on all that time killed a brand new Lithium battery!! That's faster than a digital camera! The only other thing is one song on it kept messing it up. It would sound scratchy and weird and caused the player to freeze up.

This can happen easily if USB disconnected, loose contact while you transferring files. Once that happen the player keep on looping around start up message (initializing message) and you have to throw it away without any hardware faults in it.Search the net (keyword: \`initializing problem sansa'), you will find lot of unfortunate people like me with dead player.This is defiantly a good player, if there is no such a fatal bug in it.

It works great for a very finite time, and then is useless. I've owned 3 of these, in total -- one of which SanDisk sent to replace a broken unit. All 3 of them had the same problem: the point where the headphones plug-in to the unit becomes loose, causing the headphones to crackle and drop-out. This product is as sensitive as a hot-house orchid -- which is no good, considering it's designed for travel.Additionally, this is a second-generation of the original. This current model has less features, and is not as user-friendly.Beware this product -- it is a VERY short love affair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars...","review":"Please, if you purchase this mp3 player, use it for more than three months before you write a review.

However, after three months it gave me the error \\"Not enough space for music DB.\\" The mp3 player was not close to being full. After reading the solutions from Sansa and trying to implement them, I am still left with the error reading. (The only thing I haven't tried is formatting with a Mac.

You can read about problems with this unit on multiple forum. I happened to buy one of those for my niece. For some reason this thing stopped working after 2 days of use. It would get stuck on the initial Sansa screen and nothing could be done to reset it. Windows XP did not see it so it was impossible to change firmware.

I like the long battery live, I didn't have to change the battery after 3 or 4 days of usage.The only bug I hate is when I transfer audio tracks from my PC to the player, it changed some title and artist's name for few tracks (each transfer is on few different tracks). Since you can't make any changes when the sound tracks is on the player, nor can you set a \\"playlist\\" on the player, so when I transfer an audio book to the player, it is not playing in the order of the chapters for the book. Because of this bug, I have to double check the title name every time after a transfer and write down the tracks that the name has been changed and later on manually play the tracks in the order of the eAudio book.I assume people use this player for individual soundtrack doesn't care about this, but for me and people who use it for playing eAudio book will hate this player."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for a few months","review":"I rated this item in January 4 stars for its good aspects. Now I would edit my star rating to 1.5 stars. I brought this in December as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is 11. It is easy to use, small so it fits in her jeans pocket, but it is NOT reliable by any means. It worked great for January and February, but then froze (like many other people's Sansas from reading the reviews). I did contact SanDisk directly, who walked me through some trouble-shooting, which also did not work. They sent out a new one, after giving me a free shipping label to send back the frozen Sansa, and I received the new Sansa with a differnt version of software on it yesterday (March 21). I had to contact SanDisk again because the player would not accept any subscription songs, but they walked through that solution, and thus far it is working. Buyer beware - check the version you receive/buy as some seem good while others not so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv it","review":"This is my first mp3 player. I bought this brand because I use their cf memory cards in my digital camera and I've been very happy with their performance. So far I am very pleased with this product's ease of use and sound quality. I took it out of the box, hooked it up to my computer and had 90 songs on it in less than 5 min. The controls took almost a second to figure out... but were pretty simple. The sound quality issues that a few reviewers mentioned have not come to my attention yet and I'm very picky. I believe it all depends on the bit rate you used when you ripped your songs. go for a higher bit rate, you won't get as many songs on your player but the quality difference is worth it. As for the build quality and longevity of the product, I guess I'll just have to wait and let time do it's thing before I can have a strong opinion about either. All in all I think this is a great product for the price. Ignore the nitpickers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This MP3 player is great. I wanted an MP3 player that would hold all of the music I like, but I didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars for one that had more space than I'd ever need. This one is such a great price, it has great sound, and it holds a LOT of music. I have put on many CD's and I still have space for more. I love that it runs off of one AAA battery too. The only thing I don't like is that is doesn't come with a lanyard, which I'd prefer over the arm band. The headphones are fine too. I've heard a lot of complaints about the headphones that come with MP3 players, but I don't mind these at all. Great deal!! I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use.

I much prefer the low-end Creative products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this mp3!","review":"This mp3 player has been nothing but trouble within hours out of the box. First, the screen became perma-'frozen up' within about 2 hours of getting it up and running. Second, it is less than cooperative when it comes to turning off OR on. Third, it will not sync up to my computer when i connect the USB cable to my computer. Maybe I bought yet another 'lemon', but I would certainly not ever buy this product ever again. On the upside, it comes with a lot of neat add-ons like an arm band, a cute protective cover and the sound & volume quality was pretty good...for the very short amount of time i was able to listen to the FM stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 3 times, Defective 3 times","review":"I bought 1, it was defective - before the first battery was used up problem arose - after playing for about 45 minutes the lock mechanism would activate no matter where the switch was, removing battery and putting back in would not get it working, it would die and usually work again after the next morning.Amazon was kind enough to let me return it. Since the price was so great I decided to give the item another shot. Got another one and the same thing happened. Died before first battery with lock pproblem. Amazon let me return it again. I decided to go for the 2GB model, since the price can't be beat and figuring maybe that will have a better design. The 2gb model has just died before the first battery and it is DEAD DEAD.

Then I went home wanting to transfer more but was unable to do so. Windows Explorer couldn't see the mp3s that I had previously downloaded onto the player. I could only download music whenever I was at work. Then managing the library was another problem. I had a folder for every album and I downloaded the folders onto the player yet the songs were all mixed up.So I bought an 8GB Creative Zen which is much easier to work with. Also, I found that 1GB was not enough space to hold what I had. I'd give the Sansa away but even with the startup CD I don't think the new owner would be able to delete the songs I have on it since I can only get the library to come out on my work computer.2 stars for ease of navigation and having an FM radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bookmarking not reliable","review":"If you just play music or listen to the radio, it is a good buy.

I also like that you can scroll through all your songs instead of having to skip through all of them (it is a great time saver). Once you understand how to load songs on to your Sansa it is really easy and does not take much time at all.

It's small and compact, easy to operate, havent had a problem with it since I got it. It doesnt eat up batteries unlike most electronics, I've changed the battery once since I bought it a month and a half ago. I listen to it to and from work and I couldnt have chosen a better MP3 player. If your looking for a simple MP3 player without useless features, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor for OverDrive Audio Books","review":"I purchased this to use with my local library's OverDrive Audio Books. So far, this device doesn't work with the long .wma files. For instance, if you listen to 50 minutes of an hour long track, you are unable to restart correctly at the 50 minute mark (using the pause button... also, there is not a \\"bookmark\\" option on this device). I'm giving it away and plan on buying a better audio device.I don't use it for music... it's probably just fine for that type of usage.I'm in dialog with the SanDisk support team. (Updating the FirmWare, making sure the settings are correct for proper \\"resume\\" after pausing, etc.) If I get a real solution to this problem, I will change my review... but, for now, I would not recommend this device to anyone wanting to listen to audio books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"This is a nice, lightweight little player but be careful - SanDisk is not truthful about what support is offered for various formats. I have had serious issues playing back audio files in wma format. I spent many hours with SanDisk tech support resolving possible causes. Initially they blamed the bit rate, but with some work I was able to transfer files with a sampling rate within their spec. Finally, I was told that wma would not play correctly at all (it will skip or not support fast forward or rewind) - it is a 'known issue.' They will not authorize a return or a credit for another model in spite of the fact that they advertise full support for wma. This company is not truthful in the product spec they present, so buy at your own risk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durability problem. Think it as \\"disposable\\".","review":"Big durability problem. It worked great for first 3 months. Then it's dead. The button doesn't respond. There are nine independent \\"push\\" bottons, Much easier to navigate than ipod. I hated ipod's \\"touch-sensitive\\" button. To transfer (non-copy-right-protected) MP3 files (but not MPEG4), you don't even need to launch MP3 application (MusicMatch, itune etc), which makes file-transfer much faster and easier. Very light, you can drop it thousands times, and it never breaks. It works like a removable USB drive (You need to go to Menu>Setting>USB> to change Auto to MSB. Manual doesn't explain this!) You can also use this as a USB thumb drive. You don't need to install driver either. The only caveat is a poor written manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"This is my second MP3 player (Rio was the first) and third media player (also own the Ipod Shuffle). I gave a four star because while it was working, it was great. I used the Sansa at work often because of the choice of the radio and music. I replaced the earphones for one with a longer cord because the one included in the package was short and got in the way of my work routine. After a year, the player started acting strange when I tried to transport music. I got SanDisk's assistance to re-format the drive. But now it will only hold 10-11 songs saying that it's full. I could return it to have it service but for the cost, I may as well get a new one. This is just another MP3 player that doesn't last forever. I don't want to plunk down the big buck but for as many Mp3 players I've replaced, I'm considering an Ipod Classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love my mp3 player!","review":"This is my first mp3 player.

If I was lucky, I could get it to play -- only to have the volume control automatically turn the volume down after 3-4 seconds of play (almost like playing a CD in preview mode). I was SURE this was the one-in-a-million unit that was defective and didn't hesitate to call for a replacement (which Amazon replaced in two days). I was pleased with the player until I discovered that the \\"Select\\" button wouldn't bring up the playlist or add to favorites - which renders the player useless, in my opinion. So - my experience with the M240 has not been good at all.I liked the look and feel of the unit as well as the way it fit in my shirt pocket, virtually weightless.

I only had mine for a month before it started randomly turning off by itself for no reason at all. I use rechargable batteries and the cause is not because the batteries are dead. The cause is also not because I accidently hit the power off switch, because you must hold down the power switch for 5 seconds in order for it to shut off.

I have no complaints thus far. except I have these very awkward headphones that, when you put them in your pocket with the player, they turn the player onright away, and that is an easy way to lose battery life. I solved that problem by putting the player in one pocket and putting the headset in another pocket. Another complaint I have is the stopwatch. That feature eats up battery life in a hurry as well (see my discussion at the bottom of the page for details. My story about this problem is there). If I had to ever replace this product, you'd bet I'd get the same brand, because I am having good luck with this thing so far! Loading and reformatting this thing to add songs is very easy to do. I mostly use WMP because I figure it's the easiest to do. (Windows Media Player). Well, I hoped this helped. 4 months ago this month I got this thing (March 8th, 2007).

However, my first one locked up after about 3 weeks. No problem with a no receipt swap at Staples. However, looking on Sandisk site today, noticed firmware updates for it. Very easy to do. You can download a firmware installer onto your comuter, and then everytime you plug the player into the computer, if internet connected, it will search for latest firmware. Two had been issued since I got mine at Christmas. It quickly installed the latest on my player. Hopefully, this firmware corrects the lockup problem. I noticed better sound and separation also I believe. It said that installing the firmware would delete the songs presently loaded, so back them up. However, it didn't. I'm glad to see Sandisk actively supporting their products, even the less expensive ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk...........","review":"I researched many mp3 players and read many reviews before purchasing this one.

All the screen will say is Sansa m240 1.0GB. It will do nothing else. I put in a brand new battery and still nothing. When I connect it to my computer it will not even detect it. My aunt purchased the same mp3 player for her son. He used his for about a month. It quit working about the same time mine did. It does the exact same thing mine is doing.

It would try to play a song that was not even there. I sent mine back to Amazon today and requested a refund of money. I do not want to even mess with getting another item from SanDisk. After reading other reviews, it seems that a replacement is just another headache waiting to happen. My daughter is disappointed, she wanted an ipod, but I went the cheap route and bought this thing.

First, it was a pain in the rear to get it to connect to the computer (Win XP; WMP 11). Once I installed some driver updates, it connected. I moved a number of songs over to the device and only a handful actually played. I kept getting a message saying that I needed to upgrade my subscription (Why? All the music was from my own CDs!). So, I deleted all the songs and tried it on a different computer. Everything seemed to work just right: connected on first try and moved songs onto the device with no trouble.

Media Player want's to make everything \\"automatic\\" such as searching all your drives so it is hard for someone like me who just wants to pull a single file and put it on my MP3 player.This, however, was something I could live with.What killed the deal was that more often than not, I would get errors in trying to sync or messages such as \\"cannot change sync options at this time\\".Finally, I hand enough and went back to a MUVO 100 which served me well until I decide to wash it in the washing machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant recommend this item...","review":"I wouldnt recommend this item.

I've had this for about 5 months now and never had one problem. The only thing that I wish this had was you cannot delete songs from the player which can be a nusance if your computer stops wanting to reading the songs on it, but other than that it is a perfect mp3 player for the music lover. About the battery life, I suggest you spend a few bucks and buy a pack of sony mp3 player AAA batteries. I did and one battery lasts for 3 months of above average use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this product because I wanted to read books downloaded from the public library. Unfortunately the downloaded books played back erratically, skipping and without control to navigate within sections.

I called Sansa and they kept me occupied with various \\"fixes\\" until I exhausted the possibilities - and myself - at which time a supervisor told me that this was a known problem, and basically that its my tough luck.

After reading the reviews I realized this is pretty common. The good news is Amazon has been great about the return and now refund.I would recommend anyone who wants an MP3 player that works for more than a few days to look elsewhere.

It is easy to use, sounds great, and runs for many hours on a single AAA battery. At first, I was worried about the apparently flimsiness of the buttons, but they've worked well and show no signs of wear or trouble. The radio works great and tends to get better reception than my car radio. The audio recorder is little more than functional -- it saves your recordings as low-quality, mono WAV files. This is fine for recording reminders or even basic conversations if you needed some sort of record, but don't count on them for making podcasts or video voiceovers. Nevertheless, it is a solid audio player, and I've been pleased enough with mine to purchase two more as gifts for Christmas this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best MP3 player with a reasonable price","review":"Pros: I bought this Sansa MP3 player on the black Friday of 2007.

You can select option to play by genre, song, playlist, or album...I didn't expect these so convenient functionalities with such a cheap MP3 player like this. Awesome!Cons: Doesn't have a rechargeable battery.

The only problem we have is that it locks up once in awhile, but usually if you turn it off and then turn it back on it resolves the problem. We also have it almost full of songs so that could be why it locks up sometimes. It holds about 250 songs.

The ear buds are inadequate, but I'm having a hard time finding any really good earphones, so I wasn't surprised. I am just now changing the battery (one AAA), and am VERY surprised that I've played as much music as I have on one little battery.

The quality of sound and 5 preset eq. settings are sweet and your bound to get the right mix for your style of music. The led display is a cool blue and it's easy to read and cycle thru the menu's. I managed to stuff this player with (281) .WMA files at a bit rate of 128bps when transferred, even tho it's advertised to hold (480) .wma's, i prefer sound quality to quantity. I mean c'mon 281 songs is alot anyways, unless your planning a trip to mars, or you want your sound quality to decrease by recording your tunes at 64bps or less. Not me.

When it was turned back on it locked up in the initializing screen and wont do anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy!","review":"Bought this for my mother who is not very computer savy. I like the fact that you can plug the unit into your computer and drag your music/files to the player. You don't have to use software such as ITunes or Windows Media Player if you don't want too. Sound quality is good and unit is fairy easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"SanDisk MP3 Player","review":"I ordered these for Christmas gifts and all 3 were defective; reordered and 2 more are defective. Recipients were very unhappy"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: NEW UNITS PERMANENTLY FREEZE","review":"Ignore all of the rave reviews and read the \\"freeze\\" email threads further down on the product page under \\"Customer Discussion\\". It seems that newly produced units freeze shortly after their first use. My unit froze after about three weeks. When I now put a battery in and turn it on it does the following:Screen 1: light comes on, and says \\"Sandisk initializing\\", then moves to screen 2Screen 2: no light, says \\"V4.0.44R sansa m340 1.0GB\\" it freezes here, regardless of pushing buttons or connecting the USB. It can't even shut off without removing the battery.Exactly the same scenario occurs when I hook it to the USB without the battery. Unfortunately, I'm past the 1 month return, plus I threw out the box. It's surprizing that Amazon is still selling the item in view of how pervasive this problem is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good MP3 player","review":"I wanted a player that connects to any computer easily and plays MP3's. I checked out the other SanDisk Sansa m240 1 GB MP3 Player listed on Amazon for almost $80.00 and after reading the reviews, I decided to buy it. Luckily, I found the same player FOR $20!!!!I received my order in 5 days, plugged it into my laptop, drag and dropped my Files onto the Sansa and DONE!!! Too easy!!!I like the fact that no software is required although the order includes a disk (not sure what's on there) and that you don't need to charge the player. Just put the AAA battery in and you're good to go.This is a pretty good, simple (no fuss) MP3 player especially for under $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't by this product","review":"This player is unpredictable and difficult to use. You can't transfer MP3 files directly to it and you must use Windows Media Player to manage it. Often actual songs end up not matching titles or not playing at all. It won't load an MP3 file not related to a CD, ie a sound file in MP3 format. It goes through a battery a week. This product should have a rating of minus 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES you can use PLAYLISTS from Windows Media Player!!","review":"WMP will sync only the songs if you sync MANUALLY, but if you use WMP's AUTOMATIC syncing, then the playlists themselves (as well as the songs) get put onto the device (note that WMP still doesn't SHOW that the playlists are on the device, but they are definitely there and can be used)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac owners beware","review":"I used the m240 with my Mac. it shows up on the desktop as a folder and you can drag mp3 files onto it. it worked in a very basic way, though you couldn't order the files in any way, and due to the way macs name files, for every one file I dragged on, 2 entries would appear on the player. After a while, the player froze at startup and i couldn't restart it. I ended up returning it and getting an ipod nano which coordinated so much better with my mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless for non-music files","review":"I primarily listen to spoken work programs - audio books and radio shows. If you do this as well, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER. It does not have any resume feature, whatsoever. If you turn it off, you must manually fast forward or rewind to your stopping point. To make it worse, those rewind/fast forward speeds are horribly slow without any menu options to change those speeds. I had the eariler Sandisk 1mb player and it was a much better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails completely for Audiobooks","review":"Sansa has a known problem with audio files over 10 minutes long. I was unable to keep my place if I turned it off, I could not fast forword to where I left off. Completely unusable for Audiobooks. Also the first one I bought had a broken volume control which only allowed me to turn the volume down. I had great luck with an older 512MB version of this player but I had nothing but bad luck with the newer version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supports standards - USB connection, AAA battery","review":"I have owned the 1 GB M240 and the 2GB M250 and love them both. Use them mostly for listening to podcasts and while exercising.Works well with Songbird, or simple drag and drop files directly on the player. Also nice that this uses a standard USB-miniUSB cable to connect to the PC.This player supports so many standards that I can take it anywhere and get data from any machine.Buying 2 more extras for when these go out of production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution - 1,000 File Limit","review":"This may seem like plenty, but I listen to voice tracks of about 3 minutes in length recorded at 32kbps mp3. I have another 1gb size mp3 player from IRiver which I can fill with about 1240 tracks. This Sansa only allows me 1,000 (or 999, one or the other).Pretty specialized requirement I know, but still it requires me to either combine tracks (way too much hassle) or lose 100-200 mb of capacity on the player. As I bought this for my daughter I am really disappointed.I really hope this might be addressed in a firmware upgrade...Other than that, it's really simple to use as long as you're careful with your MP3 tags and loading using Windows explorer. I also have the 512mb M230 Sansa which I like, but did not give me any clue that there might be a file limit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could","review":"This is the worst mp3 player I've ever used. I had a creative nano before which was decent and I also have the nano gen 3. I got this to play ebooks which were protected WMA files from the overdrive media console. On power up again it plays the track from the very beginning and not where I stopped before and for this reason I always have to remember where I left off. To make matters worse it doesn't even remember how long a track is and an hour track sometimes shows as only 30 min and 1 hour 30 min at other times. I wanna put this sansa mp3 player in the trash. Keep away and look at the competition. Get a zune or an ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG durability problem","review":"I bought two of these...one for my wife, and one for me. Mine died after a couple of months. Everything was fine until then. My wife's is still working, but you can't trust this thing to continue to work. Sound quality was good, interface was good, etc. The manual though STINKS and needs to be rewritten. So, anyway, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you'll get one that works, maybe not","review":"We purchased one of these as a Christmas gift for our son. After spending the time to load almost 200 songs, the unit froze up two days after Christmas. Thinking we may have just gotten a bad one, Amazon overnighted us a replacement. The second unit froze up before getting to listen to it, but after spending the time to upload 175 songs. We had already performed the factory recommended firmware update, to no avail. I believe that all the units that were manufactured for the Christmas rush are likely bad. We're getting ready to try unit number three...we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Freeze Up","review":"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my kids. Just like numerous other reviews, one froze up on the sansa screen after a couple days. Amazon exchanged it without hassle and the replacement froze up with the same problem within hours. There are definitely issues with this player and I would not buy it. I am going to return both and purchase a different player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk Times TWO","review":"DO NOT PURCHASE this player, it is a piece of garbage! The first one I had froze after two days, so I returned it thinking it was just a lemon. When the replacement unit they sent froze after three days, I knew that I was dealing with a low quality product, totally unreliable. What sucks, too, is that there was no compensation from Amazon for the time and effort I had to put in to find a box (twice), pack it all in there (twice) and wait to hear about a replacement (twice). I am going to buy the real thing next time (iPod) because you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Player purchased new doesn't work","review":"I purchased this product newly as a gift for my sister, but after uploading the songs, the menu doesn't show up and there is no other way of interacting with it later. Moreover, it doesn't even get detected by the computer after connecting it using the USB cable. It worked once, but that's it. Afterwards, it just refuses to respond!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAVEAT EMPTOR!","review":"The player worked as advertised for nearly two weeks, then as with other reviewers, it froze on the start-up screen and would not respond at all! Also regardless of the player having failed I would have hoped to have purchased a better designed player. Overall the modest price is no consolation!*update* I mailed this item back to Amazon on Jan 4 via USPS and Amazon confirmed receiving it on Jan 12. After two emails and one phone call I finally received my refund on Feb 14! I will never purchase from Amazon again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item!!!!","review":"We bought three of these for the teens. We where going to get the iPOD Nano but figured for a few bucks cheaper they could have a screen to seen the songs, as well as the AM/FM radio.

Definitely DON'T want another SanDisk product!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME PROBLEMS!! FROZEN AFTER 1 DAY!!","review":"Same exact problem, worked great at first, songs sounded great etc. next day froze on the start up screen. Would do nothing.

Sure Sandisk is going to replace my broken player, but I really don't want to use a player that obviously doesn't last longer than three months.Their product support website is terrible as well and their customer service agents are nearly useless...I will never buy another Sandisk product and caution you to avoid this company as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I bought this player but it stopped working after one month of using. As I saw it is not the first feedback like that. I strongly recommend not to bue such players if you do not want to waste about $60"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Total garbage. Bought one for someone for a gift. After a few weeks it would freeze at the home screen and not play anything. Did a replacement through Amazon and got a new one in a few days. The new one did the same thing in another few weeks. It has barley been a month and we went through two of them already. This time I am returning it for a refund. Stay away from this piece of garbage.Also when it was working, it cannot play any VBR encoded MP3s. I had to re-encode everything so they would not skip and pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - While It Worked","review":"I realize that mine is just one experience among many, but be aware that my unit simply ceased functioning about three weeks after purchase. I thought at first that the batteries simply needed replacement, but the problem remained even after a fresh cell.On attempting to power up, the unit would flash a display very briefly, then shut down again.I don't know how ubiquitous this problem might be - there are always \\"lemons\\" among the sweet apples - but Caveat Emptor, nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"mp 3 player","review":"When I 1st got the player the volume button was stuck on Loud, and that was my only complaint. All I wanted was to switch it out to another one, But anyways' You can not turn it down at all.

Terrible Customer Service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work with downloading audio book","review":"I specifically bought this in order to listen to audio books downloaded from the library (free) or rented from a company [...] but after almost 3 hours on the phone with tech support, it still was not able to download and play audio books in the \\"wma\\" format. So, I had to return it. I did, however, purchase another MP3 player from Sansa called \\"Sansa Clip\\" and that works perfectly. They were about the same low price, so if you need an MP3 player for the purpose of listening to audio books, get the Sansa Clip [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This player is awful. It froze one month after purchase, leading to replacement from Sandisk. Upon receipt, the second player began a four month decline. Sound would come and go during playback, from full volume, to no volume, to everywhere in between. Finally, it died as well. I'm not wasting my time to see if Sandisk will replace it -- it's not worth my time.A second nuisance is that the sports arm band is made for weightlifters! I'm an average sized person, BMI right in the middle of normal, and the armband would not go tight enough to keep a snug fit during physical activity. Overall, it just seems like Sandisk put very little thought and testing into this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware - many of them are defective","review":"A lot of these players were on Thanksgiving sale @ BestBuy in November 2006. There were a lot of defective items because I had to exchange it twice; no one worked; and a lot of peope were in line for refund.So, be aware - quality is not good. I guess that in 2005 they were much better than now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as expected","review":"I bought this one after after reading all the nice reviews here.

Like so many other reviewers, my device simply froze up one day for no reason after it had been working perfectly. I've traded emails with SanDisk tech support for about two weeks and even sought help from my company's IT department and it has been established that the device is \\"defective\\" and apparently, a replacement is on the way.

Customer support for North America (866)726-3475"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little mp3 player.","review":"This was my first mp3 player and I was worried that it might be difficult to transfer songs and that the sound quality wouldn't be very good, but I have been VERY happy with it. I was amazed at how fast the songs transfered to the player from my computer - in fact I was worried that I did it wrong because I couldn't believe it transfered them so fast. The sound is very clear, even better than my Sony Discman and the radio tuner also comes in very handy. It's very small and compact and would easily fit in a pocket.I agree with some reviewers that the instruction manual wasn't very helpful, but I really didn't even use it. If you just play around with it you'll learn everything about it in no time. You can also go to the Sandisk website and find better instructions there if you need them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 4 the $","review":"Point #1 I paid only $70 for it @ a \\"Black Friday\\" sale. Having said that, I only have 2 criticisms. First, the battery door is destined to come off or break due to the rather flimsy construction of the tab used to secure the door. Second, playlists are not so easy as one might think (when you sync a list it only syncs the songs not the list). You can create playlists for the device in WMP and save them to it since it recognizes the device as a drive. Other than that, sounds great, plays WMA's (which some say are a higher quality file than MP3 while taking up the same amount of memory), MP3's and other files. Loud enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"I used to have an Ipod shuffle and I think I like this Sansa better. You can see what you're listening to and skip to the next song. The sound is great and the buttons are easy to find. No comment about the headphones, I use my Sony ones. The download was much easier than ipod. Just click and drag. The one thing I don't like is that there is no way to hang this one around your neck. I got used to that before and now strapping it to my arm with the included elastic feels weird. The best part is no charging!! I have used it almost daily for two weeks and haven't changed the battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 10 months.","review":"I've had this MP3 player for about 10 months and it just stopped working. I've had problems with it the entire time I've owned it. When I first filled it with songs, it worked fine a few times, then it started to skip over songs. It just wouldn't play certain songs. A few months ago, I deleted everything, reformatted it and put new songs on it. All the songs played for a day, then it started to skip certain songs. It would play a split second of a song, then go to the next one. Half the songs played fine, half of them would get skipped over.Then, three days ago, it wouldn't turn on. I changed the battery, but it wouldn't do anything. I pushed all the buttons, messed around with it for a few minutes, but it wouldn't do anything. So now it's in the gargage. Also, every once in a while it would just turn off on me. A buddy of mine has the blue one, and he said it turns off on him often. This was my first experience with SanDisk, and I certainly won't be having another."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Reasons why SanDisk MP3 is better than the iPod","review":"I evaluated MP3 players for a while - and at $45 this Sansa M240 player was a steal! The iPod certainly has its advantages (and a ton of marketing!), but here are the top 5 reasons why I prefer this MP3 player:1) FM Stereo - can program upto 20 channels - iPod does not!2) Rip songs from any CD3) Load songs in about ANY format (MP3, WMA, etc)4) Buy/download songs from FREE from any MP3 website (iTunes??)5) AAA battery - can buy it anywhere - no need for special charger!6) Portable - I can play this in the car with a CD adapter - the iPod needs a special contraption ($$$) to play in the car stereo....okay, so maybe 6 reasons......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine with Linux with MP3 bitrates below 128K","review":"I bought this MP3 player at Office Depot on sale. I am able to use it successfully with SUSE Linux 9.3. I can transfer a 200MB file in 75 seconds so the USB 2.0 interface works well. The one problem with this player is it will not play MP3s with bit rates over 128K for MP3 files. Since I have many at 192K this is a severe limitation. I contacted SanDisk technical support and they confirmed that they do no support MP3's over 128K and Windows format over 64K. I would try another product next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"same problem","review":"like many other posts already listed, I had the same problem. I got this for my 14 yr old daughter, as an alternative to the expensive IPod. The reviews on it looked really great.

This one (the first player I've owned) sounds great and is easy to use. The only negative thing about it is its inability to play playlists that I created on my computer and then loaded to the SanDisk. It ignores folders and playlists dumped onto it and plays the songs individually or gives me the option to create playlists on the player itself which seems to be more cumbersome than doing it on the computer. --Gary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad customer service","review":"I recieved my mp3 players which were suppose to be silver.

I really wanted an mp3 player that had an FM tuner so he could utilize it at the gym. The first time he attempted to load the device with music it locked up and would not let him do anything further. I spent several hours troubleshooting and only found other people with similar problems and no help from the manufacturer that worked. At this time I am having trouble getting SanDisk to respond to my support requests so there is a chance I may not even be able to get it returned.

I took no notice because the computer was still working like normal. So, I took off most of the songs and tried to start the player again, but to no avail. Then, we turned the computer off and it never came back on. So many internal components were fried and I needed to buy a brand new computer. Amazon replaced the bad player but I am afraid to use it. This product costed me a lot of money and it deserves less than one star. Do not buy this unless you are planning on wasting your money on a brand new computer.

When you look at the pictures of the sansa, you assume It is going to be somewhat thin, but not as thin as the ipod nano. Sadly, you will be mistaken because it is FAT has heck. The radio and voice recording are awful and produce poor quality sound and static. Also, what's up with the battery cover? It looked loose and it shooked. The plastic material used to make the sansa looked and felt extremely cheap and non-durable.It's not worth it. In less than a day, I returned the sansa to circuit city and brought the ipod nano."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY that's lasted 5 years strong","review":"Update: 08-09-2012It's still going!

Then when i click on the play button, and choose between artist, song, and all that... the only option will be the name of the song that it was about to play when it stopped.... so i have to turn it off, and turn it back on... it happens very often! So... don't buy it refurbished!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"At nearly $90, the M240 isn't worth it. Very cheaply constructed, it will break easily. Sandisk support is absolutely no help at all. My M240 broke within one week of purchase (the on/off/power button depresses, but nothing happens. Essentially, the player will not turn on ever again.) My first email, I explained precisely what had gone wrong. The response? Please make sure you've formatted the player correctly. After another three emails, they finally understood that it was broken and I was told \\"Tough.\\" It sits on my desk as a reminder to not purchase SanDisk products again.The player itself is light-weight and has lots of cool features, but it is so cheaply constructed that the odds of an accidental breakage are extremely high, and when that happens, you'll be out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth its weight in songs!","review":"I bought this player about 2 years ago and use it 3-5 times a week at the gym. It takes its share of abuse and keeps on going. The sound is great and the software that comes with it is fairly easy to use compared to the Rio MP3 player that this replaced after less than 90 days! In my opinion, iPods are overrated and a BIG marketing gimmic. If you're looking for a tough, basic but great sounding player that will last, I would highly recommend this player."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a fairly inexpensive 1 GB mp3 player...","review":"It does a good job, for the most part. I love this brand, but I wouldn't buy this particular player again. It can't hold very many songs, and the user manual seemed to be lacking in explanations for some things(like the voice recorder option, which I still haven't figured out). I like that it has a built-in FM radio, and the earphones are pretty comfortable. Most other earphones don't fit in my ears, but these ones are nice and padded(you have to put the pads on yourself though, which got a tad bit frustrating). Overall, a nice, cute, little mp3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable.","review":"I bought one of these exactly 29 days ago to replace a more expensive Sansa e270 player that I dropped (while travelling at 70mph... oops).Figured I'd find a cheap Sansa player in case I drop it again. However, after 29 days (used approximately 14 hours), I went through one new AA battery, then halfway through another battery. Then, I couldn't play mp3's anymore. About thirty minutes later, the radio quit, as well. Deleting all the MP3s then writing a new MP3 back seems to have fixed it, but not without a fair amount of resetting to factory settings. Also had random power offs for no apparent reason (irritating when traveling at 70mph on a motorcycle)So, it eats batteries, and loses data every 15 hours or so.Maybe good starter MP3 player for a kid who's going to replace everything every week or so anyway. Not so good for me.You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave the Ipods at the North Pole--bring home a Sansa!!","review":"My 1 gb player has seen heavy use for a year, and never given me any trouble.

But, I just use it to listen to books and it is very annoying that it won't save my place unless I turn it off. The pause doesn't last long and loses your place in the book so I can't use it. Since the tracks for books are so long you might have to listen again or just turn it on and let it play to the point where you were.

The Creative Zen V and V+ have a much brighter display, are much more compact than the M240, and can display color photos at good resolution (the M240 can't display any photos at all), yet they're also compatible with Napster-To-Go. I'd recommend either of the Creative Zen V/V+ models over the SanDisk M240.The Play For Sure designation for MP3 players, and its logo on this particular MP3 player, don't guarantee it'll work for a Napster-To-Go subscription. Fortunately, the M200 series of MP3 players from SanDisk (including the M240) do work with Napster-To-Go so you can legally download an unlimited number of songs to up to 3 PCs and up to 3 MP3 players in one household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"This product was good at first but then stopped working soon after...

On the fourth night I set the sleep timer for 15 minutes and drifted off to beautiful music. The next day, I discovered that it would not turn on, or off, so I changed the battery to no avail. Not wanting to give up, I called Sandisk customer support and after I upgraded firmware and followed all instruction by a very patient, polite rep, we gave up, and he suggested I send it back to Amazon.

It was just what he wanted (yippee for Mom!), and worked great -- for a little over 2 weeks. Then it froze up on the initial screen. Nothing we tried worked.

The same goes for the other one I purchased. I highly advise anyone not to buy this one if you are in the market for a mp3 player.

Had I known that Now Design would cheapen the fabric quality I would have ordered a lifetime supply back when I made my first purchase. The original Floursack towel is the best for absorption and finish, and durable in spite of its lack of bulk in the towel drawer. These new towels I just received are pathetically thin. If you hold them up to the light you can see right through. Not true with my older towels. How much did you save Now Design by eliminating that extra thread or two woven throughout the towel? you've lost this loyal customer.

From the moment our three year old opened these blocks on his birthday, they were played with and fought over by all three kids. All of his other presents were forgotten about as he and his big brother and sister started building towers. It was such a great moment as a parent! I knew that we had made the right decision on his gift.We have had these for a little over a week and they are still loving everything about the blocks and build tunnels, buildings, towers, and fences for their animals. I absolutely love the quality of these blocks, they are durable and will last for years. In fact, I just ordered another set for our oldest son so they can build bigger towers and buildings.I think that every child should own a set (or more!) of these amazing blocks, it is money well spent and a fantastic value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many, many hours of building enjoyment","review":"My four year old son loves these blocks. I am so thankful he enjoys something that does not make noise, speak back to him, or tell him what to think.He received this set Christmas 2009 and built something almost every day since. Christmas 2010 he received the architectural blocks, which he also enjoys very much. I love that he thinks and creates his own designs, learning patience, concentration, attention to detail, symmetry, and the science and art of design.The blocks are wood, very durable; I expect them to last beyond his childhood. The only thing I don't like is the blocks are not made in America--other than that, definitely a five star item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa and Doug wooden blocks","review":"The only way to improve this collection would be to have a removable cover on the box.

His Mom says he plays with the blocks all the time. I saw the set in the store though and thought there were too few blocks to really keep a kid interested for long. Mom says she has no room for more blocks. But from my experience as a mother of 3 [now adult], a teacher, and a grandmother, i think at least 2 sets are needed. These blocks will last for future generations. free shipping was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, but smells strange","review":"The kids love it. Everyone should grow up with blocks such as these!! However, I think the box is cheaply made, and some of the beveled edges are a little more rounded than others. I don't think that is on purpose either. I'm very picky about my wooden products, though, as I know firsthand how they should be made. Great Christmas gift for a bitesized loved one nevertheless.I love Melissa & Doug products because they seem sturdier and more well made than other toys. However, I am saddened that they have finally outsourced to China. This product smells strange, and it isn't a natural smell. I'm sure it will wear off soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my son","review":"My son (3 yr old) loved it. He plays with it almost every day.

They are great. My 8 and 10 year old play with them just as often as my younger two. Just like the blocks found in a school setting, very durable and the wooden box they come in in perfect for building on top of if flipped over or for sitting in if you are little enough. I might even buy another set since 60 blocks is perfect for 1 child but once they start wanting to build towers high enough to touch 9 foot ceilings . . . you need more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three-Year Old Loves Them","review":"I purchased these blocks for my 3-year old nephew for his birthday two months ago and he is still playing with them.

Open ended, they create whatever they want. The only thing I wish, is that there were more of them. Believe it or not, 60 pieces is not enough.They are big, which is a huge plus and seem to be solid wood. I have read the rewies about the filler, but ave to disagree. Maybe they have upgraded them since that review.Very highly recommend.Just beware, they are very heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love these blocks","review":"I purchased this set of blocks for my son June of 2009, he is now almost 3 years old.

The two boys love building a high tower, and of course then knocking it down. They are very sturdy and have given us no problems. I love that the blocks come in their own box, which is also very sturdy. My son will empty the blocks out and then play with the box itself.

I loved that the box it comes in acts as its box to keep the blocks organized. When you put the blocks away you have to arrange them to fit so its even a game to put them back.

Great for building things even with a smaller child who is learning.The container seems like it might be harder to use based on the fact that the blocks are packed so tight.

It has turned out to be quite easy actually to get these back in the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellissa & Doug 60-piece Standard unit blocks","review":"I bought the Unit blocks for my grandson Toby, who came to visit for the holidays from London, he spend many hours buildingnew structures and buildings.

I did notice a chemical type odor upon opening the package and it isn't true solid wood. It has the california 93120 compliant for formaldehyde phase 2 sticker on it. It is made in Thailand so at least its not China.I wound up getting the PlanToys Plan Preschool 50 Unit Blocks, much better quality IMO. They are real hard wood with absolutely no odor. No it doesn't come with a storage box but I will use my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom of twins","review":"I was happy with this product over all. The design on it and none of the blocks were rough or had any edges that felt like it might come apart and leave slivers in the skin. That was my main concern besides my boys throwing them at each other. I have twins that are two years of age and they love these blocks. I felt the price was decent for the quality and quantity plus i couldnt find anything like this in stores, I had been searching for anything they could build with that wasnt small enough to put in there mouths and the huge lego sets come with like 6 large pieces and to buy two of them would be pricey and the pieces wouldnt be enough to satisfy my two boys cause they would fight over them. So over all i personally love this item and it comes in handy for me cause there is enough for the two of my boys to play with together and it helps them learn to balance and stack pieces as they grow cause this kind of toy can stick with them over the years unlike many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"60 piece unit blocks","review":"You need to buy two sets..one is not enough.The product has smooth edges, large pieces and very sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TOY","review":"These blocks are a wonderful toy for any child.

I recommend this set of blocks highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bang for your block","review":"My son received these for his first birthday. He is now three and we play with them on an almost daily basis. He's at the point now where he can build a \\"garage\\" and \\"tunnel\\" by himself.

He is just at the age where he is getting into stacking the blocks. I can see the wheels turning as he chooses from the variety of shapes to stack. I am also very pleased with the quality of these blocks. The edges are slightly rounded so that they won't scratch the baby soft skin. And, an extra bonus is the wood box that they come in. Part of the fun with these blocks is putting them away and fitting each one in like a puzzle piece! I know that we will get many years out of these blocks and I look forward to watching my son's creativity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love the blocks","review":"gave them to my 2 year grandson for christmas and he absolutely loves the blocks.

Obviously, splintering wood leads to splinters in the kids' hands, so clearly a bad idea. I'm going to have to sand the pieces down and cover in a finish. The blocks that these replaced had been played with for at least 30 years and had just begun to splinter. I wouldn't have purchased these had I known they would be rough and unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"Great toy! Our kids are very different ages (1 1/2 and 5 1/2) and this toy works well for both of them. The blocks are smooth, have rounded edges, and there is a wide variety of shapes. The only problem, as others have mentioned, is the box. It is cheaply made and our kids want so bad to stand and sit in it, as any kid would. We stop them for it is clear it would break. Also, it would be nice if the box was just a bit deeper. While it is looks great if all the blocks are in order, really, how often is that going to happen? So they always fall out the top, which makes storage a bit of a pain. A slightly deeper box would fix that. But I have other M & D products and have wished those ones had deeper boxes (shaped blocks for beading), so, maybe that is just how they make containers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, simple toy that's made to last!","review":"We bought these blocks for my 2.5 year old son for Christmas.

My son doesn't get bored of them and he plays with them every day.******UPDATE: We've had these blocks for almost a year and they are still wonderful!

However, this is one of the few purchases that my experience is way different than the review.1. For $45, my 3 year old played with it for 15 minutes then moved on to old toys. The blocks in the heavy huge and to me very unnecessary wooden box is just too few and too boring. There is not much you can create with the few pieces of blocks.2. Way over priced. $45 for 15 minutes of fun? I love most baby toys. This is the one I really have no interest at first (second and third) glance.3. A small incidence - One block my son knocked down fell on my toe. I was in severe pain for 10 seconds. Imagine it fell on your baby's toe/finger.If you don't care paying $45 and you buy 10 sets of these, I can imagine this is totally fun. You can build a few projects with the piece. But definitely one box gives you not much to excite about.BTW, I have to complement the quality of the wood.

The box is wooden, and the kid can store the blocks in it, making a neat kit. My three year old grandaughter took to them immediately, and next year we're going to spend Christmas vacation painting them in our very own designs. The blocks are somewhat \\"beveled\\" on the edges, for safety, so it makes it hard to stand them up on carpet. They are best used on a firm surface.

I have no urge to keep playing to see if it gets better, so I probably won't even bother. The controls are VERY clunky, with ever-changing camera angles and restricted cursor motion that make it difficult to navigate. And so far, the story is lame. I bought it because the box references Monkey Island and the old Sierra games, but I have yet to see any of the humor or intrigue of those games. Oh, and there's nothing special about the graphics or voice acting either.I'm starting to think the adventure game really is dead. I kind of feel bad for The Adventure Company. They're single-handedly trying to keep adventure gaming alive, but they keep churning out really bad games.I give this game two stars instead of one because I've barely played it, and maybe it gets better as it goes. But when I'm bored AND frustrated with a game after the first half hour, that's a pretty bad sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Francais","review":"C'est un de mes groupes préféré: le chanteur est excellent et je conseille l'album à tout les fans de musique punk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Drivel","review":"This book is about as comprehensive as reading the back of a cereal box.

Obviusly, when he rented Friday The Thirteenth: The final chapter and Mask in doing his research, he missed him in both of these films. Huh? Where was he, in the bathroom? Stoned?

After the spacecraft's epic voyage out to Jupiter, he focuses upon the astonishing \`fire and ice' moons of volcanic Io and Europa, where there appears to be an ocean beneath a thin shell of ice.Hanlon handles the geological discussion with ease, so this is a highly readable account.

This game is fun if you have a family game night though. The mechanics of the game are very simple. There aren't a lot of rules to learn. There is, however, a decent amount of strategy to it. There is a little resource management, a little bit a reading another players personality, a little bit of card counting/memory skills, and a little bit of planning. Over all there are several aspects of the game that make it rather enjoyable and an easy game to introduce kids to some of the strategy types involved with other games.

A preowned one may cost you around $3.000. Some jewelers tell you that if you invest in this watch, you may get your money back withing 10 years. That never happened to me. If you think about it, it's like buying bonds from corporations and not receiving interest in return, just your money back! Are watch aficionados subsidizing Rolex? Is the cost of wearing a brand, tradition, and history on your wrist really worth that much? I can get an Omega Seamaster 300M GMT with automatic movement Cal. 1128 and COSC Chronometer Certification for $1.630. I would be buying into prestige, tradition, and history for 1/3 of the price. Is the Explorer II water resistant to 300M? I think not. So what's all the fuss? Yes, the Explorer II is a beater and a dressy watch at the same time with an outstanding craftsmanship. I would give it a 5-star rating if ever sold for $1.000."},{"rating":"2","title":"professional quality","review":"I've worked in horticulture for half my life and used Solo's professional backpack sprayers.

We will be returning all sprayers to the dealer."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design and dangerous","review":"I bought the sprayer about a monath ago. Since then I have used the sprayer three times. After each use the sprayer was difficult to clean The only way to clean the tank was to allow the contents to clear from the sprayer to remove the pressure. After this I could only clean it by removing the pump. If I was not sure the pressure was completely out of the sprayer when I unscrewed the top, any ramaining contents could spray into my face. This did happen to me.On the third use the connector between the pump handle and the tank pump broke rendering the sprayer useless. In my opinion the connector is of poor design and made of cheap plastic.I would not recommend this sprayer to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty design","review":"This Sprayer has a faulty design and is prone to breaking. My parents have gone through 3 of them in 1 month. The black inner handle/pump portion is made of plastic. When either pumping or screwing the piece in and out, the \\"black wings\\" that lock the handle are likely to shear off or break. I also have the same sprayer and have just had the same thing happen to me. Solo has had good costumer service and has replaced the parts for my parents. However, what good is a new part that is just as prone to break as the previous part due to the poor design. I liked the other features of the sprayer, but it is not worth it. Strongly advise you not to buy this unit until Solo redesigns it. I almost guarantee it will break on you just as it has for myself and my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Lid to Sugar Bowl","review":"The sugar bowl itself is very pretty, however, it took over three months to arrive.

How wrong they are, and don't let them mislead you, as I have been misled by undeserved praise for Gardiner's interpretation. This is not music, but some imitation thereof. Save your money - you don't need another coaster do you? and go for something more Brahmsian. I'm gunshy after buying this CD, but Klemperer's or Karajan's worth a try. (Am also not very impressed with Shaw's Atlanta, Philip Herreweghe's or the Mormon Tabernacle's.)This interpretation is plastic. That's about the only thing revolutionary about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch sound, great recording.","review":"This recording has great sound with a satisfying orchestral transparency, fluid movement that still retains a satisfying degree of weightiness, and wonderful solos. Still, for me it is somehow lacking in some of those \\"invisible\\" qualities that might had made this a true personal favorite. Passion, emotion, egotism...I can't put my finger on what's missing for me. There is also a greatly-exaggerated syncopation in the second movement, which becomes a virtual grace-note to the third beat. I've never seen the score and don't know if it may be an accurate interpretation, but I'm thankful that other recordings avoid this. However, this still remains one of the best recordings out there, especially for you \\"period instrument\\" nuts like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Jodorowsky film...","review":"Well, it is a Jodorowsky film in name, but.... it's certainly not what his fans might expect.

The graded problems build confidence, and the solutions sometimes provide multiple strategies for attacking a problem.However, as someone attempting to score 800, I felt that much of my time was wasted on the simpler problems. Also, more specific advice about test conditions during the exam and strategies for budgeting time might have been useful. Overall, this book is a good value for the money, but additional preparation might be necessary for those trying to eke out those last few points on the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic and Incomplete","review":"This book only contains 4 sections with problems and explanations: Arithmetic, Algebra, Word Problems, and Graphs. The problems are basic and are not for college math majors. I have taken practice GRE tests and this book fails to include anything past algebra 1.

There are a number of download sites on the internet for really cheap, or free, but I wanted to buy this addon because I was sure it would be high quality and had a couple of the jets I wanted to fly.Big Mistake!! Almost all the planes are low quality and I can't even believe they charge for this. I really wanted the Cessna Citation jet but that is the worst out of the bunch. I don't even want to look at it.Abacus should be embarrased with themselves for releasing this. If it is half the cost of Flight Sim 2004, I expect those planes to look real. Even the spoilers on the Gulfstream don't act right. They aren't smooth and just pop up and down in a split second. I haven't had the time to look at much more, I just don't even want to look at this anymore.What a waste!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The person below says they know more about planes and \\"might even be able to fly one someday\\" Well, I am a pilot and if they think these planes are realistic, then I would be scared to board a plane that they are piloting. I thought this game would be fun, but it was so unrealistic it was annoying. This game acts like flying is as simple as moving a joystick back and forth. There are no ailerons, banking, yawing, etc. I give this a negative ten!! If you are looking for a realistic fun flying game, I recommend any of the newer Flight Simulator X games from Microsoft. Besides professional flight sims that we use that cost a minimum of $800-1,500, the 50 dollar one made by microsoft is one of the best. But, DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS GAME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd","review":"Seems like a very amateurish production. I'm still confused as to how to use the materials.

Her character had a ton of possibilities but as with most DC characters she was made too powerful. We witness that here as she finally has her showdown with Shiva. I do like the budding friendship with Spoiler as I think it works much better than with Barbara. The art is at times almost indecipherable.

My heart still breaks every time I remember that John Lennon was cut down before his time. Listening to this helps. Whether it's intentional or not, he really does have a Lennon-esque lilt in his vocal stylings now. (Though his Kurdt Kobain impression makes a return here and there too.)

I found it slow and unexciting, and never got into the characters. The characters didn't seem to develop in any way, and the plot twist didn't grab me.I almost never get rid of books from my favorite authors, but I sold this one as soon as I finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"I usually am determined to finish a book after I have paid good money for it, but I found this one such a waste of time I put it down half way through. The characters are unbelievable and for the most part boring. I wasn't in the least bit interested in how the two main characters ended up together - overwrought agonising over age, worth and position page after page after page! The last by this author for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy, disconnected and only somewhat entertaining","review":"I was a fan of the other Mayfair series, so I had expectations that this current book would be just as entertaining. Sad to say, however, it just was lackluster. The book is written in a very choppy way and everybody, even the characters we already knew, all just came across as shallow and not very well defined. I found myself often confused as to where exactly they were physically or what had happened and had to turn back a page or two to find the reference where someone had left a room or entered a room or similar things. It was just unfocused and disjointed. The story isn't horribly bad, but everything just seems trite and shallow. Sad to say, as I do like the other novels, but this one just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam and Desiree with melt your heart!","review":"About Adam is a wonderful story. When I started reading it, I kept saying to myself, poor, poor Adam. Adam Chillworth is a painter, a deep, brooding man who is in love with a woman that he can never have. Princess Desiree is a young woman who can never have the man she loves so very much. No worries, though. Just as there are forces trying to drive them apart, there are forces pushing them together. Adam is an honorable man, one who thinks to protect Desiree, if if from himself, as he feels he is not good enough for her. This is a story of drama, passion and intrigue, done in such a manner to keep the pages turning very quickly. Let's not forget about the humor! About Adam is the next in the Mayfair Square series. I'd say pick them all up, as you will not regret it. Robin Taylor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Not Worth It","review":"After reading the other books in the Mayfair 7 series, I expected this book the be good and edge-gripping. It turned out to be incredible boring. The characters didn't have a set personality and came off as shallow. I thought it was kind of like a movie with bad actors, you couldn't bring the characters to life. There was very little plot. They got together near the beginning, so there was no suspense. The writing was very choppy and made little sense. I wanted to stop reading the book and just burn it. I was very disappointed with her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing End","review":"I enjoyed all the previous Mayfair Square books but this one was a big disappointment.

Out of the four discs, one is the Visual Dictionary, which is an ancient piece of software created in 1996. Suffice it to say that I could not use it because it insisted that my CD-ROM should be the D: drive. (I have several hard drives, so this is not an option.)Discs 3 and 4 are an encyclopedia whose creator has gone out of business, as the technical support contact enclosed in the package confirmed. Therefore, one cannot register the product or gain access to some of the features.

The travel narrative is as engaging as Theroux or Raban (with whom she is friends) with her particular eye for historical details that become almost prophecies.I recommend it as an ideal \`entry point' to enjoying this historians writing for anyone not yet an aficionado and collector of her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, No Photos","review":"Written about ten years before his sex change operation, this disappointing book is suprsingly dry and tedious.

They introduce skills and strategies that many novice coaches may not be providing. I wish that some of the skills were illustrated in more detail. For example, just mentioning that you should keep your toe pointed down for an instep kick is not sufficient; it is critical to have the heel locked down.

The \\"psychedelic\\" hypothesis of the nocturnal flights launched by the author has a serious scientific ground and casts a Terrence McKennian light upon the witches Sabbath. The book is written in a clear and a very inobtrusive language, which does not require a special training in science from the reader. At the same time it awakes the curiousity and gives some very important pointers on sources where one can find more about witchcraft and its development, impact and meaning.

I have used it once or twice as a reference and I could find what I wanted to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.","review":"There is very little useful information in this book jam-packed with data. It includes highly debatable physical descriptions of the actors, their aliases, and the names and dates of their films. No plot summaries, no descriptions of their abilities or proclivities, or the relative quality of the films. There isn't even any cross-reference to find out if the actor or actress appeared with another particular actor/actress. Lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to find all the best XXX stars","review":"If you need to find a XXX star and the movies they are in....this is the book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"I'm not saying much, because saying anything is already too much. Filmed in black/white, the poetic suggestions and use of imagery are simply spectacular. At the same time it's very subtle, evoking comparison with Bergmann, Lagerkvist and Popol Vuh. See the rough sculpture of the blessed virgin being carried across the field of rye and you will get drunk on the poetry that's in it. Oh, and the ending!!! It's wine....A friend told us about it, we caught it the last night of its run and I thank GOD every day that we did not miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing; Chaotic","review":"I think it would have helped me if I had had a strong interest in the period of time the story took place (Middle Ages?). It was a physically unattractive movie, and the plot seemed chaotic. Also, I had bought the movie because of my interest in the young actress, Natalie Morse, but she spent most of the movie in an underground cave. I don't recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but wildly wrong in capturing the Hartnell era.","review":"In concept and partial execution, a good book. The last hundred pages are particularly well done. Unfortunately, at least the first 50 to 100 pages are wasted with a bizarre obsession with pedophilia. It moves the plot no where and is obviously not true to the Hartnell era. It is also disturbing that such a thing could be in a Doctor Who novel period. Also, since the book is not intended for younger readers, some type of warning should have been indicated on the cover. Since pedophilia is a vile practice, the book is then foisted with the baggage such a ghastly subject would entail. If homosexuality must be dragged into a Doctor Who book, I would suggest THE EMPIRE OF GLASS as a template. But, I don't see how pedophilia can ever be handled in a non evil way. Strange. Unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with TomTom One","review":"This item was advertiesed as working with a TomTom One. I selected it from the TomTom One \\"accessories\\". It DOES NOT work with TomTom One. Wrong plug style. Probably works fine for the appropriate device."},{"rating":"1","title":"TomTom Car Charger for Go Navigators","review":"This product is advertised as if it will fit every GO Navigator out there. I had to return mine because it was not compatible with my 700 GO. However, I must compliment Amazon on how they handled my return. They sent me an email with a return postage pick up and instructions on how to return it at their expense. I received a full credit to my credit card account. From now on, I will have no hesitation to order from Amazon because of their customer sensitivity and service."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CLASSIC GOLDEN OLDIES!!!","review":"I feel like I'm the only young man (I just graduated high school) who appreciates this type of music. Since my parents grew up with this music, it rubbed off on me because as a child, I heard it a lot! If you love the classic music of the 50's and 60's, you'll definitely love these! My favorites are My Boyfriend's Back, Love is like a Heat Wave, My Guy, Big Girls Don't Cry, Stand By Me, Sherry, The Shoop Shoop Song, I Get Around, The Little Old Lady From Pasadena, It's my Party, The Lion Sleeps Tonight, I Will Follow Him, Don't Be Cruel, The Twist, 16 Candles, and Earth Angel. These are my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed with sound quality!","review":"I bought these for my husband for his landmark birthday. He was delighted!

I was glad that Amazon offered the brake pads which were reasonably priced and shipped quickly. The pads work great. They provide good braking action, are quiet and I was really surprised how little dust they produce. The package didn't include break-in instructions so I called the manufacturer and they suggested 4-5 firm stops fron 55 MPH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Units, Both Failed","review":"I bought a brand new unit directly from Garmin. It worked for about a week, then it would no longer charge. I returned it and got a REFURBISHED UNIT in exchange.The refurbished unit did better.. it lasted 3 weeks before failing. To use it, I must use the charger plug constantly, as the unit will not charge.Sending it back now to try a third unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want grief? Buy Garmin","review":"If you like hassle with a capital H, buy a Garmin. Unlocking maps, product registration and a website that will not provide a simple e-mail link to contact support all contribute to make using a Garmin a major pain in the behind. They way they act, you'd think they were licensing nuclear technology. We sold our GPS10 and bought Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 with GPS receiver. What a difference. MS treets and Trips works without a lot of hassle. It's easy to install and use. The receiver works when you want it to, not when it feels like it. No company's maps are up to date and Microsoft's are no worse than Garmins. Probably better. We learned the hard way. Do yourself a very big favor and look elsewhere when buying a GPS device. Under no circumstances will we ever buy anything Garmin again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vital album","review":"This album is, simply put, a classic. Although later albums by 6FS have been good, none have been as good as Severe Exposure; this album is 35 or so minutes of relentless, dark guitar rock with mutated synths thrown in for good measure. 6FS also have the good taste to thrown in humorous bits for added enjoyment (the goofy dialogue that opens Simian Fever is especially priceless). Along the way, 6FS point towards Shellac, the Jesus Lizard, and the darkest points Sonic Youth reached . But it's the glee with which they demolish their music that makes it all so worthwhile, from their demented lyrics to the way the guitars sound positively crushed beneath a wall of static and distortion. And -- most importantly -- they rock, in the full sense of the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!

It really makes the soul feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two kinds of songs","review":"Some songs aren't that good, but the others make the CD worth listening. Personnaly, I do believe that their previous CD was better, but ís a GREAT CD. The critic above is too negative in my opinion. I can only confirm what i've read in the other two reviews: if you like RAMMSTEIN (they are great!) and if you like to open your mind and do a little philosophy, you should listen to Clawfinger (check out their previuos CD, 'Use your brain')."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware - you could lose all your passwords","review":"I used it for a year and got burned.

I've never written a review before, but I was so upset by this book's publication that I have to write one this time. It is virtually impossible to read this book and to have any respect for its content with the absolutely amazing number of standard English writing errors. This book looks like a rough draft that hadn't been proofread/edited even once before it was published. I can't believe it's in print!!!! This book was purchased at a price commensurate with other books of its size. For that price, I would expect that the book would have been to a polished stage, and this was barely a first/second draft. How did this book get into print and offered on Amazon as a legitimate published book when it's merely a very, very rough draft??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This is a very misleading CD cover. I thought I was ordering music from the TV series. Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique use","review":"After months of frustration trying to find a headboard I liked for my bed, I got creative. This beautiful trellis now serves a a headboard on a twin bed. To make up for the fact it is not as wide as the bed, I glued the two posts, which would have been used to put in ground,to the outside of the trellis posts. I put artificial flowers in them and the effect is a headboard same size as bed. Love it. Had a little concern about screwing through material but a call to the manufacturer cleared it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIX filter works fine on RX400h","review":"This filter works fine as a replacement but it's not obvious how to orient the filter.

The richness and depth of the full orchestra transports the mind and soul. I feel sorry for those who have never experienced this kind of quality and who, in their shallowness of knowledge, deride it as \\"elevator music\\". In fact, one rarely hears music on elevators except for screaming vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best of the Boston Pops","review":"The Boston Pops are a national treasure.

The Part II questions in the practice tests appear to be made up by the book's authors and not based on actual tests, and the authors underestimated the difficulty considerably. The questions are far easier than anything that would be on the exam.However, this book is usable if you combine it with another reference that contains Part II sections from actual exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but needs revision","review":"The review of calculus is hardly efficient. Things like volume and series are inadequate. Although the practice tests are ok, the book needs a bit of work to be really good. The \\"examples\\" are laughable as well.

I would definitely recommend this product.It also has esp max and is CDR-RW."},{"rating":"1","title":"This 'Flame War' is only lukewarm","review":"_Flame War_ was unimpressive and dull, though it had a few brief moments of enjoyment buried in it. Cute, stereotyped characters (pudgy, asocial hacker; beautiful female geek; clueless man w/ heart of gold) and poorly planned plot devices (going online without modems/getting diskettes in the mail/being blown up by diskettes with C-4), and maddeningly slow pacing make this book resemble a bowl of porridge rather than the spicy curry of intrigue the jacket promises.Protagonist Harry Garnet, law student-cum-caretaker, provides a style of narration that seems at first silly and flip, then gratingly cutesy. However, the dialogue in general is better than average. Another point in _Flame War_'s favor is its near-accurate depiction of MOOs and MU*s in general.All things considered, though, you'd do well to wait this one out and hope for a more savvy treatment of the 'cyberthriller' premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should've been a million-seller.","review":"Davis' music uses a lot of different infuences such as rock, blues, R and B, Gospel and pop.

Until recently. I've been having growing chronic pain and tension in my left leg, lower back, and shoulders. Neither regular stretching after exercising nor other yoga DVDs did much to relieve the pain. A few days ago, feeling the tension in my neck and head in addition to the usual areas, I popped in the second DVD of the series. An hour and a half later, I felt completely wrung out. Days later, I am still tension free and planning to work this series back into my exercise routine. Some reviews said the videos are repetative, but for me, that was exactly the way to gradually deepen the stretches in my problem areas.

I have no problem with the Dish being made of plastic, but the housing where the hose is supposed to fit, does not have a tight fit when the hose is put on, so it leaks at the joint. I just purchased another product today, and am just taking the money loss, because it is not worth it to be aggravated further, by returning the product, so I am out $28 plus. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short lived product","review":"After just under 1 year, this thing is completely useless.Two major problems:1)overflow has not worked properly for last 4 months. It uses a simple float mechanism (like a toilet) to stop, which does not properly shut off. We were able to fix it for a few months, but it overflows badly now.2) The other problem is that if you have large dogs with large paws, you will probably want to mount this since 1) it's plastic, thus edible, and 2) they swim in their dishes. The problem is the mount holes are also plastic and the bowl is now tearing away from the weight of the water.Minor problems:1) Fittings are plastic - so it leaks - copious amounts of patience and plumber's tape will do the trick2) No drain hole3) Some of inner fittings have corroded (clearly a local problem)Pros:1) Price2) Color3) It didn't crack or discolor from the sunBottom line: I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This was a waste of money. It to a while to get it dialed in (just like Toni's review said above). It worked for a few weeks and then got so scummy. It was impossible to clean properly. The scum was growing from the inside (the part you can't get to) and just seemed unsanitary for the dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedro Conga brings new energy to Salsa","review":"Pedro Conga definitely is one of the most talented salseros lately. He has joined an amazing leader singer: Maelo Ruiz, who has a powerful voice. Check the follow songs out: Noche de Mar, which probably is my favourite because of its executions, showing Maelo's voice quality. The other amazing song is Amor de Cristal, where Axel Martínez (chorus) makes good tandem with Maelo. Pedro Conga descarga on the conga showing up the reason why he is called \\"Conga\\". A must have CD for salseros who love dancing and enjoyng very fast and powerful songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one I bought was defective.","review":"Installed this cartridge on my Denon DP 300F turntable and I was getting music out of one speaker and only buzzing out of the other. I took out the cartridge and double checked all the connections, and everything seemed fine. After fooling around with this for a couple hours I was pretty sure I had a defective cartridge, so I reinstalled the old one and it worked fine. I'll be returning the Grado tomorrow. This might be a great cartridge, who knows, but this one was a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crews rocks.","review":"If you like Southern Gothic, you will love this book, which is successfully horrifying, funny, energizing, and moving, not to mention brilliantly written. It's about violent drunk losers whose best days were in high school. It's a bit slim, and it was written in the 1970s, which I didn't realize till I was about 2/3 through. Also, if you're reading this to read about New Orleans because of the flood (and because \\"The Knockout Artist,\\" which is also awesome, takes place there), you should know this book actually takes place in Texas. I picked it up for the N.O. connection but was not disappointed. Great book by a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best reading experiences of my life!","review":"This is one of the more interesting and definitely one of the best books I've read in the past decade. The writing is so natural, so effortlessly beautiful, very descriptive and at the same time, the words chosen are simple and uncomplicated. You feel like you're in the author's mind - it is that intense. The dialog is unique, and etches out the characters so clearly. All the characters are intriguing. Despite the juggernaut of an ending, it all makes sense. Nothing is out of place. Joe Lon is a great antihero. A worthy and extremely entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary Southern Culture","review":"Harry Crews, who grew up in rural south Georgia, does an excellent job of telling the story of a young man who grew up in a rural, poor, and culturally-deprived area of Georgia. The \\"hero\\" is JOe Lon Mackey, a former high school star football player, who finally realizes that he is a \\"nothing\\". One cannot live on past glories. He realizes this as he watches his former high school girlfriend go on to college and develop as a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book in hopes that it would bring back warm memories of the South that I know and love. Not what I got. I think I may have enjoyed this book when I was fifteen and loved all those prepubescent teen books. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sssssome Ideassss Ssssssuc*","review":"Perhaps in 1976 the shock factor appealed to a larger market and that accounts for this book still being available for purchase. Give the author this, there's no shortage of characters in this collection of pages and some are well crafted. Calling this collection of pages a novel is a stretch beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profane junk for the fun of it","review":"I realize that there are perverted and profane people out there but most authors don't glorify them. Some authors may allow profanity but they don't stuff the pages with it. There may be a vile, sickening villain or several in a novel, but the whole cast isn't made up of them. I read the first pages of this book, then had to toss it aside. Everything bad seemed gratuitous and there was precious little good. Some obviously like Crews stuff, but even some fans had a hard time with this book. Sorry, it ain't my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and one-dimensional","review":"The problem with this novel and most of Harry Crews's work is that it strives for little more than a surface sensationalism. None of Crews's work even approaches the excellence of Flannery O'Connor's, which is built on a firm philosophical (Catholic) foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compellingly ugly","review":"Parts of this novel were so disturbing, I wanted to toss it across the room. I most especially hated the passages about the torture of the poor pit bull...but then everyone in this novel is a poor pit bull. And Crews has a genius for describing the ugliest things in a way that is compelling; like an auto accident up the road you swear you won't look at, but there you are rubber-necking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast of Snakes","review":"I was very disappointed in this work. It provides the reader with a vile, twisted view of life in a small southern town peopled by repulsive characters with no redeeming values. I should have put it down after only a few pages but I hoped there might be something of value in its pages, unfortunately, there was not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crews at his best","review":"Despite heavy dialogue and a vision for the violent that would, perhaps, even make O'Connor a bit nervous; Crews has managed a story about a man on the edge that touches the gritty corners of the Southern experience. Crews characters are surprizingly dymanic for people who are almost gloriously \\"redneck\\" in their approach to life.This book manages to make you laugh at some of the most profoundly disturbing aspects of rural southern life. The cruelty of the book is almost naturalistic in nature.The only reason I don't rate this book with five stars is some of Crew's female characters can be a little harder to shallow than his men as well as the dialogue in the book being almost unnecessarily thick at points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable length not as stated.","review":"I choose this rating because I have not been able to use the item yet. The item is supposed to have a 16-1/2 foot cable. The cable goes from the pump to the solar panel. The cable attached to the pump I received is LESS than 10 foot long, so I don't have enough cable length from my bird bath location (that can't be moved) to where the solar panel needs to be located to be in direct sunlight. So, the item doesn't do me much good as it won't run without sunlight on the solar panel and the cable to too short to allow the panel to reach a sunny area. FALSE ADVERTISING! Think twice before purchasing this item if you need a sufficient length of cable as you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"too cute","review":"It does what it says it will do. Do not expect much and you will be happy with this pump. Was very easy to install....just make sure you do not cast a shadow on the solar panel and you will se your water sputter. In full sun it is a charming little fountain....you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs battery","review":"Works great when the sun is directly shining on the solar panel. But if the sun goes behind a tree, everything stops. It needs a battery buffer to store energy so that it doesnt shut off when the sun is temporarily gone. Not useful as is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price.","review":"This solar fountain only works while sunlight is directly on the panel.For the price, it should have the capability to store power for a period of time.

Mine looks \\"lost\\" in the 18 inch wide bowl in my birdbath and in the wide open surrounding area because the water does not go up too high. It does not go as high as shown in the photo.

Just not as impressive as the photo and write up make it appear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just purchased this item to use in our new landscaping.

Beware of companies that have minor details about their products. The instructions were scarce and very misleading (reminded me of the 60's and Made in Japan). The pump was about 2\\" x 3\\", (unspecified in the details) now what power, albeit solar, could come of this. The fountain was 1 1/2\\" high at most, although Smart Solar specified 2cm-15cm; quite a difference in output. Of course, maybe I received one that the quality control inspector missed on the conveyor as it passed, on its way to consumer land. It doesn't even rate 1 star.

I tried cleaning off the panel, cleaning the pump, adjusting it, all of the manufacturers recommendations and even some tricks I know from owning other fountain pumps. I am keeping it just in case I come up with some sort of creative way to use it. But for now it is in the garage because I got tired of listening to it trying so hard to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can do better","review":"I would strongly discourage purchasing this item. I live in Arizona and the device only barely reacts to direct sunlight. Can't say if it is the solar panel producing too little power or the pump with too little oomph.

Forty bucks, for what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a trick to it","review":"At first I was disappointed because every time I came out to look at the fountain, it wasn't working. I had to jiggle the connection between the solar panel and the fountain to get it started. But a few days ago, I repositioned the connection so it was lying flat, instead of hanging down. Now the fountain is on whenever I come out on the patio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much","review":"I should have payed attention to the other reviews. They were very accurate. It only really works when the sun is a perfect angle so it only lasts but an hour or so unless you manually change the direction of the solar panel. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"We are bird lovers and do everything we can to attract a wide variety of birds to our yard. We have a birdbath, and thought the solar pump would be a great addition for the birds' enjoyment and ours. We have lots of sun in our backyard, and therefore assumed it would be perfect for this pump. However, we wasted a birthday gift card on this item. Our expectations were not unrealistic. We understood it would not work on a cloudy day, in the shade, or any other sitaution that obstructs the sun. BUT, we DID expect it to work on SUNNY days! This is NOT the case. Even on a sunny day after we have moved the solar panel into direct sun, it might (or might not) work for about 10-15 seconds. Then--no matter where you move the panel--it will not work! The only thing this pump has brought us is frustration!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright, BRIGHT light","review":"This product said it needed direct sunlight, obviously since it is solar powered.

A little disapointing... :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Fountain only works in full sunlight. A small passing cloud and it shuts off.Shuts off if overcast. Also, solar panel must be facing the sun at all times, which means you have to rotate it during the day to keep fountain working. If anything at all blocks the direct sunlight from the panel, it shuts off. When my cat walks past the solar panel, the fountain shuts off.

Doesn't work well at all. I don't know if it is the solar panel being so small or what. It is not worth all the money being charged for the product. I bought an electric pump instead and use the attachments from the solar pumps. I don't recommend going this route at all for running your ponds. This may be good for a bird bath but not a pond."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"Wanted it for the birdbath but figured the bigger birds would slosh enough water out to eventually burn the motor out. So I put it in the pond. I had to tilt the solar panel towards the sun to make it work. The sun was only at about 2 o'clock in the sky (clock, not real time). Even then it wasn't very impressive. If you want a feeble dribbler, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Durability","review":"I purchased a first pump of the same name a couple years ago and another recently.

Sprayed too high for my bird bath and sprayed the water out of the bowl. I just used the tube to let it bubble like a drinking fountain which was not a bad thing. However, last week the whole unit stopped working for no apparent reason. Worked one day, not the next. I am disappointed, and glad I didn't pay any more for something that didn't even survive two months. Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal power, quality OK","review":"This is our 3rd attempt, from various vendors, to get a small solar powered fountain. They usually quit after ~6 months or don't work right out of the box. And forget trying to get service/repairs. All these solar pumps are made in China, and no USA phone numbers.We got 2 of this one, and both worked, but even in bright overhead southern California sun, we get maybe 5 inches of height from the fountains. Hope these last more than one summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely 6 inches","review":"I bought this item from Amazon but its been very sad. It barely shoots 6 inches in full sun.

Many other puppets included Sooty still going strong to-day after many years, Muffin the Mule, Gerry Anderson's films- 'Thunderbird', 'Stingray' etc. I should like to see a Part 2. of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Now You,","review":"I love love love this cd.

I purchased both Pigeonhead CD's without hearing any of the music. Shame on me. I simply recommend that someone that enjoys Brad or Satchel try to listen to a sample of the Pigeonhed music before purchasing. It is synthesizer driven and very different from the other music I have heard from Mr. Smith. I am moved by his vocals on all other CD's I've heard from him, however, it is my opinion that his vocals do not overshadow the music. If you like synth and techno maybe this CD is for you...just not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I had high hopes for this book for my genealogy research, thinking it would be lists of names.

This error is NOT on the VHS. Additionally the \\"extras\\" are 10 min of interviews hacked together with black screen in between them all- I've seen better editing in high school video classes.

Historia is a collection of videos spanning from 1980 up through 1987 I love the videos for me and my wine and Love bites but I like all the videos though. In the round was recorded in Denver 1988 it features some smokin guitar work from both Steve Clark and Phil Collen (Steve did jump about a fair bit) the live version of bringin on the heartache was cool though Stagefright got me jumping up and playing air drums/guitar. This dvd is one I do not get tired of watching. These (HIstoria In the round) may look \\"dated\\" now but at least captures the essence of the band in their prime. Extras include videos from Slang and an 11 (?) minute interview discussing how the dvd came together as well as the videos for slang (I'm not 100% on the interview content as I didn't buy the dvd for that). If you like early Def Leppard then this will be a welcome addition to your dvd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great package!","review":"It's great to see all these videos and performances by a great band on one DVD. The sound quality isn't great at times, but remember, some of these videos and performances are from the early 80's and likely don't transfer well to DVD. The gems are probably the videos put on as extras from Slang and Euphoria. Promises especially is a great video - now where have I seen that actress before; oh yeah, The Patriot.The concert in the round is a great idea and really showcases how the band interacts with the crowd. Despite all the adversity, Def Leppard remains one of the great hard rock bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked these on VHS, love them on DVD, must have for Leppard fans","review":"I originally collected these on VHS, great collections themselves individually. But, now on DVD, the quality is a bit better, the sound rules, and the 5 bonus videos, (work it out, Slang, all I want is everything, promises, goodbye), round out a great def leppard collection. Historia contains earlier versions of videos and my personal favorite leppard song video, Rock Rock, which was only released in Japan on video, and on historia for our viewing pleasure.

Very few main stream artists, so we have a ton of artists that didn't even hit the top 100 in the United States during the 60s or 70s.This is to costly for what you get. To few hits included (USA Hits) and average sound. Yuk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is a \\"Hard Sell\\" with a soft and refined touch.","review":"I just finished watching \\"HARD SELL\\", and I must say that I am looking forward to checking out more episodes, from WHITE COLLAR. From what I have seen thus far, this TV series is LEVERAGE, mixed with WALL STREET, and \\"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN\\" (with the latter I think being a DIRECT inspiration for the series). Normally; I start my viewership with the Pilot episode of a series, just to get a feel for what the show has to offer. But anything with aggressive Wall Street brokers, and the \\"Greed is Good\\" mentality automatically catches my attention. The thief with a good heart; is a con-man but not too abrasive with his tactics. So most people don't want to see the scam coming. If the series continues with episodes similar to \\"Hard Sell\\"; then I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this series on DVD. Keep up the good work. WHITE COLLAR just acquired a new fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid show that takes place in NYC","review":"Based on its price and existing reviews, I decided to try \\"White Collar,\\" Season 1 and believe me, it was worth all 1,900+ pennies. The story revolves around a classy master thief (played by Matt Bomer) who strikes a deal with the FBI agent (played by Tim McKay) who caught him twice, all in order to avoid going back to jail. The agent works in the FBI's white-collar crime division in New York City and the master thief is there to provide a criminal's perspective to each case. Catch is that the thief is confined to a two-mile radius by an ankle bracelet and needs to locate his missing girlfriend. Tiffany Thiessen (of \\"90210\\" fame) stars as the agent's wife. Great cast works well together. Solid, believable scripts kept me interested and jonesing for season 2. Could be filmed in L.A. for all I know, but looks like NYC to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a comment","review":"I had pre-ordered the DVD for $41.99 which I thought was quite high. I cancelled it today after checking othershows prices. The Closer for 15 episodes is $25.99, NCIS is $37.04 for 25 episodes. While I love White Collar,the price is way to high for 15 episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Collar","review":"Really like this show. At first I just started watching it because he has such pretty eyes and it is a cop show with a twist.

Very impressed. All discs work perfect. Made a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the show!","review":"I love the show! Only thing with the disc is on Disc 2 episode 7 there's a scratch that gives all my dvd players a hard time. Only Xbox 360 can play it fairly smooth. But when you look at the disc you can't see any visible signs of damage. Otherwise, great show! Very entertaining. Love how they have the backround story of Kate going on on top of each episode's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kate Thing .... Just way too stupid ... but I took heed","review":"If the pilot were representative of the whole show, this would be a 5-star review. The pilot was well-written and laugh-out-loud funny. After a couple of episodes, it was down to 3 stars. By the end, the whole Kate music-box thing had rendered it almost unwatchable. I am ok with suspending disbelief, but come on, suspending disbelief and suspending IQ aren't the same thing. The woman is walking around playing clue games and someone is supposed to take this seriously, the fact that she is in serious jeopardy? If this bit of boring dumb weren't the underpinning of so much of the show, it wouldn't have trashed the whole show, but it is and it does.P.S. Took heed of the comments and yes, it did get better once Kate died! Raised from two to four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Series","review":"White Collar is probably one of the best written series on TV today. The characters perfect, the writing is the best. Doesn't rely on violence, explosions and sex to involve you in a great show. Hope the writers can keep up the excitement with more super writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Catch a Thief","review":"White Collar is one of a number of outstanding shows currently on USA Network. The premise is similar to Eddie Murphy's classic 48 Hours. Take a cop and team him up with one of the criminals he caught and see what type of fun ensues. In this case we have Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), head of the FBI's White Collar Crime Division in New York, and Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) a charming, good hearted, forger, art thief, and con-man. Burke has tracked down and put Cafferey behind bars twice but now can use the crafty crook to help him solve some of the Bureau's toughest cases. The chemistry between the two leads is great and the supporting cast is outstanding. All in all, a very fresh and entertaining series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is the best thing I've seen in a long time!","review":"This is an awesome show! I love the character development between Neal and Peter, and the relationship between Peter and his wife. I also love that it's a clean show and I can watch it with my 10- and 13-year-old kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of early CHUCK","review":"White Collar is a frothy, funny, fun to look at show in the manner of Psych, Chuck and Burn Notice, my favorite shows on now. Both leads are excellent - showing there is more to them than expected - and the dialogue is very good. Like C, P and BN, you have to have a strong suspension of disbelief - plot holes abound - but it is fun to watch the interaction of the leads. If we're lucky, they will develop the characters in a way where we really care about them (like in Chuck and to a lesser extent, Burn Notice). Since we have OTA TiVO, I have to watch them either online, or via Amazon - even with the per show fees, it is cheaper to buy ala carte than pay $50-$80 per month for HD cable or satellite. Video on Demand ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!! Love Matt Bomer","review":"This show is about Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer), a sexy con man, who strikes a deal with FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim Dekay), to spend the rest of his prison sentence working as a consultant to help the FBI catch white collar criminals. (Think Frank Abignail, Catch Me if You Can) The show is great because it intertwines Caffrey's work with the FBI into Caffrey's other mission, to find his ex girl friend, Kate.My favorite thing about this show is it doesn't take itself too seriously, like other crime dramas. The relationship between Caffrey and Burke is great, they really bring you into their world.The other great thing about this show is the way the two of them solve crimes. It's smart and innovative. Add a little Mozzie (think Monk) and Peter's Wife, Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiesen, the fantastic and still gorgeous Kelly Kapowski), and you have a great combination!If you don't want to buy the DVD, you can watch it on Netflix, but pre-warned, you're going to be addicted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean show","review":"I love this show! The plot and relationships are great as stated in other reviews! I have watched the first two seasons. Reasons I love it: No foul language, low sexual content (maybe two scenes in two seasons), and low violence. It is very hard to find shows like this. With that being said, I was disappointed to read reviews that said season 3 did not follow these same guidelines. Enjoy the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment, intrique, with a twist\`","review":"From the very first episode, it beomes obvious that White Collar is not your run of the mill cop show. This is creative, entertaining and does have enough excitement for anyone. Top it off that both my wife and daughter enjoy the \\"eye candy,\\" and I actually get to watch the show without being interrupted with unrelated conversation. There are belly rolling moments with high tension, but ALWAYS a twist to keep your imagination going. In short, this is an awesome program with all the perfect ingredients for a long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"If you enjoy mysteries, you'll like White Collar. I love this show!! It's smart, funny, and well written. The actors and characters blend well together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series that is fun and entertaining","review":"Matt Bomer is excellent in this series and the supporting cast is good as well. Started recording this on my Tivo and was well into the second season before I started watching the first episode. Long story short I burned through the first season and was pretty well caught up to season two in just over a week. I would regularly watch 2-3 episodes back to back! Definitely worth the time and if you don't get USA network the dvd's worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love everything about it","review":"This show is genius - the characters are wonderfully portrayed, and the plot never skimps on creativity. I am a huge fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"I love this show. Its always entertaining and the plot twists are always leaving me ready for another season.

I've watched it several times on USANetwork, and the quality of the AVOD downloads is incomparably superior.The characters in the show are all appealing. I hope they'll all be back next season, especially Diana Ross, whose character has evolved into a tough, supportive friend for Caffrey and the only person for whom he shows genuine affection.Too bad \\"White Collar\\" has only 14 episodes per season.I'm hooked on the AVOD system.--pat"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"the Season One of White Collar is superb.

It'll be WAY too predictable if she marries Joe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Mandie books, but I must admit that this is the worst I have read. Mandie has almost no emotions. The author doesn't let us in on what she is thinking. She never has any quiet time to just be Mandie. The story itself has no plot, and the highlight of the book is the last paragraph, which is still lacking. I finished the book in one two hour sitting, and it wasn't from captivation. Mandie's friends are mentioned one or twice, and when she goes home for vacation it is told of in less than one page. The whole book consists of meaningless dialogue. There is no theme, characterization, or setting that Leppard usually does so lovely. I know that I could even write a better book than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This product really helps get rid of the dark circles and bags under the eyes.

We moved to the 90's game and it's perfect! We were all born in the 70's and are in our 30's. The questions span all trivia areas, movies, tv, music, world events and sports. We had a great time with this game....it had us singing these songs, remembering movies from our youth...overall a great game for the right age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't we just come out of the 90s?","review":"I can't believe this! I remember at the begining of the 90s, people treated the 80s as a LLLOOOOOOOOONNNGGG time ago, I completely different era. I was only 5 when the 90s started, but it still drove me mad in the 90s when people talked about how LLLLLOOONNNGG ago the 80s were. Whenever people in the 90s said things like \\"Oh, that happened way back there in the 80s\\" I'd just get a confused look on my face! It was just a few years ago people!Now, what does this have to do with this game? Well, people today are doing the exact same thing! They treat the 90s as being way back there, even though we're just a few years removed from the 90s! The news, music, and culture of the 90s are not way back in another time. As far as I'm concerned, they still fall under the category of \\"current events\\" as opposed to the \\"ancient history\\" label people are starting to give them.Its 2005 people! The 90s aren't ancient yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game for any Gen-X'er","review":"If you're like my friends and me and spent your teens and early 20's in the 90's, you'll LOVE this game. Great questions dealing with music, movies, tv, events, and sports. The great thing is that most of the questions really make you think a bit (it's not a super-easy no-brainer like some of the other games out there). We set up 3 teams of 2 and the game took about an hour, hour and a half (obviously, more teams = longer playing time).This game will definitely be a staple in all of our gaming nights. A sure bet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Time - Tough Questions","review":"The box of The 90's Game reads, \\"The 90's are Back.\\" Although, I didn't think they'd really been gone all that long - I still had a tough time remembering the diner from \\"Saved By The Bell\\" (The Max, by the way). Regardless, this is much more fun than other trivia games, because even though you remember all the shows, music, movies, etc. from the past decade (as opposed to say stuff from the fities and sixties) - the answers lie in the details - which often are just on the tip of your tongue. The last time I played included a mixed group (some trivia buffs some clueless tag-alongs) and there was enough in there to please both sets. Great time had by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"90's Game Rocks","review":"After the torrential rains of June, I bought the 90's game this summer as a rainy day activity for my beach house. But we didn't just play the 90's game on rainy afternoons, my housemates were itching to play this game when they woke up, on the beach and before going out at night. The 90's game is a fun game for groups -- never a dull moment, even if you didn't watch every re-run of 90210 and Melrose Place! Everyone can dominate at least some of the categories -- whether you are a music buff, sports fiend, movie aficionado or TV nut -- but it's never too easy to win, nor too difficult to cause boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"not detailes","review":"This book doesn't really have much in it.

It seems to have been designed as a primer to whet the neophyte's interest, but unfortunately the neophyte does not come away from this book knowing substantially more than when coming to it. Too bad, because the entire saga raises a myriad of fascinating issues and questions. Perhaps this book was written merely to cash in on the perennial interest in the Philadelphia Experiment.

Even though there were stories of him in the book, I think every reader could connect themselves to him at one point or another. After reading this book I really do find my self looking at the details in life and noticing things that I would regularly pass by. It really does help you pause...take a breath...and locate priceless moments in what would be a rugular day. Also, in my opinion, it is not a book that you can read just once.

The melodies are rich and the hooks are suprising (like they should be, instead of being merely granted). My impression is that Carl Newman is the brains behind this outfit, judging on his work not just with the \\"New Pornographers\\" but with his own album; the muchdeservedly appreciated \\"The Slow Wonder\\".Plus, the lyrics are quite well-written, if not a little obstuse at times; but that all makes for more repeat listens, which is something this album demands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tasty, unique album","review":"This thing is delicious. \\"Independent\\" is masterful.

This book is highly relevant to H & S professionals from all industries and service sectors, as the concepts given can be applied anywhere. You can even apply them to your own driver behaviour - you'll be surprised at the result! This has to be one of the few academic books that have not had me snoring within 3 minutes of attempting to read it - fascinating throughout! Some readers from the more conventional schools of thought may be irritated by the \\"one sidedness\\" of the views expressed here, but they are founded on 30 years of data.

This DVD is Def Leppard without Steve Clark, and in my opinion Def Leppard died when Steve did. They do a good acoustic \\"Iggy Stardust\\" on this DVD. Maybe they ought to play David Bowie songs from now on. They don't seem to have any direction, and it shows in this DVD.

However, the reason I dropped it from 5 to 4 stars is the visual design - it's very much struck in the late '80s (and in a negative way) when released in 1993 and '95 with bight neon colors, scene wipes, and a general \\"dated\\" design when Grunge was at it's uprising and peak and more muted colors and designs were the calling for video collections at the time.

The bad: Tyrone Power was way too old to be playing the part. No one will believe that Tyrone, with crow's feet, is Eddie Duchin in his early twenties. Kim Novak is vacuous and her death scene is absurd. She looks better dying than what most people look like after a vacation at a summer cottage. The conflict between Eddie and his son is contrived.

The 1940s and 1950s produced some of the most visually beautiful movies ever made, and this (along with Picnic) are some of the best examples of it.This movie was made in 1956 by Columbia, after Tyrone left his contract with Fox. So far, only one of his major titles, The Mark of Zorro, has been released. I'd like to see The Rains Came, Blood and Sand, The Black Swan, The Razor's Edge and Captain from Castile on DVD: Fox, enough of these 1950s CinemaScope titles that are in DeLuxe Color, evidently inferior to Technicolor! Let's release all of Tyrone Power's movies on DVD now!

And, although I chose not to build some of the 500 circuits described in the booklets which accompany this product (because they were really oriented toward fun & games, like listening to Space War sounds), after several days of sitting in my living room with this circuit board and a multimeter, I was a LOT more comfortable with electricity & electrical components than I was before I started. Very, very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all he wants to do!","review":"I bought this as a 7th birthday gift for my son, who is the kind of kid who wants to know how everything works. It comes with the plastic board to build circuits on, many, many circuit pieces, and three books of projects. It's been almost a month, and he is using this, and I'm not exaggerating, 3 or more hours per day -- first thing in the morning, after school, before bed... he just loves it. He quickly moved from following directions in the book to trying to modify the circuits (what if I put the speaker on instead of the fan). He's starting to ask questions about what a resistor is, and such -- thankfully, the books have clear explanations.I give it a 4 for durability because the battery compartment cracked when it fell from the kitchen table onto a carpeted floor, then bounced onto a wood floor. It still works fine -- it was just the casing -- but kids will drop things, so I'd hoped the plastic would hold up a bit better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best toys ever!","review":"This is an awesome educational toy that will keep your little Einsteins occupied and their minds occupied too, for many hours.

My son loves building complex LEGO projects so if your child can follow the LEGO instructions then they are ready to move to up building electronic circuits. I was surprised that when my son has friends over the boys always seem to gravitate to this electronics set when they are not playing outside. (Instead of computers, board and video games, TV, and other activities) One of the most interesting things is that after they build the project per the instructions they start making their own modifications and they love to see how changes impact the project. The set is durable, well-constructed, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic project for my son","review":"I ordered this for my eight-year-old son and it's been in active use for the last four months.

The only thing that I have found frustrating for them is the volume of the pieces. Once they get it put together to make the noise maker work, it is really quiet. You have to put your ear literally on the piece in order to hear it. I don't want it to be deafening either like some toys, but audible to the human ear would be nice. The instructions are easy for a 7 yo to read and decipher and he has made many impressive connections with the kit. I'm hoping he can translate that to real wires and connectors one day as he loves to take apart anything electronic that we will allow."},{"rating":"2","title":"More information available on the web","review":"I just played with this (Snap Circuits Junior) for the first time and came looking to buy one for my kids.In response to the person who said the manuals have errors, see the web site http://www.snapcircuits.net/ (and also http://www.elenco.com/ as mentioned below.)

It is very educational, the direction books are easy to follow (our kids needed a 30 minute lesson before we left them on their own to make their discoveries), the snaps are a super idea (some of the other electronic sets I looked at which required twisting wires together), and it is FUN!We gave it to our 8 year old for his birthday and he has been playing it ever since. His 10 year old brother is very jealous and wakes up early in the morning so he can play with it before his brother wakes up, however the experiments can get a bit noisy so he ends up waking all of us up with them. They both love showing off what they have made to us and their friends and they are learning about how electricity works.Due to the nature of the toy a few of the pieces (such as light bulbs) have potential to break if not cared for properly so be sure when kids are finished playing with the set they put them away properly so they don't get stepped on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy - but much is left unexplained","review":"This is a wonderful toy, solidly constructed and durable. I think the major barrier to an understanding of electronics is just the skill level required in assembly. This toy breaks down and eliminates that barrier. The experiment books are nice, but after assembling them and testing them one is left with the unanswered question: Why does it work? There are no explanations provided as to what is going on in the overall design of the circuit. Why is the circuit that way? Why does making the circuit that way make it do what it does? This is never explained and is a peculiar thing to be left out of an otherwise exceptional educational product for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun gift for all!","review":"I bought this for my 10 yo son's birthday.

The other kids have had fun, too, and it's become a sibling activity to put these projects together. So far all of the projects in the book have worked fine...I saw reviews that said some of them were outdated, but I think they must have updated the project books.

If you are into surround sound gaming, they are not for you, but they are perfect for music on the desktop.Note that these aren't just for computers. They have standard line-level inputs on the back, so you can attach anything to them, such as an iPod or CD player.The cabinets are sturdy (and heavy). The cones are exposed though; there is no grille to keep curious cats, ferrets or toddlers away from the relatively delicate material of the speakers themselves. Keep this in mind when you choose a location.The headphone jack on the front is a very nice touch, but I found the midrange boost control feature to be of little value, at least in the room I was in. Your mileage may vary.Sure, you could go get \\"real\\" stereo speakers and an amp to drive them, but if you want some good sound on a budget these speakers with built-in amp will treat you well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I steal a lot of songs","review":"Father: you got the chord there budSon: I think soFather: My father showed me this one back in the days goes something like this, ready sonSon: I think soFather: you can go firstSon: no, you go ahead daddy, I like to copyFather: Hey there son, we are going to looseI said son, you are going to looseYou are going to loose, all your houses you cars and your womanSon: That's OK cuz all I gotto do I just ask some body to write for meFather: I steal a lot of songs; I said I steal a lot of songs from other writers in the worldI even tried to get your girl but I got no gainSon: I gotto ask Cruz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go buy a different book!","review":"Our school ordered tens of copies of this book for our AP Chem class, and it wasn't helpful at all!

Brilliant band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful return from Curve","review":"A return after a 5 year absence sees no decrease in quality. It all starts off with the single 'Chinese Burn', a thunderous rhythm track, all beats and vitriolic lyrics. 'Coming Up Roses' is one of my favourite Curve tracks. Quite reserved in terms of noise, no wall of sound etc. It features textured electronic analogs along with a pounding drum loop.'Something Familiar' is a pure pop/rock track. Chiming guitars combine with more aggressive guitars to form a strong, powerful song. Other highlights include the fast paced 'Sweetback' and the albums' last track 'Recovery', which leaves us wanting more.An extremely underrated album mainly due to the fact that in 1998 the music world was disintegrating into the whole boy-band and girl-band hell it is now. Well it's their loss, Curve will always have a strong following no matter what because they are one of the few talented and genuine music groups out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull drone of an album...","review":"I have both \\"Doppleganger\\" and \\"Cuckoo\\"; They are both thoughtful driving albums.

Cuckoo, their last album in 1993, hinted at a decline, but now in retrospect is more solid than this disaster.I got the early CD single \\"Chinese Burn\\" and was mostly unimpressed, although some of the remixes were marginal. This album confirms that Curve is presently \\"behind the curve\\" and has lost it. Shame, too, because Dean & Toni really had something going in the early 90's with the fusion of hard rock/dance beat/and mysterious girl singing.Garbage is a band that has been noted for picking up the \\"Curve sound\\" with their debut release. I always regarded Garbage as \\"Curve-lite\\", unfortunately Come Clean is \\"Wan Garbage\\". The songs have nothing interesting about them. The sound is \\"too hard\\" and too programmed.

Reese Barnett is a Sheriff and former lover of Neely's. When Reese's cousin asks him to help hide her he agrees before he knows who she is. When he realizes it's her he isn't too happy about it. Actually he's downright ugly about the whole thing. The story was very emotional because they each felt the other had let them down nine years before causing their bitter break-up. Over the course of the time she's under his protection,they begin to reveal their sides of the incident that caused the death of the wife of one of her former clients and a woman Reese had sworn to protect and try to come to an understanding of the events that led up to it. I had a hard time at first because I was so taken back by Reese's behavior and resentment, but I couldn't put it down.

Neither Reese or Neely want it as they still each blame the other. Over their time together they begin to understand what really happened.I would have given this a five but I just had a hard time stomaching Reese's behavior. He left Neely bleeding in the street, not knowing if she was dead or alive, and never tried to find out if she survived in nine years?

Even though he was wrong, and knowing he still hates her after nine years. After his betrayal and treatment, what's left to love about him? Yes, she did defend herself and stand up to him a bit, but to still be in love with him?

Listening to Korngold's Op.1, you'd never suspect he was 12 years old when he composed it. It's the work of a mature composer, albeit one who would go on to find more of his own voice. But that's the case with all great artists of course. And Zemlinksy's works are always ingenious and rewarding. The professional relationship between these two composers makes the relationship between these two trios all the more interesting. As usual, the Beaux Arts Trio plays impeccably and Philips has created a magnificent recording. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are a lot better trios available than these.","review":"If I wrote a piano trio, my first choice would be to have it interpreted by the Beaux Arts Trio. Their skill and finesse is beyond compare. Their considerable talents, nonetheless, fail to elevate these trios to the same exalted level of the finest of Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Hummel, etc. I found listening to these two trios more of a chore than a pleasure. While the proficiency of Korngold and Zemlinsky is without question, I find their lack of exceptional melodic moments reduced my listening experience to one of desiring these compositions to be over and done with as soon as possible. Perhaps others with more sophisticated tastes than mine might find some redeeming moments in these pieces; but these recordings did not work for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Rip Off or Huge Mistake!

The group has since undergone many different members. What we have here is a poor recording with woefully bad singers done in the late 90's.

Apart from the translation of the verses in the first 10 chapters of Genesis, there are some magnificent commentaries by Shabaz Britten Best, and it simply makes you wonder!

Once again Amazon comes through for me!***Updated 11/17/12I first wrote this review awhile back, spring I think. Since then I have purchased a new phone altogether, but while I was using this product throughout that period, I decided to update this review. Basically my review is going to repeat what everyone else here has already said. This battery is pure rubbish! Is started out decent at first, but by the time you get a couple of weeks into using it, you're lucky if it can even hold a charge for more than a day (not in use with calls) and no more than a few hours (in use with calls).

They said they would reimburse and did, though it took quite awhile.I bought another from another firm for just over three bucks and I am not happy with it as it is not acting like I recall new batteries are supposed to. I feel like I need to go up the road and pay $37.50 for a good one, but I'll give it a bit more time, though the battery is not lasting long at all.I guess the old adage of 'you get what you pay for' is in play here with these very inexpensive batteries?"},{"rating":"1","title":"suspect it was used","review":"Whenever a deal seems too good to be true it probably is, I should know that.

While checking out the phone, the Cellcom tech immediately noticed something fishy about the battery. He noticed it was bulging slightly and questioned where the battery came from. He said the cells inside were coming apart or something like that and this is what was causing the case to bulge. He ended up needing a new phone so I will never know how long this battery would have lasted.

This is another great set, with some classic episodes that were left off of volume 1 and some generally zany and surrealistic ones, many of which I have never seen before. I didn't like this one as well as volume 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) too many cartoons with the same characters on each DVD. I prefer when they get mixed up, rather than sitting through a bunch of Tweety and Sylvesters all in a row. And 2) too many cartoons that have obscure references (such as old Hollywood stars and popular literature from the early 20th century) that kids just won't get -- and you probably won't either. If you don't have volume 1, get that one. If you do, then go ahead and get this one. It is a worthy addition to your cartoon library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looney Tunes are great!","review":"This set has a lot of roadrunner, tweety, and older shorts of not so popular cartoon characters.

A time when parents got up and watched cartoons WITH their children, and everyone enjoyed them. Today, cartoons are mostly for adult viewing. They teach kids about fighting and blood spurting from wounds, or that backtalting parents, bad language etc. is acceptable behavior. Granted that there is violence in these cartoons as well, but the caliber is much lower, and not nearly as likely to be imitated by children. It's time to go back to basics....back to Bugs!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile collection of classics","review":"These Looney Tunes cartoons are priceless. The artwork is rich and extremely well executed and the wit, the humor and the general foolishness stand the test of time just fine.

I mean, at first, the governess and lord plot was interesting and somewhat refreshing. But after basing her last 6 books on this governess-lord plot, don't you think that it is quite enough? I mean, the first 3, \\"Rules of Attraction\\", \\"Rules of Engagement\\" and \\"Rules of Surrender\\" were pretty good, but then I got kind of weary of this plot, and then it just all became a formula. I know Dodd is a very talented writer, but after 6 books, don't you think she should just take a break and start on something else? It's like the Cynster, after the first 6 books, the rest just seems like a formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL, ANOTHER GREAT STORY","review":"This is my third book by Christina Dodd. She is my new favorite author, I can not believe she has written so many books and I didn't know of her. I loved Samantha so caring and wonderful to the children.

Another great love story for those people who love romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"The writing verges on purple prose. The characters are cartoonish. It's embarrasing because Dodd's earlier books were very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorblimey! Christina Dodd keeps getting better....","review":"I have been a big fan of Christina Dodd's governess series from the first book. Each time I read one I think, there's no way she can write a better one, she has peaked. Then, she goes and proves me wrong. I truly loved MY FAVORITE BRIDE. The heroine was sassy and sweet, the kind of woman you want to be friends with. The hero was dark and enigmatic enough to be really appealing. And, as always, Ms. Dodd develops her scenes in a way that make the reader feel as if she has fallen through a time warp and landed in the scene.I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Dodd at a writer's conference last year. She was such a kind and generous person. I believe those qualities bleed over into her writing.More governess books, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Snuff","review":"While I usually love Christina Dodd's books, this one left me rather empty. I didn't know going into it that it was an homage to \\"The Sound of Music\\" and felt that the parallels were hamfisted at best. I plan to read the others in this series, just to get a comparison - and I remain hopeful that they will prove better than this one. If you want to read a story for an afternoon's diversion that you do not have to think about, this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favorite Bride--Nasty Groom","review":"I have read many of Christina Dodd's books, and like most of the other reviews believe she should steer clear of movie plots and try a little harder to be original. However, this is not why I didn't like this book. Although it was a quick, fast read--I didn't like the relationship with the two main characters. I felt like William was too easily forgiven. He was a JERK and didn't deserve the quick forgivness. I don't expect a lot of realistic stuff in my romance novels, but no way I would have forgiven him so quickly. This took away from the book and from the heroine. All in all this book annoyed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sound of Music?","review":"Ms. Dodd is one of my favorite writers, but I didn't enjoy this book at all. Although well written in her usual style, I found the obvious \\"borrowing\\" from the Von Trapp family in rather poor taste. These were *real* people. This wasn't a fairytale. I recently read \\"Lair of the Lion\\" from Christina Feehan and I wasn't at all bothered by her \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" story because it not the same thing.If Ms. Dodd wanted to use this story she darn well should have acknowledged it in the credits. I was absolutely *floored* to read her \\"Any resemblance to actual events is purely coincidental.\\" How on earth do you put that on a book that is obviously is anything but?Unless you like *real people* fanfiction, or haven't had the pleasure of seeing \\"The Sound of Music,\\" I don't suggest you waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother.","review":"Usually I love Christina Dodd. Well I used to. I admit I haven't read her in a while. I haven't been up to date with any of her Governess Brides series. And maybe I should not have jumped into book 6 but I did, and I wish I had not even bothered to finish it. I hated the heroine, and the hero was a pompous ass that was so self absorbed it was hard to read. The plot was weak, thin, and boring. None of the side cast had personality. Zero heat between the couple. The love scenes were boring, I skipped over them, and that is a bad sign. I was annoyed that \\"strong independent\\" Heroine falls in love in less than 2 days with hero, with almost zero interaction between them. How can you fall for someone after a few words and a quick kiss? In short if you like mindless tripe with no plot and boring characters and love scenes that are filler rather than steamy, then you will love this book. If you are smart though, you will stick to Dodd's earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catering like an idiot","review":"This book is a collection of vague and uninformative quotes, dated menus, and common sense advice. One word for Ms Halvorsen, ICE. The details of coffee and tea service are poured over, yet, at no time does the book remind the would-be caterer to buy ice! It is amazing that in such a competitive publishing world that books like this are written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"The Silence of the Lambs remains one of the greatest crime thrillers of all time, and any real DVD collector needs this special edition. Hannibal is also a good movie, not in the same ballpark as the first one, but well worth it anyway. Silence: 5 stars. Hannibal: 3 and a half stars. Also be sure to check out the excellent \\"Red Dragon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 DVD is Worthwhile","review":"The Silence of the Lambs is a great film that makes you scared but makes you think. Hannibal just makes you numb from the onslaught of disgusting and griesome acts, like Passion of the Christ. I guess nothing will ever be rated NC-17 for gruesome violence and depravity.

Every 10 to 20 odd seconds, there are 'glitches' or 'holes' in the recording making the video totally un-watchable.Anthony Walmsley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhythms of the heart","review":"This C.D. has a wonderful mixture of jazz rhythms and creations. Regina Carter is extremely talented and has developed into a confident jazz violinist. She is also accompanied by extremely talented musicians inall the selections. I hadn't heard it before I bought it, but I'm very happy with this C.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"Actually 2 and 1/2 stars. I agree with two of the reviewers below that Ms. Carter is better in concert than on this record, but I seem to be more disappointed than they with the difference. Her playing here is restrained, simplistic, detached, unemotional. Her violin's tone sounds boxy. There is a profusion of \\"guest stars\\" here and no sense of a band cohering. (Her real pianist is better than Kenny Barron.) I could go on, but I think you get the idea: this is a commercially compromised, timid, halting, uninspired effort.I can only recommend you see the real Regina Carter in concert, and in the mean time pick up these two jazz records featuring violin: The Mahavishnu Orchestra's \\"Birds of Fire\\" and Shakti's \\"Natural Elements\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sounds","review":"Vendor sent CD as promised with a case that was cracked as reported from the vendor but the CD is in great playing shape. I would order from this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"The camera is excellent, the quality of the photos and video is very good but the only bad thing is that you can not use the zoom with video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"I've had this camera a while, got it for high school graduation. Normally, cameras get dated within a year, but this camera is so much nicer that a lot of other similarly priced newer cameras. It's AWESOME. The screen is big and crystal clear, the picture quality is amazing, the blur/motion settings are really good and it's tiny, so it fits in my purse and goes with me everywhere. I didn't think it was durable but friend dropped mine pretty hard once and nothing happened (not that I'm saying I would recommend dropping it...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I have been using this camera for over a month now. I give it 5 stars for: picture quality, build quality, and price. This is a state of the art point and shoot camera. 7.2 MP, Leica Lens for under $200? Bang for the buck is very impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"mmmm....","review":"well, great photos, i found it to be incredibly user friendly & intuitive... but the thing died in 3 weeks. took some gorgeous shots on the california coast, not in the rain, not in the snow, simply a few days during weather in the low 60's with some breeze... not even any sand whizzing around. and now the mechanism that extends and retracts the lens has locked up. nuts. sent an inquiry for replacement and all i got was a \\"we received your inquiry and are currently in processing. we will contact you shortly\\"... that was 10 days ago. i never imagined a digital camera would be quite THIS fragile... maybe i just got a bum one... ??... hoping i get a replacement before (a potentially last) christmas dinner with my sick grandfather..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but....no thank you","review":"I initially went to the store to purchase a Canon 870 is but I fell in love with Lumix as soon as a saw it.It had a wide Leica lens, large LCD, slim body and attractive colors.I purchased it right away and left for my vacation on the next day.After a great day of sightseeing in the foreign land I found an Internet café. Great place to send e-mails and pictures to the family and let them know that we made it and that we are having fun....We paid for 5Minutes of internet and a nice man gave us the USB connector to upload photos.RATS......this camera DOES NOT USE USB CONNECTOR. It uses something (whatever that is) ELSE.....My first instinct was to take the card out and smash the camera but I decided to give it to one of my less liked relatives. Have him carry a (whatever that is) cable around the world..I am going back to get myself a Canon...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Camera","review":"The carrying case is nice and it came on time but the digital camera didn't so I had to return both.We paid for express shipment and they shipped it ground. The camera came when we were gone. My husband had to buy a new camera. Please credit our Credit card."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pictures","review":"I was thinking about buying leica instead of lumix. This camera does the same job for half the money.I am sure there are differences but, after all it is a point and shoot camera.Wide angle makes a big difference.I don't know why people still using 35mm's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very impressive little camera","review":"I bought this camera primarily because of the wide-angle lens and the image stabilization, as well as the reputation of the Leica lens. I'm not an avid photographer, but I wanted something small and easy to use, and this camera is certainly that. The controls are very intuitive and the instruction manual explains the more advanced features very clearly. I'm very pleased with the quality of the landscape shots and portraits I've done so far. Everything about the Lumix is amazingly compact; you can pop it into a shirt pocket or into a pocket of your cargo shorts, and take it everywhere, and it's so light that it's easy to forget that it's there....I worry about accidentally putting it through the washing machine someday. There may be better cameras if you need and use a lot of advanced features, but this little gem has been perfect for my needs. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lumix camera","review":"great deal at $166. not as intuitive to use until you get used to wheel to set modes. i cannot see small symbols on wheel without glasses. screen is nice and big, but lack of viewfinder makes it harder for outdoor shots in sunlight. excellent battery life. fabulous quality pictures with no blur. excellent auto fill in flash for backlit outdoor shots. very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for on-the-go pictures.","review":"I got this camera to take on vacation because I didn't want to carry around our larger 35mm camera. It fit right in my pocket and took great pictures. The controls and different modes such as scenery, portrait, etc. are easy to use. Great to bring to restaurants and bars (party setting). My wife now keeps it in her purse and is able to get great candid shots of the kids without having to plan ahead and carry the big camera everywhere. Very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"great versatile point and shoot","review":"Very good pictures without the need for firing up your favorite photo editor. It even allows to take the pictures in various size formats/ratios e.g. 4X6 photo eliminates the need for cropping before printing assuming you framed the shot properly. In my opinion, wide angle lens is more important than any other feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Photos","review":"I've bought this digital camera a month ago, just before going on holidays. I must say this is a great product: easy to use, beautiful photos, small... An only one concern: some options are not easy to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational, hands-on, visually stimulating","review":"We purchased the Human Torso for our 6 year old son, who was constantly entertained by any form of organ or body part model he could get his hands on (dentist office teeth, heart and brain models at our church nurse's office, etc.) I couldn't decided on what single model to purchase, so I bought the whole torso.It is very sturdy, easy to take apart and put back together, colorful, and well made. Price was comparable to single organ models, considering you get the whole body of organs. He was fansinated by it for a short time, but seemed a little embarrassed when a younger friend pointed out it's naked behind.I want to note that it SHOULD have come with an \\"educational cd\\" for the computer, but all that was on the cd was an HTML of other products the company sells. That was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent wrong model","review":"After carefully requesting this model NB-5H, I was hoping to take pictures in december...however, never got the right one, they sent a NB-5L which doesnt even come close to the 5H version. Therefore, I have to rate this with the lowest mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to Adam Tepedelen, this is a great record","review":"This is not so much a record review as it is a reviewer review. I am in full agreement with R. Wyatt. Amazon's editorial reviewer Adam Tepedelen is dead wrong about this record. I wonder if he has any sense of humor at all. This is not a serious record and is not intended to be. I have had it since it came out in 1997 and it remains one of my favorite records. I own many thousands of vinyl records and cd's and I listen to \\"Must've Been High\\" regularly, which is more than I can say for so many other records that I have bought since this one came out. This is a fun record, from a band that does not take itself too seriously. It is not mainstream country by any means. Thank god for that. I wonder what Adam does like? I probably wouldn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick back, enjoy.","review":"This is one album that will really stick in your head for a while. Tracks like \\"Must've Been High\\" and \\"roamin' round\\" make for great Sunday music after a rough weekend, or the drive home from wherever. Musicians will appreciate the effort to go back to the roots of recording (only ten microphones were used in the recording). Overall this is a great album, great guest appearances, and not to shabby for a rock n roll band."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, encourages christians to stand for God","review":"I recently bought Donnie McClurkin's CD, and I have been nothing but blessed! Not only does he sing with the annointing, but he also ministers the word of God and reminds us of His promises. His album is so successful because he has allowed the Holy Spirit to work through him. It's not everyday that one who comes from such a hurtful past rises above it with the strength of the Lord. The favor of God is truly upon his life. I wish him the best and I look forward to his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have been through what I am going through,","review":"What can I say! You got all the Victories.

Donnie puts his whole heart mind and soul into it. the songs that i really like are: Search me Lord, Just a little talk With Jesus, and Stand; which makes me wonna cry everytime i hear it. This man inspires me to acheive my hopes, wants, and dreams. When i pray for my family, I pray for him to. i look up to this man and pray that i can meet him one day. I love this CD and i Love Donnie McClurkin, every time he sings you can tell that he wants to preach and I'm looking forward to hearing a sermon one day!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome You can feel Donnie's love for the Lord in each song","review":"This CD was Awesome, it is truly ordained by the Lord. You could actually feel the presence of the Lord as Donnie sings. Donnie's love for the Lord is evident in every word that he sings."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS PRAISE AND WORSHIP","review":"THe first time I heard Donnie McClurkin he was on TBN singing \\"Stand\\" that song touched me so I called in to TBN to find out who he was.It took me weeks to finally get the CD because the stores were always sold out.When I heard the whole CD I couldnt stop listening to it (I still do).This CD has gotten me through so much.Thank GOD for Pastor Donnie McClurkin."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I gave up looking on store shelves for this one. Thanks to amazon, I was able to get this product in excellent condition, and in time for the event for which it was needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definition of Anointed","review":"I had heard of Donnie McClurkin for about a year before I purchased this CD. As I read the titles of the songs after receiving it, I couldn't believe he'd record an old hymn like \\"Holy,Holy,Holy\\". Well, let me tell you, I have sung this song for years in church, and was never especially moved by it. But this rendition moved me to tears. I mean not just tears, I wept, and cried. If you're having problems with what it means to be \\"anointed\\", purchase this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence In Music","review":"Donnie McClurkin's C.D. is awsome. He is definatly a anointed man of God. I especially love the songs Speak to my heart & I want to spend tommorrow here with you. This C.D. has something on it for everyone from the young to the old. Buy this C.D., you will not be disapponted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Want my money back!","review":"I purchased this item in October of last year and has yet to receive my CD.

I've watched the series many times and have returned to it like an old friend. Beats everything else on TV hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Fins","review":"Purchased these fins a year ago to do some snorkeling in Florida. I found them to be very heavy, and not nearly as comfortable as the old full-foot Voit fins I replaced. The rubber foot cup is very rigid, and The ribs on the outer edge of the fins are large and dense, which contributes to the weight. I also had problems with the heel strap slipping off. I had to concentrate on swimming without bending my ankles to keep the fins on. Tightening the heel strap only seemed to make the fins more uncomfortable. If you are interested in a good fin, I would look for one with a full foot cup that's soft and pliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work, had to return","review":"the movie itself is great, I purchased it after watching it on netflix. Unfortunately, the dvd didn't work at all. I tried it on 3 players. I contacted the company and they didn't have a replacement. Fortunately, a Norwegian friend of mine enjoys re-enacting scenes from the movie at dinner parties. Less fortunately, I don't speak Norwegian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock and Roll Concert","review":"I had rock and roll people for years tell me that Mylene Farmer had the best concert. So I thought that I would check it out. They are right. This is overall the best rock and roll concert. I love the DVD! I have the audio CDs too! But I would call it more french pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK, but be careful","review":"This radar detector does seem to work well, but sometimes your safe response time can be really short. Whenever it alerts, slow down immediately. I got cocky and took about 2.5 seconds to gradually slow down, and I got a ticket. So, always slam on the brakes immediately whenever there's an alert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good!","review":"This is my first radar detector and it has made me very happy so far! I just wish it didn't have too many false alarms though. But when it comes to detecting cops it has not failed once yet. It has very good range. This is good for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the work!","review":"This is a great product for the price. I get a lot of false alarms but that's because I probably need to disable x band... most garage openers and automatic doors trigger the radar... I have yet to see police using x-band around my area. I did not notice a difference between highway/city but you get used to it.... the difference led intensities are good and stealth mode is superb. You get used to it, this will alert you of real threats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detectors okay - Service is is the worst around","review":"The detector had been in use less then 6 months when it died. Sent it back for warranty repair (1 year warranty) and they indicated it was out of warranty because I bought it from an un-authorized dealer. Yet they do not list who is authorized to sell it. If you purchase one you better make sure they are authorized to sell it or you will get no support from Beltronics. They leave it up to the consumer to take on this risk. It would be one thing if they had a list of resellers on their web site, but they don't. They want you to call them to find out if the reseller it authorized before you purchase. I have never dealt with a company like this. They indicated that they did not know how the un-authorized sellers are getting the products so it becomes a customer issues (they did confirm the unit I shipped them was a real Beltronics detector).There are other detectors out there that are as good or better. I would not purchase another one from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally stopped working. Received full refund.","review":"The detector never stopped alerting me. It was constantly going off and there were never any radars in sight. All of sudden it died and never went off anymore. That was after only about 6 weeks. I returned it for full refund. Need I say more. The product I received must have been faulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bel V965","review":"Great sensitivity and very good features especially auto-mute. For the money($150) it's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bel Disappointment","review":"I've also had many detectors and finally decided to spend good money for a detector that I thought would do the job, (not alot of false alerts ect)well I was really disapointed in this detector- 965. Your supposed to be able to turn off the X band to eliminate the annoying alerts your receive on this band,, Well,after turning it off it still gave audio X alerts.(Yes I read the instructions).Way to many false alerts, the unit is heavy and bulky, windshield mount is not a winner either.The best thing about this detector was getting rid of it!! Seriously,as I said above I have had many detectors, (2nd Bel) and I'm not a \\"rookie\\" when it comes to using them, but this one, Bel 965 is bad !! Spend the extra bucks and get the Passport 8500 x50.If you need to fill the space in your glove box or under your seat this is the detector for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I owned 2 Bels before this one. The new mounting system stinks. Previously just snapped on, now I have to pay attention and sometimes use both hands to mount it when I'm driving. Have to push down a button to lock it in and adjust forward/back at the same time. Wouldn't have bought it had I known. Regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable customer service","review":"This is not a review for Mastch VC9805A, but rather a review of experience with Kaito electronics.In short - I would not trust anything they say.After receiving an item I did not order (was not even Mastech brand) I filed a claim with Amazon, because Kaito customer service representative was very rude.In response to my comment Kaito posted a statement that item I received was not wrong.Just a day or two prior to that they sent me an e-mail clearly stating that item I ordered was discontinued; that is why I received an \\"improved\\" version.Amazon was on top of things and I would not hesitate using it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Gal !","review":"Being a lover of medieval history, when I bought this book and sat down to read it I was expecting perhaps, another somewhat dry and unexciting account of the daily life of a medieval woman living in a medieval town. Wow! Was I pleasantly surprised! This little book is a real gem as it recounts, in modern English and in biographical narrative fashion, the travels and tribulations of a truly remarkable, if a bit eccentric, Englishwoman of the 15th century. I especially enjoyed the description of her journey to and sojourn in the Holy Land and her stay in Rome. This woman, who was subject to visions of and visitations from the saints and Jesus, would likely be declared insane today, and she almost was burned as a heretic back then.Her courage and fortitude are truly admirable. Ms. Collis has done a masterful job of weaving quotes from Margery's autobiography with modern English prose to present a lucid and most enjoyable account of this lady. Definitely a two thumbs up book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your worst nightmare of a group tour","review":"Margery Kempe was a woman of the middle ages who aspired to sainthood. As part of this, she went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, to Rome and to Santiago de Compostella. She could neither read nor write, but got others to write her story for her. There is very little about the trip to Santiago; it was practically a trivial trip compared to the others, but it is a fascinating glimpse into the experience of being on pilgrimage in those times.Picture being on an extended group tour with a small group of opinionated and intolerant people, most of who can't stand you, and you may have an idea of this experience. On the other hand, some people really are difficult to be around. After reading this book, pilgrimage of the middle ages is no longer just a fact of history. It puts a real face on a pilgrim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money But Lots Of Pictures","review":"I purchased \\"Prison Tattoos\\" to study gangs and their tattoos. Being interested in law enforcement and part owner of a tattoo shop this book caught my eye. The intro is about 8 pages followed by 60-70 pages of pictures some fuzzy and crude.
