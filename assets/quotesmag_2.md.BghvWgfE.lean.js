Honestly, it takes a moment to build up steam, but as soon as it gets going there's no stopping it. It does a great job of providing some crude, vulgar humor(which we all love) and blending it with a lot of spot on political commentary. After the jab Ferrell and McKay had at Wall Street with The Other Guys, and now knocking politics down a peg or two, I find myself looking forward to whatever these to gents decide to caress together.

How about your co-worker sleeping with your wife or girlfriend when you get the promotion and he didn't. I don't see any humor in that at all.

I'm not sure that his character has an official job title, but Smarmy Image Consultant works for me. Zack's character is endearing & very likable mostly due to his naivete and spot-on moral compass. Will Farrell excellently portrayed a bumbling hedonistic ass-clown. I've never used that phrase before, but it's fitting for this description. The film was full of cheap shots and simple minded fun.

I didn't want to cheer for either charater, and their families were equally off-putting. The jokes about religion, adultary and 9/11 were just moronic. I feel dumber for listening to a Chinese woman act like a black slave.

Not impressed.","review":"I was so determined to see this movie even though it had so many negative reviews. But I rented it and got about an hour into it and turned it off. Not only is raunchy language used carelessly and distastefully, the movie's portrayal of women is low and unacceptable. They are repeatedly portrayed as sex-crazed and brainless. I don't know about other people, but that's not funny to me. Also, the funniest parts of the movie were shown in the trailer, the rest of the film drags. Poking fun at bad behavior, religion, and politics can be done in good taste for a laugh, but here it's just crude and cruel, and the genuine laughs are limited to just a few scenes. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strategery","review":"This was a movie that I could only laugh at.

Trying to make a point about today's political system, the influence of money and the making of a candidate is great. But you still need some smart writing and actual humor to make it worthwhile.

Ferrell is making hay while the sun shines. Juvenile trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Ferrell passed his peak a long time ago","review":"This was another one of the movies I watched that looked funny from the preview, and I did find a couple funny moments but really found that the humor just wasn't there. This isn't the right kind of movie for young teens, like your 13 year old kids, at least I wouldn't have my kids watch it when they were that young. I really must say that the first couple movies I saw Will Ferrell in he seemed very funny, but the most of the latest ones he is in like this one just make me wish I never watched them. I like to remember him as a funny guy who made me enjoy laughing with my family in Elf, not tasteless brainless crap encouraging or glorifying bad social behavior. maybe I am missing something, but trying to make humor of punching a baby, and dog by accident just didn't work in anyway you try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video quality poor","review":"Purchased as streaming video.

Why all the cursing and why all the stupid and gross sexual jokes? I've watched Will Farrell's \\"Land of The Lost\\" and \\"Bad Guys\\" and I must say that they are not even remotely as vulgar as \\"The Campaign\\". The whole movie proceeded with mocking Christianity and displaying total family deterioration coupled with vulgar language beyond even worldly norms accepted nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie!","review":"This movie was funny and so true to what is seen during election campaigns. It is too bad that our real life campaigns are not able to end in the same manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"Aweful. I've always been a fan of Will Ferrell, but it seems that He'll no longer do any comedy movies that won't be trying too hard to be crass. Granted I'm still a fan of Talladega Nights and Anchor Man, seems the roles he's been cast in are just trying to rehash those same characters into a new more disgusting mold. I wouldn't waist your time. There were some funny parts, but none of them made up for the lack of thought put into this movie. No subtle jokes and a truck load of in-your-face crude joking that I probably too often extend my patience for because I've been a fan of Will Ferrell.

Don't miss out!","review":"\\"While not as potentially convincing as a Michael Moore, Robert Redford/Alan J. Pakula, or Oliver Stone piece, it still packs a punch through its over-the-top sense of humour, cutting/sometimes offensive jokes, and corny political satire within the character's means to win at the ballots and polls. Relative to this election year's Obama v. Romney hullabaloo, it can be said that the story and the irony of the situations occurring all make sense and feel more intriguing to the smarter eye than Anchorman or Talladega Nights ever channeled through.

I was hoping for big laughs here and instead got a few chuckles. Nothing more than a truck load of sexual jokes and bad humor that involves punching a baby. Not funny in my book. I've liked Zach Galafianakis in his previous work and Will is generally funny but this movie just didn't work for me. I felt it was loaded with cheap humor and the writers really didn't dig very deep to get some good material to represent the talent of these two actors.

It represents new career low points for Will Ferrell, Zach Galifinakis & Jason Sudekis, who seem like they're in a contest to see who can make the audience wince the most with one mean-spirited, unfunny, dumb & dirty joke after another. The story's resolution is no more satisfying than the jokes - redemption comes not through moral discovery but through eye-rollingly phony plot twists, because it's time to wrap this thing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"crude and cheap humor","review":"The quality of this instant stream was fine after the first few minutes, but overall the content of this movie I would not recommend to anyone. I'm not even uptight about adult content, I just get tired of my senses and intelligence being insulted by humor that is dependent entirely on impressing the audience with raunchiness and/or absurdity.

Jason Sudeikis and Dylan McDermott do some strong work in this but Aykroyd and Lithgow are caricatures not real people that we should really inform ourselves about. I am a liberal Democrat. This is a lame SNL one-joke skit that doesn't end mercifully after 5-7 grueling minutes but drags on and on belaboring the message that the American public is stupid, easily manipulated and big business is laughing (and profiting) from our folly.

This book, in fact, reinforces the \\"ugly American\\" stereotype Europeans use when describing us. There are numerous errors in the book. For example, Alemania, alemmanic, and derivative words do not originate from the French word for Germany...it originates from the name of the ancient tribes who populated the area centuries before there was a German or French language.Too bad.

The Extech has a calibration screw in the back so I tried calibrating it to match my other hygrometer but the screw doesnt even do anything!!! It just pointlessly TURNS!

The same thing happens if you shoot the paint too fast and I'm not talking about going auto, just shooting quickly in semi auto can break the paintballs when they're getting loaded up.

In his unpassionate Canio, there is no fire, no sturm und drang, only the occasional yelp that signifies severe distress.Luckily, Canio has little to sing beyond his major arias, and Bocelli is surrounded by a compitant (if not wonderful) supporting cast, who manage to weather their below-standard Canio and also their lackluster Conductor. Both Baritones are unexceptional but unobjectionable (the Silvo does some very nice work in the love duet) and the Beppe (a part Bocelli COULD pull off if he wanted to) is sweet-voiced. The Nedda, Ana Maria Martinez, is actually quite good, and it's a shame to see her opposite such a dire leading man.

The price prompted me to take a chance. I'm glad I did! The camera formated it without a hitch. Used 8M for system and left 244 M usable for pictures. It downloaded and reformated with out a hitch.

I just bought the Canon Powershot G2 Digital Camera and it came with a 32 MB CompactFlash card that barely held 10 pictures at the highest resolution. I needed more capacity, but I wanted to buy a card that was compatible with my camera as well as my MP3 player. It was interesting to note that the 32 MB CF card that was included by Canon was made by SanDisk. That convinced me and I ended up buying the 256 MB CF card and it has worked just amazingly well in my camera.I love this CompactFlash card as it is so small, and versatile. If you plan on buying the 256 MB CF card, I would also recommend buying the Sandisk Imagemate USB CompactFlash Card Reader (SDDR-31).

The wonder and magic of this classic myth are expressed in beautiful language that is remarkably easy to read. The story is conveyed without the poetic langauge being mauled, and without the language itself getting in the way of the tale. I find it encouraging that a young reader found the story \\"disgusting\\" and \\"gory\\". The tale is indeed both gory and violent. With so many translations, however, the adventure is lost because the reader becomes tangled in a maze of archaic language and puzzling prose techniques designed to mimic the Greek. Kudos to Fagles for bringing The Odyssey back to the people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the translation advertised on website; by Butler, not Fagles","review":"This may be a fabulous version translated by some guy named Butler.

In addition, some of the musical transitions between books were piercing in tone - very difficult to listen to.

The translation is good, and is very poetic yet easy to read. The verse form has been maintained and reminds the reader that this was originally a verse, and not a prose narrative. The binding is tight and attractive, with thick sturdy pages, and with \\"ruffled\\" unfinished edges, giving the book an older feel, and making pages easier to grip and turn. I recommend this version, if you're considering buying The Odyssey for your library.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the rhythm of heroic adventure","review":"This translation just sweeps you away.

If you have any interest in the subject whatsoever, no recommendation is too lavish. Some reviewers have stated a preference for other translations, and this leads me to make two points: First of all, most of you buying this book are probably not meeting the Iliad for the first time. Secondly, Homer's world is so removed from our own that it is very helpful to view it through the eyes of several translators.Unfortunately, some reviewers were as young as High School freshmen. Of course, they were unable to place the book in context, and were frustrated by the attempt. I had the same experience with Dante. Don't give up! The Greeks constitute one of the four legs of Western civilization, and without some understanding of what out connection to them involves, there will always be a gaping hole in your education."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD didn't work","review":"The CD arrived without a case.

You never really get to feel good or bad about Odysseus' character, and the only one you do feel sorry for is Penelopia, his faithful wife who must choose to keep her promise and marry someone else, or stay faithfulto Odysseus.

There is a long introduction that explains the nature of the Greek gods, some of the thematic elements to look out for, a description of Homer and the context in which the book was written, and is generally a great reference, especially for those who have little experience with Greek literature. The language has been translated so as to maintain the integrity of the story while making in intelligible. Be aware, this is not light reading, and don't be ashamed to keep a dictionary and guide at hand.But most importantly, let yourself become immersed in the story. Don't read it like a history book, and don't blow it off if it is assigned reading. Endure the emotional journey with Odysseus, search for understanding with Telemachus. Investigate the story; a tale that survived this long should have made its mark on our society.

The tales compliment and in some small way confirm each of mankinds dealing with the unknown at that period of history. To have the background of reading the Bible, Homer, Romans, Voltaire, etc. is to truly come to grips with an individual religion and God, versus, a rote learned Higher Power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great masterpiece by an ancient Greek slave","review":"This book is another wonderful epic poem crafted by the great Homer. This one outlines Odysseus' troubles getting back to Greece after fighting in the Trojan War. This is a purely exciting adventure story that has captivated generations. Odysseus has become a folk hero in modern literature. It is also a love story that is extremely touching in it's scope. We meet some truly wonderful and horrific characters in this story.

A beautiful blonde with long beautiful legs, Haver exhibited a rare combination of talent, vitality, and innocent charm. None of her films -- including this one -- were great, but all of her films were fun to watch. After her contract with Fox expired, Haver -- never obsessed with the artificial glamour of Hollywood -- dropped out of movies and entered a convent. Several months later she left the convent but did not return to movies. Instead she married Fred McMurray, to whom she remained married until his death. Unfortunately, not many of June Haver's movies are currently available on VHS and none are available yet on DVD.

Grab this with Stone Temple Pilots' \\"Shagri-la Dee Da\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully crafted and somewhat eccentric pop masterpiece","review":"Most of the negative reviews I read herein seem to be from Silverchair fans who were looking for more of the same. I happened across this CD by accident and I love the innovation in the songs, the lovely-and-not-overbearing use of harmonies, and the bits of humor here and there. Look, what's not to love about a recording that includes the lines \\"All of this time on my hands, so far has gone, to feeding my animals\\"?Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album won't sell well in America! D'OH!","review":"That being said, it's a damn shame. With so many crappy artists out there nowadays, it's hard to find something good, let alone something DIFFERENT. This album has both going for it. The problem is, we here in the US of A are into **cringe** Hilary Duff, Lil' Flip, Chingy, etc. IT WON'T SELL, but it's one of the best albums along in a while...it uses several different musical styles, including even waltzing. Stay away if you shut your brain off while listening to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing since Jellyfish","review":"Only Elbow is putting out this kind of lilting pop these days. And I think these two might be even better. Beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daniel Johns must be absent","review":"I only listened to clips of a few songs on this album and it made me ill. Maybe Daniel Johns has an evil clone that is taking over his life. The music isn't horrible if you haven't previously listened to ANYTHING EVER done by Silverchair. It kinda sounds like maybe Johns' girlfriend had some input on this album. Silverchair is a great band, and Johns could have done something more \\"alternatively\\" based. I hope that Silverchair fans don't go insane over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"...and the two powers combine","review":"A side project, a joke - call it whatever you want. Two musicians, successful in their own right collaberating towards something they havent individually persued. How many people have the guts to do it without seeming plush or arrogant? And further more, how many succeed? Very few.The Dissociatives have made an album thats in many ways disturbing but positive, a melancholy art-pop mix that proves why Paul Mac and Daniel Johns have been regarded so highly as they are.Personal favourites are \\"Horror With Eyeballs\\", mixing a circus-like verse with a lush melodical chorus, and closer \\"Sleep Well Tonight\\" which wouldve been a fitting close to Silverchair's \\"Diorama\\". Think of the difference between \\"Neon Ballroom\\" to \\"Diorama\\", thats the kind of comparison to judge between \\"I Cant Believe Its Not Rock\\" and this album.The Dissociatives are no joke, and will take some getting used to (more so from a lyrical point of view) but its well worth a listen"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"are you kidding? big breakthough i think with this cd, its very beautiful and uplifting and needs to be heard. johns work with silverchair was great, but mostly with certain songs on neon ballroom and most of diorama... however, silverchair were always missing something in my opinion.. although diorama is kind of a classic.. anyways, this is a nice step forward and definitely not missing much, cant wait to hear more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its like poison in my ears","review":"I gave this cd a 2star rating just because if you close your eyes and pretend real hard it almost sounds like Silverchair!I am such a big fan of Silverchair and understand that a sideways venture for Daniel Johns is a fun project but I dare anyone to find a song on this album that comes close to any Silverchair classic!!! It honestly sounds like some 2 bit pop rubbish!I hope some popsters get a kick from this but it makes my skin ripple with anger!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"complete\\" history of NM","review":"I purchased this book for myself and 6 of our neighbors as a Christmas gift. I read the book after I gave the book to the 6 neighbors. Had I read the book before giving it as a gift, I would never have given the book as a gift. I was most disappointed in the contents, the style selected for writing the \\"fiction\\", and the difficulty in following the author's purpose.

Her stories are inovative and the nagic involved is not sterotyped. Her tales tend to have a hint of horror but not to excess. I found it a good read. By the by, some people may consider her to be a \\"young adult\\" author but I don't believe in passing up a good story written since I was the \\"right\\" age (I am sixty-three.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice quick read","review":"This is not my favorite Patricia Briggs novel, however it is still a fun easy read. I would recommend it especially if you are new to this author then get into her other works especially Mercy Thompson series."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy fantasy...","review":"This book han an intresting premise and a fascinating enough world and characters. For me it was an okay book, not exceptional, but decent. I think I might be influenced by the fact that I've read a lot of Briggs resent work before this book, and I find that she has developed forward as a writer, which is how it's supposed to be.I don't normally give 5 stars to book, unless it's book I'd buy again if I lost it, or it's just that good I'd be willing to buy it in hardback, as well. This one isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, however I found the beginning to be just a tad bit slow but once I got into it, it was hard to put down. I don't want to give too much away so I will keep it short. The book is about a young woman who uses her \\"magic\\" and the help of the Hob to save her village. The book has some good curve balls thrown in to keep the story interesting and from becoming too predictable (and it even has a little bit of romance). I really love the character of the Hob, he made the book for me. This is one of those books I could see myself reading again in a few years. This is the second Patricia Briggs book that I have read, (the first was about Werewolves) and I was satisfied with both books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only work by Patricia Briggs that disappointed me","review":"Since the other reviewers did great job summarizing and specifying good points and bad points about this book, I will just make a comment. I am a big fan of Patricia Briggs and read all of her books (i.e. ones that are available). I enjoyed all of her books EXCEPT for this one. I don't mind the simplicity of a plot as long as there are a great character development and wonderful diaglogues. I was unable to connect with the main characters. I just did not care what happened to them. To me, it was very slow paced and well...boring. Please don't judge the work by Patricia Briggs by this book. She is a great author and is one of my favorites. In my opionion, this book was just not upto her usual standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"True fantastical adventure","review":"This was a quite keen little story. The story while having it's adventurous moments didn't move past showing off the things that made the characters human and real. Aren comes off as a quite real woman of the times. Her true heroicness is shown from the beginning and never waivers. She doesn't make an 180 in terms of personality she just continues to be herself and that's what makes this book great. Even the hob shows his true feelings and makes the reader symphathise with him. Great book. I can't wait to read more from her!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This was a very enjoyable book containing the highs and lows that I so love in fiction. As mentioned in another critique, not everything is spelled out in this book. Patricia Briggs left a lot of things unsaid, which in turn makes the reader stop and think. I personally prefer that leeway to interpret and imagine things to suit my own taste. If you want everything in your fantasy novel to be cut and dry and all laid bare, this one is not for you. Having said that, I can see myself re-reading this book many times in the future, and enjoying it every time!What it's got:Creatures of fantasy and mythThe whole range of emotions: love, hate, hope, despair, and most importantly humor, as well as everything in betweenA soft and sweet love story"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Tale","review":"Patricia Briggs will quickly climb to the top of your favorite authors list. I know she did mine; why, I am only missing \\"When Demons Walk\\" at this moment.The Hob's Bargain is an excellent fairy tale, full of the normal bargains, good versus evil, misconceptions, truth, love, and good will overcome. Briggs weaves a wonderful tale that will whisk you away. You will find yourself not wanting it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sets the Standard for Fantasy Reading","review":"Wow. I never thought I could enjoy anyone's books as much as Patricia Briggs. Though detailed landscapes, storylines, and wonderful characters, she sets the standard with which to read short fantasy. This book is great to read over and over-- just to catch everything you missed the first, second, or third times; it's a fulfilling and amazing read. It begins with a woman imbued with magic in a land deviod of magic. When the magic returns, so do all the creatures that thrive in it.... And it continues from there. Overall, I think it's a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old made new again","review":"As magic returns to the land, supernatural creatures both good and bad - including the Hob himself -arise from their slumber to roam the earth again. This brings about the bargain in the title which is a new take on an old idea: In exchange for the Hob's help, he wants a bride in return.This fairy tale premise could be sappy but, with a no-nonsense heroine, Aren, who has faced her share of tragedy and come out stronger for it, the story works very naturally. While there is plenty of magic and action, this is essentially a romance. The Hob (a solidly built supernatural creature with blue fur and a tail - I'm thinking Marvel Beast and Nightcrawler rolled into one) and Aren are a good match. He gives her acceptance and helps develop her powers and she helps him find something to live for by giving him someone to care about again. Along the way they manage to battle evil blood mages and save the largely unworthy village from destruction.A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasing Fantasy Elements--but Ho-Hum...","review":"I thought I would like this. It's a variation on Beauty and Beast tales, which always seem to hit a soft spot with me. However, nothing seemed to gel in this story. The heroine--a perfectly NICE girl, I'm sure, never gained my sympathy nor interest, despite BAD things happening to her (perhaps I hate being so obviously manipulated? Yes, she goes through a lot; I feel bad; she's still not fleshed-out enough to get me to really care about her and what happens to her). The world seemed limited to one valley (definitely limited after magical changes seal the valley off from the rest of the kingdom... but even BEFORE that--I get no concept at all of the world this story is set in). The Hob. Could be very neat. But, again, no quirks of personality that made him interesting or unique.I read the book through, which means that it wasn't awful. It was OK as a fantasy goes. 'Just nothing I'd want to recommend to anyone. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduction to Electronic Circuit Design","review":"The seller advertises this book as if he sells the whole book. What I received was in fact only Part B of a two-part book. The hard cover is the whole book, but the soft cover comes in two parts.

My wife and I can never agree on anything (I like spicy and flavorful, she prefers blander dishes), but we both love every recipe we've tried from this book! The recipes are not too complex to make, most can be completed fairly quickly, they don't require many (if any!) exotic ingredients, and they taste fabulous.The inclusion of complete nutritional information (including fiber, for you Weight Watchers folks who are computing points) is an added bonus.

In the past, I have tried substituting low fat ingredients on old recipes and it never really tasted right. Evelyn's cookbook makes delicious low fat, reduced calorie meals soooo easy to make. The big surprise is that my husband really loves everything we've made from this cookbook. As a comparison he has never been fond of Weight Watcher recipes. I'm ordering all her cookbooks.

So far I've made the Barbecue Chicken Pizza (easy and my kids loved it) Roasted Asparagus (divine) and the Chocolate Cake (unbelievable, really.) What I like so far is that the recipes are easy with uncomplicated ingredients.

The small viewing area defeats any benefit of added magnification. By the way, this originally fit the round eyepieces of the F series cameras.{That should tip you off, it's about 20+ year old technology}.

Actually, Solstice do have their own sound and craft some extremely memorable and poignant melodies. I don't give very many 5's, but Solstice have earned it with their utterly majestic riffs, especially on \\"Cimmerian Codex,\\" \\"Hammer of Damnation,\\" and \\"Cromlech.\\" My two complaints are that the vocals are occasionally inconsistent, maybe even a bit out of tune--some more time spent on production would have helped, and that the lyrics are sometimes unnecessarily obscure. That aside, this is great doom metal, and beyond that, it conjures an unparalleled atmosphere of pre-Conquest Saxon England. This is music for the ancient heptarchy.

On first sight this was very attractive. Unfortunately, this book was a big let-down for me because the author didn't seem to have any inspiring success story to share of how she used her own technique. Nowhere in the book does she mention how she found a partner and the acknowledgements do not include any thank you to a soulmate. Is this the proverbial blind leading the blind?

Attraction is about energy, flow, synchronicity, positive expectation, and being in a state of receiving something wonderful. Dr. McCraw's book is about getting to this state AND doing actions consistent with an objective.

The comic follows Scrooge's exploits throughout the world, from meeting the Beagle Boys, encountering Flintheart Glomgold, founding the town of Duckburg, and meeting his nephews for the first time.

But I think I just broke a blood vessel in my middle finger while attempting to hold the pump square on the presta value for 500 strokes to get to about 70% of the pressure I needed. At least bike shops are like coffee shops here in Portland and I can find someplace with a real pump on the way home.I would like to only post positive reviews, but when something is so poorly implemented, I can only hope to discourage sales of the product and save somebody else some money and headache.

We really wanted a fire pit of some sort. I came across several and this one really appealed to us. It was shipped and received right on schedule and the price was very reasonable. We have only used it a couple of times so far, but we are very happy with it. The only thing I have noticed is that when you put the cover over it (cover came with it) to protect it from the elements a great deal of moisture builds up in the bowl. If you have any ashes in there it's a real mess. But we do live in a very humid area. It also did not sit level after assembly. One more thing, I like how the rim does not get that hot. Nice if you have small children or animals. For the price, I would recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"More inferior Chinese workmanship","review":"We ordered the CobraCo FB6132 Fire Pit, and it arrived quickly on Prime. Very disappointed that the bowl itself doesn't even come close to the one pictured on Amazon or on the photo on the box. I knew it wasn't \\"real\\" copper, but the finish should have at least TRIED to look like copper. It is just a lousy black paint job over something that looks like copper colored paint. What kind of toxic haze will the paint cause when exposed to the fire? Haven't had it long enough for rust to set in, but we are in FL where it is very humid sometimes so I do expect it to rust based on other reviews here. We too experienced issues with matching up the support pieces - the holes aren't lined up properly. I am really tired of stuff from China - no quality control at all. I would like to have them send a bowl that actually looks like the photo, but that might be more trouble than it's worth if the finish burns off anyway. I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible cover = Signs of Rust in 10 days","review":"This was a gift to us, but as soon as we put it out with the cover on, we found the bowl completely filled with water after rain storms.

It also came with a 2inch crack in one side of the ledge, but we didn't want to bother the gift giver and return it, so we're still using it.

I'm frankly amazed by how many famous wrestlers this guy has worked with in his 11-year career as an announcer/ commentator on the pro wrestling circuit -- everyone from Jerry Lawler and Dusty Rhodes to King Kong Bundy and Eddie Guerrero. The best part of this book is the \\"inside\\" stories the author shares about the fantastic wrestling matches he has called, the wrestlers who make up the \\"indie\\" circuits, and the very insightful tips on what makes a \\"good\\" pro wrestler (the answer may surprise you!) Believe me, after reading the two-page Prologue of this book, you will be completely hooked.

He keeps on telling you about shoes, socks, hunting vests, food & habitat of grouse, grouse conservation organizations, feather colors, dogs etc, sitting on a comfortable chair in a room. Just a few blurred scenes of dogs flushing grouse in very thick cover. Only one or two actual shots fired on grouse during total 45 minutes of film. A complete waste money and time. What you expect in a hunting video is the filming of actual hunting scenes. No one is interested in learning basics of upland game.

This product has helped both me and my husband, so that we don't have to deal with back problems any more. If we feel like we are in need of a little stretch we just pull it out and use it for about 5 minutes and we are good to go. The only thing that is a little bothersome, is that it can get uncomfortable after laying on it for a while. When you are going to get up you should do so slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution!!! May cause injury.","review":"I was happily using this product on a daily basis for about three months and noticed that I started getting a pain in the middle of my back. After consulting my chiropractor, he told me that I had pushed one of my thoracic vertebra out of position. It has actualy been pushed inward. Now I have to kick my feet over my head daily to try to move it back into position. I have a smaller frame than most and for me, this piece of equipment hits right in the middle of my back. It would be nice if this product had a smaller size to just do the lower lumbar region.

I returned the other one and ordered in on Amazon instead.This is really a great product. Depending on your back health, the first couple of times you use it may be a little uncomfortable. Not painful, just uncomfortable. But if you use it consistently a couple of times a day for 5 minutes you'll find that your back starts to limber up. There are 3 settings, which basically are 3 degrees of arch. I've had it for about a month and a half now but haven't yet gotten off of the first setting because the directions show you different body positions that you can work up to for better stretch before you move on to each new level. This is a long-term solution for back health and over time, you'll find that your back and lumbar area become more limber with use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I had good experience with a similar though different product (I intentionally don't write its name) and I wanted to try this one - it is absolutely horrible - I returned mine.Problems: It is not rigid enough, it has the wrong shape and the gap it too wide to support the spine - it doesn't even have rubber buttons to stop it from slipping - if you just need a stretch - this may be a good choice, but if you have any problem with the spine or need the spine aligned don't even get close to this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spine so open, you can fight crime!","review":"My father was diagnosed recently with Degenerative Disc Disorder and has been placed on a steady regimen of selective traction.

Not only has it opened up the spaces between the discs in his spinal column, reducing pain, but now his spine dorsiflexes, enabling him to bend in half both ways.

My kids love \\" Philidelphia Chickens\\", \\"The Intermission Song\\", and \\"Belly Button\\". Seriously, I really can't think of any song on this albumn that I hate or even dislike. Also having all these different stars sing the songs makes the cd all that more enjoyable and fun.

These books give great insight into the \\"vampiric condition\\" associated with the World of Darkness. Even if you aren't a roleplaying fan, the characters are compelling and the web of their stories is intriguing. Stolze seamlessly blends the Kindred we known and love with the corruption and beautiful decay of Chicago into a novel that explored nearly every aspect of what it means to be a vampire in horrifying detail. My only complaint is that he didn't write ALL the books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want More!","review":"I'm really glad to write a good review for this book.

I was happily mistaken!I've never played Requiem, and I have limited knowledge of Masquerade, but I was able to enjoy this book regardless. The main attraction was the characters, although the plot as quite good as well. The characters were all fleshed out, I felt as though they could be actual people (or vampires, actually). They were all interesting, not the cliche vampires you'd see in a novel like Twilight. This book was the only World of Darkness book I've ever read that I couldn't put down.

There is very little initial tutorial for people, such as myself, who have never had any formal dance instruction. The transition from the earliest basic instruction is much to rapid for a beginner to grasp. The lessons would have been better if there was, for example, a \\"birds eye view\\" of how their feet were moving or they did the dance moves in even smaller pieces then joined them together.

Don't let the names on the box think you're getting anything great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price!","review":"I consider myself an intermediate ballroom dancer, and I found this video well worth the price. It may be a bit challenging for couples trying ballroom/latin dancing for the first time. But I find it well worth the price for someone who has a few classes.

If anything, it's great inspiration!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a teaching video","review":"Great production, but this video fails as a teaching video, unless you learn strictly by watching and picking up moves as they happen real time. It goes from watch to warp speed in what seems like just seconds without much detail or practice time. Going through the video is frustrating as a student and not recommended. If you want to get the video to look at several good looking people dancing for entertainment purposes, that's up to you. I'd much rather just watch Dancing With The Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not a learning tool","review":"Well, the dancers are pretty to watch and I can pick up some pointers on some techniques, but as a teaching tool this is useless.

I had just read Isaacson's book on Steve Jobs and enjoyed it and Ben Franklin is waiting in the wings. I now have quit this book about half way through.My take is this: Either Issacson does not do a good job of explaining the theory of relativity (he does have an interest in it and it seems a pretty good knowledge of the theory) or I am just too thick. Now, I am certainly not the sharpest knife in the drawer but I did just retire from flying large jets to international destinations for the last 34 years.

I enjoyed the first third of the book most, which focussed on his exploits in the worlds of physics, philosophy and academia. Beyond that, much of the book (And his life) was centered around socio-political issues. Interesting, to be sure, but not quite so up my alley as the theory of relativity.The book is a bit on the dense side, but no more than one would expect. After all, it attempts to sum up the life experience and extensive contributions of one of the most fascinating, brilliant and important people ever to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiration to budding scientists","review":"While a scientific background is helpful to fully appreciate Einstein's academic struggles and breakthroughs, the book is not meant to explain the theory of special relativity or quantum entanglement (though it does try).

Convincing quotes from Einstein in Isaacson's book: \\"A foolish faith in authority is the greatest enemy of truth\\" and \\"I am a deeply religious nonbeliever...a somewhat new kind of religion\\". But foremost by Einstein: \\"Through reading popular scientific books, I soon reached the conviction that much in...the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively frantic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression\\". Yet like Gibran, Einstein was impressed by nature's laws inclusive of humans: \\"Science w/o religion [passion] is lame; religion w/o science is blind...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into a genius","review":"Walter Isaacson's 'Einstein: His Life and Universe' is a trip into the mind and life of one of the greatest minds in history. the book takes us into the childhood of Einstein. How he his imagination and wonder of the world led him to a life in science. It was fascinating how at an early age, Einstein did not like the Nationalism of his German homeland.Isaacson takes us through Einstein's education, how he led his class and decided on a career in science and academia. It was surprising how he struggled to gain the respect of his peers. I came to realize that his radical views on relativity caused the older physicts a difficult time dealing with Einstein.Isaacson does a great job explaining Einstein's breakthrough theories.

That sense of eagerness is what makes this book so much fun; Isaacson's joy of discovering the universe is contagious.During his presentation, which was not even on Einstein, I was struck with the normality of Isaacson's personality; he seemed approachable and lacked the the brashness or imperiousness that one typically associates to the historian that writes large works on figures like Kissinger and Einstein.

It finally just became too boring.However, if you have an IQ of 160+, or you have an intrepid interest in Einstein, I believe you will find this book outstanding.

This pump is a real POS. Had it for 4 months. Used it 3 times. On third time it would not attach to a schraeder type valve anymore. Barely would hold to a presta valve. Yes its light and attaches easily, but its cheap plastic with only the pressure tube made from aluminum. Im buying Cyclaire to replace this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with this pump is a POS","review":"Like the other reviewer used no more than 4 times and would not attach to schraider valve anymore....waste of money.....DO NOT buy this Blackburn air pump!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this piece of junk.","review":"The holder will not keep the pump stable on your bike. The pump handle locks into the holder, and a velcro strap is supposed to keep the rest of the pump stable. On rough road, though, the pump will slide down from the handle and dangle off the bike. I have mine secured with duct tape now. Not pretty, and not useful for anyone who plans to use it regularly (Luckily, I have a floor pump to use at home)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally False Advertising","review":"This product is garbage compared to what the manufacture claims it is. They claim it will pump up to 90 pounds, which is why I bought it. My old hand pump will only pump my mountain bike tires up to about 40 pounds so I thought this would be perfect as I inflate my tires to 60 pounds. What a disappointment when I had to fix a flat. My new piece of Blackburn garbage only pumped my tires up to about 38 pounds and it was much more difficult to handle than my old pump, which I am going back to using. I curse Blackburn for their lies and I will never buy anything with their name on it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick change","review":"I like the screw on/off mechanism for changing back and forth from schrader to presta.

The drive I initially received, worked fine initially, but over a few months took longer and longer to warm up (up to 30 minutes), before the computer would recognize it. I returned it to the manufacturer. The second drive they sent me lasted for about 2 weeks, before my computer reported that it could not read from the drive at all, due to I/O errors.

However, O. J. Simpson is not one of them. He had plenty of advantages in his life. Simpson's playing the race card is a sham and a tragedy. It was the only way to get away with murder. Oh well, our system of justice is not perfect. But, letting a guilty person go free is not the biggest problem with our justice system. The biggest problem is the approximately 10% of persons in prison who are innocent. It is far better to let a guilty person go free than to convict an innocent person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Can't Make Up His Mind","review":"This novel is part adventure, part romance, part comedy.

Up until the end I was not disapponted but then the comment by a character that Jews were responsible for Jesus's death really upset me.

If you use this machine as much as I do, you will pay much more for the tapes than for the labeler. The manufacturer could afford to give the machine away. And they almost do.That's OK.

Frankly, we are sort of glad we were not able to get the cover. In retrospect, we believe it would be a \\"hulking black thing\\". Surely, with the top black cover, you would need a special placed to put it. As to quality, frankly, it seemed a bit flimsier and lower in quality than lower priced ones at Lowes and Home Depot, made by Whirlpool and GE.

Don't have a water bottle in it yet, but had it plugged in for about 30 seconds to test it, and the reservoir was cool for quite a while just from that, so I trust it will cool nicely.

For those unfamiliar with it, \\"Glassworks\\" contained 2 solo piano pieces along with 4 pieces for ensemble. I've had the original since it first appeared on vinyl and was excited at the prospect of hearing solo piano versions of the 4 ensemble pieces. Unfortunately, this CD turned out to be a two-CD compilation of the original \\"Glassworks\\" recording plus Glass's \\"Solo Piano\\" CD - another recording I've had for years.

It is a model of its kind, unique in scope, shows a mastery of multiple langauge sources, and is a scholarly yet readable account of the history of the largest European country of its day, the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealthy of 1569. Prof. Snyder's account is masterly, even-handed, and scrupulously fair with a clear and valuable thesis. It brings the complex strands of a neglected part of Europe into focus and explains while Poland and its Eastern neighbors were able to reach a peaceful accommodation after the downfall of the soviet Union. Tragically, the Balkans did not enjoy the longterm fencebuilding that kept this corner of the world at peace. Snyder's account of the Polish-Ukrainian conflicts during World War II is groundbreaking and fills a vital gap in this story. Not since \\"God's Playground\\" has the story been told so well.

As your product becomes more engineered, marketed, and distributed, you can see the change in the market. However, these changes are subtle, putting a new cupholder in your cars doesn't cause Idaho to order 500 new models. So far so good. However, that is about as far as they got, before cutting all kinds of corners. The marketing of your product is a difficult, slow, and not very realistic method. As a HUGE billion dollar corp., you are still able to only do 1 or 2 radio and television campaigns. Also, the game's ACTION CARDS, that allow you to destroy other company's invetory, payoff politicians, etc..., is basically like using the community chest in monopoly, its outdated.

Strange that since the feelings in it had come across to me so clearly when I was so small, it did not matter that no one said anything! Anyway.

The balloon seems to have a mind of its own, waiting for the small boy, following him, and obeying his orders most of the time. The film makes its way with pretty much zero dialogue, and focuses on the lovely visuals. They used to show this film to us in elementary school, and I'll always remember the scene where the little boy encounters a little girl with a blue balloon, and the balloons want to follow each other as if they were a pair of dogs out on a walk with their owners. The story takes an ugly turn when a group of bullies decide to hunt down the little boy and destroy his balloon, simply because they have nothing better to do. But upon doing so, all the balloons in all of Paris come to the good little boy, to carry him off into the sky, and to who knows where..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece - Warts and Al!","review":"This DVD transfer of The Red Balloon is a truly appalling transfer of a truly wonderful film. If you are looking for technical perfection and a few (well, maybe more than a few!) hisses, pops and scratches are going to upset you, then don't buy this. But if you are looking for a film that combines a simple narrative with beautiful shots, a classic fifties' film score and delightfully restrained acting (more from the boy Marcel than the balloon), this is the film for you. And, as you watch it, you start to wonder if it didn't sound and look like a faded and dated 16mm print being projected in an echoey school hall, would it really offer the same feeling of peeping nostalgically into a long-gone world of innocence, simplicity and beauty.

This book was especially helpful in understanding strategic planning for those who have not been involved in that process previously. It provided several models that can be used to plan strategically the needs of the organization of which talent, is the most critical and difficult factor within an organization to plan for. It is also one of the only books that addresses the issue of people and talent development as a strategic need. It provides a rationale for talent development and an updated review of how the field of training has evolved into Workplace Learning and Performance. The reviewer who was so disappointed with this book probably doesn't understand how these roles have changed.

Again, it is different from the usual Nikon pouches. With this design, you have to pull the button seen on the right of the picture very hard towards the center to close the pouch, and then you have to adjust the cloth which will be gathering in front of the button, and then pull the botton once again, and again.Frankly, I am not able to easily and completely close this pouch.

The third game takes care of a lot of this, but at the same time, takes away some of your abitlity to manage your railroads effectively. All in all, I would say if you are playing on a laptop, go for RRT II and if you are on a desktop with a decent graphics card, then go for RRT III.

If you want a car to stay with the train, you have to re-enter it at every station. The program emphasizes business/money aspects, not operations or engineering.

I have invited people from our congregation to come see it and they all enjoyed it as well.The man who plays the part of Dr. Peale in the movie, Mr. Murry does a fantastic job acting and preaching powerful sermons in the movie. I consider it a must see for all Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresents the Canaan Dog Breed","review":"I found the information to be inaccurate and incorrect, both in text and photographs. If the author researched this breed you can hardly tell. I would not and will not recommend this book to anyone. The other two books are far better. Bottom line, don't waste your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novice owners look elsewhere","review":"This book was written by a fairly knowledgeable dog person who has never pwned a Canaan Dog. You get about what you'd expect from that combo: basically okay but repeating inaccuracies and missing nuances she had no frame of reference to assess. Some errors are important only to breed afficianados, but others are more general: microchips are the size of a grain of rice, not a kernal of corn (ouch!). Not all tapeworms are carried by fleas. There are no microfilaria (heartworm larvae) visible in the illustration on page 119... The book does contain much good information but unfortunately the novice is going to have a difficult time sorting the wheat from the chaff. The photos are lovely but I agree with other reviewers' comments that it would be nice to have included more dogs, especially showing all color patterns and correct color patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for First Time Owners","review":"I do not know how the author researched this book and where she got her information, but there is really only one statement in the book I disagree with, and that is where she says that a Canaan Dog is prone to bite. THIS IS NOT TRUE. In the very early days there were some few people-aggressive Canaan Dogs, but they were the source of bad stories about the breed which took a long time to overcome. Other than this one misrepresentation, the book does a good job of introducing a first-time owner to the breed. It should be a companion to the information received from a breeder and not the sole source of information. The photos are lovely, but present the type favoured in all the rest of the world except the US - the only reason I can see for the prior reviews complaint about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good bag, very adjustable.","review":"I'm a big dude and have been searching high and low for a sling bag that is made for larger frames.I looked at this bag many times and was put-off by the way the shoulder strap was held together by velcro, so I looked more and more.I broke down and got; its actually a well made bag and the strap doubles over into itself before it's locked in with velcro. Even with a full pack, the strap held, didnt even show signs of stress from the weight.The Navy was a good color too. Great bag all in all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I was VERY disappointed in this book! First off, when I first saw the envelope it came in, I couldn't figure out how there could possibly even be a book in it. Well, there was, if you could call it that. It was about 80 pages long and took me less than an hour to read it. I expected a lot more granular information about the audit process, more in-depth definitions of the terminology used in casinos, and overall, MORE information. Pretty much all it consists of is the same generic audit memorandum after each section. I'm really upset that I paid over eighty dollars, about sixty five for the book, and the remainder in shipping. I'm going to see what I can do to get my money back.DON'T waste your money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pictures Were the Best Part","review":"I got this book because I really like Heath Ledger. The sad thing is that this is just another one of those teen-idols books. It does give a lot of good information and has great pictures, but it could have been better. If you like Heath, I think you should buy it, but you can only take the quiz in the back so many times. I would recommend since you can take it places where you can't watch 10 Things I Hate About You or A Night's Tale. This is a good book, but the pictures really were the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much To Recommend Here....","review":"I guess it didn't help when the movie stopped playing after just a few minutes, but this was not the first time Amazon's streaming did not work properly.

I have nothing but repect for the man. But this was better read than seen as a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done!","review":"John Sayles' \\"Amigo\\" is a wonderful film about a little-known piece of American history: what really happened at the end of the Spanish-American War. The truth is we brutalized a nation of people we didn't understand and thought were little more than monkeys. The film is not \\"revisionist\\" history, as there are many surviving contemporary letters written by American soldiers who wrote home to relatives in the USA from the Philippines explaining in great detail the horrible events they engaged in during the Philippine-American War, 1898-1902. Bravo to John Sayles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in the last couple of years","review":"Certifiably Insane is a fantastic book. Readers who enjoy the novels of Johnathon Kellerman and Stephen White will enjoy this new main character, forensic psychologist Simon Rose. I knew I loved this writer in the first chapter when I found out Simon's dog was named Tupelo Honey and his prior dog had been named Sara Smiles. The book contains fantastic character development and a great sense of humor about the funny and not so funny parts of life. I think it is a great loss for avid readers that this author passed away during the editing of this novel but I was thrilled to read his wife's note (see above) that she will be continuing with the Simon Rose character in a series.

After Chapter 18 this book fails every test of literary competency and narrative continuity. It was either at this point that Mr. Bahr's widow began her ill conceived attempt to finish her husband's work or that Mr. Bahr suffered the unfortunate head injury that led to his regrettable heart attack.

The problem with most of these kinds of books is they cover every facet of the performer's life but they are too close in time and too enthusiastic to be definitive on the career of someone who is clearly talented and articulate but has a long way to go to develop to the level of those whom we will remember a hundred years on.

Stones, leaves, a blade of grass. Rushes, thorns, the splash of water on a quiet rock. In the thoughtful hands of artist Andy Goldsworthy, these ordinary landscape artifacts are pressed, moved, shaped and juxtaposed, then left to melt back into earth over time. When viewing Goldsworthy's art, one thinks of the rapt attention of a child, who sees possibility in every fallen branch. Yet, the overall impression is philosophical in nature. Even the person who claims little understanding of art can find a way to enter in, especially with the help of Baker's essay. A beautiful read, a beautiful look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Underrated","review":"\\"Mind Wars\\", one of the excellent albums included in this two-disc set, is easily one of the most underrated thrash/metal albums of all time. The vocal arrangements on Mind Wars are absolutely amazing, and the vocal style ranges from thrashy growling to melodic clean vocals. The music is generally fast throughout, and sounds genuinely passionate.

It is clearly an issue on the master itself, as the CD I had was brand new and scratch free. You would be better off tracking down the japanese import or the original 1988 RC disc of MIND WARS if you want to hear the album completely defect free. I know for some it will not be a big deal, and without this obvious defect, I would have rated this set a 5, however, if Powerage, the now defunct label who released this 2 CD set had taken better care to inspect the master before it went to press, the MIND WARS disc would have been flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THE BLACKEND REISSUE OF THIS CD!!!","review":"DON'T BUY THE BLACKEND REISSUE!!!THIS CD SET IS DEFECTIVE!!YOU WILL BE AS DISAPPOINTED AS I AM IF YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!

Having withstood at least two millennia, his thirteen chapters of warlike proverbs are beyond any reproach I can provide.I'm giving two stars to this book's introductory material. If I was more familiar with Chinese history, then perhaps I would have appreciated the introductory material more. Unfortunately, the introduction's academic pitch was oftentimes beyond my reach. I picked this book up hoping to read a great Chinese work placed accessibly within historical context. In the end, I can say that I have read Sun Tzu, but I still can't put him into context."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art. The Philosophy.","review":"The Art of War by Sun Tzu is a timeless classic. It is everything anyone ever wanted to know about the art of war and the art of leadership from a practical point of view. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the subject.

No wonder such book found its way onto the market--even its title implis a sense of wisdom and mistery. With such \\"wisdom\\" of war, the Chinese failed to win a single war against almost any intruder over the past 2000 years. Indeed they won some battles once in a while, but even with overwhelming population and productivity, the Chinese had been defeated and often ruled by Mongolians, Manchurians, British, and Japanese, to name just a few. Moreover, business today is more about creativity than undermining the competitiveness of rivals through cheating, conspiracy, and extortion. This book sure has historical value but I wonder if those who claim that it's full of valuable advice for the war and business today are sincere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not SUN TZU you are warn not SUN TZU","review":"I purchase believing the reviews what i read, it not sun tzu has nothing of the original book SUN TZU the art of war so YOU ARE WARN! if you want to spend your time & money go ahead but you are warn this isnt any close to SUN TZU the art of war"},{"rating":"1","title":"the english language he griffith uses is a barrier","review":"the average person who can speak perfect english wont understand many dictionary words he uses to translate the art of war. unless you understand rocket science words, check out thomas cleary's version."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzz","review":"Man, after all the kudos my old, dumb crowd from high school had foisted on this book, to finally read it and see what they were crowing about...turned out to be nothing but namedrop, I guess, because its a bore and a half. This edition is 200 pages long, however, the actual text is onnly about 90. But it doesn't matter if you skip the prefaces and appendices, you'll still be reading very dry, dated, technical military tactics. Do not, do not buy this if you are expecting philosophy, martial arts wisdom, or business strategy. They just say that so you'll buy it.

It easily could have been written in the present time if not for all the references to ancient wars and, warriors.

For whatever reason, Sun Tzu wrote in such a way as to let his text be as applicable today as it was 2400 years ago. Political, business, and military leaders would be well served by reading this book. It is obviously not just a book on warfare. Very little, in fact, is dedicated to actual battle. Sun Tzu argues that in order to win you must win before the battle actually takes place. You must put in place winning strategies to weaken your enemy's position and bolster yours. So Sun Tzu can state, without disrespect to his ancestors: \\"Anciently those called skilled in war conquered an enemy easily conquered.\\" This text must have been amazingly practical when it was written (even more than now) because there are lots of anecdotes and tactics that ancient military leaders would have found very useful. Even now, these examples are incredible useful for modern day readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"For some reason Amazon cannot get Sunzi right. The link to the audio edition of the Griffith translation is to a different translator's work. Some of the reviews here refer to Cleary's illustrated translation, not Griffith's. The link to paperback editions of this work are to Cleary's, not Griffith's etc.Having said that, if you can figure out what edition is being offered, Griffith's translation offers many strengths. It is translated by someone who not only read the work, but practiced and theorized on unconventional warfare himself. There are questions as to whether his translation is perfectly accurate. It is said that the great Three Kingdoms strategist Cao Cao also misinterpreted the Sunzi in his commentary. So, while not strictly accurate to the letter, both enhanced the spirit.There are other very good translations, Sawyer, Ames, etc. But Griffith's is the one I turn to first.List OwnerYahoo Egroup Sun_Tzu"},{"rating":"2","title":"1 of 2 Best Books Ever Read","review":"1 of 2 in best books I've ever read.

Being like a history book, there is no core story that connects the chapters together. After the introduction that is about 1/3 of the book, it goes into the \\"tips\\" for war. It has one or two lines for a tip, then tells a story of how the tip was used. After a while, it can get very dull and repetitive, so I give it 2 stars. I would recommend this book to people in the military, but to anyone else it wouldn't be very useful or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Martial Artists","review":"The one star that I gave this book is because I was reading it from a Martial Art's perspective instead of a Business perspective. The main thing that bothered me about the text was that the Aurthor explained himself every few lines. When he would translate some text, he would follow that up with a few lines further explaining what he had just written. So the book didn't have much flow to it. I personally think that the author should have just translated the text to the best of his ability and left it to the reader to figure out the true meaning and application of the Sun Tzu's thoughts. It took a little bit to realize that this book is more geared towards Businessmen. And looking at the other reviews, I guess it's really good for people looking to succeed in Business.

This product will also kill all the suds in your soap bucket, so make sure it has been completely rinsed off your car before you follow up with your wash mitt. The best way to get bugs off is to soak a cotton towel in hot water and drape it on the bug caked portion of your car.

The headlight & tail light are as bright today as they were on the first day I installed them.I find the different lighting modes on the headlight & tail light to be extremely useful for varying night time conditions.

The front light was fine, but the back one... ?! You have to put the batteries in yourself, and in order to get the casing open to get the batteries in you have to remove 3 teeny, tiny screws. Sounds easy, well I have perhaps 10 screwdrivers at home, but none of them were small enough.

Very poor design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lights","review":"I bought this light set about a month ago and am well pleased. The lights are bright and battery life is good. I haven't yet replaced the batteries and I use the lights about 15 minutes each day. The only problem I've had is the front light is loose on the handle bar and wants to turn up. This should be easy to fix with a rubber strip.I passed a police officer (he was stopped) this morning and when I saw him later, he said he could see my light good all the way to the top of the hill. He said it would be hard not to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Combo from Blacburn!","review":"The combination of front and rear light is a good deal; and both were very easy to install. the front light is fairly large, and bulky ... but the 3-way lighting option is very helpful for those times you ride in traffic.

The quadrant is bright enough to light the road ahead of me and sends out enough peripheral light that I don't feel like I'm riding in a tunnel. As far as lighting is concerned, I really like the Quadrant. My only complaint is that is a bit spacey looking. But I got a good deal on Amazon, so I can't complain.The Mars 3.0 is the best tail light I've ever owned.

For me, it's adequate for lighting up my path for my ride in to work. I generally start out at 5:45 AM in the dark, but most of the roads and side streets I ride have a bit of lighting. If you're truly riding in the dark, you'll want a more powerful headlight. This will not suffice in zero light situations. Mounting was easy, batteries seem to last forever (I use non-rechargeables so I don't have to keep popping them out all the time). Weight is minimum. They seem like they'll last a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light, great price","review":"I've had the light for a month now and really like it. The tail light is very bright and can be seen from the side, which I think is a big advantage. The front light with the flashing sides and steady center allows the best of both worlds - allowing you to see the road and still catch the attention of vehicles. My only critique is that the headlight is rather bulky, compared to many other lights. It is very obvious on the handlebars and hopefully won't get stolen too quickly. It's also clearly not a serious pathlighter, but is fine for town situations where there's usually other light on the road as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lights!","review":"These lights are excellent. Very bright and the headlight puts out a good beam on the road ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird but nice","review":"Ok, so one reason I bought this set was because the headlight is so strange looking. But I like the fact that it has a 2-on, 2-flashing setting giving good illumination plus the added safety of better visibility. One thing I didn't realise is that this light is pretty big. I can understand the durability questions about the mount other reviewers have made. It's a lightweight bracket for a heavy light. But so far I have had no problems. The taillight is very bright with side-mounted LEDs and a much easier to use mounting bracket.Oddly, when I bought this set, it was cheaper to buy both than the headlight alone. I'm very happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"clumsy and fragile","review":"the tail light attach system is not strong enough for mountain biking demands, the hook to attach it broke at third ride. the headlight is too big, the light is dim.

They clip on and off the bike making them handy for whatever I need them for. If you want to ride fast at night the front light may not suffice.

I have ordered three additional sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Light Set","review":"A good basic light kit. Holds up well under rain (and yesterday, snow and freezing rain). I like the detachability, as the front \\"phaser\\" light doubles as a flashlight. This allows one to find their bike in the dark. The rear light could also be used when jogging, clipped to a belt. The front light best suits city commuting, where street lights provide ambient light. When used on the Burke-Gilman trail, the front light reflected light back into my eyes, though this is easily fixed with electrician's tape across the top.

On the bottom of this piece of crap are 4 little rubber pieces that are meant to protect the floor.

Each murder becomes more grotesque and is described in painstaking detail. The team of detectives moves from one crisis to the next, (both personal and professional), especially the lead sleuth. And, as one can guess from the title, there is a religious twist to the plot. I assume all this is meant to build tension for the reader, unfortunately it all becomes somewhat numbing, monotonous and tiresome, i.e. any shock value quickly wears thin due to sheer repetition. The story itself becomes predictable and formulaic and the good guys and bad guy caricatures of themselves. The book is much much too long and the ending anti-climactic. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressive, but...","review":"...but wait a second. Haven't I met this before?

From this point of view, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific first novel by an author that bears watching","review":"Wow. I wasn't expecting too much going in, so this book was quite a pleasant surprise. Quite horrific in places, while in other places it actually will make you think, this book is well written, with a main character/detective that is refreshingly different from the hordes of single cops with dark secrets and high sex drives that pervade most books of this genre.The best part about this book though, by far, are the murders and the way the city itself reacts. I think that's what I enjoyed about this book more than everything else, while the plot was good and the characters a treat, the true jem in this book is the realism...I could almost imagine that this had quite possibly really happened. And in fact, there are some real-life murder cases that bear a strong resemblence to this novel...Great job, Mr. Starling!

Then you'll get it, and it will be like getting hit on the head by a hammer. I do not want to get into the details of the book, but it is amazing and the author did his homework.

The dialogue was terrific, if you don't care much for dialogue tags. As great as the tale was, however, I saw the end coming from about mid-book. Little innocuous details given are sometimes good for foreshadowing, but a huge, gaping hole that gets left uncovered is kind of hard to overlook.Also, did anyone notice the shocking similarities to Thomas Harris' Red Dragon & Silence of the Lambs? The Killer hanged one of his victims exactly like in \\"Silence,\\" Red's marital woes, exactly like in \\"Red Dragon,\\" the leaving of the silver spoon in the victim's mouths (In \\"Silence\\" it was a butterfly).Anyway... this was a fantastic, intelligent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cross between \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" and the film \\"Seven\\"","review":"A very engrossing novel. Well thought out and well composed, with a surprise ending that has nothing to do with the identity of the killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starry-Eyed","review":"I'm a little bewildered by all the 5 star ratings given to this book. Sure it's a fast read but it doesn't approach the standards for the genre, i.e. \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" (from which some ideas for the plot appear to be lifted, but without the same effect). The murder scenes were written well but large sections of the book just come off as filler. The characterization of \\"Red\\", the relentless hunter of \\"Silver Tongue\\", while voluminous, didn't seem to draw him out all that well and the minor characters were the equivalent of card board cut outs.I bought this book based on the mega ratings it received here and my two stars won't drop it's overall rating one iota. But to potential buyers I say \\"Lower your expectations.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller!","review":"One of the best thrillers I have read. It's characters are complex, the plot is deep and explores every angle and the dialouge is sharp. I had a good idea who the killer was halfway through and then had to totally do a 180 and change my mind near the end. I ended up getting it right but was still not 100% sure. I absolutely love books like this, that keep you guessing until the end and books that you just can't put down.It is extremely hard to believe that this is the author's first book.

As I usually steer clear of British mysteries, I'm so glad I gave this one a try. Imagine tracking a killer, when your own deeds are circumspect!

The main character, Red, is not likeable at all; he has no endearing qualities and spends too much time lamenting his lot in life. I wish he were less maudlin and tackled his job with more enthusiasm and strength. Also, I find the author's style of writing very unengaging---he uses very short descriptive sentences in the present tense as if he were writing for the stage or the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed with this book","review":"I forced my self to read all but the last 6-chptrs of this book.

Due to the huge amount of bands that emerged during the time, obviously some got overlooked. Ulysses Siren was one of them.The problem is, I don't understand why. Ulysses Siren is better than probably 99% of all other thrash bands...and yes, this includes the Big Four (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax).This album will kick you right in the teeth. It's sheer brutality is unbelievable. It's fast and heavy and loud, just like thrash metal ought to be. Not just that, but Ulysses Siren were excellent musicians, and this album showcases their talent well.Basically, imagine Dark Angel taking the 1980's versions of Slayer and Metallica, grilling them over a fire made with vintage Megadeth, adding a helping of Overkill and a slice of Testament and then serving it to Exodus for breakfast and you'll be in the ballpark.Ulysses Siren is the best thrash I've ever heard.

He jumps around a lot, not only from place to place, but also forward and backward in time. The situations are so much alike that it is hard to follow the first fifteen chapters.

Big hassle to set up on a recent-model Windows notebook due to convoluted Bluetooth software in Vista.

They were enough to make me gag. As a beginner runner who does not feel that passionate about running yet, it can certainly turn you off. For example, one story is about a woman who just got some bad news about some test results. It goes on to say that the first thing she did was \\"lace up her shoes and run- with tears streaming down her face, she ran towards the sun set.\\" I don't mean to sound insensitive, but it can be a little overwhelming to read these stories constantly through out the book when you are just starting out and trying to \\"enjoy\\" running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all levels, not just beginners","review":"I could not decide between this book and the similarly-titled one by Claire Kowalski so I actually went to the bookstore and spent some time flipping through them both. They both seem very good and well-informed, but the Kowalski book is definitely geared more toward beginners (in tone, mostly, but also in content). I am looking to move from beginner to intermediate level running and found that this book fit my needs much better. This one I think is also good for beginners, but the Kowalski book has more of a motivational focus and this one concentrates more on striving for excellence in your running (racing, improving times, etc). It is really a book that can take you from the absolute, never jogged-before state to a marathon. The author's style is very accessible and easy to read, too. I read it cover to cover on a long flight and enjoyed it all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for newbies","review":"I absolutely love this book. I recently signed up to train for a marathon with marathonmakeover, and this book has given me a lot of information about the sport. Nobody in my family or close circle of friends run, so it gave me the advice I need. The only reason not to give it all five stars is because I have not finished reading it. If you're wondering about running, and are a woman, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for beginners","review":"This gave me the motivation to get up and go.

It has a lot of good information and is PERFECT for the VERY beginner runner or the slightly experienced runner. If you've been running for a while or even if you were a high school runner just now getting back into the swing of things I would say this book is not for you though. I have never embraced running as a workout because I never really considered myself a \\"runner,\\" as such this book is perfect for me, but for people with more experience in this sport this book would really be a tedious read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly informative--must have for female runners","review":"If you are new to running, I highly recommend this book. It discusses common injuries for women, eating habits and injury prevention. This is important knowledge to have if you intend to start a running program or have a goal of entering a race.

There are even sections that break down how running will affect you at different ages, as well as when you are pregnant. Overall, a fun and informative book - I would definitely recommend it.

The M4 development and production is covered in detail with all marks and variants, upgrades and modifications. British service and modification are also covered. Postwar employment and conversions are included, even though Israeli and other post war conversions are not covered in detail.There are extremely detailed specifications of the M3 and M4, all marks and many of the variants like the M7 and M10. You will also find the specs on most weapons employed on the M3, M4 and variants.If you are interrested in the technical development and production of the M3 and M4 tanks, this book is a must. Well written with 100s of b/w illustrations it is, despite the price, great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depression or Spiritual Dark Night!","review":"The author shares experiences of a bout or depression or is it the dark night of the soul (spiritually speaking). It was good to read of someone's experiences who were similar to mine. I'm a Christian dealing with depression over childhood issues and at the same time experiencing spiritual abandonment. The author shares the struggle between knowing in our heads and from our past that God is present but the emotional and internal feeling that God is no longer around. This book is the only contemporary writing that I have found on what early Christian mystics (John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila) described as the dark night of the soul. After sharing his experience the author analyzes the theological/spiritual conclusions he has drawn from the experience. Some of his theology is creative, interesting but not mainstream fundamental beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Wow, this book was far beyond excellent, I am left short of words.

The unit displays cadence if and when it wants. Ride a bit, reset it a couple times and it might work. And then, in the middle of the ride - no cadence. It has never been able to consistently display.The unit is trickier than a Rubik's cube to figure out. This is the first cyclometer I have ever owned that required a look a the users manual for anything other than setting the wheel size. It's like cramming for an exam before each ride, trying to figure out how each function works.4 displays?? The is room on the display for 4 functions at once. But the top one never displays.

Vaughn Monroe and Harry James do not belong in the film because they were given poor material to work with. The creators of this film did not know what they were doing in the popular music department, nor in the story department. I would never watch this entire film again. The non-James non-Monroe music is excellent, exciting and worth buying a DVD for, because then you can skip everything else and be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only because of the music","review":"The only reason I have not given this movie 5 points is the plot. However, the plot is a very minor component in this movie... This 1947 feature, shot inside Carnegie Hall is about a mother whose only dream is that her only son will become a famous concert pianist. As he grows up, he's fortunate enough to see the greatest names performing right across his home, at Carnegie Hall. The first 40 minutes focus on the plot and there's hardly any music in them. But then the direction changes - the plot moves to the backround while the focus is on Jascha Heifetz (1st movement from Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto), Artur Rubinstein (Chopin and De Falla), Jan Peerce, Rise Stevens and more. It's a unique chance to see these great names performing live! The picture and sound are, I guess, what can be expected from a movie made in the 40s not by a big Hollywood studio; nevertheless, if the artists and music in general are the focus, it's a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Dream Machine meets Classical music","review":"I bought this to have the Heifetz shortened version of the 1st movement of the Tschaikovsky Violin Concerto in my collection. Remember when in 1980 Perlman interrupted his concert to say to the audience \\"Today is the birthday of the greatest violinist who ever lived?\\" He was referring to Heifetz and his comment took in a lot of territory as no one alive had ever heard, for example, Paganini. Well I feel the same way about Heifetz. So get this one to hear Heifetz at his best. Forget the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to cherish","review":"I bought 5 copies of this book to give out to those I love. The pictures are so engaging and the text is adorable.

It does look ok, and work ok, but there was at least three bad issues. Poor instructions. This is nothing new to me, but the problems don't stop there.

All in all a good addition to my jewelry making library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult battery installation, poor QC","review":"Wow, buying the Blackburn Mars 3.0 was a negative experience all the way around. First of all (and I'm definitely NOT a tree-hugging granola head), I was offended by the excessive packaging. It was very wasteful. And then only after I opened the package did I discover that installing the batteries required a tiny phillips screwdriver that many people won't have. Plus it was tedious to remove and replace the three tiny screws. It would have been more helpful if they put the battery installation instructions on the back of the excessive packaging. Then I found that the battery tray was too tight, requiring a lot of force to pop the batteries in. Then I discovered that the unit was broken. One LED lit up but the button didn't do anything. I'm glad it was broken because when I returned it I then discovered the Planet Bike Superflash, a fantastic little tail light that comes in very simple earth-friendly packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very bright!","review":"I believe one of the other reviewers said that the only way that he wouldn't get seen with this blinky is if he forgot to turn it on. I would agree. This little guy is pretty bright. I bought this as part of the blackburn headlight/taillight pair. I's been very reliable on a second bike that I use. It even has this robocop look to it that is kinda cool. I'm all about spending a few extra bucks to be well lit at night-if the products are bright and reliable, and this one meets my criteria.I also useDown Low Glow Lighting Kit - Two Tubes-Envy(green)and Planet Bike headlightsPlanet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mountfor safer night riding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully bright light - bad design","review":"Like many others I think that the front of this light is wonderful... and the back of this light is terrible. It takes forever to change the batteries and the plastic clip on back is weak. I have returned home from a ride on two occasions to find that the light was no longer attached to my bike. If they could change these things, I would purchase another in a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless due to a poor clip","review":"Like many other reviewers, my clip snapped off after less than a month of light use. Keep in mind that I'm on a road bike commuting along mostly smooth roads. The light is great, but if it can't stay on the bike, it's just a nice shiny paperweight. I should have paid heed to the many warnings. You should do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"No hassle","review":"I have been a commuter cyclist for decades and I have used a number of different front and rear lights. The Blackburn Mars 3.0 is significantly brighter that any rear light I have yet used. Installation was easy, although I am not fond of plastic/resin \\"screws\\" for mounting brackets. My last light, a Cat Eye, worked well for quite some time. The salt air here at the beach eventually corroded the insides, first eliminating the flashing modes, then reducing the steady mode to only occasional function, soon after which the unit died. The Cat Eye had easy snap off access to the battery which may have contributed to its demise. The 3 small screws on the Mars are a small inconvenience if they prevent corrosion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of LEDs stopped working after 3' fall.","review":"While biking, the clip I had attached this to broke, and the light fell onto road from my bike. The bottom half of the lights stopped working. I expect a bike light to be robust enough to fall off a bike (at least once) without breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken clip after 1 year","review":"The clip on the back broke off after one year of intermittent commuting. I hadn't crashed or hit the light, but when I went to take the light off after coming home it almost fell off in my hand. The clip was cracked almost all the way through.Battery life has been fine with a set of NiMH rechargable AAA's. Probably somewhere around 30 hours (3 months for me) of blinky mode. The light gets gradually dimmer and blinks slower as a warning that the battery is getting low, so be aware of that and don't wait for complete darkness.Though the small screws mentioned by the others are not the best method I've seen for getting to a set of batteries, it's not too bad if you have a small screwdriver and good vision. The light would have gotten 4 stars if it wasn't for the clip cracking. Without a clip the light is worthless. I've sent an email to Blackburn and will update the review if they respond.Over 1 month later, and no response from Blackburn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Light w/ great customer service from Blackburn","review":"The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because yes, the screws to change the battery are kind of a hassle. Luckily, the light lasts fairly long - regular riding (for me, anyways) is about 3-5 miles/week as the sun goes down with this light on flashing mode - and so far I've had the light for 7 months w/o having to change the battery. I'd have to say however, that one day it just froze up on me. Despite taking the battery out/replacing it it wouldn't turn on. I emailed the folks at blackburn who got back to me within 2 days and are in the process of mailing me a new light! I'd definitely recommend this product because it does what I need it to do, is super bright, and is backed by great customer service. (BTW I have 2 and my first one has never given me any problems)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery life, hard to change batteries","review":"It seems like I'm changing the batteries in this light every other month or so! I have several other bike lights that last much, much longer. To make it worse, it's really hard to open this light up to replace the batteries. I would not recommend this tail light - there are others out there that have comparable or better brightness/visibility factors and longer battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"i have not been killed since using this light","review":"this light is bright and has possibly kept me from being murdered by a car. neat! if not getting murdered by a car is important to you, consider buying this.update: less stars. while riding in the park yesterday, this light popped out of its bracket. while the light is nice and bright, its clip isn't sufficient to keep it attached to your bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"great flasher!!!","review":"I have the previous model of this unit, and this one is definitely much brighter than the older one...

I'm not getting good battery life","review":"This is a bright light and you will get noticed but the batteries are hard to replace because the case is difficult to get into and a small specialized screwdriver is required. I'm only getting about 6 hours of flashing light time and have changed the batteries numerous times. A single LED light that holds up to water and abuse seems to be the Pelican Mini Flasher. It is not as bright and fancy as the Blackburns but the batteries are easy to change and it's a tough little light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective design","review":"I strongly recommend you getting the Blackburn Mars 2.0 if you plan to permanently attach this light to your bicycle. The 2.0 uses a screw and thus will stay attached. My 3.0 fell off somewhere along my first ride as soon as it got a tad bumpy (in New York City).I had to buy a replacement light and thus settled for the 2.0. To this date it is still attached to my bicycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mars 3.0 Flasher Light","review":"I found a Mars 3.0 laying at the edge of the road one morning flashing, I liked it so well I bought two more.

It makes no sense to me why they had to cut out so much; and since DiC's main concern was violence, why didn't they just remove the most violent scenes, and leave the rest in?We would have been left with the two episodes, and a much more emotional and dramatic ending to the series. Even DiC is pretty good at maintaining the emotion during the intense scenes, but they were either lazy, or not thinking straight.While they did do a good editing job (which is something I NEVER want to say), they really disappointed many Sailor Moon fans. I do find myself defending dubs, even Sailor Moon's dub whenever I come across otaku that constantly bash it, but even I will admit that DiC could have done a lot better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Awesomeness","review":"This is by far the best collection of Sailor Moon episodes EVER, at least in the first season.

I watched the last episode (where Sailor Moon faces Queen Beryl) like 3 times because it was so incredible. In conclusion, I loved it.A lot of people say that it is dissapointing because the last episode was cut and edited to make it shorter. I never saw the original version, so that dissapoints me.

Han Solo is a smuggler for a gangster named Jilliac th Hutt, leader of the Desilijic Clan. Jilliac's home is on the planet Nar Shadda is orbiting, and there is an imperial fleet coming to totally demolish the planet to prove to Jilliac that the Empire does not tolerate smugglers and their employers. The Battle of Nar Shadda insues. The victor I cannot reveal, but the smugglers have something in store for the Imperials. This book is one of the best books I have ever read.

It also explains why Lando really hates Han, why Han ended up with Leia and not Salla or Bria.It was also neat to see Winter, Shallomar, Jalus, Muuurgh and Mrrov, Malla, and some of the Ylesian priests.

The monitor stand was not sturdy enough to support a large monitor. The pullout keyboard stand would frequently stick. The computer tower stand also was not very sturdy and did not support the weight of the tower well. The bar across the back of the desk was at the same level as the plug input for the computer tower, and thus it blocked the plug. This meant the tower had to be pushed out to an awkward position in front of the desk. Overall, this was a poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated cookbook","review":"By today's standards, this is an unexceptional collection; there are so many better, more creative and appealing Kosher recipe collections available.

He tried them all. The Canon 900 was a distant second. Other than the superb quality of the prints, the amazing thing is that it will take a CD driver, so you can print from your CDs. It will also burn the pics in your camera card to a CD. What talent!I sold a HP Photosmart 7550, when I got this one. The R300 is the basic printer.

It has exactly the same print engine and software as the R300 but at half the price! I checked the specs at Epson and they're the same. On the Canon printers you have to go to the i960 to find a six color printer for the same price as the R300 and still not get the card readers on the R300.

I am able to print as many pictures as I like or am able to put on the disc and then title it in any color I desire. It is sometimes cranky about pulling the tray in to complete the printing cycle but with a slight assist it will usually draw the tray into the machine. I have had to replace my tray once because it just got old and tired on the end that lays on the rollers that pull it into the machine but replacement trays are cheap.

The print heads clog up and the paper handling is so bad that every other print miss feeds or jams. The printer will miss feed 90% of the time. You can not leave this printer unattended.

The ink does run out quickly as the cartridges are small but the compatible ones have worked well except for the black. I have not had trouble with paper feeding and use several sheets at a time. One will need to experiment with the settings for different computers but the end results are georgeous. I like my home printed pictures better than ones done by print shops.

I am CONSTANTLY replacing ink cartridges and this is a very low-use printer. In my opinion, what many of the printer manufacturers are now doing to FORCE excessive ink consumption is borderline criminal. Printer prices have plummeted, but ink consumption is out of control.

I'm not computer illiterate - yet I've tried everything patiently all day, and still nothing except for the usual \\"CD / DVD TRAY OPEN\\" error, which is insane since I WANT the tray open for printing. I assume the print quality is very nice, but I don't know for sure because IT WON'T PRINT. Epson should rename these things - they aren't printers, they're UN-printers.

It seems that it WILL NOT feed greeting card paper, and forget about printing out more than one copy at a time. It constantly reports jams that are not there, or that the CD tray is open when it is not, and locks up the whole printer. I have been trying to print out my wedding invitations for 6 days, at least 3 to 4 hours at a time, and I am ready to pull my hair out. It will feed regular paper, no problem, but who wants to print out their wedding invitations on regular paper?

It is an edgy and thought-provoking collection of poems. In it Ellis acts as our tour guide as we travel with him -- and immerse ourselves in his view of the language of hip hop and pop art, the neighborhood, family, culture and much more.I might not be the best person to review poetry but I was moved by his concise, almost stark manner of writing. His emotions shine through. I kept thinking of Lawrence Ferlinghetti (my favorite poet), and although their poetry is different in so many ways -- because both men's thoughts are for their own particular time, their messages are both timeless.If you like gritty, urban, thought-provoking poems, this volume is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Ron","review":"Ron White is a funny guy. I've seen him numerous times on the Blue Collar Comedy DVD's and I have his CDs and he always makes me laugh. When I started reading the book I realized that the material was stuff I'd already heard. Thankfully, as I read on I realized that it wasn't all old material. To fully appreciate Ron White, you need to see his live performance with his Texas twang and sipping scotch like it was spring water. The book is a quick read and for any Blue Collar Comedy fan, you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is great but the book is mediocre","review":"For Ron White fans, there is nothing new in this book. In fact the 304 pages are half cartoons -- which are somewhat funny but takes away from the real subject -- Ron White. I'm a huge fan of Ron White but this book was actually boring in spots. If you have seen him on TV or DVD - then you've seen the best he has to offer. I'll buy his next DVD but an author he is not.

It was a ho hum read for me with very little humor and, not that I am vain in any way, but the use of the same four letter word repeatedly throughout his book got old real fast and lost whatever punch he may have thought it had. The photo illustrations were okay but took up alot of pages in the book to make this probably the fastest read you could imagine. My sense is that his audience would benefit far greater from viewing his shows than reading his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but pretty much his act","review":"I bought this for my husband, who is a big fan, so the review is based off of his impression. It contains most of his act and only delves a little bit into his personal life, but he is still hysterical, in print or otherwise. If watching him is more for you, then rent his DVD's because he is more entertaining to watch than to read it in print. It would be nice to find a comedian put out a book that doesn't just contain his act on stage and offers a bit more new humor. It is a good read if you decide to check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I like Ron White - on TV. However, his book \\"I Had the Right to Remain Silent\\" just doesn't come off the same way as he does on TV. The book consists of various stories, all fairly lame when read. Perhaps the material would be much better live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I have liked Ron on TV and DVD, but now I don't like him at all! He tells much too much about his life with drugs and how Foxworthy had to bail him out several times. I don't find that even slightly amusing. I never laughed the whole way through this book. What a waste of money! But, if you like totally disgusting foul language, you'll probably like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast and Fun Read","review":"I'm a Ron White fan, so I picked up this book that is a combination of his stand-up act and (somewhat limited) autobiography. I agree with other reviewers that if you've seen his act (particularly the two DVDs of his own stuff), you'll probably be familiar with most of the comedy material. But it still comes off as funny, particularly with the drawings that accompany the material. I still laugh at the same jokes I've heard several times and it didn't really change here.The autobiographical part of his book was just OK as it didn't really reveal a whole lot about the man (other than he still is very good friends with his first wife, who he has skewered in his act). He also goes into a long story about going into pottery making in Mexico with an old girlfriend that was somewhat interesting.I blew through this book in two sittings of about one hour each, so I don't know if it's worth the price I paid. But if you like Ron, it probably isn't a bad purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a transcript of his television specials...","review":"Just a transcript on his television specials, But that's okay; 'cause now when I watch him on CMT for the hundredth time, I can read along with Ron...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a Huge Ron WHite Fan...

Not nearly as funny when you read it as when you are watching him perform. I know his routines so well that I can imagine him telling the stories with all of his facial expressions and gestures, but it's just not the same.Sad to say it's not worth the money I spent - can you give a Kindle book back for a refund?? I'd have been better ff buying the Tater Salad DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"Of course, it is full of jokes you've heard before.

I was a bit weary of going with the refurbs...but I'm trying to save money everywhere I can for the trip. I have had them for two days and have taken them around with my MP3 player on the way to class and what not to test them. I've been very pleased with the noise-reduction function. Even with no music playing they do a very good job. Definately an excellent buy for noise-reduction headphones at a refurbished price. They have worked flawlessly thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for getting into noise cancelling headphones","review":"After flying over 40 hrs (50+ if you include layovers) I have to say that these headphones were worth it.Things I liked:1. Compact design - easy to pack and store in the seat pocket2. Comfortable - no issues falling asleep with them onThings that could be better:1. Better cord managment - not a biggie but having both cords come out of the same end of the cancelling unit could be improvedThis is my first pair of noise cancelling earphones so I don't really have anything to compare them to. However I think the refurbs are a good value buy and I don't plan on upgrading anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, Poor Quality","review":"The noise reduction feature is great on airplanes, but I've grown to dislike these headphones. After 3 months, I'm getting static in the left earpiece and the battery holder makes static in both phones when you move it (loose connections?). Nobody services these in Detroit. Also the battery holder is always getting tangled in the cords which is annoying. I'd recommend Noise-Cancelling headphones, just not these. I'm looking at the Sony NC6's as my next pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have ear inserts and this is AWESOME","review":"I work out alot and run also. I also travel alot for work. I HATE the ear buds as they give me headaches and make my ears hurt so I came across these pair of headphones at SFO international airport. I bought them and LOVED them until they broke due to my negligence. I bought the same type on amazon and I cant rave enough about them. Travels very well and its very compact for a noise reduction set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price","review":"While I do not like the inline power module very much (it's a bit bulky), the headphones perform as advertised. They do an excellent job of removing the noises from motors and other lower-pitched sounds. Voices and other higher-pitched sounds are muffled, but do get through.I didn't expect these to perform like a $200 pair of Bose, but I have not been at all disappointed in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones but ....","review":"My experience is that the headphones are awesome using iPOD's or listening to movies on the airplane. The noise reduction is not perfect but it helps alot. The only problem I have experienced is that when I listen to the airplane audio channels I get considerable gain and I can't turn the volume down low enough for pleasurable listening. This may be particular to Boeing 777 economy seating. So.... you may want to bring your own music player just in case you exhibit the same problem on your flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not block airplane noise","review":"If you just want a nice sounding pair of headphones, buy these, but if you are looking for something to knock down the airplane noise, look elsewhere. They just dont get the job done. Not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, light, and they work","review":"Great product. I am very pleased with the refurbished PRXC 250 noise-canceling headphones. I bought them for air travel and they work extremely well. I especially like the light weight and very small size when folded up. I can imagine that bigger over-the-ear muffs might work slightly better, because ear muffs provide more noise attentuation than on-ear headphones, but these do an excellent good job and are much lighter and easier to wear. There is an audible hissing noise (\\"white noise\\") when the noise cancelation is on, but it is not bothersome and hardly detectable compared to the ambient noise on a airplane. When wearing these headphones, and plugged into the plane's audio circuit, the music and movie sound is drastically clearer due to the reduction of the background noise. I don't find the separate battery pack to be a problem - it clips on a belt or pocket, or I just keep in lap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it...","review":"Of course, just when I bought these refurbished the price on the new ones is lower than the refurbished ones - go figure!!!I've been searching for a pair of headphones with noise cancellation and great sound... they're all 'not that great'. The sound level is too low, there's no bass (especially with the noise cancellation off, only a bit better with it on), etc. Instead, I'm switching back to my Koss PortaPro headphones... they're AMAZING, a lot less money, don't require batteries... and believe me, no matter how ugly they look, they're almost as great as $400 over the ear giant audiophile headphones.... I'm super happy with the Koss PortaPro, but not all that happy with these.... actually, I'm quite disappointed in them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiss can be a problem for some people","review":"We wanted them for airplane travle but I just returned them for two reasons.The female members of my family (who must have outstanding hearing) complained about a very distracting hiss when the noise reduction was on. I (as many people) was unable to hear that frequency, but my wife had also tried the Bose ones in a store and they did not have this problem. So it must be a Sennheiser specific issue where they were gambling on most people not being able to hear that hiss.The other reason why I finally returned my pair too was the fact that the noise reduction simply wasn't that great. We were also trying the tinyEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator Earphones (Black)which go directly into your ear (like a plug) and they did a much better job of blocking out unwanted noise. They are super small and only cost about half of what the Sennheiser headphones are going for. So it was an easy decision for us. 3 x Etymotic ER6i for our flight to Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"I bought them for my wife and she likes them when she flies.

It went down three time in the first day (I wrote a longer review here but lost it when it went down the third time).I did call SMC technical support which is available 24x7. They had me set the link speed/duplex from Auto-detect to 10mbs/half duplex. This did not fix the problem. She told me I needed to keep rebooting the router.

Hoping to get it to work, otherwise Linksys here I come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance & Fast easy setup","review":"This was a great choice. The setup was so easy that I was up and running in about 10 mins. Of course, wiring the house took quite a while in addition to the 10 mins.The printer works better now that it's connected to the routers printer port and best of all, all 3 of my PC's have acces to it. The printer port setup was simple...it took all of 60 seconds.The built-in firewall is so good that my Zone Alarm software never gets to log in any attacks now that it's behind the SMC firewall.I highly reccommend this for amatuer and pro.Wireless systems are just not as solid and trouble free. In my opinion, it's worth the time and effort to wire-up. The cost is small, about [money] in materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"an Excellent product for the Price","review":"It was a piece of cake to setup.

I have spent over 4 hours on 3 separate occasions, at different times and days, trying to get through to their support to obtain an RMA (Return Authorization - to get the device repaired or replaced)for repair unsuccessfully.

It took me longer to do the cabling from room to room than to set-up the router itself, it was so easy. Since then, it has been a solid performer in both environments, lasting through two DSL providers and a cable provider.

The only problem was the one of the units' free network cables was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news...","review":"1. Basic routing worked ok.2. Dial-on-demand doesn't. There is a poor workaround, but it results in lots of unwanted connect time and it's buggy.

To avoid unwanted connect time, the unit must be configured so that all users must have administrative access in order to manually initiate dialing. Very insecure.4. Administrative interface poorly designed and buggy.5. Print server is extremely slow. Useful only for simple text printing. Won't operate bi-directional with Win ME so you can't use the features of a \\"smart\\" or multi-function printer.6. Tech support is horrid. Non-response to some e-mails.

I emailed SMC's technical support three weeks ago, and was ignored.If you do not need the voice/video of Windows Messanger or similar programs, the router works ok.

This is ridiculous......This is the very exact opposite to LINKSYS......With Linksys, I could talk a technician with almost no waiting time. I mean it is like RIGHT AWAY SERVICE. Now, that's what I call EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.......This product has smooth setup. Just Plug-and-Play and you are connected to the Internet.

Before I got this router, I was having great difficulty maintaining my connection (I don't know why). \\"Always on\\" wasn't exactly true.

I mean why not??? This is just an example. I also have been experimenting my other ports exposing to the WAN and it is a pain. Some don't even work.If one of your purpose of buying this product is server related, this product would not be a good buy.But if you want to just share internet connection, this product is good enough, just good enough.And also technical support is also NOT good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It rocks","review":"I bought this router early this year (2001). I've been extremely satisfied with it. Home LAN and internet sharing setup was really easy with the router; no sweat! What really distinguishes the SMC router with most of other products is its printer port. I originally had doubts about the parallel/printer port that came on the router. After using it for almost a year now, I'm totally sold on it. The setup was easy and it alleviates my home LAN from having to have a dedicated printing machine.I've tested the port forwarding feature by setting up a Half-Life server. It worked without problems.

If you like Gilliam's stuff, you'll probably like this but I classify this movie as a renter, not something I would own and watch repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much as i want to say yes, eh...no.","review":"Being a huge fan of both Johnny Depp and Heath Ledger, and not to mention a love how should i say it...trippy movies? I saw the previews for this and was so excited. However as much as i want to say it was a great movie, it was not. Heath Ledger did a great job, but Johny Depp, Colin Farwell, and Jude Law only appear in the movie each for like 5-15 minutes. It was really a let down as at least i thought they were going to all have seperate rolls but, unless you have seen the movie you understand, they do not. The plot was very dull, but the visuals (when they finally came back after the movie would dull down for like 45 minutes) were pretty nice. But overall, big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Visual","review":"I found this to be very visual but also disappointing --- I simply don't understand or appreciate what the director was trying to say --- from what other people have said in their reviews, I guess I fall into the latter category of not quite \\"getting it\\" --- that's life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"imaginarium of dr parnassus","review":"the arrival from the shipper was fantastic. the actual movie STUNK, its too bad heath ledger is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond imagination","review":"I'm sorry, but this movie was a hot mess. I can't even begin to talk about what went on, because it was so haphazard and disorganized. I viewed it already knowing what the story was and I still could find nothing intelligible in it. Whatever Terry Gilliam was trying to say wasn't comprehensible to me.There are obviously people who like this kind of movie, but to me it seemed to be pure self-indulgence on the director's part. The whole thing needed stripping down and remaking by someone to whom telling a story mattered. As a 5-minute music video it might have worked; as a two-hour movie it just meandered pointlessly along, a series of barely connected scenes in which anything that Gilliam happened to think of was filmed and included in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"I tried to watch this film, I really did. If for no other reason but to see Heath Ledger's last performance. Well, what a waste of time and effort. What a mess of confusion, violence, and depressing images. I couldn't figure out what was going on, no matter where I picked up the film, at different scenes when it was of cable. It just never went anywhere, unless you count all of over the place, going somewhere. It was really a waste of time, also for the great actor Christopher Plummer. I can't figure out why any of the fine actors in this film signed on-especially the ones who filled in for Ledger after his death. And why three of them? To make the storyline, whatever it was, seem more confusing, weird, creepy and depressing? Well, mission accomplished then. If there are people out there, who justify this film with the prhase, 'this is my kind of weird', then that is what they are signing on for by watching this film. Some kind of weird-the worst kind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Rotten Egg","review":"Watching this movie was like being trapped in bumper car hell, buffeted all around by outpourings of chaotic acting energy, plotless action, and computer graphics best left to \\"The Revenge of Roger Rabbit\\". How can so many fine actors produce such a scrambled rotten egg?Long before this movie mercifully ends, we can guess that the devil will lose the bet, and the hero (not the villain) will get the girl. A predictable plot ending is an aspect of many movies, the fun is in seeing how the protagonists pull it off. Not so here.

I think there should have been some sort of disclaimer on the packaging saying it is recommended to be high or on strong prescription medication which I was neither. This movie is really out there and whomever made the trailer for this movie deserves some sort of award to transform the movie it is to the trailer that got me all excited.Acting is good but I felt myself always wondering what was going on and to be honest I still don't know what the movie was trying to portray.To be fair I was still somewhat intrigued by the movie but will never and I mean ever watch it again.

Easily half of this book is about her mother's school days at Bryn Mawr or irrelevant stories about her family that have NOTHING to do with her acting.

The songs that make Face to Face so strong are: Dandy, Rosie Please Come Home, Party Line, Rainy Day in June, Fancy, Holiday in Waikiki and Queen of Darkness. It does seem Ray enjoys mocking the rich, songs like House in the Country and Real Estate song are tracks that kinda drag out those themes too much. You can see a split between the brothers on this album also. Dave seems to be still stuck in 65' while his brother Ray pushes onto 66' with his more envolved numbers.

After giving up we went out and bought a gallon of Nature's Miracle Stain & Odor Remover, which worked wonders. If you really have some serious pet stains then I would recommend using the Nature's Miracle, even if you don't have pet stains the Nature's Miracle cleans non-pet stained carpet better than the Hoover solution as well.

They are very entertained and the fact that there is little to no talking in the clips makes it more or less universal in understanding. I usually make up 10 or so questions about the video (pre-typed and use as handouts), which gives me materials for vocabulary to pre-teach before watching the clip.

But no, once it's downloaded, hey presto, you find out it is the 2011 version. This article at [...] describes how the current \\"owners\\" of the NIV translation are seeking to suppress the 1984 version and put a disguised gender-neutral version in its place. \\"An examination of the text reveals that this new 2011 edition of the NIV is actually a minor revision of the TNIV, the gender-neutralizing revision of the NIV that was published in 2005.\\" NO THANKS!

Dr. Leeb correctly predicted the 2008 oil crisis very early in this decade (when oil prices were still hovering at $35/bbl and all market and governmental pundits predicted more of the same (\\"The Oil Factor\\"). In this book, he astutely portrays the current energy crisis, its history, and possible civilization-changing ramifications IF immediate and costly actions are not quickly taken. Understanding the denial and \\"follow-the-group\\" mentality of human nature, Dr. Leeb concludes this expert treatise by wisely laying out a suitable investment strategy to help one survive and prosper while others struggle with their heads still firmly imbedded in the ground.

In this book, Stephen Leeb makes the point that we are there now! Just how it is going to unfold he is unsure of but the time to make investments is now and this is the book to read if you want profit from the crisis. The big question that the author ask is: where is our government, the media, the press, and why are they not raising the alarm and informing the public. The author has a great answer to that question. This is a very good book, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I thought this book had some really good ideas on how to evaluate the level of economic stress from ongoing oil shortages, and offered some good thoughts on how take advantage of oil depletion.

Instead he uses a few graphs with primitive analysis to make his case. He says he is not an expert on the oil economy. How does he have the temerity to believe that taking a brief foray into the field he can be confident he has the answers that true experts disagree about so widely. In the reading I have done Hubbert's peak will be reached anywhere from last year to 35 years from now.It looked to me like he hade about 4 or 5 chapters worth of material but nevertheleess wanted to make a book out of it so he filled the rest with topics on the psychology of crowds and general observations about the market.

The cart design has seen some minor changes, such as solid foam-filled wheels instead of the air-filled ones on my older model. The build directions have also improved. The only complaints I'd have are the fact the front wheels are not castored, so you have to raise it on two wheels to turn it at all. But I find that once it is in place where I want it, I don't need to worry so much about that.

I'm black and I have soft hair that has really deep waves. It doesn't like to stay straight and even with relaxers it reverts. It takes forever to dry and frizzes with the first sign of moisture. Clearly that means I blow dry and flat iron a lot which means heat damage, and since I use Aphogee treatments and conditioner I tried this. It makes my hair sticky, dull looking, and fluffy no matter how much I use. Once it's in no amount of oil sheen, hair grease or cream will give it shine,and it stays sticky until I wash it out.

I ordered this and the Aphogee shampoo for damaged hair. The shampoo is just OK (I haven't seen any dramatic changes yet), but I'm not liking the keratin spray at all. I haven't noticed any decrease in hair loss, my hair feels sticky and-when I brush it-it feels like I'm actually getting MORE breakage! It's only been a week, so I'll keep using it for a while longer and see what happens.UPDATE: I've been using the shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and keratin restructurizer a month now and I'm still not impressed. I haven't seen any improvment in the condition of my hair - in fact, my hair actually feels more coarse if I don't use my Bio-Silk along with the keratin spray.I'm not even going to bother using up these products, I'm going back to my Suave and Bio-Silk."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i hadn't wasted money on it","review":"when i brought this i was originally looking for something to spay in my hair every day but i decided to get this instead it really doesn't do anything for my hair and yes i followed the directions and applied heat to my hair after i washed it but i could live without it. i really dont see what it's doing and i've tried it a couple of times...so yeah, but the chi keratin mist does wonders for my hair i love that product but this i wish i could return it but i already used it"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this?","review":"i dont even know what this does, i bought it hoping it would help keep my hair healthy and cut down on the dryness, over all, it didnt do much for me, invest in something better,although my hair style is curly african american hair"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"I got this to help with my split ends because I blow dry daily.

Having said that, it's not a dry philosophical treatise. I became involved in the lives of these characters, and as others have said, saw a similarity to A Christmas Carol. It's a whole new take on Dicken's famous story, with a successful experiment playing the role of the Christmas Spirits to teach Professor Marlowe (the Scrooge of the story) a few invaluable life lessons. You'll be disappointed if your idea of a good SciFi novel is non-stop action, since Wakely's book is more deliberately paced and thoughtful. Instead of fast food literature, this is a sit-down kind of meal that- in the end- is not only more satisfying, but more nourishing (and better for you) than anything from a drive-through window. An Audience for Einstein is a very good, intelligent book that deserves to be discussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended to me based on other books that I had bought from Amazon (Time Traveller's Wife, Life of Pi, to name a few).

The storyline was predictable and too simplistic -- a doctor goes beyond ethical bounds and the subjects suffer. This concept is interesting but the book isn't. The novel might be more appropriate for young or teen readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious read, interesting idea","review":"Only the premise of the story carries this book along, and I find it tedious to read. The characters are hard to penetrate beyond the surface. But I hate skipping to the end so I slogged through. I get a star for reading this one. But it is an interesting idea. The concepts frequently reminded me of issues in the Frankenstein story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This was a fun book. I was afraid it was going to be stuffy and all intellectual, but it keep my interest and had some genuinely amusing moments. I liked the old professor and Miguel, and how their highly unusual relationship helped both of them become better human beings. Several nice surprises throughout, with a great ending. I would say recommended for everyone from teens on up. (Some mild adult situations, language.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been okay as a short story","review":"The only reason I'm bothering to review this book is so others like me won't be fooled by the 5 star rating into thinking this is some masterpiece of literature. It's a pretty cool story, but only deserves to be maybe 50 pages, not 170. There is just endless tedious dialogue that bored me so badly that I skimmed over the last 40 pages in about 15 minutes just to find out the ending. The characters don't seem real at all; their dialogue is incredibly \\"on the nose\\". Most of the scenes had either no suspenseful buildup or no interesting climax. The core idea and the ending were okay, which is why I give 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for all ages","review":"I'm guessing this book got its young adult label just because one of the characters is an eleven year old boy. If so, I hope that doesn't stop older readers from reading it. This is an intelligent story that broaches some important medical debates that are far from being settled. Wakely's take on those debates- in the form of two opposing characters, who each state their case in convincing fashion- will keep you reading to the touching, clever ending. There's the possibility of a sequel here, although Wakely had better be careful to not just rehash the plot, since it's hard to see how a second book with the same theme could be better than the original. Also read Flowers for Algernon (if you haven't already) since that book is in the same vein as An Audience for Einstein.

The face light does not light the LCD screen so it is impossible to see the digital time, alarm, and fishing information in the dark. The face does not have numbers from 4 to 8, so you are basically left to your best guess as to which number the hands are pointing to (a watch should tell time AT A GLANCE!). The watch requires a special band that cannot be found anywhere. So if you break the band or want to find an upgrade, you are out of luck. Worst of all, the band links are not easily removed - it took me trips to 3 jewelers to finally find one who had the special tool required to move the unique links on this wacth band. Overall, since the watch is basically useless in low light conditions (often the case in fishing and alarm situations) I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good analog/digital watch","review":"I bought this watch more than 2 mnths ago...it is working fine since then...good looking watch with many features...its a little heavy and thickness is more... seems quite durable and reliable... keeps perfect time..moon indicator is nice function..its gives double advantage of seeing both analog and digital time at the same time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius.

Personally, I didn't care much for this book. It certainly isn't one of the worst of the series, but it could have been much better. I didn't find that the book was written particularly well and it could have used more action. I found the book disappointing for a number of reasons. For one, the most important clue to locating the helmet was given to the Hardys; instead of being something that they figure out for themselves. As well, while Frank, Joe and Evan are harassed by a couple of the crooks throughout much of the book, they hardly ever actually come into contact with them until the end of the book. The only one of the Hardy's friend to appear in the book is Chet and he is only in the beginning and the end.

Luckily I gave her a second chance and I love these Nautre of Desire books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Joey W. Hill has a delicate and beautiful way with erotica, even erotica that edges the extreme. The work goes beyond entertainment and explains the motivations in a way that grabs your inner being and shakes it, until you understand what the characters need, and why.

The author recounts the studies of scientific historians bringing to light the deception of famous scientists:- Ptolemy who took the credit from another Greek astronomer, Hipparchus;- Galileo, father of empiricism, who's experiments defied replication;- Newton who, from his lofty seat as president of the Royal Society, accused Leibniz ofplagiary while doctoring supporting measurements to make his own Principia morepersuasive.From there the author describes more modern plagiarism and outright deceit within the scientific community.This is a great read for those seeking a career in the sciences or in engineering.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Full of case studies proving that Darwin, Galileo, Pasteur and Newton all \\"stretched the truth\\" scientifically when it suited them.

This is a thorough treatment of his work, and I would recommend it to anyone who 1) desires to know how the ethnological process should be carried out or 2) just wants to read reallly good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pinnacle of artful journalism","review":"Gay Talese epitomizes literary journalism, or, as Tom Wolfe coined it, \\"The New Journalism\\". He writes articles as if they were short stories; they are character-driven and artfully written with the smoothest prose you'll likely ever read. His most famous stories, like \`Frank Sinatra Has a Cold' and \`The Silent Season of a Hero', are about famous people. But he preferred to write about common people, often with unique jobs, such as the obituary writer in \`Mr. Bad News'. He can make anyone fascinating to read about.This anthology is a good starting point for initiates to Telese's work, though I would have liked some excerpts from his more famous longer works, such as \`Honor Thy Father' or \`Thy Neighbor's Wife'.

It's one of my favorite games ever. Fascinating story, beautiful graphics, and great atmosphere. I was hoping for more of the same from Jericho.Unfortunately, Jericho was a disappointment. The graphics are very nice, but monotonous compared to the variety in Undying. I found the gameplay rather boring. The multitude of characters was cumbersome; they often got in the way, just because there were so many of them, and I didn't like being forced to switch characters just to get through certain levels.Worst of all was the DRM. Maybe it's because I'm running Windows 7, but it kept forcing me to re-activate the product. Every time I ran it, I had to put the disc in the drive and activate the game...again. What a pain.

For what I paid, I'm happy. I won it in just over a week. It's a first-person shooter as you work your way through various levels. Graphics were great - nicely detailed and control was fine. The thing about this game is you get to jump from person to person in your team, each of which has seperate weapons or powers. And they're all surprisingly fun to play. I thought I'd ignore some of them - and maybe 1 or 2 I thought were weak, but the others were a lot of fun to play. It's got this horror-theme going on, which was all right. Graphics were nice but had that monochromatic thing going on - you know, when they need to save on processing power? But still it looked good and I liked it. I thought the ending was utterly dumb.

Very young children will love the pictures but will be bored by the words. Older children will also love the pictures, but will find the text \\"preachy\\". This book would almost be better without the words. At least then it would allow the reader to make up their own inner dialogue about what it is the blind girl is \\"seeing\\". I can only suppose that the book lost something in the translation from Chinese to English. Either that, or the publishers felt that the pictures were strong enough to overshadow the overly sentimental writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Just adding to the two reviews already here, this DVD (and it's companions from this outfit) are little more than commentary by several (to me, at least) unknown British musicians from a band called \\"Autumn Wind\\" who wax eloquent about how great and underappreciated RB and Rainbow is/was/will be, interspersed with maybe 20 to 30-second concert clips in between.I fell for this scam and bought BOTH Rainbow DVDs. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting, waste of time and money","review":"Wow...other reviewers already covered it, but I gotta say...DO NOT buy this DVD if you are expecting any sort of decent Rainbow footage...you'll get a very brief clip (generally an intro, or bit of a solo) then it cuts away to some no-name British wanker telling you how great Ritchie is, then some lousy session musician will tell you how he would make a certain solo better, and so on. Some comments from actual, legit musicians (Neil Murray and Dougie White) are nice, but the latter pretty much plays the company man and thinks everything is just perfect. I can only assume this was made to rob people of their money, as it doesn't at all deliver what the packaging states, and seems like something some friends put together so that one day Ritchie might talk to them. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste","review":"I really looked forward to watching this two disc set and hoped to see interviews with past members of the band and some great footage. Instead I was subjected to 2 hours of nonsense spewed forth by some pretentious unknowns called \\"Mostly Autumn\\" as well as some ridiculous pseudo rock critics and a session musician, all of whom pretend to be experts on Richie Blackmore and Rainbow. Nothing new is offered here. Viewers are treated to usually no more than 20 seconds of some really great live Rainbow tune, before the music is actually faded down and the pretentious yabbering begins again. This was really sad and one of the worst music DVD's I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price, but limited...","review":"The picture quality and software are quit good, especially for the price.However, it only has manual focus which is not very easy to use unless you pick full closeup or infinity. Also, the CCD is rather insensitive so you need a really bright subject to get good pics. Finally, they designed the lens to point in the wrong direction by default; it points a the user rather than away. Normally this is not a problem, you just swivel the camera, but you have to do this every time you take it out of the provided pouch because it holds the unit only one way; the camera points at the user. Silly design.But, for the $75, it is quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for 1.3 MP, works with my T3","review":"Just bought one over the intenet and downloaded the driver for my T3 palm. So far I've found it takes well balanced color pictures (as long as lighting is adequate) with the expected resolution limitations of a 1.3 MP camera.

So far no real complaints besides the noticeable shutter delay after pressing the button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I have never been as disappointed with a purchase as I am with this one.

Whenever he comes across a word he doesn't understand, he looks it up in the dictionary! It really impresses people when a child asks them, \\"what does that word mean?\\" It seems that most kids are so used to hearing words they don't know the meanings of, that they just learn to brush past it.This book teaches HOW to get the definition of a word, and it makes it easy to do so.

But Local Treasures also tells some interesting stories about the methods of geocaching--and how people use it as a both a hobby and a way to orient themselves to the places they occupy in the world. The photos and stories in this book really manage to invoke a sense of the diversity of places and people across the US, and to give the reader a brief sense of alignment with those places.Overall, a beautiful array of photos stitched together with a great storytelling voice give a relaxing and worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee table grabber","review":"This book is just what you need to capture the interest of possible cachers.

I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this album and I'm sure it will be in my CD player for a long, long time.I had a chance to meet these two recently at a recent Tesla gig (Aug. 12th, 2005).

To hear Jeff Keith's powerful vocals, the lyrics that speak to your soul and the driving beat is something that's been missing from the music scene for way too long.

As Megan hangs more with Perdita she realizes she is not just a freak but there is more to this girl.

I am confident in my ability to do wiring, so this was not a big deal. The item comes with three sizes of fittings for the hole into which you insert the light bulb housing and this came in handy as I could choose the size of the pvc, this would go for the size of the drill holes as well for a piece of woodworking or pottery.

Instead, I found a very personal tale, filled with with onformation about the biths of his three children and the most outlandish condemnation cases. In one, he told about cockroaches crawling all over the property owner. In 2 more he told tales of human waste being discovered on the premises. In the rest he mostly told how having a beer or a chaw of chewing tobacco with the property owners changed the previously hostile people to those who accepted his first offer for the property.

What about the last game of the season and the playoff?? Oh well, to tell you the truth, I'm very disappointed regarding *all* the NFL films I have. Come on, how can someone turn a whole season into a 25-minute tape?? Very disappointing... But again, if you want to improve your Buccaneers library, you should buy the tape. At least the material that they have is very good. Another disappointing aspect is that they don't give you the final results of every game or any kind of statistics.

It comes with 2 batteries and 4 machine screws/nuts for drawer mounting but NO wall mounting screws. Be careful of the door if you drawer mount it as it is heavy and swings freely. That's why I recommend wall mounting this safe instead. Mount a cleat(a small strip of wood)horizontally on the wall first and rest the safe on top of it to support the weight while mounting it to the wall. I live in a mobile home so wood screws work fine. I used 2-3/8 wood screws at Wal-Mart by Bulldog Hardware (product# WS-150). This is not required but I put foam tape weatherstip (3/8\\" wide x 3/16\\" thick) around the door jam just to give it a softer closing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Security at an affordable price","review":"Purchased this safe to have a secure place to keep documents.

He seems to be hiding behind diversions, lame reflections and obviousness instead of driving the story forward.I can hardly understand how this book can appeal to anyone looking for science fiction.

Here were the original members of my beloved COMMISSIONED, back together again, and performing all of my favorite tunes! Of course I bought it. However, I must say that I am somewhat disapointed.Perhaps its the fact that the songs were recorded live in concert. My favorite songs did not minister to me in the same way as the individual CD's had in the past. It was as if the new lead singer was trying the \\"Out-Do\\" the original members. As if he were trying to make his mark. On many of his solo vocal spots, he was yelling out the lyrics and not blending with the others. This was a major \\"turn off\\".

The end of the film is basically a long session of Kerry bashing, which has little intellectual meaning - it doesn't shed light on the F 9-11 issue.

It is perfectly legitimate to question some of the fact's on Moore's documentaries. He does present many facts that are questionable.

I called Timex support and they suggested I try to put the transmitter on when I wasn't at the gym. At first I thought this helped, but the problem recurred. I tried wetting the transmitter contact pads as much as possible and decided as much as I liked the product when it was working properly, I couldn't solve the problems, so I returned it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features hampered by quality issues","review":"The features for this heart rate monitor are great--the hourly chime, alarm, timer, chronometer, and of course the heart rate monitor transition well from workouts to just a great watch that keeps me on track.The huge problem is that the start button that helps to set up everything has begun to be rather unresponsive after only a week of use! I haven't exactly dunked the watch in a sink of water either, but for some reason the crispness of that button press is gone and now I have to try a few times whenever I want to get it to work.The heart rate sensor chest strap isn't too comfortable either, and it does take a little time with the manual to figure out.

Truth is, it is easier to operate than any Polar watch (I've had a couple) and should give any runner, except for the elite enough features to train completely.My main complaint is the quality: The HRM strap I received was defective, so I returned it and 2 months or so later received a replacement. Now the replacement HRM is not working right and so I have to send it back. Luckily, it is still under warrantee. The long and short of it...I've bought a USED Polar watch to keep me going while this one is getting repaired, so it might be worth the extra $20 or so dollars to get the Polar R100 and avoid delays: it's like needing a car to use while the new one is in the shop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HRM Timex","review":"It is a nice watch that is easy to read and use once you read the directions.

Even so, the buttons and sequences for the HR functions are intuitive and easy to understand. The HR transmitter strap sends a strong signal and does not interfere with others nearby. I'd highly recommend this for someone who wants a HR monitor/watch that is simple and easy to use.

As others have pointed out, the straps are small. I just didn't realize how small until I tried them. I do not have large wrists, but could not get the wrist strap to work for me. It was so bad I couldn't get an accurate heart rate until I took the watch off. The strap was pinching an artery on my wrist so that it would read about 31 BPM!-even on the loosest setting, which made the watch flop around on my wrist. If I took the watch off, it would accurately read my heart rate!Also the chest strap for the sensor was too tight for me opened all the way.

The stamped, unpolished metal blades have a powdery white discoloration and there are multiple scratches on them. The blades are held together with an unpolished rivet, so all of the unpolished metal makes these scissors difficult to open and close. If only they had uploaded a photo of the other side of the scissors where the word PAKISTAN is stamped, I never would have bought these. Overall I would assess the value of these scissors at $1.00 US or less.Don't buy this cheap and unusable product. I took one for the team on this one.

Your other alternative without the kickstand is to lay it on its side, which is not a good idea regarding the oil and the gas, which will leak out in time.

The archetypes are lived here, in flesh and blood, and the courage to live is palpable. But like all tales of truth, this journey is not without raw and honest humor. There is no ego here, covering up the mud on the author's face. Naivete is exposed on these pages, and so the account is all the more readable and real.

WinXP seems to have been an afterthought in this book as it is included in some parts but not in others, but mostly it is not mentioned in any useful context.The section on debugging is probably the best, and most needed if you try to install Samba according to this book, but then I already got a copy of that chapter free from a link on the Samba website.My copy of this book is currently gathering dust on the floor and I am using FTP to transfer files.Not recommended for Samba beginners, for whom I guess it was intended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Publication...I've Got A Running Server!!!","review":"I found this book to be really useful.

It was actually quite embarrassing as I was watching it at a friend's house and I started to cry because I was laughing so hard. I rarely laugh out loud when I watch comedians even though I find things funny...I must laugh on the inside or something.

Where on earth do we vote for that??"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Words Needed","review":"Just buy it. I would have given it more stars if that had been an option. Eddie Izzard is the funniest comedian I have seen in a very long time. This particular performance is several hours long, but when it's over you will be disappointed that he stopped at only one encore.Probably the funniest bit I have ever seen is done completely in french. Who knew?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love Eddie Izzard","review":"Having seen \\"Definite Article,\\" and his one-man NYC show \\"Dress to Kill\\" twice, I rather enjoyed \\"Glorious\\". Although DA is one of Izzard's best, and includes the classic moment of Mother Nature teaching sex to animals, Glorious has the beautiful \\"Covered in Bees\\" riff. Not to mention Izzard's take on the bible is one of the best I've heard so far. True, Glorious is not one of his best, but it is the only one of his videos available in American VHS format (other than bootlegs you can maybe convince your friend to get). And as to continuity of thought, I've never found Izzard big on that, it's jsut that he's so full of digressions and random leaps of logic and flights of fancy that he's delightful.The one low point in the video is the end of the second set (About the airplane). But right after it is the fantastic bit about computers.

Perhaps on the DVD? Eh, Eddie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LAUGHS!","review":"You can't go wrong with any Eddie Izzard concert. He is so smart and funny; well worth your $$.

Laugh out loud and quote the lines again and again...or double your sense-of-humor back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD full of laughs","review":"Love Eddie Izzard's stuff, and though this isn't his most recent DVD, it's all new material (not seen in his other DVDs/specials). He does a delightful imitation of an evil giraffe, a hilarious Sean Connery impression, and remembers the utter uselessness of push-mowers. How about Eddie as a beekeeper - flirting? Or those appliance dials that lie to us. Love ya, Eddie. I agree with another reviewer that Izzard should be prescribed medication for anyone feeling a bit blue one day. I've watched (and love) Full Circle and Dressed to Kill and would still highly recommend Glorious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out for the bird strike!","review":"Where did this guy come from? My daughter rented this Eddie Izzard DVD. I was blind-sided with the sophisticated, mime-style humor of Eddie Izzard (is this his real name? Is he really a \\"he\\"?). From hearing about Genesis to wondering why Noah had to get two of everything... including ducks..., Eddie Izzard brought a unique perspective to comedy. Nothing was off limits... the Queen Mother, Death, hopscotch, speed archeology, toasters, and Achilles. It is all here!Take special note of the set... very minimalist. Izzard uses his talents to make you \\"see\\" what he is describing, without depending on props. From swords to Hoovers, you will get his meaning.Rated R for mild profanity, and I for irreligious."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Glorious","review":"I'm sorry to all the people I am about to offend by saying this, but for my money you can't buy a better Izzard show than Glorious. While it's true that is lacks some of the fine tuning that so many have praised Dress to Kill for having, it more than makes up for its \\"rough around the edges\\" delivery by being the funniest set Izzard has ever done. This once again proves that Izzard's wit and comedic genious are in a class of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unstoppable, incomparable, absolute genius","review":"Hilarious, brilliantly structured, mind-blowingly precise, and the best physical/mime work/comedy in any of his tapes. I have seen Eddie Izzard perform twice (once in French) and own all of his videos and one audio of the closing night of his Definite Article tour in London. Glorious is by far and away the best of the lot. This is the one that got me hooked on Izzard. He's still funny, but he's gotten less so, for reasons perhaps not so interesting to discuss here.However, this tape is total genius. Unlike any stand-up I've ever seen, Glorious is like having the funniest, wittiest, smartest person possible entertain you at a cocktail party for an hour and a half. Do not miss out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you like mold!","review":"The first time I saw Glorious, I thought \\"that wasn't as good as Dressed to Kill\\". But since then I have found that Glorious grows on you like mold. Eddie Izzard has such an interesting way of looking at the world! And many of the things that you don't laugh at the first time you see Glorious will drift back to your mind at the strangest of times.Every time I see this show, I like it better! I'm anxious for more from this brilliant comedian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie at his finest!","review":"If you go to any of the Eddie Izzard DvD's user comments on Amazon you will see that its almost unanimous that \\"Dressed to Kill\\" is his most popular performance. Personally I think that if any of his acts could give dressed a run for its money it would be Glorious. Although, that may be because I watched dressed over 100 times and it kind of lost any moments that could take me by suprize and make me laugh. Anyways If you are an Izzard fan Glorious is a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bunch of flowers!","review":"To someone who's never heard of the man: he can probably best be described as a stand-up Gary Larson. His humour seems at right angles to everyone else in comedy (who else could do a bionic Queen mother?). His videos definitely amuse even after many watchings, although for uncontrollable laughter its better to see him live. To best appreciate his genius, try repeating one of his sketches to some friends who've never heard of him, and watch the blank faces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The HBO special was hysterically funny. I had never heard of Izzard man before and looked forward to experiencing 'Glorious' as well. Just my luck, but the best I can say for this effort is: incoherent.

After spending 3 days of non stop reading, I can honestly say that this book was the most interesting and influental read I have ever had. The story of the incarnation of id and the relationship and struggles between Carmack and Romero is both gripping and motivational. To see the progress of our generations history, and I say that as I am 23, through the video game timeline, knowing it started with them. Regardless of what politicians and critics claim...the video game culture IS the world's greatest cultural phenomenon, and these 2 men paved the way for what we look at now as the future of gaming!Kushner did an extraordinary job by merging both the facts of the industry and a compelling story together to make a book that I recommend ANY and ALL gamers read.

If you have any interest in the life of two kids who took the videogame industry by storm read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn what happened to good games","review":"This is the most intriguing true story that I have read in a while, and the only reason I didn't rate it higher is that it is very difficult to read; I don't mean that the writing's complicated, I just mean that the story rips your heart out. I grew to know and love Tom Hall, John Romero, and John Carmack as I read, and then I grew to dislike most of the people involved in id Software because they were concentrating less and less on story, humor, and fun and more about making money and having the prettiest technology.If you want to know what happened to your favorite old games like Commander Keen and Doom and why the industry isn't putting out anything that's as good or better, read this. If, however, you are happy to pay fifty dollars for what is essentially a showcase of some neat new lighting trick (or whatever) that the programmers just learned, you will not find this very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly amazing and inspirational book!","review":"Truly amazing and inspirational book!While most people who want to become game developer are gamer, game development is indeed a far cry from playing PC/console game leisurely in the afternoon.Although Romero's ion storm is not successful it doesn't really mean that his view of \\"Design is Law\\" is totally wrong.

A good light read that didn't disappoint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book....","review":"I am floored by the good reviews here. The idea behind the book is good, but the book itself is tedious and hair-pulling bad. I was so disappointed, I can't tell you. The protagonist, Birdie, is incapable of dealing with any issues at all, from working, to her ex-husband, to her children. I mean it's hard to imagine anyone being able to relate to her.I certainly didn't mind the absurd plot; that was part of the fun, but Birdie was just singularly incapable of any rational, intelligent behavior. A better writer would have had more fun with the character, but this author created someone so inutterably unlikeable that you just simply could not.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book, do not read this book, don't even think about this book. Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Fun!","review":"I picked this book up because of the title. Goodness knows, I feel like I'm supposed to be a superhero most days (I'm the mother of four).The main character Birdie (AKA Super Mom) is a heroine for women everywhere. Super Mom and her alter ego, the mild-mannered supermarket cashier Birdie Lee, are portrayed with wit and humor. The snappy dialogue is irresistible!Super Mom's sidekick is her son Martin, who helps her build her superhero costume. Super Mom's daughter Kelly is a believable teen, and Super Mom's relationship with her best friend Carrie is a fascinating glimpse at the ups and downs of our closest friendships. There's a wonderful romance in the book too, and a delightfully dark archnemesis, but I won't spoil the plot for you!For all those women who wish they were superheroes, and sometimes feel they ARE unrecognized superheroes, check out this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I was looking for","review":"I am probably like most of the people who are searching for a book like this, I want to make something useful, beautiful, practical, etc. from the numerous ties that the men in my life are no longer using (for various reasons- changing tastes, or fashion, just plain worn-out, or becuase they have passed away.) I found this book to be wanting in the areas of my greatest interest. It seemed like too much emphasis was placed on acquiring ties, like how to word a classified ad, and where to look at thrift shops. I wanted some more guidance in the actual assembly of the projects, and this book just didn't provide that.I also have to admit I was a bit put off by the photo of the author displaying her 'creations' she gave the me impression of a gypsy. The items she made are not attractive, and not at all what I was looking for. I wanted a book that would show me how to assemble the ties into a pretty wall hanging, pillow or quilt, not a funky hat or vest and skirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is wonderful.

I am not an experienced quilter and found the book to be pretty difficult. As stated in another review the patterns were not easily accessible and many of the projects were way too crazy for me to even consider. The patterns are difficult to use in that they are just a light grey underneath all of the writing on the same page! I would have preferred some basic patterns with simple directions so that I could preserve these ties in a memorable way.

I hate to risk cutting up the ties and mess it all up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daddy's Ties is a bust","review":"Although the concept of the book, and the designs in it are good, the author got lazy and used a lot of abreviations that are not normal, and I found myself constantly referring to the front of the book to find out what the abreviation meant.

It seems that I have to open the door at least half way, before the closer will do its job. Since I usually only open it wide enough for me to pass through, the door often slams shut without the closer functioning at all. If I'm carrying something large and open the door wide, then the closer works good with a smooth and quiet closing.

Mr. Miller's commentary complements the stunning interior photographs of most of the great liners and cruise ships of bygone days and up til present time. The NORMANDIE, REX, QUEENS MARY and ELIZABETH, even the infamous, tragic TITANIC. The high point seems to be the 20's and 30's, when Art Deco was the range, and the low point, IMO, the 50's and 60's, with that horrible Scandinavian Modern.If the book has any flaws, it is that it focuses too much on transatlantic liners, and not enough on liners from other routes.

This was not always the case. The great saints, monastics and mystics of the medieval period read and respected this work extremely highly.The \\"Conferences\\", set up as though Cassian was in dialogue with the great hermits of his day (and in some cases, perhaps he actually was) deal with the various issues, choices, and crises which beset all Christians -- not merely those to whom the grace of the religious life has been given.This is a book to be digested slowly, one \\"conference\\" at a time and to be meditated upon -- not to be rushed through.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best...","review":"\\"The Conferences\\", alongside \\"The Sayings of the Desert Fathers\\", has been one of the most influential books for me. If more people read St. Cassian's work, they would be better focused on Christ and more equipped to abide in Him. More people need to read this great work. Here are a couple quotes (keep in mind that the entire work is filled with such wisdom):\\"A person can be broken more easily by prosperity than by adversity.\\" -- Abba Theodore (6.9.4)\\"The one who realizes that more has been forgiven him begins to love more.\\" -- Abba Isaac (9.15.3)St. Benedict made Cassian's \\"Institutes\\" and \\"Conferences\\" required reading for his monks.

I was very disappointed (and even jaded) by this experience with the Treo 650/700's. The concept is fabulous but their execution is subpar. I am now back to paper organizers due to the extent of my frustration.

I almost can't believe I'm reading about the same phone. I've had the phone since July, 2007. I've had no problem at all. I love this phone. Besides using it as a phone, I use the camera, video, calendar, mp3 player, Google maps (free download) and just searching the web (including youtube.com and myspace.com). Text messaging hasn't been an issue either. I've played around with e-reader, and the excel, word, .pdf programs. No issue. I feel bad that many are you are having problems with the Treo 700p. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. Oh, and no I don't work for Treo or affiliated with anyone in the Palm area. Just a consumer like the rest of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm is knowingly selling customers a defective phone.","review":"DO NOT buy this phone if you ever plan to use Bluetooth. It has been well documented on various Palm and Treo websites -- and admitted by Michael Moskowitz, general manager and vice president at Palm -- that the Bluetooth software on the 700p is defective. In a public letter, Mr. Moskowitz promises that there will be a firmware update released in the first half of 2007 that he HOPES will fix the problem, but Palm is making no promises.In the meantime, Palm and Verizon continue to sell a phone that they know is defective. Better that than loose money by taking the phone off the market until it is fixed, right? WRONG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned mine after 19 days...","review":"I returned my Treo yesterday after 19 days. It you read every review with one or two stars you will get the horrible picture. They are not exaggerating, believe me!!! Mine had ALL the problems mentioned. I love the features of this smartphone, the touch screen, the stylus, the email thread....the phone has GREAT features that just would not work. Luckily I had Verizon service and they took back the smartphone with no problem. I was tempted to get another Treo but I had 19 days of hell with this phone. I loved this phone, I really did not want to give it up. I took a blackberry that works well but I still wish I had the Treo...and it was working. If they get this smartphone to work as it should I would definitely get another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Described","review":"Acrylic frame is exactly as described.Easy to assemble.

His playing is both majestic, and personal, and his interpretation of Bach is unique in its sensitivity, faithfulness, and perfection. It is difficult to imagine any music better than that within this immortal recording, especially when listening to the godly Ciaccona, or the perfect Fuga. This recording is the embodiment of the pinnacle of music, that great art, for which the existence of Man is validated, and the potential of what Man can be and accomplish is revealed. It is truly a blessing conferred upon us to have this recording, and Mr. Yaron amongst our company."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL IN PRINT!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This album is still in print, & not worth $129 nor 100 dollars, man somebody is always out to rip other people off!

It gives all of indie rock a solid kick in the face and says: \\"Take that you constant kick bass b@stards.\\" The songs are all perfectly crafted with remarkable and memorable lyrics. The guitar lines are perfect. The bass is a bit soft spoken but amazingly performed. The drums are so solid and catchy that you don't know how to react. Is this medium paced dance music?

The chapters zip by with blinding speed; every chapter leads into the next. One twist in particular is hinted at very early on and left to simmer in the reader's head for almost half the book until its incredible payoff. Every character is by turns hilarious, frightening, and real; the futuristic inventions are never too far beyond the pale, or indeed beyond the end of this decade.

Not fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"the stuff about pharmacies is good, but not much else","review":"If you've read some other reviews then you probably know what the plot of the book is.

And after pages and pages of her self pity at his behavior there was an anticlimactic moment of reconciliation. Let me rephrase that, it was an EMOTIONALLY anticlimactic moment. I just assumed it was another mildly erotic sex scene, but it was the turning point of his feeling. She allowed him to treat her as a one night stand and confirmed his presumption by forgiving him over sex. ***SPOILER*** This is after she bartered her immortality for the purpose of helping his mother keep her soul and looses her in the process.

Possibly because a lot of big heroes (Jameson, Adorno, etc...) are trashed by Docker in this book?Who knows? In any case, the review above is a woeful summary of what was obviously barely more than a skim.Docker does NOT equate poststructuralism with postmodernism, for example. While he certainly shows inconsistency (most notably in his gushing over Bakhtin), and is not above some self-promotion, his arrogance is hardly beyond the pale in this genre. This is a book that means to be provocative. It's also got some style, some humour, and some (thanks be!) unexpected takes on various issues. Those who have encountered Docker in more typical (and perhaps serious and scholarly) modes, will be aware that he knows his stuff too. Here he is actually trying to reinvigorate (by being nasty and even flippant) a discourse that I think he clearly loves."},{"rating":"1","title":"To cheap","review":"I purchased this product in the hope that sometimes cheap stuff is actually ok.

Just as in his previous two books in the trilogy, it's the details that thwart the author's effort. Warfare in the Mechwarrior universe, even the less 'Mech-centric Dark Ages, could not possibly work as written. If an invasion force landed on Earth, there would simply be more effort made to stop the invaders. What sane person would allow the fallen Paladin to duel the Countess of Northwind as described, especially on the brink of a battle for the cradle of humanity?I'm sorry, but even *I* can't suspend reality enough for this one. The best thing the book has going for it are the minor characters, Will, Jock, and Lexa.

This album they put out though, could have been a lot better than it is. The first four songs are great, with all fall down being incredible, but the rest of the album sounds almost the same. They need to mix things up a little more, and get some different sounding horn riffs.

The singer/bassist has confronted this issue by saying that the punk rock scene has gotten hypocritical in the sense that innovations (like adding horns) are likely scorned, judged, or both. They were often boo-d when getting set up at shows when the horns came on to the stage. So shame on all of you who either wrongly label or scorn Against All Authority for its innovations. Besides that, AAA is a very political group that has a strong anti-government message that has a tendency to make a listener want to start a riot in a police station. Though I havent purchased the newest album, 24 hour roadside resistance, I have heard a few songs and AAA really goes all out on it.

It, in my view, has more complexity than say Candy Land, yet is easy for even my youngest. It is a fast play game, but all the extra elements (such as collecting aphids, etc) adds to the game fun. Each card has written directions, but it also has them in picture form as well for the prereaders. I do think that the counting of both the aphids and the spaces (which you need to count backwards and forwards depending on the card drawn) are good learning tools for young children. The box even includes a story about why the Ladybugs are traveling and so forth. Good buy for a game for a youngster & not too bad for the adults that have to play along!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for counting","review":"This game is great for counting! One of the kids I work with, whom I didn't expect to recognize the numbers AND count, began to count out his spaces for each turn the second time playing this game! It motivates kids to count both the spaces and the aphids. I did tweak the rules a bit so we didn't have to give so many aphids to the ants--just made it so you only to give one or two to each ant. It keeps the game moving that way.

I am writing this review because I saw that the game had four stars and I felt compelled to warn other parents that this game is NOT a great game. It was created by a Six year old and it plays like it; way too many \\"go backwards\\" cards and roughly half the cards have \\"take another turn\\" on them. This game involves no strategy or problemsolving, like chutes and ladders, it is 20-30 minutes of counting spaces and blind luck as to who reaches finishline. This game might be fun for some first graders playing by themselves, but parents will find \\"go fish\\" or \\"old maid\\" more exciting and educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but it is not a book","review":"I bought this game for my 3 year old because of the great reviews.

There is nothing going on. you just pick a card and go, nothing is happening on the board there is nothing fun to do at all. Near then end if you dont have enough points you cant go through to the end and have to go in a circle forever. This is not very fun for me or my son.I suggest cariboo.

I had high hopes for this game, and I do admit that it is very simple and very cute, but nothing of interest happens, no giggle-inducing play here. I've tried several times recently (she now almost 3-1/2) to generate interest in this game again, to no avail. She just finds it boring. Players traverse along a path, collect aphids, maybe go back a few spaces, and make it to the end. There are so many games that far surpass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex for younger players","review":"I am surprised that this game has an average of 4 stars! Perhaps for an older child (like the SIX YEAR OLD who DESIGNED it!) this game might be appropriate, but certainly not for a 3-year old! There are simply too many things going on (collecting cards/giving back the card, going back to start if you don't have the card, collecting chips/giving back the chips, getting caught in a seemingly endless loop if you don't have enough chips, moving foward, moving backward, etc, etc). This game was torture for me to play. Even my kids got bored/frustrated VERY quickly. We've had it for almost a year, and have only played it MAYBE a handful of times.

It's too complicated for her age and I don't get how kids can play without reading. I had to thoroughly explain the game to my 6 and 8-year old nieces, and once they finally played they didn't even have fun.

This isnt entirely true. Some cards say go back # and some say go forward. Also,some say go again, ect. Not a big deal because im playing with him, but just a heads up.I bought this as a first game for my 3 year old. He finally has some what of an attention span and has interest in playing games/doing puzzles. He does very well except if you play by the rules, you have to keep looping in a circle until you collect enough aphids. This really annoys him because he doesnt really understand and gets confused ehich spaces to count for his turn. He is very independant and wants to figure it out all by himself but just gets frustrated. I was kind of sticking to the rules because i figured if I just let him pass, it will be harder to re-teach the rules when ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped quickly as described","review":"Bought as gift for granddaughters, sorry I acted on advertising, parents said \\"just another game\\" so similar to many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsessed 3 year old","review":"My 3 year old is completely obsessed with this game. He'll play it by himself if nobody else will play with him. Besides the counting forwards and backwards, number recognition, turn taking, and losing well, he's now learning to add and subtract from it by counting his aphids. We say things like, You had 5 aphids and now you got two more, so now how many do you have? Or, You have 7 aphids and you need 10. How many more do you need? At first he struggled with these questions, but after playing the game over and over, he's now able to do the calculations pretty quickly in his head. Wonderful game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way of learning to count and read","review":"I have two boys 3 years and 5 years old.

My son is exactly 3 years and 4 months old, and he got this game for Christmas from his Grammmie. It's great! he loves to play it, it's easy for him to understand, and it's fun. It's great for him to count out how many spaces he has to move his game piece, and he is learning to recognize numbers. the numbers are printed VERY large on the cards, and so we are teaching him to recognize them.I would recommend this to anyone with a 3-4 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for teaching how to handle disappointment","review":"My mom bought this game for my almost 4 year old son. He hadn't ever played games before. He really loves the game, and though it is all up to chance somehow wins with great frequency. This game has helped teach taking turns and handling disappointment and frustration when you have to keep going back to start, go around the loop to collect more aphids, not getting the number you want or losing a turn. It has also helped with counting and asking if the number of aphids he has is less than 10. I can see how some parents might find this game tedious, but we are a game loving family and it is great to see my son finally enjoy one. I haven't played it with multiple children, but that might change the dynamics somewhat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass.","review":"We received this game as a gift, and my 4-year-old daughter was excited to play it (she has the Grumpy Ladybug game, and this is pretty much in that vein).

The book is wide-ranging covering topics from the philological origins of Tolkien's names and languages to the various types of literature from romantic to epic to lower modern forms represented by the various characters and passages, to the possibly religious aspects of Tolkien's story and the various compromises he made in the process of finishing his never-finished work (And many other aspects, as noted in previous reviewers' comments). \\"Much food for thought\\" is an understatement.

This is basically garage rock with some pretty interesting elaborations.The foundation has a 1960s DIY sound, but on top are voices, eccho, and a chours of voices that go bumb in the night. The album has the feel of a 60s 4:30 horror movie--nice fright noises, but nothing that will even raise goose bumps.Still, you have to admire the CA quintet for expanding the peramiters of garage rock, and as music, this is pretty funFor true frights, though, trySacrificeby Black Widow, or the first Black Sabbath album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't do it for me!","review":"I'm a big fan of 60's psychedelia, especially some of the lesser known bands. When I first saw this album, I knew I had to get it. I loved the cover artwork, and thought I was in for a dark, psychedelic trip. While it is no doubt a psychedelic album, it doesn't even come close to creating the dark spooky atmosphere it seems to aim for. Needless to say, I was dissapointed.

And I also agree that it's not worth changing the band more than once, the pins and the pin holes are too worn out after that. I've very often found myself wearing the only watch that still worked after unbelieveable conditions, including extreme humidity, high heat, shock, below-freezing temps and extreme abuse. The watch laughs off jet fuel, oils, cleaning fluids and anything else I've ever subjected it to. I buy them two at a time just to be sure I have one when my strap breaks, I'm addicted to wearing this thing because it just keeps on going.

However, buy the \\"Voguestrap TX1951 Allstrap 19mm Black Regular-Length Fits Casio and Other Sport Watchband\\" for #3.99 from Amazon.com or Walmart. Instead of using the spring pins that come with the new strap, re-use the original Casio pins. Looking at the watch, the pins can be pushed out from right to left using a paperclip. After putting on new strap, push the original pins back in...left to right. The Casio pins do not use springs. Instead, the right tip snaps into a socket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday Present","review":"This is the only watch my husband can wear because he is allergic to metal.

This is not a thriller or a suspense novel, it is a melodrama, a soap opera.

Everytime a character is in trouble a branch falls, a wave comes, a bump in the road. Jeesh already. And alas, there is no mystery here...O'Brien forecasts everything in a narrative that could easily have been 100 pages less.

I do use it all the time under various conditions and have not had any issue with it coming out so there is no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Perhaps it is because the book is now 5 years old, but reading it now in 2002 it adds no value.

Actually, it is a trip back in nostalgia; an amazing trip.technically, not that great, particularly as a remastered product would be; but inclusive of everything from these early movies; no judicious choice; just a sound dump. So would you like to hear Jimmy Durante again (I would), Kathryn Grayson (not particularly), the Pied Pipers (dated),Gene Kelly (not bad) they will appear. It is the sort of 3cd set that you may keep pushing the track ahead button; but then again you will eventually get to, \\"Night and Day\\", \\"I fall in Love to Easily' (a blockbuster), \\"A Lovely Way to spend an Evening\\" (fantastic). Is there another cd with these early hits at this price? You will even get to hear the early Bobby Socks boosters scream and one of them sighing, \\"Oh! Frankie\\". Oh. to be young again! enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath Stealer","review":"I am a lover of mystery novels, and Eye Contact more than fills my requirements for a satisfying read. The book offers a gruesome and unfortunately believable crime, humanly flawed characters, psychologically disturbing yet frighteningly normal suspects, and a realistic yet uplifting conclusion. Although I was initially drawn to Eye Contact because of the mystery element (which certainly kept me turning the pages eager to find out \\"who done it\\"), the mystery is not what sticks with me a week after finishing the book. Ultimately, Eye Contact is a book about parenting. McGovern's quiet and occasionally heartbreaking insights into the parent/child relationship take my breath away. Eye Contact captures the essential paradox of parenthood: loving our children for who they are within the limitations of who we are."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to write a book about autism, stick to autism","review":"Some interesting -but definitely not new- insights into autism, wrapped around a totally implausible mystery that was definitely not \\"thrilling!\\" I wish I hadn't wasted my precious reading time trying to finish this silliness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Train Wreck!!","review":"Although this book did a good job conveying what the life of a child with autism may/may not be like, the story itself was very difficult to follow and the conclusion was unfulfilling. The characters were drawn quite well and the dialogue was realistic, but there were too many similar names to keep track of and the author recklessly jumped from time and place and point of view. It was actually kind of a mess.

Cammie Mcgovern has written essays on being the parent of an austistic child, so it's no surprise that the characters are vivid, real, and empathetic. Not only was it moving - I couldn't put it down, and it stayed with me for a very long time. I hope she comes back to these characters, I really wanted to know what happened to them. By the end, they felt like friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"McGovern's insight into autism and its effects on family make for extraordinary reading","review":"Cammie McGovern's \\"Eye Contact\\" is fantastic when the book's focus is on the story's protagonist Cara and her autistic child, Adam. McGovern's insight into autism and its effects on family make for extraordinary reading. Where the book is not at the same level is in the mystery/thriller side of things. I felt let down by the resolution of the key event - it comes down to a question of of \\"who was in the woods that day\\"...and on that point, well, things get muddled to say the least.At one point, McGovern seems to forget about Adam and we go through a 20+ page dry stretch in which the book's singular, fascinating character disappears from the pages. Compare that to Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, where the compelling autistic lead Christopher never leaves the reader's sight. That's what made that book such a great read.'Eye Contact' is a good book though, definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Contact","review":"Great book.

I gave it a while and then gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down!","review":"In fact, I couldn't put it down, much to the chargrin of my husband who had to deal with the reading lamp on half the night! Not only did I find the story compelling, but as the mother of a child on the autistic spectrum, I found Adam and Cara totally realistic. So many books with characters with autism have them make amazing, unrealistic recoveries or dramatic improvements in a very short time, which I always find hard to swallow. This book was far more realistic than many in what it's like to be the parent of an ASD child. I was drawn to this book because of the autism tie in, but I think the story would appeal to anyone, because it is a very good \\"whodunnit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful","review":"This is a must read. It is absolutely beautiful and like nothing I've read before. I mean I've read many great books, but they're all amazing in their own ways, and Eye Contact definitely stands by its own uniqueness. This book is warm, insightful and powerful in that its scary how real it feels. I'm not going to say more because I don't want to give away the plot (not that someone else didn't already), but I highly recommmend itDon't expect a thriller though. If you are looking for Mission Impossible on paper or something that will make your hair stand on end, this is the wrong book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest Little Book","review":"This short little book took me AGES to get through. I constantly made excuses to do anything but read it and that is NEVER a good sign. Multiple sideline plots made it difficult to discern what message the author wanted readers to take with them at the close. The most prominent storyline was the murder of a little girl but the mystery is consistently overshadowed by complications in the life of the mother of the autistic witness to the crime. There are complications with her old girlfriend, with her old boyfriend, and with her present day loneliness. The trips down memory lane left me questioning the point of the novel. I am still not sure what the driving message was. The longer I contemplate it the more I think the murder was never the author's main point, but without that, frankly, I'm not sure what the main point is. Decidedly un-gripped by this tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for this at all!","review":"I just didn't care for this book at all! It wasn't plausible and the twists and turns were ridiculous! You only turn the pages in this book to see if there is some nugget of wisdom, or truth to be had, and you finish the book so dissapointed. It added NOTHING to my life. The characters were lacking depth and had such small, pathetic lives.

THis is not the case, and for most rolplayers should not pose much of a problem. The secrets books are continued supplements to the Way of series of 1st edition l5r. The book is presented in both d20, for marketability to d&d fans, and 2nd edition d10, for playability of l5r fans. The only improvement any of these books could offer would be an update of old techniques and skills from the way of books to the 2nd edition l5r system. Oh and all that \\"mediocre fiction and the boring content\\" as the previous poster so eloqunetly put it is a great way to familiourize yourself with the setting and goings on of rokugan.

The same amount I had ordered from Amazon. I used 2 of the coupons at Akins, a health Food Store, and the product was the same as the product from Amazon. Today I used the remaining coupons for different products. I've tried to cancel my quarterly shipment from Amazon but can't reach anybody to help me.

Eastlakes vision of the Vietnam war is dominated by its absurdity. These two facts intertwine to support my summary that the book is the mother of all Vietnam war fiction.Eastlake, a WWII vet, went to Vietnam and published some dispatches from there for The Nation magazine. His vision of the war as an absurdity long ago became a cliche in fiction and movies, but in 69 it was a revelation.That alone hardly makes the book great, or even worth reading. What makes it so is wonderful prose and wonderful characters.I love most of Eastlake's work but I am aware that his (what I call) over the top style is unbearable to some or at least disqualifies his work from being mentioned in the same phrase as literature. I of course disagree. The Bamboo Bed is a landmark of modern American fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run , don't walk.....AWAY","review":"This has got to be one of the worst investments I've ever made......if the mic is more than a 1/2 an inch away from your mouth, it cuts out.

Every material gets a solid description, several pictures, a list of pros and cons, and installation instructions. Also, a big chart in the front tells you which floors can be installed yourself and which need professional installers.

Not that I feel it's not an important topic, but now I'm left with 20min video on massage.Secondly, the people in the \\"class\\" sound as if they're reading from cue cards. Badly scripted cue cards at that. Very annoying.And last but not least, the massage techniques that were shown were very very basic and repetative. If you've never had a massage, and your partner has never given a massage, then this video may be a good starting point for you. But I found that the techniques that my partner natuarally uses and adjusts with cues from me, were a lot more effective then the techiniques Lori teaches in this video. I was left feeling more annoyed and angry than relaxed by the time the video was finally over.

A comprehensive study of Italian culture is beyond the scope of this book. The authors have arranged 74 brief \\"points\\" about daily life in Italy, alphabetically by subject, so the reader doesn't know what is coming next. If you look at the sample pages available here, you will get a sense of the leaps: we begin with an explanation of the Italian version of April Fool's Day, followed by four paragraphs on table manners, and then we're on to \\"attracting attention,\\" and so on. From the very way it's organized, we are clearly in the realm of entertainment, although the information is accurate and certainly useful.

The author seems to be all over the place, and even though this book is supposed to provide a user's guide about the mind and how it works, and he does that at times if you filter the rambling away, however I could easily feel a self-centered and arrogant attitude by the author since his first few pages and shows in many places across the book. His address can be rather too academic at times (because he's a professor) but it doesn't make it as easy on the average joe to follow.I got tired from his style so now I'm cherry picking certain passages just to try to get what I'm looking for.

I've never had a problem with HP printers but this one kills their reputation for me. Oh yeah, and the laserjet 4101 doesn't help improve it. Does anyone else miss the 1120C and 1220C?

It's unacceptable, as it grossly impacts the time it takes me to do my work. I bought it because it was small and a good price... but, as they say, you get what you pay for.My previous drive was a 256 Meg Sandisk Cruzer. Looks like I'll shell out some money and get another Sandisk. Much better.

This movie has excellent period footage, and great big name actors(of the time) that fit perfectly into their roles throughout the film.

To give a perfect example, how one commanders decision to equip their fighters with bombs as opposed to torpedoes (or vice-a-versa) could be the hingpin that holds their battleplan together, or the mistake that tears it apart. Take it from an ex-sailor, the depictions of naval combat in this film are as close to real as a filmaker could probably get, especially considering the era the film was made in. Add to all this the all star cast that reads like a whos who of hollywood, you wont find a better film in this genre.

Umax is a bunch of daft cretins if they actually think anyone will waste their money on such inferior support. I was fortunate enough to find a pirated copy of their updated drivers (it came from overseas and was in a different language) so I could use the scanner with XP.

I doubt that it would stand well on its own, as there are characters and events that would just seem to come out of nowhere if you don't have the background of the preceeding novel.Just a few, brief comments:1. It's a worthy follow-on to the original novel, but you should definitely have read If I Never Get Back first. (Or heck, just reread it; it stands up really well!)2. There is definitely less baseball, and less focus on baseball, although it does recur throughout.3. The ending seems a bit hurried, and less carefully crafted than the rest of the novel.

It was a perfect book. I was not prepared, therefore, for the sequel. It is slow-moving, has very little on baseball, weaves a story line that is, at best, confused, and is just plain flat. Brock also succumbed to the dictates of the politically correct culture on a number of occasions (wholly absent in the first book): \\"so much for gun control;\\" referring to negroes as African-Americans; etc. And last: the book is in urgent need of a proofreader.

The ratio of raisins, nuts and chocolate is fine, but the chocolate itself was not good.

The corners were cracked, and the peices of plexi weren't in the box, so I assume they were broken before they were shipped.

If I had paid under $10 each for these and been able to pick them up at the local adorama store, I would have been satisfied.

I won't be ordering these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got wrong item","review":"I ordered this 24x36 frame but got something far smaller. I tried to amend the situation but it was so complicated and finding the seller was impossible so I just gave up and used the smaller frame for another poster. Very disappointing.

Large portions of it are repetitive drivel, restating old threadworn cliches from the sixties. It's too bad a good editor didn't realize the latter portions effectively weaken the argument for drug legalization. Obviously, many have labored to keep drugs out of the hands of the multitudes but one has to be careful when approaching the conspiracy theory. Good people over time have made some uninformed decisions that definitely ought to be re-examined in light of better evidence today. Prejudice and misconception have played their role. And, to be fair, some anecdotal evidence suggests opponents of marijuana usage sometimes may have had less than altruistic motives.

He is just showing his obsessive stubborn side that will not give up the dilema handed to him. So Crawford isn't Sherlock Holmes, but the reader has a chance to share in the detective work. McMillen can appear offensive, but if you can allow some of the more scrufty moments pass by, then it can take on an air of irony. The epilogue hilarious and that alone makes the read worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad I'm An ACLU Member","review":"I don't know what to do about this book now. I don't want to give it away because someone might think I support this homophobic, misogynist book. I can't give it to a used book store because I really don't want anyone else to read this book. I don't want to send back the book to the author because I don't want any more of my money to be associated with this book, and I can't burn it because I am against censoship. I do think that the author has a right to write. I guess that's what I get for buying a book in a bar. This is my only recourse...write this review: This book is wrong. It is wrong because it was overtly anti-lesbian, it was wrong because it used language to degrade all women, and it was wrong because the entire middle of the book could have been condensed into one page.

Vampire High is a familiar tale in many ways, of high school angst, young love, and new friendship, with a twist. Others have described the characters as lacking depth, where secondary characters are true but the primary characters are trully engaging. Whatever Cody's faults our young hero is posessed of one thing in abundance Integrity. And it is this integrity that serves him repeatedly... and models what it is to be truly human....

I hope he writes sequels to this book.. but if not just write something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical vampire novel","review":"Forget what you know about vampire novels (Sookie fans, Bella/Edward fans) because this is a bit more tame. Tame on the romance (it's there), tame on the blood (still there, less graphic), tame on the oh-no-vampires-exist! (it's a kinda realized world here). But not tame on the teen angst (bullies, popularity issues, homework), the underdog getting his (you'll be cheering), and the subtle, cheeky humor (especially towards the end). A reprieve from the still great but overwrought Twilight (sorry! had to be said). Nicely done with a cute twist at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire High sounds like most high schools!","review":"What a wonderful book! Thanks for a fun, amazing read! I'm rarely ever into any kind of fantasy or paranormal (anyone who knows me well knows that my boots are firmly planted on terra firma), but VAMPIRE HIGH is not so much a paranormal or vampire book as it is a book about the value of real friendship. And while Vlad Dracul High School is filled with kids who have unusual, um, dietary needs, they are still teens like you'll see at any high school--quirky, needy, funny, bright, mean, sweet and exuding all of the other wonderful qualities teens possess! The characters in VAMPIRE HIGH--both the jenti and the gadhe--are so beautifully drawn that I was rooting for them all, turning the pages quickly to see what would happen next. The ending satisfied, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come along if you can!","review":"This was the second album released by the prolific surf band, the Challengers.

It is plain garbage. The rhymes are elementary and the choruses! Those were the worst. They are so repetitive I wanted to rip my ears off. The verses are incredibly short and the rhymes are not clever at all. The beats are also quite bad and bare. The only track worthwhile on this abum (and the reason it earns a 2 star review) is the title track \\"King Of Rock\\" which is a straight up classic. Just download that track and save yourself a couple of bucks. If you want Ryn-DMC at their best, pick up Rasing Hell, but steer cleer of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Classic, Period,","review":"This is classic old school rap without a doubt, and Run DMC were originators.

It's quite appropriate that Jerry Cantrell is opening for Creed and 12 Stones this time around because without bands like Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Grunttruck, etc. neither one of these bands, as well as Bush, would have any idea of what to sound like. To even refer to them as 'Alternative' is about as far fetched as you can get.

What's funny is after someone mentioned they are similiar to KUTLESS I realized the vocals from the 1st song on this CD, CRASH sounds similiar to KUTLESS' LET YOU IN from their cd SEA OF FACES.

Although I personally think \\"Potter's Field\\" is a better CD, this one isn't bad. They are not in the same league as Pillar or Kutless, but who knows how much they will mature as a rock group given time. Just look at how much Pillar has improved over the years. The thing that makes me sad is when I see reviews of Christian rock bands by (obviously) non-Christians who just don't get the message. (EXAMPLE: ok... this band ..honestly just SUCKS and nothing more. in every damn song this stupid singer is saying \\" i know i need you now \\" ...i wanna puke i cant believe that some people givem 4 or 5 stars...)

Eternity is a long time to burn in hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent alternative metal","review":"12 stones is one of the new bands that have come on to the scene with the success of Creed, fusing acoustics with power metal. The music has been compared to Creed and the comparison is justified, although they have their own unique sound as well. The singer is excellent, moving from the softer ballad parts of the songs into the heavier parts without difficulty. The songs are excellent and can stick in your head. The only complaint is that the singer does the metal scream/growl too often (Although it is typically in the background). One last note: This is a Christian band, albeit on a secular label, not a band \\"searching for the answers\\" a la Creed. But do not let that be a turnoff if you are not into Christian music, as these guys are a great band in their own right with awesome music. If you like Creed, you will like this album, guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start","review":"First half of this album is consistently excellent, with powerful guitars and vocal hooks. Second half is where things get a little too generic for my liking, save for the blazing \\"Soulfire\\" and earnest, beautiful \\"In My Head.\\" Best Feature: The songs feature strong electrics that - contrary to some opinions - are fairly compelling on their own. Worst Feature: The childish screaming/lyrics (as in neither one makes sense at times)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just get bored too easily...","review":"Big surprise, there is really nothing in this album that hasn't been heard before.

The music and vocals weave together to provide a pleasurable listening experience for anyone interested in the recently emerging rock style. However, after listening to the cd a few times, I got tired of it. Many of the songs sound the same, not to mention that I realized I had heard the same sound from teh like of Creed, etc. before.

I can turn the cd on track #1 and let it play through the whole thing - never wanting to skip a track. These guys have a heart for God. They share the Truth through their songs. On top of having a great album, their stage performance is awesome. The energy that they have captivates audiences, even if they are just a cover band. I absolutely can't wait until I see then in concert again. I had the great opportunity to meet them face-to-face. Some might expect them to be rude and very self-righteous; however, they are quite the opposite. They were very nice to me and everyone else in line to meet them. Even though they had just come off the stage, they were very happy to talk to all of us. They looked tired, but they weren't irritable at all. They were very outgoing. They are an awesome band all around. I give them two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 stones","review":"This is a great band. By far one of the best unknown bands on the music scene. I have seen them live twice; once at an acoustic promo show, and once on the last stop of their recent tour. Their show is amazing, just like their cd. Great lyrics, guitar solos, and use of vocals by Paul McCoy. Coming from their hometown of New Orleans, i have seen the energy they have when they play live. They have the same energy, the same passion, the same love for music live and in their studio productions. Although they are a christian band, they don't portray themselves as such. They sing about the same things everyone else does, but with a few more god references. I can't wait until they have a new cd. \\\\m/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add to your favorites","review":"This band is a great one. Their lyrics are amazing. And I promise you will like every song.

Speaking of Creed, it seems to me Wind Up records is trying to do the same formula that helped Creed sell 20 million albums, and with Wind Up's lineup of 12 Stones, Creed, Drowning Pool, and a few others, it seems the radio airwaves will be muddied up for some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame band","review":"the worst lyrics i've ever seenall the songs sound the samedont buy it.. total waste of money!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh god...","review":"ok... this band ..honestly just SUCKS and nothing more. in every damn song this stupid singer is saying \\" i know i need you now \\" ...i wanna puke i cant believe that some people givem 4 or 5 stars. actually i want to give 0 but unfortunately its impossible....don't throw your money out save it !!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hey","review":"ok this cd is the stupidest thing i have ever heard.even though i havent heard it but it looks stupid and its not on mtv so it must be stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nu-metal with a constipated singer.","review":"For the record... nu-metal is absolute guano. 12 Stones, a pathetic excuse for a band, has a stupid talentless singer who can't decide if he's a rapper, a singer, or in a death metal band.

I will go ahead and say that they are the best Christian band since P.O.D. and I highly recommend this every song is great and its worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid debut!!!","review":"So this is 12 Stones. Well, I found out about them from \\"Bring Me To Life\\" by Evanescence, and this surprised me. These guys prove that Christian rock can be heavy metal. Though all songs sound a bit similar, there is a different feeling felt by each one. My favorite songs are Crash, The Way I Feel, and Open Your Eyes. McCoy is a good hard rock singer, and I like his growls in the songs. I suspect that their second album, coming out soon, called Potter's Field, will be even more successful. But this is a good group, with Christian meanings and rock music. Gotta buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak songs, weak vocalist, and a waste of money","review":"I spend a lot of time listening to all types of rock, and for me i have a set list of ingredients that produce my ideal sound.

These guys have a passion that is hard to find in the maintstream music world. This album is a must for any music fan. Great musicianship, excellent lyrics = Awesome CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Generic Hard Rock","review":"For being utterly devoid of originality, this is actually a fairly decent album. While not unique in the slightest, the music is delivered perfectly. The drumming is flawless, as are the guitars, particularly during the several solos that highlight the cd. While vocalist Paul McCoy is no David Draiman or Maynard James Keenan, his voice gets the job done with everything from singing to growling to screaming.While 12 Stones is, I suppose, considered a Christian rock band, they don't have the lyrical stupidity and lack of seriousness that is detremental to the genre.Something else I should note: even if you don't particularly care for their music, I encourage you to try to catch 12 Stones live. They put on a damn good show for a thouroughly enjoyable concert experience.So there you have it, unoriginal but still solid music. Highlights of the album: Soulfire, Broken, Open Your Eyes, My Life"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slanted look at Hood","review":"I found Dyer's book on Hood to be very slanted and also boring.

Another annoying thing about the book is that often times Dyer gets off Hood and begins to write about Lee, Longstreet, or someone else Hood served under. When writing about battles, Dyer often writes of the battle as a whole rather than what Hood's brigade or division was doing during the battle. This makes the book feel less of a bio of Hood and more of a book about battles that Hood was at. All in all, Dyer doesn't focus on Hood, the text is usually pretty boring, and he looks as if he set out to make Hood look like a genius. If you are interested in Hood I would recommend you skip this book and look into Richard McMurry's John Bell Hood and the War for Southern Independence."},{"rating":"1","title":"No relationship development in this one","review":"If you are looking for a book where you get involved with the characters and their developing relationship with each other, read no further and look for another book.If you are looking for a book with a premise that allows for a lot of quickies this may be for you. It felt like it was written by a man for men. Very little foreplay, just dominance and taking what they wanted. It got old very quick and I wished I had returned the book.When the women finally had their chance to leave the planet and some couldn't bring themselves to, you found yourself saying \\"really, what could they possibly want to stay for?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining, Negative Outlook","review":"All this book does is cite the negative effects of fertility treatments, including surgery! It points out how horrible certain patients' experiences were, without any positive outlooks. What a horrible waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly Bad","review":"Silly that this should be on two tapes; it's filmed in EP mode and niether tape takes up more than a fourth of the spindle.The video quality is fair to poor, the quality of the soundtrack is poor. The soundtrack itself is very annoying.Of the two tapes, #2 was much better. Both tapes have women basically dancing, etc., but the women in #2 were generally better looking.They appear to me to be all natural, which is a plus; and I think most of them are amateurs.Overall, pretty lame though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another digital music book....","review":"This book is useful, enlightening, and fun. It covers many cutting-edge topics in lucid fashion, topics that can only be found otherwise in academic journals. The computer code (in the book and on the CD-ROM) is an invaluable resource for the ambitious reader, who can actually try out or modify the techniques. The CD-ROM also provides examples of these new techniques in action. Finally, the author's sense of humor comes through often (this is not a stiff, boring book!).As a \\"digital-sound-artist\\" and someone who teaches this stuff at the university level, I highly recommend this book not only to those who want to learn about the most recent work going on in sound synthesis, but to those who want another perspective on more familiar topics (like the basics of PCM, fourier analysis, basic digital filtering, etc....)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Sound Synthesis/a review","review":"One of the best volumes I've come across in the field of sound synthesis on personal computers.

It is supposedly a \\"live\\" album, but it's really a studio album with applause dubbed in. There is one other hit besides \\"Louie, Louie\\", that being a cover version of the Motown classic \\"Money\\". The rest of the album features a mix of group originals and cover versions of recent hits. About half of the album consists of instrumentals.

The Financial Peace Planner is the only book you really need to follow his program. It is comprised of the most important points and gives the clearest instructions on how to budget your money.

I was there in southeastern Oklahoma and I knew these guys when they did this album. For me, it is a bit of the history of American rock, and I think that is deserved praise. They went from this to have a couple of Billboard top tens, including a number 1 with Western Union. By then, \\"The Attic\\" (where I heard them play several times) was a distant memory, I'm sure. Even in abstensia, they continued to mentor me and my aspiring band. We never made it as far - but I hope their own memories of those days are as good as mine!

When I received the one I had ordered through Amazon, it was so hard to open that it burst the seam on the back end of the tube and I have to use it that way. In addition, it has a different odor than before which makes me wonder if it was an old tube and that's what caused the cap to be practically sealed shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I've been using this product for a number of years & just loved it.Since they've changed from the pump bottle to the tube they have obviously changed the moisturizer, now it is thin & does not cover well at all. So I am in the process of finding some other tinted moisurizer. What a bummer. Look at the dates of the previous reviews!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price!","review":"I discovered this product when I was getting facials at a Facelogic salon. Although I've given up salon facials for economic reasons, I still get this product because it's simply the best tinted moisturizer I've ever used and it's well worth the price.It comes in a wide range of tints to match just about any skin tone, provides sunscreen protection, and covers smoothly with a light matte finish. Best of all, it does not make me break out in my oily areas like other tinted moisturizers. It delivers moisture only to the areas of your face that need it. Along with a little mascara and lip gloss, this product gives you a perfect every-day look."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best tinted moisturizer out there","review":"I've tried several tinted moisturizers over the past 5 years (because I don't like having to use several products layered on my face during the weekdays) and I keep going back to this one. It's simply perfect. It goes on smooth and light (no heavy coverage appearance) and stays put for a good 8-10 hours (not a full day, if you're going out at night, a 1/2 reapplication will do the job). It also has sunscreen in it, which is a major plus. I have sensitive skin and I've never experienced any irritation or a breakout from this product. It's well worth the price too. Very affordable compared to other designer lines that doesn't work nearly as well. It's hard to find in department stores though, so ordering online is probably the best option."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic sizing","review":"these size small underwear are small enough for a five year old child to wear them, just so you know.

I took it off, and then I found the reason to return it immediately.Do a google search on when to switch helmets, it is when there are flat spots, scratches or cracks in the helmet.Mind you, my current helmet had scratches, that is why I was replacing it after two years, but this one was brand new and had dents and scratches straight from the factory!

To be my first time purchasing and wearing a helmet I thought I would look awkward wearing this however its fits well. I recommend to anyone that is considering buying a bicycle helmet this is definitely a good \\"bang for your buck\\" and stylish.Con: what appeared to be padding and stickers included I could not figure out what to do with them and the manual did not explain where you can place them.Be safe and wear a helmet if you're just cruising or rock mountain bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Bought two of these helmets.

If it happens to fit you comfortably, this is a bargain. In my case, my head is large, but theoretically within the size range this helmet claims to fit (it comes in only one size). However, it did not fit well. I could get it on my head, but it hurt. It went straight back in the box and back to Amazon. I would also add that I agree with all of the complaints of other reviewers about the straps twisting sideways. Even if it fits your head OK, that might be enough of an annoyance not to bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Helmet","review":"It's a comfortable helmet with a nice little emergency information sticker in case something happens on the road. I don't know if this is standard, but I really appreciated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice helmet.","review":"This is actually my first bike helmet, but I could not think of anything bad about it.

I like the extra protection in the back...makes it easy to loop my headlamp on my head when riding at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"one size fits all is a Large or XL.","review":"I usually wear a Medium helmet. When I tried on this helmet, which is classified as a one-size-fits-all, my head was swimming in it. I realize you can adjust it, but an adjustment is supposed to me minor corrections. It's my opinion that this would not be a safe helmet for anyone requiring a Small or Medium size helmet. Returned the helmet and purchased a Bell Array in Medium, which is a perfect fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and Attractive Product","review":"Get this helmet for a great price at Amazon, rather than spending the same (or more) money for the off-the rack Brand X at the local department store. The fit was a bit snug, but I've got an ample-sized head. And true to Giro's word the helmet is very adjustable. Great variety of colors makes means that your helmet won't look like everyone else's; you'll look cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"low-moderate use","review":"i don't ride my bike that often (around once a week for an hour at most, weaving through NYC traffic). haven't had any problems with the helmet (i don't even use the stickers that some of the other reviewers complain about - maybe i should :)overall, for low to moderate use i give it a thumbs up. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the price - maybe i could have picked up something cheaper, but not dissatisfied with the product itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bike Helmet","review":"Did not enjoy this particular helmet.

It's as cool as a helmet can be (I wear one only for safety, not as a fashion statement) and the dial adjuster is excellent. It fits snugly and comfortably. The visor is a plus. I wish Amazon's Super Saver shipping was faster. I know they can expedite the order for the same cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable helmet","review":"This helmet is easy to adjust to get a good fit. It is also light and you hardly notice that you're wearing a helmet once you start riding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helmet - well done","review":"This was half the price of the least expensive helmet I tried on at the stores. The air-flow through the helmet is excellent. A thumb knob at the back of the helmet enables easy/quick adjustment of the fit to snugness.

This one fills the bill"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"It's good and very adjustable to fit different sized heads. the only problem is that the straps around the ears like to stick up instead of laying flat, and they're a little uncomfortable, but it seems to do the job and hopefully I won't test the safety features for quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Comfortable","review":"I recently bought and returned the Schwinn Thrasher because it was big, clunky, and didn't feel secure on my head. This Giro helmet is light, fits snugly on my head, and looks awesome. The straps take a little getting used to as they dont lie flat like those of the Schwinn, but its not a big deal. The small size is makes the Y-strap totally worth it. Good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my life","review":"The helmet is fairly light weight, comfortable (although the straps take getting use to), and adjustable to fit your head perfectly. The air flow is fair and really I forget it is on halfway through the trails.Helmet tested and vouched for!I recently was on a single track that resulted in me fracturing my c4 and c5 spine.

First and far most the helmet is uncomfortable it pinched my head from the top there's no padding there. I read some other reviews seems giro is notorious for that they fail to put padding at the top I returned it immediately. For short rides im sure its fine but I ride for hours and I don't want to be uncomfortable the whole way instead I went with the bell variant a lot more padding and supposed to be great on safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"pdiddy","review":"bought this for work and i'm a police officer in hawaii and use this helmet for when I we do our Bike Patrol and so far love this helmet very heavy duty and very light. highly recommend 5 star, aloha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"Probably the most comfortable helmet I've ever put on.

I would recommend this helmet to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price point, seems to fit properly","review":"I have used this helmet for about one month and it seems to fit properly and no problems with it. I have no long term reports but my experience with bike helmets has been that they need to be replaced every two years if used more than a couple of times per week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helmet review","review":"It is a lower end price Giro but works well for my cycling. I've not seen the need to pay $200 for a hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope I never have to use it!","review":"I purchased the Giro as piece of mind when I am out riding on the back country roads. It is lite weight, fits easily, and keeps your head fairly cool on a hot day with the air holes. It looks good when you are wearing it. I just hope it never comes in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"GIRO Indicator","review":"I've used the GIRO Indicator for two months now, having purchased it here then because it looked better than any of the Schwinn or Bell offerings at or near the same price. I almost returned it, having a problem with the fit. Tried some Schwinn helmets at a local department store but for one reason or another none of them were to my liking. I stuck with the Indicator and I'm glad I did...the fit seems to have improved over time and is now not nearly as snug. That will definitely help for my first DALMAC tour later this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, Stylish, Well Built","review":"Having never been in a serious crash (knock on wood) I cannot comment on its effectiveness but the comfort and build quality are very good.I'm new to helmet wearing so its a little funky for me to have one on but you quickly forget about it once you're on the trail.The brim is removeable but I've never tried to take it on or off.The rear strap at the \\"Y\\" connection do in fact twist against your face and do not lay flat. This can be bothersome to a degree BUT the nylon is rather soft, and when the connection is set lower to around the jaw line, you arent really bothered by it.Ventialtion is pretty good, my head never feels hot. If you tilt your head down just a little bit on those boring sections, you feel the air work its way through the helmet and really cool you down.Overall I'm pleased with the helmet, I hope I never find out how effective it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits kinda funny","review":"The fit is kind of funny, and the straps are twisted and fits strangely.

It also provides pretty good ventilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice helmet","review":"This is an excellent helmet at a very nice price (+ free shipping!) I bought it to replace a heavier and uglier Schwinn helmet. The straps don't sit flush on your face like some helmets, but it's not that big of a deal. The helmet is VERY light, comfortable, and good looking. It also has plenty of vents to keep your head cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safty","review":"I never like to order things online if I never tried it out before. Especially on things that I need to wear. I don't know will it be comfortable because I never touch or felt the item. I don't know will it fit me. I know I wanted a reliable helmet because helmet is very important when it comes to biking and it can save you. I read many reviews on this helmet and decided to be brave and give it a try. So happy I did. When I receive it, I tried it on right away. It felt good, the fitting was perfect. It's made out of good material. I wound say this helmet will definitely protect me if I have any accidents with my bike. You can't go wrong with this helmet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why spend more","review":"Wanted a helmet to wear as an example for the kids. Don't know how it would hold up in a crash riding full speed down a mountain trail, but those days are over for me anyway. Highly recommend it for a nice leisurely ride where there may be some car traffic. Helmet is lightweight and comfortable enough. Some people complained about how the straps twist and may be slightly annoying, but you can adjust them to alleviate problem. I like the ratchet in back for head size adjustment. My wife and I can use the same helmet. Overall I'm happy with the helmet's fit and function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice helmet at a nice price.","review":"After buying my first road bike I realized I needed a helmet. My budget was $50 or less (at my wife's urging), and after looking at numerous models on line, I decided on the Indicator based on all of the positive reviews. I have to say I have not been disappointed. It fits well, feels comfortable and is very light. I think all bike helmets look dorky when worn but this one is not bad and I actually forget I have it on once I hit the road. The bottom line is it protects my head and for the price paid I feel I got a great deal. If you want a decent helmet that won't break the bank, give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Very light weight, looks good for a bike helmet, after adding included foam pads was very comfortable. Love the easy adjustment knob."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality as expected","review":"Good quality as expected. The paint and design look very nice. I never own a $100+ bike helmet to compare to, but I can't think how much better if I get an expensive one. Fitting is easy too. Only one thing is that it comes with 4 small pieces of foam pads, but they are not sticky. I may not need it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit, Cute Style","review":"I ordered this helmet after going to a local bike shop and trying on a Giro \\"Skyla\\" helmet only to find that the Skyla was too small. Most of the universal fit helmets I came across were very masculine, so I had been without one for a while. I saw this one on Amazon and decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did! The color is a true turquoise instead of just a plain blue and it looks feminine. The larger size holds all of my hair with ease and it's comfortable. To anyone looking for a cute helmet in a size larger than what manufacturers seem to think the average female head with hair is sized like, this is the helmet for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aesthetically Pleasing!","review":"Was looking for a biking helmet after purchasing a new Trek 1500 this weekend and wasn't sure what I was looking for..I went to Giro's website and read up on the company and it's history and thought I would try to see if I could find an \\"affordable\\" helmet thinking that these helmets were more \\"high end\\" and that most likely I would end up with a \\"cheaper\\" line but I was pleasantly surprised when I ran across one of these at a specialty bike shop for only $35! I tried it on and with the help of a wonderful sales person in the store had it adjusted to my head! The color I chose was white and found the fit and comfort of the helmet to be very good! So...I plunked down my $35 and tried it out that afternoon and love the feel and look! So for those of you looking for a name brand helmet at an affordable cost you can't go wrong with this line! Very pleased with my choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty design","review":"This helmet is painful to wear, even for a few minutes. The straps are designed so that they can never lay flat on your head and face and the hard plastic pieces protrude and poke your head.

AIDS and malaria, poverty and hunger continue to kill millions of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Also, while Keegan states that \\"it is poor states that mainly cause war\\" he makes no mention of the involvement (historical, political, or economic) of wealthier nations in those wars.But more importantly, though this may be an entertaining read, WAR AND OUR WORLD actually tells little about the nature of war, its origins, its transformations, and its possible future. 74 pages is just too short to even introduce a topic as wide in scope as war, and Keegan doesn't come close to providing a sturdy framework for a brief discussion of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best band of the argentine rock","review":"Este disco compila algunos de sus temas mas conocidos.

Apparently the Berlin Wall never fell, and the USSR never dissolved. Women's problems accelerated by not following Marx and Engels, the Industrial Revolution harmed and degraded everyone's standard of living, bla, bla.Skip to the Conclusion and it's still more of the same: the Market (their erroneously definition of it) is the root of all women's problems.

He builds a solid background with Mengerian foundations of money. Then he thoroughly builds a scheme of understanding monetary policy in a gold-backed system. Once this is accomplished, modern financial market complexities are built on top of the books over-arching analysis. Topics made clear include Inflationary bias (Barrow, Gordon, Kyland, and Prescott), hyperinflation, rules vs. discretion, bank deposit insurance, and many other central bank policies which can be difficult without proper guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Julie Andrews","review":"Our children enjoy this very much.

It was NOT the same part - the chipset was a cheap knockoff (I had to pry open the original to see if I could fix it when it broke and since the faceplate fell off this model, exposing the chip, I discovered this was a cheap imitation).

When I read the statement that organic foods are not proven to be any better for you, I closed the book and put it away. Haven't opened it since. This statement is so obviously false. It has been clearly, scientifically proven that organic foods are more nutritious and healthful, both for their improved nutritional content and lack of toxic pesticides.This lie made me decide that I couldn't believe anything else written in this book, either.

Prague is almost exactly the centre of Europe, geographically; but more than this, Czechs resent being classed with the Eastern European \\"barbarians\\" with whom they were forced for 40 years to share an ideology.Whether Mr. Roberts is oblivious, or simply insensitive, to this national sentiment, his lack of understanding heavily handicaps any credibility he may have had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Box, Rough Shipping","review":"The clam shell box with 3-Rings is great for storing old documents and photos in Acid-free covers.

Can I keep lifting weights at the gym at the rate that I currently am? Are there any specific exercised that I should stay away from?\\". I found this book ponderous. It read like a medical research findings report in a journal, not like a book and answered NONE of my questions.

Boy, was I wrong. This book was more scientific than helpful.

Instead, this book is a tiny, 64-page treatise whose stated purpose is to establish, for the non-chess player, the appearance of knowledge through buzzwords and short stories. There are brief (2-page) biographies of a couple of dozen historical and present-day chess figures. The first is Alexander Alekhine, whose emigration from Russia to France brings out the worst of the author's racism: \\"To be born French may be accounted ill luck, but to enter into it voluntarily is depravity of a high order....\\" Come on. But there is some genuine humor on the next page, when he describes Alekhine's Defense (1...Nf6) as \\"the chess equivalent of hormone weedkiller, stimulating White into such a frenzy of development that he would outgrow his own strength and collapse.\\" The best feature of this book is its low price.

But after a few minutes of slogging through the huffy sarcasm and personal attacks against succesful authors, you do start to get the feeling that there's more going on here than the need to deflate egos. It's obvious that for the anonymous critics it's so much easier to be clever than to actually say something or even attempt to. In other words it's easier to write an anonymous personal attack, laid thick with cynicism, nihilism, jealousy, hostility and aggression than it is to attempt an actual meaningful work of art. So here the 'writers' of Lord Gnome's companion prove the point that it's not so easy this writing business, is it. If it was then that's what we'd be doing instead of slinging crud anonymously.

Some might say that a character that is rich would be hard to get to know and sympathize with. I thought that Kevin showed the right amount of tenderness with the main character to achieve this. Especially in scenes with her children, her mothering nature made her more touchable. I always enjoy Kevin's page turning writing ability. Many sleepless hours have been lost on Kevin's books.

The strings! I knew I remembered there were strings on the record I heard at that dance. Sure enough today I stumbled on the \`real' version on You Tube. After digging more I now find this album that contains this version.So I recommend the cd because it contains this beautiful version of Blue Holiday.

Just the way color was used throughout the film bothered me. All in all, I watched it once, then promptly took it outside to the dumpster so I'd never have to see it again.

What a horrible message that is 180 degrees opposite of what the gay community has been trying to project. If the filmmakers had stuck with the original premise it might have been watchable, however the confused and wrongheaded direction it takes makes it a true waste of 91 minutes of your life. Don't bother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"But I'm a Cheerleader","review":"This movie was well done!Great costumes.Great characters.Great music.Funny.Great sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good!","review":"In the middle of this way over-the-top, no-limits comedy you find yourself in one of the most touching love scenes ever filmed. Astonishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a great film","review":"this is one of my favorite films, yet I think that some of it is misunderstood by people who take things too literally. what I mean is, the stereotypes of the butch dyke, lipstick lesbian, prancing gay boys, is part of what makes it so funny because (at least my interpretation of it) the film is what I would call satirical. it's making fun of how everyone else in our society sees homosexuality, which is pretty funny because it's so pathetic that Americans can see a whole group of people as disgusting and unworthy.alright, that's it. hope I helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is social commentary NOT a teen flick","review":"I read some professional critics reviews of this film before I purchased it and the critics just didn't get it. There were several comments on this being a bad \\"Porkies Revenge\\" type movie. This movie is, most of all, social commentary that is done very very well. There is certainly a point of view and a message in that commentary but it is done with humor and understanding of the opposing view. Never quite mean spirited but certainly pointing out some of the absurdities in the false arguments of the conservative religious and secular views against LGBT culture. The movie is also unafraid to have some fun making fun of that very same culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Favorite Movie","review":"The quality of the DVD was great, shipping was fast, and I honestly watch little else now but this movie. As a college student with no TV, my laptop is my primary form of solitary entertainment during\\"chill time\\". This movie has been ejected only twice in the month I've had it, and I watch it pretty much every other day. Yes, I can now quote it!! But seriously, if you are on the fence about getting this movie, go ahead and do it! You won't regret it. It's kind of bizarre when you first watch it but I promise, But I'm A Cheerleader will quickly become one of your very favorite movies. Plus Clea DuVall is hot AF in it ;P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should watch this movie!!","review":"This has to be one of my favorite movies ever!! This film has made me laugh hysterically and still manages to be touching and sweet. It has one the best love scenes I've seen in a movie and the soundtrack is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie for the open minded","review":"I love this movie, I managed to buy it despite the fact that my whole family is homophobic. It is an awesome movie, I think it is good for teenagers because it is less seriouse then other lesbian movies. Almost all of the characters are a gay and lesbian stereotype, including the all famouse lesbian softball player and the gay wrestler. The movie is about a girl, Megan, whos friends and family suspect she is a lesbian and send her to a gay camp called \\"true Directions\\" in order to turn her straight again. She ends up falling in love with other camper Graham Eaton who is played by the wonderfull Clea DuVall. It is a great movie, very funny at times, and very seriouse a others. It is a good movie for anyone, gay or straight. Even if you dont like the plot line, the soundtrack is awesome and the cast is very easy on the eye. So everyone should watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Hilarious!","review":"At True Directions, girl meets girl and boy meets boy in the obvious slight at the religious right. Roger Ebert gave it 2 thumbs up and so do I. It was hilariously engrossing with Richard Moll as a Gay underground former reformed gay giving shelter to those that found their \\"true directions\\" in gaydom. Ru Paul Charles, so out of drag, sported a shirt that said, \\"Str8 is great\\" to the point of almost becoming an ex-reformed gay that instructed boys how to be a manly man. ...but, I think he'd rather be a Cheerleader! LOL -Felecia Constance Rowe, Chairwoman, Felecia Constance Rowe, Inc."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best gay movie i've watched so far","review":"It's a great show.Won't get sick of it..it's not dat i'm gay...just that i enjoy watchin gay movies. at times they're really versatile actresses. so wanna catch a good show....dis can be one of those!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story, fun movie","review":"This film features a neat, quirky score and ten minutes of closeups on different cheerleader body parts. What's not to like? But seriously, it's an interesting movie with a nice message and a sweet story. As you might already suspect, Natasha Lyonne and Clea Duvall each shines in her role. Definitely worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh: Kind of corny, but opened my mind","review":"I first saw this movie a year ago, and, well, I had to rent it again. No mean feat let me tell you with no Blockbuster Card and two fairly homophobic parents. However, I still like it, and once I can buy movies without them knowing, this one will be on my shelf.Complaints: There are a few. The plot is cheesy, the music is horribly cliche, and the characters are so incredibly stereotypical it's almost embarassing.Praises: Proof for questioning people (like myself) that despite what parents may think, being gay is not wrong. Plus, it stars Clea Duvall!This movie needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It is very corny, but then again, its basically a gay chic-flick. If you want a laugh, especially if you're a lesbian, then I suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest gay movies of all time","review":"But I'm a Cheerleader puts every gay person's coming out experience in a fun playful light. The romantic ending was kind of out of place, but the movie as a whole is great and entertaining. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good times for everyone","review":"This movie is one of the best gay movies I've seen in the last few years. Yep, it includes just about every gay sterotype there is (the softball player, the goth girl, the boarding school girl, the social outcast, the actor/dance/singer, the retail worker, etc.), but underneath it all there is the underlying message of acceptance and the pride in the fact that you are who you are, and you have to learn to embrace it. Cathy Moriarty makes a great turn as the head of a program to \\"cure\\" teens of their homosexuality, without realizing that her own son is dancing to showtunes while mowing the lawn. Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall carry the movie wonderfully, and you actually believe the connection between the two of them (as opposed to a lot of other gay film leads). I loved the colors in this movie. I loved the music. Whenever I need a laugh, this is one of the movies I turn to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I severely enjoyed this movie-- I don't know how to put it better than that. The acting was good, not amazing, but good. The plot was funny, realistic and cute. Also, bonus points for an amazing soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insecure heterosexuals will be offended","review":"This movie is a less than common mix of ridiculous humor and seriousness. The humor is dominant due to the overall atmosphere.The main character is suspected of being a lesbian by her parents because she listens to Melissa Ethridge and displays other \\"signs.\\" They send her off to anti-gay camp where she finds love and her true self.While most reviewers seem to get \\"the right idea,\\" the movie is not as clear as it could have been and lets some people walk away with the idea that people \\"become\\" lesbians.A lot of the movie's jokes play off of stereotypes, even though the gay characters (male or female) in the movie have a wide range of personalities. This has the potential to create the logically ironic, yet perplexingly common, situation in which members of the majority get \\"offended\\" on behalf of the minority..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful movie! I usually hate spoofy type comedies but even though this is extremely sarcastic there are still some really beautiful moments, such as the love scene. And the music is just amazing. I would recommend this to anyone, go see it right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Brilliant Movie","review":"My sister and her friends were watching this. It was really funny. The best part was the \\"straight is great\\" camp. Those people were only there because other people thought they were gay--not because they necessarily were. Those people thought they were gay because they were stereotypes. It kind of reminded me of school. How everyone judges other people. I think this movie did an awesome job at making people see how stupid judging people is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea - but not clever enough","review":"It seems that reviewers either loved or hated this one. Well, the idea is clever - parents send their daughter, who doesn't realize that she has gay tendencies - to a special school to try to get on the straight and narrow. The idea backfires - in a house full of gay teenagers, she falls in love. The cast is also charming. Yet for me the movie fails, since it is just too exagerrated to be funny. Although the idea in general is believable, everything about the execution is just way too over the top. The general idea of this film was handled much better in In and Out, which had believable characters, a generally believable plot, and much more humor. The school was just too unrealistic for me - and the day-glo fiftyish costumes just added to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let-down","review":"I have to say I really expected way more out of this movie. It doesn't know which way to go. Cathy Moriarty should have played it like she did in Soapdish, at least we'd have enjoiyed her. I am not an expert on Natasha Lyonne's acting, but I couldn't understand what kind of person she was. She's always out it, making strange faces which points to the direction of \\"I hate everything here\\" but then when she sees two boys making out on the floor, she screams and after that she is like a against the groups AND the camp people. so what's up? I got the same feeling from \\"There's Something About Mary\\" it was not funny. It's like they put in scenes that have a very potential funny element in them, but it's like the directors don't want to make them funny or whatever they are supposed to be, so the whole thing leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth.This movie is like a flat line. What could have been...."},{"rating":"1","title":"woah, this was bad.","review":"This might have worked as a ten-minute SNL skit. It's a one joke movie (parents enrol their lesbian daughter in a cartoonish 'learn to be straight' program), and it's juvenile, lame and oh so boring. Seriously, how do things like this get funding? Four large thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strait is great!","review":"A twisted black comedy about a young cheerleader who is forced into a Homosexual Rehab center by her friends and family. And what better a place to have a love story. If you like odd indie films this one is for you. It has a John Waters-ish feel and I'm sure it will make you laugh to the point of soiling yourself.... well, maybe not that much. Either way it's a great movie and I think everyone will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic!","review":"This movie is incredible. The cast, the production, the plot, the acting -- everything is impeccable. This movie has appeal to both heterosexual and homosexual audiences and revolves around a high school senior who is sent to a \\"straight camp\\" after her parents fear that she may be a lesbian. Natasha Lyonne & Clea DuVall deliver wonderful performances, as do RuPaul (out of drag) and Cathy Moriarty. Viewers may also enjoy the eye candy of soap opera hunk Eddie Cibrian, who flexes his muscles and dimples more than once in the movie. \\"But I'm A Cheerleader\\" is a hilariously honest look at homophobia which proves once again that we can never change who we really are. I highly recommend this film to EVERYONE. Also stars Dante Basco, Richard Moll, Melanie Lynskey, Mink Stole, Douglas Spain, and a guest appearance by Michelle Williams of Dawson's Creek."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the recovering man","review":"This book is the cornerstone of recovery for men and used by men as an aide in recovering from addictions, co-dependency.

At one time, I respected her as a cutting edge doctor of alternative therapies. Now in my book she is nothing but a quack. She also also turned into a huckster of various products on her website. At one time, her website was a place where anyone could get free health information. Now she had redesigned it so that only people who subscribe to her newsletter can get quality health information. She has become a huge disappoinment. If you want quality alternative health information go to Dr. Andrew Weil or Dr. Ronald Hoffman's websites. They are the gold standard on alternative medicine therapies. And they don't use tarrot cards to diagnose illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"Maybe I had trouble with this because I am not a mother. Since it seems that most of the viewpoints are coming from the mother's perspective and not the daughter's. However, I also had trouble with the house analogy. I mean, really. A house representing our life's journey? I don't get it.I found this book to be very self-serving to Dr. Northrup. She seems to want to push only her ideas, opinions and way of thinking. What irks me more than anything is that she is not a psychologist, but she tries to pass herself off as one. She may very well be a good obstetrician, and she should stick to that.I think that if I want to explore my relationship with my mother, I'll just ask her."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i wanted","review":"it is not what i wanted. i wanted more adult relationships. a little late to deal with 50 year old daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Lots of great info and wisdom.

She's an OB/GYN, and it's refreshing to read her perspectives, as they're quite different from all the OB/GYNs I have ever known. A great reference, it's the kind of book that you can go back to again and again. You will not be sorry you purchased it. Definitely a keeper on my bookshelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for adult daughters and mothers","review":"After hearing Christiane on PBS I really thought the c d package would be directed at developing a friendship with your mother after reaching adulthood. Why they act the way they do, how to see their words and actions through their eyes, understanding them and letting the pain they cause drop away.

It features two of their great singles that should have been hits, but weren't; \\"Why Pick On Me\\" and \\"Sometimes Good Guys Don't Wear White\\". Besides those classics, there are some other great songs like \\"Black Hearted Woman\\", \\"Mr. Nobody\\", \\"Mainline\\" and \\"Have You Ever Spent the Night in Jail\\". Most of the songs are good, but the group doesn't fare too well on the ballads, including (oddly enough) an Italian ballad which was written by the group's guitarist (it's called \\"Mi Hai Fatto Innamorare\\", which means \\"You Enchant Me\\").

Offering effective and practical strategies to combine and take full advantage of the Alpha mind (that which is fixated on helping one survive), and the Beta mind (the more recent evolution that strives to cope with new complexities, technologies, and social forms), The Mother Of All Minds is a life and adventure-affirming guide to better understanding will and the power of harnessing one's own thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elsewhere","review":"Reading this book is a waste of time. If I thought I could get my money back I would. My first clue should have been that the book was self published. Lynch was successful with his Strategy of the Dolphin.

I have been studying and working with Grave's material for several years. I have had training from both Beck and Cowan, and use it in my work and life. In my opinion, this book does not suggest anything more than that Lynch may have met Graves.The Mother of all Minds is a catchy title, and my expectation was that something of substance would be presented.

Some of the artists covered more than once here are: the Fireballs, Dick Dale, Duane Eddy and the Bel-Airs. It's interesting to note that the Challengers were lead by Richard Delvy, the drummer from the Bel-Airs. He formed the Challengers after the Bel-Airs broke up.

It started acting up a couple of weeks ago so I replaced the battery but now it loses about a minute a day. Very unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic casing broke almost immediately","review":"One of the \\"corners\\" that holds the band pin broke off within a couple of months. I bought a second Casio, different model, and the exact same thing happened. In neither case was there any excessive pressure or force. I have been using Casio watches since they first came out with a digital model many years ago, and this is the first time anything like this has happened - twice within several months. I sent both watches to Casio explaining the situation and asking for replacement but have not received any reply after four months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Review","review":"It is amazing that you can get such rugged dependability for this price. I am now buying my second Casio Forester only beacuse I am EXTREAMLY hard on wrist watches. Do not hesitate to buy this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 week!","review":"We received this as a wedding gift from our Amazon registry. I picked this cheese plane because I trusted that Henckles makes a quality product. It was great, for a week, until it snapped in half. The metal is extremely thin and small where it attaches to the handle. We replaced it with OXO cheese plane that has been great for almost a year now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay!","review":"I purchased the Twin Cuisine Cheese Plane to complement my Henckel's Twin Cuisine Cheese Knife (see my review). Unfortunately, this Plane does not work as well as I had hoped. I happen to have an OXO Cheese Plane that works great. The Twin Cuisine Plane does not shave the thin cheese slices as well as the OXO Plane. Perhaps it is because of the serrated cutting edge. The slices are not very uniform and often break apart midway through the slicing process. The Plane looks cool alongside its sister cheese knife, but does not work as well as other cheese planes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this item if you don't mind the sight of blood ! ! !","review":"Simply put, the Henckel cheese plane snapped at the neck on a fresh wedge of Emmenthaler and sliced a chunk off of the tip of my thumb. I had used it maybe four times prior to that. Needless to say, I am disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a couple months","review":"The blade is not well attached to the handle. I expected much better from Henckels. I am working to get my money back. This shouldn't break so easily. I cannot recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I bought this last Christmas as a gift for my husband because he adores cheese and I'd had it with those ridiculous little wire cutters. It got hidden away in the drawer for about six months because he forgot about it but when he finally started using it he loved it. About a month ago it snapped in half. The top portion just snapped right out of the handle - not fixable. We were both really disappointed as we expected Henckels would have produced a better product. I went with this one in particular because all of our other knives are Henckels and we've had good luck. Will not be purchasing this product again...now I'm trying to find another one that will last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is 1 star too generous?","review":"I bought this without looking at the reviews first. Big mistake. Just like the others, my plane has snapped off where the neck meets the handle. This took about a month of occasional use. It seems this cheese plane was designed primarily for slicing cream cheese, and even then only if the cheese is warm.Before it broke, it almost sort of worked ok... at best. The serrated edge is a terrible idea which makes it very hard to make thin slices which don't break. It also makes the plane a real pain to clean, because anything you wipe it with will get caught up in the serrations.That said, this cheese plane never killed anybody, does not kick puppies, has not appreciably warmed the environment, and never once insulted my mother. It is this combination of characteristics which have earned the product the one star I'm giving it, as limiting this review strictly to the realm of intended use would have left it with none."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Legado de Los Enanitos Verdes","review":"I think this cd is a great sample of many of the greatest hits \\"Los Enanitos Verdes\\" are famous for. It includes some of their early work and remakes of other popular songs in Argentina. It brought many good old memorie back."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE","review":"I have gotten this eye liner directly from the Chanel website and absolutely loved it.Unfortunately it was discontinued when I needed to re-order - I was thrilled to find it here.I was so disappointed the first time I used it - it flaked all over my eyes, my cheeks and the rest of my face. Now, since I had purchased before I knew this did NOT happen with the product directly from Chanel so I can only discern that this product is NOT what it claims to be.I wanted to give it a second chance, and a third..both times it still continued to flake and by mid-day my eyes were a mess - so not the quality of true chanel style.ONLY BUY FROM DIRECTLY FROM CHANEL.So bummed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not tall enough","review":"bought it - threw out all the packaging (my fault!) and noticed that my six month old was too tall for it. I tried to raise it up and noticed that it was already raised to the highest position. Only buy it if you have a baby on the shorter side! It is not sitting in my garage waiting for the yard sale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"walker was too short after a while","review":"I liked the walker at first because all four wheels pivot and help the baby move around, but my daughter was able to get out once she became taller. The walker doesn't go up high enough like some of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy!","review":"I bought this toy for my 5 1/2 month old son. I wanted something that folded up small enough to put under the bed for storage (it did fit!) It was simple, it got him upright, and the price was right. I set it up the night I bought it with in 4 hours total of use my son ripped the bear off the toy bar leaving a rather sharp edge. Now he is in the 95+ percentile, but not overly strong, and this toy is made for older stronger babies. I contacted the company a day later, well, it's now a week 1/2 later and another contact and no reply...In total, I was very disapointed in the quality and customer service of the company..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been half the price!","review":"This walker is a no frills item, but it lacks in safety. The seat doesn't lock down well, so my baby could easily fall through the hole. It doesn't height adjust well or fold up well either. Definetly not worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tall enough","review":"My daughter liked this walker at first, but she quickly grew too tall for it. We ended up buying another walker that was taller and has buttons and sounds to it which she loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"I bought this walker 3 times! I bought it for my first daughter because it was inexpensive. She grew into it and out of it quickly so I was glad I didn't buy a more expensive brand. I bought it for my next 2 daughters because my first daughter loved it so much when she was in it. It's very sturdy and the print hid a stain that got on it very well. The toy bar kept my girls interested and it conveniently comes off as well. It callapses to almost flat for very convenient storage. If I had to buy another walker, I would buy this one over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby walker","review":"This is hard to rate as it was a gift for my granddaughter. I never heard any complaints and she loned it out several times so it must be a good it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I really like this walker and so does my son. It was very easy for him to get the hang of pushing himself around the house in it. The only problem I have is that my son is very long, and the height just does not adjust enough for him. If it raised like one more notch up it would be a little better, but I really do like it. It's deffinatly money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trend Walker with Toy Bar - Bears","review":"Bought this item for my Grandson only to find out afterwards that the item has been recalled. This item should not even be listed. Tried to get a refund from Amazon but they only gave me a gift certificate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Exciting Tingling","review":"What a story!!! I've read Harris' 3 books and I liked this one best. The action starts on the first page. I liked how Harris created real characters that have real lives and face the same issues and problems I do.There's a good mixture of romance and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done - no pun intended!!","review":"I got into the story right away. Harris brought me into the police activity and I thought I was part of the police investigation. I liked the way harris mixes the romance and the mystery.If you want an enjoyable reading experience, pick up one of Harris's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! I enjoyed the books","review":"A friend of mine gave me this book and I bought The Captain's Fund. I immediately went to the website to find out more about the author and the story. I like knowing the background of the characters and setting. Read both books by Harris. They read fast and easy.If you enjoy a story the moves and doesn't give you pages and pages of description, try Smoldering and The Captain's Fund. The State Trooper characters are real people you get to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page-turner","review":"This was a well-paced book. I read it in one sitting. Harris wonderfully presents the characters and unfolds the plot to make you keep turning the pages. It's lean - you move with the action.

I found the style to be relaxing and enjoyable to read. Harris tells a good story and has created memorable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it in one sitting","review":"I look for interesting summaries on the back of the book - the synopsis for Smoldering caught my interest. It's a police investigation plus good character development. I vacation on Cape Cod - nice setting for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harris is even better with this story.","review":"I enjoyed The captain's Fund so much I couldn't put it down so I tried Harris again.
