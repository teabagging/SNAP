We watch cage fighting in languages we don't understand and thought the movie Horrible Bosses was epic and underrated. So if we tell you this movie is BAD, you should be very scared.

The smell is also quite lingering.This might be a great product for a garage or an outdoor work area, but I don't think I'd recommend it for use in bedrooms or other living areas.

We have different \\"temperature preferences\\", and she spends much of her time at home complaining about being too cold. That, or I complain about being too hot.Anyhow, the Indus does warm up. In fact, it gets downright hot -- you need socks or something else between you and it once it's going at full tilt. It's a very effective foot warmer.But then there's the smell. Once it gets warmed up, it gives off a powerful smell of hot rubber. The smell doesn't go away very fast once it's turned off, either. In fact, I had to wash the comforter that we'd had over the Indus repeatedly to get rid of the burning rubber smell. The house still smells faintly of hot rubber, and it's been days since we used it.If I had no sense of smell, I'd love the Indus. Unfortunately, as it is, we can't use it.

A few things to keep in mind though:1) there is only an on/off switch, so you'll have to turn it off once it gets too hot.2) can't put it on carpeting which is a pain, but I used the cardboard box it came in to place under the mat.3) wearing socks seems to help with spreading the warmth to the top of the feet as well.4) wipe it down before use, there's this slick, oily residue on both sides of the mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE of this product!","review":"This is the worst product I've ever purchased. The unit, whenever plugged in and used, gives off the most horrible petro-chemical-solvent based fumes I've ever encountered. No one in our household can tolerate the intense fumes, which permeate the entire house within 30 minutes of use causing burning eyes and throat, and intense headaches. Hoping that these odors would subside with time and usage, we plugged the pad in out in the garage and let it \\"season\\" 24hrs/day for a bit over 3 weeks. Tried it inside again, with the same results as before. Even after a month of aging, the solvent odors are intolerable. I am discarding it, as the health risks to anyone breathing these vapors are unacceptible. To those reviewers who stated they noticed no odors, you must have received a unit manufactured by some other vendor, as this made-in-China heating mat is the most unacceptable -- and dangerous -- consumer product I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've needed this a long time.

However, the instructions that come with the mat warn to not use it on wood or carpeted floors despite the fact that the Amazon product image shows it being used on a wood floor under a desk. No warnings about the floor types appear on Amazon. Furthermore, the rubber odor is awful and the mat out of the box was quite greasy.

I actually thought that maybe I had hit a skunk with my car, but when we unplugged the mat, boxed, and bagged it, the smell went away.

Previously, I had one in a 9 x 12 office with a high ceiling and good air flow. In that situation, the odor was noticeable (but not objectionable) for about a month, then went away. My mom wanted to try my new one in her small shop that has almost no air flow--she couldn't breathe.

It works very well with your shoes on, making it ideal for the office. The heat is strong enough to warm the entire shoe. I can feel the radiant heat on my lower legs through my pants. It does heat extremely well, and I love it for that. I give it a an A+ for function!However, it does emit a very strong odor. The fumes in the rubber are quite potent. I had it under my desk, and the fumes would irritate my eyes, nose, and sinuses. My office mate and I got mild headaches, as a result of the volatiles in the rubber. The fumes should dissipate after time. I plugged it in at a ventilated area to let it vaporize the volatiles in the rubber. I will revisit this thread to give you all a progress report.

As a person who likes to be really warm (hot showers, snuggle up by the gas heater, etc), I was surprised to find that this mat gets too hot for me. Even through rubber-bottomed bedroom shoes.It's got the right idea, but a way to adjust the temperature is needed. Prehaps I can wire this up to a dimmer switch or something. If not, I might end up sending it back.Currently, I've got my digital candy thermometer between my foot and the mat and it's reading 127 degrees F and climbing. 129 ... 133 ... 135. Merely a bit warmer than body temperature should suffice! I'd guess 110 degrees should be plenty warm. Now I'm up to 136 ... 138 ... 140 - maybe I have a defective unit?!?

Likewise my hand.The mat needs a breaker or a fuse on it to prevent such overheating if the thermostat or design of the heating elements fail as they did on the 2nd one.Again this mat would be very dangerous for an older person, a sick person, someone who fell asleep, etc.I can not stress the danger enough enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either I got a completely different product or those 5 star reviewers all live in Florida.","review":"This was a total waste of $36.

The pump works better this year than the old pump did and they are both just alike. I have tried to find these pumps, but the size of the pumps are never given so you do not know what to order.I plan to order another solar water lilly so I will have a spare pump for next year.

That has been the problem with so many acts like Jennifer Lopez, Ashanti, and now Rihanna. Her latest single, S.O.S., samples the 80's classic Soft Cell's Tainted Love. Rihanna's track doesn't really have the feeling of a great dance song here. It just sounds terrible. While her last singles Pon De Replay, and If It's Lovin' That You Want were fairly welcomed guilty pleasure tracks, this song doesn't capture a new singer in their prime.

The funny thing is when a black male/female singer borrows (which happens a lot with black singers)the sound or vocals from another artist's classic hit no one says anything but when a white artist does this (which doesn't happen frequently) everyone is all over the white singer from the media to buying consumers.

Rihanna was just better off doing a cover of the song becasue whenever I hear \\"S.O.S.\\" on the radio, all I can think of is \\"Tainted Love.\\"\\"S.O.S\\" is totally unoriginal and Rihanna doesn't bring anything new to the table.

Rap & Hip/hop sample like crazy. Madonna's \\"Hung Up\\" sampled ABBA, and her \\"Future Lovers\\" samples Donna Summer. Rihanna hasn't invited something new here. In honesty, I prefer her vocals (and possibly, lyrics) to Soft Cell's lyrics and vocals. Seldom does a remake (or sample) outdo the original, but let's face it: Soft Cell's hit wasn't a hit from the vocals, but the track. Catchy, catchy, catchy. My disappointment with Rihanna's CD is that the single isn't at all representative of the album - meaning, if you buy the album hoping to hear more songs with the sass and spirit of \\"SOS,\\" you'll be disappointed.

This is a truly enchanting comedy about a young girl and her struggle to escape the grasp of her abusive grandmother. Few words are spoken by the girl, but she conveys her feelings with the haunted look in her eyes.

The 4 way screwdriver is well made and functions as expected. The folding razor knife blade did not lock in position, which is highly disappointing, as it appears to be well made otherwise. The blade is easy to change, but should be done with care to avoid getting cut. Quality wise, this set comes very close to being tools that anyone would prize. In addition to the flaw in the locking mechanism, a few minor imperfections in the shaping of both wood and metal parts keep these tools from reaching their full potential.

Anachronisms in phrase and thought aside, I have never seen it - or mention of it - in any history text, and I am a history major. Furthermore, it's in the \\"Fiction and Literature\\" section....That aside, buy the book! Not only is Roger's diary a vivid and unromanticized account of the Crusade itself, but it offers some interesting points on Christian theology and the early medieval view on divinely sanctioned violence.

I was immediately grasped by the power of his characters (how Roger wrote of his love for his wife and his faith), bound by the path of his story and was so upset when I finished that I promptly began it again.If you're a historian looking for a gripe, then no doubt you'll hate it.

Much is out of place and out of character with the historical record--- and I'm only a third of the way through it.As to the agenda, I don't need a heavy-handed Hollywood-type history lesson.

It isn't a faithful account of the events, the people or the emotions and motives of the people who went on the crusade.

He totally misunderstood the situation (in three different ways!) and I just decided to forget about it and mark it up to experience.

There is something about the smell of the material that made him want to chew it all the time. He first bit the toy's ears, then the tail, and to finish he removed most of the filling.

The book is so disappointing. There are no words, so you make up your own story, which is fine and fosters creativity.

There is not dialogue beyond \\"Do you want to be my friend?\\". The lack of dialogue allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions about what the other animals are saying in response to the mouse. In the end, the mouse finds other mice who emphatically answer \\"yes\\" and they become friends. I do not see any negative aspect to this book, as other reviewers have. In my opinion (as an Elementary School Teacher) this book is not about rejection and bigotry, but is about perseverance and never losing hope. Not everyone will want to be your friend, and that's OK. Keep trying, and you will find people who love you for you! This book is fun.

Now don't get me wrong I don't expect War and Peace in a children's book, but a little more dialogue would have been nice. As it is, there are 2 possible conclusions I can draw from this book:1. The mouse is asking each animal to be his friend and they are all saying 'No', which makes them all very mean and not worth talking about or,2. The mouse is only asking the other mouse at the end of the book, ignoring all the other animals completely.Either way, here is the message I walk away with: Mice should only be friends with other mice (people should only be friends with their own kind). Is this what we want to teach our children?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Friendly Book for Young Minds!","review":"As always, Eric Carle's books are well illustrated. This book presents illustrations that draw in any young reader to the adventure. The text is simple and understandable to the young mind. The story line serves as a useful tool to discuss issues of \\"same and different\\" with your child. However, it is not of the same caliber as Carle's other books such as the Hungry Caterpillar and Brown Bear, Brown Bear...I recommend this book as part of any child's library, but if your finances are limited, purchase the other two books mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book about friendship or tolerance.","review":"Agree w/ a prior reviewer - this book was VERY disappointing. I was horrified to hear it read, for the first time, by a 'teacher' (who obligingly filled in the dialogue for the non-mouse animals, to say to the mouse: \\"No I don't want to be your friend. . . your too little (or whatever).\\"I think it can be read w/ a more positive spin, e.g., \\"I'd love to be your friend, but I can't play right now. . . \\" But the illustrations really convey a negative message to kids, and on its face is about being friends w/ your own kind, since it's only the mouse at the end who says \\"Yes.\\" Not what I want to teach to my children. This book apparently was written in the 70's. It's way out of date, and I wouldn't buy it. Other Carle books have the same type of animal illustrations, so it's nothing special in that regard either."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better editions of this title","review":"We decided to purchase this book for our toddler after she enjoyed the copy we had checked out of our local library. She had loved turning the pages and looking at the large pictures of each animal. Sadly, this copy was smaller than a postcard. When we read the copy from the library, I liked the idea of a book that tells a story with very little text, encouraging the reader to create his or her own. The way each animal's tail appears on the page teaches little readers to turn the pages in a book to reveal the narrative. I was disappointed that this edition has dialogue in which each animal rejects the mouse. I would have prefered the larger, textless edition. When ordering, pay attention to the dimensions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"compared to hungry caterpillar a disappointment","review":"yes this is a book about friendship and i realize for child at times simple is better but this book i thought really lacked especially compared to how great a book the hungry caterpillar is(i personally think just about this authors best book)it has at the very start of the book the question ask by a mouse \\"do you want to be my friend?\\"and then at the end a yes from another mouse no other writing between yes you can teach your child a little about the other animals the mouse is apparently asking though not in print.I personally thought this could have been laid out a little different"},{"rating":"1","title":"TINY BOOK","review":"Bad, Bad, Bad!

It is highly readable and the author keeps your attention with pace and humour that is all too unusual in this genre.

However, I noted some misinformation in the description of it. It alleges that Iraqi children have been exposed to radiation from depleted uranium. There is no proof for such an assertion and in fact the fear of radiation from various sources is much greater in many cases than the actual danger. For example, it has been estimated that there were more than 100,000 abortions in Europe due to fear of Chernobyl radiation. Best estimated from reliable scientific sources as that those were needless abortions and that the dose from Chernobyl was not sufficient to cause birth defects. So it is clear that there were approximately 100,000 needless deaths due to unjustified fear. By the way, I make my living in the field of radiation safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kristen Blake Wool Blend Peacoat","review":"The color is perfect and the overall look is very nice.

What ruined the book for me were too many inclusions of 20th century slang terms. Words like \\"creep\\" and \\"the Mob.\\" were used freely, but back then they would not have been part of the everyday world view. I also had the mystery solved in the first few pages. I think if the book was 200 pages and the mystery was less obvious, it would have been easier to overlook the inclusion of slang. I think Lynda S.

The pads do not create any more dust than any other brake pads and to be honest, if you take care of your vehicle and wash it on a regular basis, you'll remove the brake dust anyway. Be sure to burnish the pads to your new or newly surfaced rotors so that you obtain the maximum braking potential. Burnishing puts a thin film of the pad material onto the rotors and improves your braking performance. The instructions for burnishing are on the box and it only takes a few minutes to complete the task. These are great pads and they were competitively priced (Amazon was as cheap as anyone that I researched)and the free shipping makes it a slam dunk to buy them from Amazon.

This book will put you in the Christmas spirit with it's wonderful love story between Lady Noelle, and Sir Nicholas.The characters are well developed and likeable. Noelle is just the maiden for Sir Nicholas who is one of the knights of the round table. Sir Nicholas does not feel that he is worthy of love and therefore turns his back on those that would try. What he does not know is that he is Lady Noelle's destiny.Set during the reign of King Aurthur and the mystical magic that goes with it is a perfect backdrop for a story for this Christmas love story.

That's it - not really mood-setting for the season.Besides that, the story was slow and the writing stilted and the characters boring. The author tried to make it magical by adding characters like Merlin and King Arthur, but it just doesn't seem to work, there was very little authenticity.

I like to think about all the things scientists are doing and learning now about the Universe. Books like astronomy 101 help me understand what they are doing on these videos. Spends a little too much time on the scientists sometimes and not enough time on the various pictures since there is so much to view. Like a little more info about the various probes into our solar system. I am still kind of a novice so who knows, I should have given 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"I love science shows. I love everything physics / astronomy / space. I hate this series. It seams lately that the Science Channel, The History Channel, and others try to make complex subjects simple by using moronic metaphors and annoying examples. It has been a while since I STOPPED watching this series so I can't cite examples, but they are many.I suppose this type of show makes science more understandable to someone who would never watch science shows to begin with, but then, whats the point. I hope the producers of these shows get a clue, because for people like me who actually like the subject matter, this is painful.

Some are funny, some are sad, and many of them brought back memories for me of people and places I knew growing up in Winona, Minnesota. The first story, named \\"Toyota City,\\" plays on mistaken identity. Another, \\"Mother's Good Bavarian China\\" portrays that peculiar trait of saving our best for a time that never comes. \\"Shop til You Drop\\" recreates the ambiance of the old downtown many small town Minnesotans knew before we all started going to malls.

Unfortunately, he is an atrocious writer. The text is rife with bad punctuation, mangled syntax, subject-verb disagreements, and words utterly and egregiously misused. Reading it -- or trying to -- is a painful and punishing experience.I don't expect the author of a book of this type to write like Tom Wolfe. But his failure to enlist the aid of an editor who could bring the text up to minimal standards of literacy is a major act of contempt toward readers. Prose this bad should never, ever be committed to print."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ship's Chronometer--some reviews should be discarded","review":"This is an excellent reference and text on marine chronometers.

A while back, I reviewed a book on Amazon.com, Brazil, Five Centuries of Change, by Thomas Skidmore, which I gave accolades to, and I will applaud Uys' marvelous work Brazil for the same reason: it gives both the novice and the Brazil expert an excellent understanding for the complex history, culture and geography of this little known Latin American giant."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the People","review":"To view a country and write as seen through their people is a difficult task. Errol Uys' re-release of Brazil is a blazing success. This book creates an image and feel for the country that truly leaves a concrete imprint in the mind of the reader.

It's extremely rare that I haven't finished a book that I've started, no matter how bad it is. This is a book I put down half way through and, oddly enough, have shown no interest in picking it up again. I felt no attachment to the characters and no sense of intrigue about what was/is going to happen next.Basically, it appears as if the author read Michener and decided to copy the ideas and plot line without adding soul or the kind of depth that Michener could. Each chapter was the same story repeated: only the names were changed to protect the banality of the story.I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long by half","review":"i normally really enjoy reading books that cover history with fiction mitchener is a master of this and i have read most of his books but this one i got half way and couldnt work out a reason to keep reading as i had lost interest and went and ordered some better reads glad i was able to easily get another good read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be Michener, falling short","review":"Uys cites James Michener's magisterial historical novels as the inspiration for his work, and indeed, worked as Michener's research assistant during the production of 'The Covenant'. Michener himself wasn't an outstanding writer at best, technically speaking, but he was a master storyteller. The tales and situations that he crafted drew readers in- Uys, unfortunately cannot match the master's alchemy. Brazil is just rather turgid.

It harkens back to a simpler time when musicals were meant to be just FUN! These songs are going to stick in your head and the characters haunt you.

This musical could have had it all! It has a great sci-fi storyline, interesting characters, and an intriguing name, however, the cd drags on and on, leaving you feeling like, \\"There has to be at least one good song here!\\" If you love sci-fi musicals, buy the Starmites cd, or Little Shop Of Horrors.

Don't be fooled by the title, its just not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen For Yourself (but try not to pay for it)","review":"To compare this show to FLOYD COLLINS and RENT is a breath-taking bit of hubris. FLOYD COLLINS was an original piece of theatre, and RENT was at least ... slightly unusual. This show just didn't have anything going for it; it was a little cute, a little tuneful, but mostly dull and familiar. The producers probably hoped that would insure success, since Broadway audience generally love the unchallenging and familiar. But if, even with Cameron Mackintosh's money behind them, the writers can't get their shows to succeed in America, there doesn't seem to be much hope of their becoming the hope of the musical theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well done little show - fun and zippy","review":"This is a great score, with excellent casting on the recording.

Very enjoyable - I hope it gets more productions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Dance NOT!","review":"There are sixteen selections on one CD. The first selection sounds like a Japanese melody in the style of the '60s, a mixture of traditional intruments with an orchestra. The other fifteen selections are modern westernized Japanese pop-songs with the singer backed up by an orchestra and women backup singers.

After a few days and the pain was just getting worse, I finally went to the ER and had to have my appendix removed.

The pain worsened with each passing night. I stopped taking the pills, and the pain disappeared! I will try taking the pills once or twice a week, and hope that they will be effective and help with weight loss. I did lose a few pounds during this trial, but not worth the pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does nothing good","review":"Horrible product! Should be taken off the market.

I over indulged the previous weekend and was waiting for the \\"effect\\" to occur and it never came. So I was worried that I have been eating and taking Alli this entire time and it wasn't the real Alli and therefore that explains the drop in weight-loss. So, I did a test. I purposely ate over the recommended 15 grams of fat for one meal, nearly doubled it, and still no \\"treatment effects\\". I think I have a dud!

It is no miracle pill, but I stay on a diet and eat low fat foods, but I'm also in my 50's and it is easy to put on a few pounds. Alli just helps me stay on track and if I go out and eat something a little heavier than usual, I take an Alli and at least feel like I offset those extra fat calories a little. A couple of years ago when I was trying to loose weight, I got to a plateau and couldn't seem to do anything to drop more weight, when I started using the Alli, it moved me off that plateau and helped me loose a few more pounds.

I have ONLY had this occur a couple times when I did NOT follow the low fat diet for many days and still took Alli. So, IF you are having this problem badly, you are CHEATING. Its NOT a miricle diet drug where you can eat allll day long, whatever you want and loose weight without any issues. Its suppose to assist you to loose weight faster when you follow the diet plan. Now I only have use it to maintain my weight loss. I take it b/4 going out to eat, having a fattening treat at home, etc. Its the BEST! It will help you to loose weight faster when following a healthy, low fat, diet plan. I also cut out carbs, salt and sugar and lost even faster! LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It came very fast ordered through Amazon too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something that works","review":"As an over 50 woman who wanted the best of both worlds, both to eat in at least a semi normal fashion and not be as wide as I am tall,Alli is one of my best friends. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 only because it isn't perfect. There is a draw-back in that if you stray from the prescribed grams of fat you may regret it. This can also be a plus if you look at it in the form of a friendly reminder to be sure you really want what you are about to put in your mouth. I have lost 20 lbs on Alli and don't feel deprived of anything. I eat what I want and if I over do it I know what to expect. Enough said.

I am not having ANY of the side effects that I had before and haven't lost a single pound ( I mean, even when i eat really greasy, fatty foods, there is nothing whereas before there was) I'm just not sure if the product is as its supposed to be.

We just started dieting and exercising after taking it for a couple weeks, that is really the ONLY way this product will work. We did go out and eat some greasy meals, and if you plan to do that, I highly recommend you bring some extra undies with you. This is probably TMI for an Amazon review, but it felt a little more gassy than normal and those were the times grease would leak out... Once I stood up and the teeniest amount of gas came out and so did grease.

I only take it with lunch and dinner as I don't eat many fat-containing breakfasts. I've been taking it about 6 weeks (and not even with every meal) and have lost 7 lbs. But I am also continuing to run and eat well. SO its not a miracle pill. And I have experienced a few unpleasant \\"treatment effects\\", but not real often and never in public. SO I think it helped.

Either way, the combination of the three have been working for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work anymore !!!!","review":"Started using this product last year with great results, then it went off the market due to the main ingredient shortage. Then about 2 months ago found it at Walgreens. Started taking it with no results, by that I mean no oily discharge after eating bad. Thought it was a bad bottle so last week bought another bottle at Costco, same thing no oily discharge. Sounds gross but that is the way you know if its working. Something has changed with this product and will no longer buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY. PRODUCT HAS CHANGED. DOES NOT WORK","review":"Alli was off the market for a while and is now back on the market. DO NOT PURCHASE IT. I used it for years and it was wonderful & worked great. Now it is being made by a different manufacturer and it DOES NOT WORK. I have wasted money thinking it was a bad batch, but it wasn't. After researching on the Alli website, everyone agrees that it no longer works as before. You do not see it working as before. I am so angry that Alli does not do something about this and warn everyone it IS NOT THE SAME! CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED, DO NOT PURCHASE! I am hoping they will go public and revert back to the original maker. Until then, they just lost a dedicated customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"B+ ON PRODUCT, A+ PRICE, A+ DELIVERY","review":"Alli works, but it is very slow. i guess thats healthy, but i was looking for something with a little more weight loss... at the same time, i dont worry when i over eat because i still consistently manage to lose 1 lb or 2 every week. the most i lose in a week is 2.5 lbs but i also walk 3 miles almost everyday. I eat what i want, and before alli i had less weightloss.I take 3-4 pills a day, usually 1 with breakfast, 2 lunch(my largest meal), 1 dinner.I would definately buy this product again, because i feel its the safest thing out there, and ive had no side effects of jitters nausea fatigue or anything that would worry me.

They use the post office for delivery - even the supposedly expedited 2 day service for a hefty $20 fee. Of course, delivery is not within the 2 days of normal Amazon shipments that come via UPS or FedEx. Rather, the delivery is within 2 BUSINESS days. Well, that yields a delivery time of 4 or 5 real time days if the order is close to a weekend.I feel cheated for paying the expedited fee. I could have purchased the same product for less money but with an upcoming trip I could not wait the 4 or 5 days quoted for normal delivery (for $5 shipping fee).Amazon should also include the method of shipment in the order details. Given my individual situation of having different delivery addresses depending on the method of shipment it would make things much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't seem to be the same","review":"I purchased ALLI last year around this time (getting ready for bikini weather) through drugstore dot com and I am not sure if ALLI changed it's product (doesn't show change on label) or if the seller is not selling a real ALLI product. Either way I am very disappointed in this product, doesn't seem to have the same effects that it did last time I took it when you have high fat foods. Anyone who has taken ALLI knows exactly what I am talking about. While no one wants these effects, it's part of the whole \\"make sure your eating heathly or else\\" plan that makes people on ALLI sucessful. NO ONE wants to have the side effects, so you do what you need to do so that this doesn't happen. No such luck with this product this time around.

Bottom line is...I did what I was supposed to in order to avoid the nasty side effects and still experienced them. I had to wear a large maxi pad to avoid the leakage from going through my clothes and causing stains. It was seriously the most disgusting thing ever! I tried to be patient and put up with the negatives so I could see if it would help me lose weight, but it became so uncomfortable to be leaking all day that I had to quit after about a week.

It makes you not want fatty foods due to the end result of oily, loose stools. This is not going to pull fat from your body. It only pulls fat from the food you eat. It works well with exercise and a balanced diet. I decided to use it again because my weight seemed to be stuck. Since using this (4 weeks), I have lost 12 more lbs. I did work out 5 to 6 days per week and watch my diet as I have always done, but Alli gave me the extra push I needed to get an extra 12 lbs off. If you stuck at the same weight and your working out and dieting isn't moving the weight, try adding Alli to help move the pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps you lose weight even when you eat bad","review":"Alli totally helps lose those extra pounds. Even on a bad week (and a bad week means A LOT of side effects from the pill) I will lose a little weight.

I have not weighed my self at all, but I have measured myself and I lost half an inch already after two weeks. I have started climbing stairs everyday for half an hour. I feel much cleaner and healthier. I think this is the safest and effective way for me. I have had problems losing weight with the \\"just diet and exercise\\" thing.

Vit. D is oil based, and Alli interferes with vitamin D absorption...which is necessary for calcium absorption; they work together. Definitely important for women of some age (or any age!). Not worth the depletion of D and calcium in the long run.Also, regarding fakes, don't know if I've ever received any fakes when I ordered from Amazon, but there's a website to help identify fakes through the FDA (fda.gov).

When I tried Luxottica's Ray-Ban Aviators on, I almost felt like I was wearing cheap sunglasses with plastic lenses. I would rather the nose bridge dig into my sinuses due to heavyweight lenses than wear cheaply made drug store quality sunglasses for $100!!!

The premise is interesting. The author is fascinated by Ibn Battutah and his travels. He sets off to follow in IB's footsteps. The author draws references from many bizarre sources presumably to help clarify or explain some of his experiences, but what it ends up being is gratuitous obscurity. I carefully sought out his references, but I did not feel rewarded. I noted with interest how often the author clarified that he was not married and did not wish to be and that he is not a Muslim and did not wish to be. These two issues arose many times. I was interested in the Eye of Joy and a couple of his jokes, but overall I felt the author was trying to impress the reader with his wide knowledge of obscurity rather than share an experience with his reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greater than Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, my 600 year old friend","review":"From a fragment in a Yemeni library retraces the some of the steps of the greatest traveller of the pre-industrial age.

Tim's style is entertaining using history as a lens, & I found myself totally engaged with his trip, & with Ibn Battutah the traveller. Islam is not the focus of the book, but more the virtues of travel, and the wonders of Battutah's experiences.

I've no doubt that Mackintosh-Smith is a well-educated and experienced Arabist, but his writing style in this short book is not only stilted and pretentious, it's frequently closeminded and (to my mind) unfair to the alleged subject. There are occasional insights worth having here, but overall, this is not a book that I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dry for a travel book","review":"I'm a huge fan of travel books plus a Moroccophile, so I thought this book would be just the ticket. Unfortunately the author's style is quite dry. He spends a great deal of time visiting tombs and non-existent shrines to saints. Really, it's quite boring. What about the food? The people? How the author (completely fluent in Arabic) manages to travel through such an interesting part of the world and not have daily random travel adventures is beyond me. I've had more adventure walking down the street to the produce shop.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they were really into shrines or liked Arabic poetry.If you're looking for some great travel writing, try Bill Bryson's \\"In a Sunburned Country\\", Anthony Bourdain's \\"A Cook's Tour\\", or any of the short travel story collection books by Lonely Planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can it get ?","review":"I am very literate, educated and well traveled.I have read over 40,000 pages a year for twenty years, and have written a book.

I can't say I'm a fan of the second CD at all, and there were some parts that were so short that I wondered why they were even there (Vegas). Regardless, this CD was good enough that I almost felt a stab of regret for hawking it. Almost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry Rollins: Think Tank","review":"Henry Rollins wouldn't put out anything he thought wasn't worth your time. on \\"Think Tank\\" Rollins leaves his familiar realm of alternative punk rock music and divulges into the art he is ever-popularizing; spoken word. the points he makes on the album are valid, the observations he makes are funny and the stories he tells are both interesting and heart felt. definately a good buy. the only problem with \\"Think Tank\\" is the duration. as a double disc you think you are getting a lot of bang for your buck, however his performances on each cd are reatively short."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rollins spoken word record which is long overdue.","review":"To those unfamiliar with Henry Rollins' spoken word records, this CD is a very nice introduction to his work. To those who are, this Rollins at his absolute finest. From second one, Hank brings you through his adventures at the airport (continued), television, Bill Clinton, etc. The first CD is a very rapid fire comedic routine, as the second CD is more involved with telling long storylines and being just as funny if not funnier. Henry has mastered his storytelling ability to the point where its effortless, and this is readily evident in these 2 hours. Everyone can relate to at least one of his stories, as he speaks from a perspective of everyday life. This CD set will become a constant companion to you on a lonely night for years to come. If you enjoy this, I highly recommend Human Butt, Live at McCabe's, and the Boxed Life for even more great rides from the life of Henry Rollins."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new and important contribution to identity politics","review":"Carretta's latest book is a scholarly examination of the autobiography of Olaudah Equiano, aka Gustavas Vassa. This book has generated some controversy in its claim that Equiano may not have been born in Africa. Carretta's detractors, however, completely miss the point of this book, which places Equiano squarely in the same vein as other important Enlightenment writers like Benjamin Franklin. This book does not detract from the importance and usefulness of Equiano's autobiography. Rather, by providing thoughtful analysis of Equiano's narrative; it helps to illuminate how the he saw himself in a time and place where identity (and nationality) were instable. What is important is that Equiano saw himself as African, whether or not he was actually born in Africa. This distinction is important to getting the most out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damning the first description of an 18th-century African childhood as inauthentic and its author as dishonest.","review":"Besides reading this biography I suggest reading Paul E. Lovejoy's article, \\"Autobiography and Memory: Gustavus Vassa, alias Olaudah Equiano, the African.\\" A professor of history at York University in Canada, Lovejoy holds the Canada Research Chair in African Diaspora. His paper can be found on line and in examining inconsistencies in the documentary record (only the baptismal record and one ship's muster list show South Carolina as a birthplace for Equiano) concludes convincingly that Vassa was not inventing his African childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the production team thinking?","review":"There were some really good fights on this event. I only wish they would have shown them in their entirety. For some reason the production team decided to run a graphic announcing the round number for the first fifteen seconds of each round - meaning you don't get to see the first fifteen second of the round. During many of the rounds you are missing opening punches and kicks, and in one case they are on the ground when the graphic goes away. However, and this is what sent me to my keyboard in a rage, there is a nineteen second TKO in one of the fights (I won't spoil and tell you which one). Basically what you see is the graphic announcing Round One for fifteen seconds with the commentators going crazy, then the graphic disappears and you see the ref running in to stop the fight. I'll probably regret this hasty review at a later date, but right now I'm furious. What could they possibly be thinking by doing that? Arrrgghh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live, Lovely, and Lifting","review":"This was such a big deal in '86 -- Streisand LIVE. I wished I was there! Then we got the HBO special and next the CD. Barbra's vocals on this concert are surprisingly brave and bold. Hear those wacky notes she hits in \\"Something's Coming\\". Listen to the playful sexiness of \\"Evergreen.\\" Behold the prayerfulness of \\"Papa Can You Hear Me?\\" My favorite vocal-styling is on \\"Happy Days\\" when Barbra does some amazing tone color on the lyric \\"shou-ou-out it now\\". This album is very good. We love Barbra LIVE!! The patter in between songs is a bit heavy, but can you blame the lady for trying to make a concert a little socially relevent? It may be heavy-handed, but Barbra is really trying to give back in her own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Voice- Not Perfect But Fine","review":"I still don't understand why people consider this to be one of her worst performances. OK, so she over sings occassionally, but one can't help to admit that she still sings with passion for her music and it comes across very clearly that while this charity benefit concert is another one of Ms Streisand's ambitious projects but personally, i can't find much to fault it with, unless you simply think her songs are absolute stinkers. So there, you have it- another fine live performance. Not perfect, mind you but it will do just fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Barbra but this stinks","review":"Barbra is fabulous no doubt about it, however its clear to the listener that this was her first major concert in 20 years, because she sounds totally unprepared for it. She cant hold any of her long notes without screeching them, or merely cutting them short. Her breathing is irregular even with teh first number she sounds out of breath. Her nervousness makes her voice wavery, and her high notes thin. I mean Barbra, the ultimate perfectionist, even hits some flat notes, it was shocking she NEVER hits flat notes. The only moderately good cuts were Somewhere over the rainbow, send in the clowns and People, but only because those songs didnt require any heft. All the songs that required some effort she manages to blow. If you want to her real concert magic buy \\"Barbra: The Concert Live from Madison Square Garden\\", its absolute brilliance and shows how many of the songs on this album should have been performed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent In The Clown","review":"Another CD from one of the most overrated and overindulgent acts of the past fifty years.

It bent to the point that it was no longer safe to use without haveing a welder reinforce the hitch and bolt it to the bumper of the truck.

It spurred my interest in reading. Three high-school age boys use an abandoned trailor, in a salvage yard owned by one of the boy's Uncle, as the headquarters for their private investigating firm. Think Hardy Boys meets Scooby Doo, without the slapstick of a talking dog. The boys always find a creepy mystery to solve. It appealed to the part of me that liked Saturday afternoon horror movies and adventure stories. There is nothing too gruesom here for a young reader. And the mysterious adventures would appeal to any young boy with a taste for ghost stories and monster mysteries. This is the seventies worthy pre-cursor to the Goosebumps series. This book is the first in a series of over 20 books. And the titles by Robert Arthur, the original author, are the best. It is a shame these books are out of print. They are perfect for any boy age 9 to 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kick Boxing dud","review":"The sometimes animated or recorded at slow speed and played back fast kick boxing provided some super action.

Sorry but take no-doz when watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mystery, no plot","review":"This is a lesson to me not to buy two books by the same author at once until you have read at least one first. The only mystery here is how it ever got published. The plot is on the back cover. If you read any more, you get 305 pages of a narrator/character who can't manage film in her camera (film? in 2004?), charging her cell phone, and finding her keys. This from a woman who is supposed to have been a nurse for 12 years. Find the medication? Find the chart? Find the patient? To some people may be funny. Perhaps I have just spent too much of my time sorting other people's chaos to find it entertaining or relaxing. If you like a good mystery try something by Catherine Aird. Or spend the $6.99 on lunch. Wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure if I want to read more faux Plum","review":"As many others have said, this is a poor clone of the Stephanie Plum series. Almost every Plum character has a match in this book, and it was disappointing. The book itself had a good story line. I enjoy laugh out loud books; this one didn't provide much, but did have some amusing scenes. I had to mentally stop myself from reading \\"Ranger\\" when the character was \\"Jagger\\".Overall, I was very disappointed.

She is supposed to be a medical insurance fraud investigator - but not a very good one. From sitting plainly in front of the person's house she is watching - to consistenly forgetting survellence cameras - it is infuriating.

This is definitely not the case. The knife is well made and comes with a small pack of additional blades. Speaking of blades, they are easy to change on this knife as well. A small lever on the blade is lifted, a small hinged guard is moved, and blades can then be popped out and replaced. The belt clip is a nice addition as well and makes it easy to carry the knife around the house when working on projects.

Few of us can truly understand the circumstances Levi lived through, but it is important to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition (Classic House's) is a failure","review":"This is one of the great books in Western Literature. That being said, the edition published by Classic House is absolute junk! There are typographical errors all over the place. Every other page has a mistake. Additionally, the way that the text is justified is terrible; there are large spaces between the words-making it difficult to read. This edition offers an object lesson to always go with a large publisher, as they have the means and experience to create a book that is an accurate and well laid out version of the author's original intent. This book looks like it was printed by a ninth-grade student and I urge you not to buy it. I will be returning my copy for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whilt chilling, it is suberb","review":"This book is truly remarable: it was written in 1947 but stood the test of time ; despite the author going through the most horrendous events it isn't bitter and twisted but analytical and human.

Oh, man. I don't know about that.\\"After reading this book three times, once for a graduate class and twice before on my own, I still don't view it as Holocaust literature--and I mean that in a good way: read the memoir and you will see what I mean.Oh, and don't forget to pay a few bucks more to get If This Be a Man.

The maps are excellent and I didn't have to buy any other maps. The information is very current (including prices, where's hot to go etc.). The layout is a little different from other guidebooks (instead of looking at shopping, eating, sightseeing in each area, this book separates the sections into shopping: areas A,B,C, etc. and Sightseeing in different areas etc). Quite easy to read and I highly recommend. It did enhance my trip to London and is quite well written. I didn't use it to find places to eat, but shopping and sightseeing places are quite good. Once in London, make sure you pick up a copy of \\"time out\\"--the weekly newspaper of what's going on.

The book is categorized into types of design (i.e. the octagram and eight-pointed star, the triangle and its combinations, ringed interlacement etc.). The designs are presented in small (ca.3x3cm) squares, black and white, so nothing is squandered in this neat little book. It is very handy and easy to take along wherever you go, and wonderful to get ideas from wherever you may be (with a mind needing a geometric struggle, riddle, or to play with form). I often use it when I go out for a café, and scribble all kinds of designs while sipping my coffee. The book really stimulates the mind, geometrically. And the black/white neat presentation makes it just right. In fact, it is perfect for the purpose of taking along to really *use* and work through, - while you keep all those shiny, glossy grand reference books at home on the bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocket on!","review":"A very good CD by a relatively unknown group(Nation wide).

This is a great book to purchase for any young person just begining to read.Jack London's use of imagery tells a tale of the early 1900's gold rush territory, that no history book could explain. This book is an excellent example of the human struggle told from the point of view of a dog. All in all it is a great book for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmingly Funny and Entertaining","review":"Although I would consider this a chick flick, the mexican type of humor allows this to be entertaing even for guys. The playful and sometimes even cheesy sexuality in the movie is not at all distasteful or unnecessary, but rather adds to the comedic sense of the film and gives it a sensual touch. Martha Higareda is a great and beautiful actress, and truly gives her character life as she portrays a young and rebelious senator's daughter, who is sent to an academy for ladies where she is to learn how to act like a proper woman in order to not ruin her father's campaign. The movie has great music by Ximena Sariñana, who also stars in this movie along with Rafael Sanchez Navarro, Blanca Guerra, Camila Sodi, and directed by Fernando Sariñana.

It is difficult for another singer to match the caliber of Nancy Wilson's vocal artistry with her unique phrasing and penetrating conviction. Her interpretation of \\"I Was Telling Him About You\\" and \\"A Song For You\\" are classic Nancy at her best. Her passionate, compelling and relentless delivery of \\"Deeper\\" is erotic and penetrating as is the more gospel tinged \\"Puttin' My Trust\\". She shifts gears to tease and please on \\"You Know\\". On the wistful \\"I Never Held Your Heart\\" Nancy tenderly aches with regret. No one can tell a story through song the way Nancy Wilson does. This album showcases the many moods and range of material that only the prowess and vision of Ms Wilson could deliver with such polish and appeal. Nancy Wilson is one \\"class act\\".

There's a pretty good career overview for an EP of this size with tracks from the last three full length albums, a key track or two from each. The production is in your face. You can feel the heaviness of the guitars, the ruthless kit pummels from Nick and the majestic keyboard touches. Vortex's voice doesn't hold up that great on this recording, but it sounded just like the CD when I saw them live in 2001. Shagrath is a good showman. What would've been better is a full-length live album. This recording of live material doesn't do a highly visual live band like Dimmu Borgir justice. But, it is a nice little addition to any fan's collection. The cd itself is shaped like a skull and should play in most personal cd players.

When we tried it out all we got was feedback. Words were not audible at all. When I contacted the seller I was told it was a novelty item only, which I think is a ridiculous answer, since even a novelty item should work a little... Maybe the one we got was broken. I didn't try again, since the seller didn't seem to think anything was wrong with it when I called, and the shipping, which was not refunded when I returned it, was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't purchase","review":"This was a bitter disappointment. One of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control. However, if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting, we get horrific feedback (screeching). Nothing seems to help and when I sent a note to the manufacturer for advice, I never received an answer. Unfortunately I'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem, so it looks like it'll hit the trash. Save your money and don't purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This item sounded great in the ad, but the only thing right in the ad is that it's pocket-sized.

He loves the bike and scoots around the house and neighborhood on it. **Just a warning to some parents, if your little one is accident prone and you are worried about falling, the seat on this bike is a little more difficult to get on to because it has a back on it. You might want to go for bike without the back rest. We still love the bike and our son is \\"mounting it\\" beautifully. Our little guy has yet to tip it over, and he rides pretty rough.

His playing is sloppy and the arrangements are run-of-the-mill jazz fusion songs with no soul or feeling: It sounds like this boring mish-mash was quickly put together in just one take haphazardly. If you want to hear his best album, which really puts this garbage to tremendous shame, then listen to his 1961 album \\"Ready For Freddie.\\" Otherwise, don't waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Feet Of Clay Here","review":"Freddie Hubbard's Red Clay starts off arguably the finest stretch of trumpeter's career. The album hints at jazz-rock fusion that would take over the 1970's, but still is strongly rooted in hard bop. The title track is a beautiful piece of music with Mr. Hubbard and saxophonist Joe Henderson perfectly melding their instruments together over the top of a slithering electric piano riff from Herbie Hancock. \\"The Intrepid Fox\\" is another classic with Mr. Hancock driving the song with some superb piano work and drummer Lenny White providing a sturdy backbeat. There is also a strong funk sound throughout the album and that is a sound Mr. Hubbard would move more towards as the decade progressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs ever, period.","review":"To put it simply, you've got some of the best jazz musicians in the world playing on this album. You heard me, every musician on this album is amazing. The rythmic and melodic ideas of all the players on Red Clay are refreshing and have been major influences in my playing style for trumpet, piano, and drums. I could go on to analyze the style of every player in depth, but the fact is that this CD is well worth your money. I've been listening to it on and off for a few years now and I only appreciate it more the longer I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"When everyone in jazz was going fusion or still flying free, Freddie Hubbard went his own direction with Red Clay.\\"Red Clay\\" the track is a minor blues, cut clean with an amazing theme, and the band digs their heels deep into the dirt of this astounding groove. The second track is a flute display, and all the tracks mine a polished, middle of the road bluesy funk.This album is filled with electric panios, a typical move when even some of the most traditional jazzmen were trying to rockify their music.

Both ends offer stereo sound. The female ends are sturdy and allow plenty of give to keep from dragging the iPod around every time someone moves, as opposed to the splitters that are one single unit.I did order two, and one of them has an annoying habit of cutting the sound completely from one female end, but twisting seems to restore the sound. I would likely return it if it wasn't a pain, and if it was the only one I had.

It definitely does not look like the picture that is shown in the description.Instead of the plug splitting into two separate cords, it's one flexible cord about 2 inches long and has the headphone splitter unit at the end of it. That way no cords are tangling around. I like the design but beware it doesn't look like the picture shown.I'm not sure if it's my plug, but there has been a little static noise coming from my speakers. But I just unplug and plug it back in and everything will be fine. A sort of a nuisance but I cannot yet 100% attribute the static noise to the splitter.The cord is really flexible so you can bend it pretty much into any direction where you have enough space.I'd say if you are even slightly considering getting one, this one is the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless with an iPad 2","review":"I have to say this is the worst audio splitter I've ever tried!

Of course, when turned all the way up it is too loud in the other set of headphones anyway. There was no balance whatsoever.This is definitely one of those, \\"You get what you pay for...\\" situations.These went straight into the trash. I couldn't even return them because it was over 30 days since I purchased them by the time I got home (we were traveling out of the country for several weeks).

For some reason the mustard did not do well... but that probably had more to do with my growing technique. It would come up, but then die almost immediately.As an FYI, the basil was a lemon basil and the parsley was the Italian flat leaf type rather than the curly type. I ended up purchasing some regular basil and curly parsley to add to my collection.If you like ALL types of fresh herbs, this is a good buy, particularly for an indoor herb garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Shipping/customer service","review":"Product was fine when I finally got it.

I have no problems with it dropping the connection and the setup only took about 15 minutes. I have the camera sitting in a window and I am able to read a license plate a block away. I have the camera set up to cover my cars in my driveway at night and the low lux ability allows for really good viewing with only a street light as illumination. Price is a little steep but the lower priced D-link units are a big drop in quality and features. Not sure if the problems were with early units but I have no issues with this camera (other than Price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Magical Ewoks","review":"This cartoon focuses on Ewoks and their magic.

It was not too complex for my younger students, but was not too simple or \\"babyish\\" for my older students. On the page that says peace is wearing different clothes, my kindergardeners simply noted it was okay that they all wore different colored shirts.

It wouldn't have been used to rally the American war effort otherwise.However, there's still plenty to take away from it. Life in the trenches, weaponry details, tactics and gallows humor pepper the narration. That's what kept me interested the whole way through.This isn't the quintessential World War I book.

Seasons four and five, she lost it. The charm was gone. It was hammer time with lesbian this and lesbian that. I know it was a milestone in TV history.

I've decided to get a couple of other more highly rated books. I'll let you know how it goes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy recipes!","review":"Everyone did such a great job with their reviews; the only thing I can add is that the recipes are wonderful. Also, they do not consist solely of yams & tofu. It's a great diet for anyone to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated","review":"I expected this book to have solid information and backing as why you should or should not eat certain foods. I expected there to be scientific information and there is very little in this book. It is a very strict vegan diet with no junk, if this is not what you were thinking, do not bother wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best resource","review":"I questioned a lot of items in this book to my acupuncturist and neither one of us were impressed. When struggling with infertility women often grasp whatever information they can get and run with it. Take caution and do your research first... for example, a true \\"yam\\" as mentioned in the book is difficult to find in the US (google it!) and is often mistaken for a sweet potato. And kelp can mess with your thyroid if you have a thyroid condition (common in infertility). There is also some good research about the use of wheat (ie: NOT eating wheat) in infertility. DO YOUR RESEARCH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic resource","review":"This is a great resource for anyone struggling with infertility, filled with useful nutritional tips on which foods are harmful/helpful. Includes stuff I'd never heard before--like vitamin C is an antihistamine, and can dry up your cervical fluid.A must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"To complicated","review":"I was looking for different explanations how to achieve pregnancy after almost two years of trying with medical help. I always have thought that what we eat is what we get and so I bought this book.But I am really dissapointed by its advice. It is to complicated to follow! The ingredients are not common and if you have to work and eat outside your house every day, this diet is almost impossible to follow. Even the book becomes boring after the first chapters!I really think after this book that the best way to achieve pegnancy trough food is to have a balanced meal and that's it!All the rest has no value!Please save your money, other books are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This book is useless to the average American. You have to give up several basic American food groups: junk food, fast food, instant food, restaurant food, to name a few. Oh, yeah, meat and dairy also. When you're all done with the dietary restrictions in this book, you'll buy all your food at a health-food store and cook all your meals from scratch from recipes in the book. And if your family doesn't want to do the same thing, you'll still have to feed them, since these meals don't resemble anything that Americans typically eat.Maybe the typical American diet is the root of a lot of infertility. But I think the book description and introduction should be clearer on how much work and sacrifice is necessary to follow this diet.I didn't actually try this diet. I could tell after reading the book that I wouldn't be able to do it. I barely cook, I eat most meals at restaurants, I travel a lot and my husband has hypoglycemia so is unable to eat this diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better be willing to overhaul your diet!","review":"This book had some valuable information, I'll give it that. But, for the most part, the diet is not something that your average woman will be able to follow. I want to have another baby very badly, but some of these changes are just not realistic. Several of the foods in the diet are close to impossible to get a hold of in your average small town grocery store. And your food choices will be very limited while on this diet. The fertility content of the book is basically verbatim from \\"Taking Charge of Your Fertility\\", so if you've read that (a must read!) you will not garnish much else from this book except for the actual diet and recipes. Overall, unfortunately, I felt the money I spent on this book would have been more well-spent on a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well intentioned but unsubstantiated","review":"I purchased a number of \\"natural\\" infertility books when my husband and I decided against fertility treatments. Although I think Fern may have some good ideas, it is dangerous for someone with no training whatsoever to put forth her ideas as facts. Don't eat soy? Soy is a great alternative to pesticide laced meat and poultry. I suggest books from people with SOME training. I found that most of her \\"don'ts\\" conflicted with the suggestions of professionals. Also, I found much of her suggested supplements advice worthless, as she never gives amounts/dosages. With that said, I located the yams (what could it hurt?) on the web at Frieda's, which is an African market. Good luck to all of you and stay strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!!","review":"My husband and I tried to have children for over three years. I got this book in a desperate attempt to avoid unnatural fertility assistance. I followed the diet and within three months I was pregnant. I recommend this book to anyone dealing with infertility!!

No not sweet potatoes, which are often mislabeled as yams, but true yams. I have checked my local healthfood store (Whole Foods) and they don't sell them. Neither does my local supermarket store (Safeway). How are you supposed to follow this diet, if you can't even acquire one of the main items. There was some helpful information. However since the diet states you must eat all of the suggestions items and not just one or two, then I guess I can't do it without the yams. Thus, it was a big waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally found yams","review":"It took some calling around, but I finally found a small produce store in Chicago that sells many types of yams--they sell at least 6 different varieties. I found this store by searching for African Grocery/Chicago in a few yellow-page search engines. Hope this helps people who are having a hard time finding yams.I too, like others who have written, have been a little frustrated at the lack of documentation in this book, but I decided to give the diet a try. Don't know yet if it will work, but I'm having the same symtoms as I had taking Clomid, so I'm hopeful--at a fraction of the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"View the difference between a sweet potato and yam","review":"I don't think this book does a very good job a describing the difference between a \\"sweet potato\\" (almost did a Dan Quayle) and a yam.

I was quite surprised to see that a real yam is black/brown. ...I'm very curious to know how many people have been eating sweet potatoes while thinking they were eating yams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"None of the data presented in this book was new to me.

What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"I really want to have a baby, but it is impossible to eat the way this book wants you to. I am really being honest about it!I really am a normal person. I work all day and I don't have the time to prepare the recipes, because they are really not normal. Please don't ask me to eat strange things in order to be healthy. A lot of women have babies without this diet!I think to eat healthy is to have a balanced diet, fewer calories, no caffeine, less sugar, etc. We all know it, but we never practice...

However, this is a book strictly for expert knitters, extremely well-versed in intarsia knitting (although there is some entrelac knitting).Don't expect any circular knitting, chunky yarns, machine knitted short-cuts. There is also no instruction on how to do intarsia knitting, or any other technique. The book assumes the reader has a thorough working knowledge of all the techniques and basics.This is not to say the book is of no value to the less-skilled knitter. It is inspiring in its use of color, pattern and texture. A less-skilled knitter could use some of the motifs on a more limited basis, and use the book as encouragement to stretch her abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"I bought this ethernet cable for online play on my playstation 3.

What a let down. Noise cancellation good, but the bass reproduction on the headphones flat out sucked. Along with the totally outrageous THREE day return policy, and ridiculous 15-25% restocking fee by the vendor, I was to say the least very very very disappointed.

Didn't like sound.\\" and decided to buy anyway because he said \\"This might be preferable for classical music\\" and I listened to classical music.I will likely try the Audio Technics. I gave these a 1 star because they are marketed as high end and I didn't feel the quality was real. I absolutely would have kept them if they didn't crackle but they would still have been mediocre. But the crackling is horrible. It lost the clear sound it came with in one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average But Expensive Headphone","review":"I do not consider myself as an audiophile but I am into listening and creating music as a hobby and can differentiate between different products. I have Sharper Image (they are out of business now) headphones and PXC 350. Both are noise canceling. My review is based on difference between the two. I paid twice for PXC 250. It is tighter on head, bigger on ears, leather pads are less comfortable. Both cancel noise almost equally though Sharper Image does a better job. PXC 350 flattens all sounds, while in Sharper Image I can clearly hear bass and treble. I was carried both of them during my two 14 hrs trans-atlantic flights and tested them for different sound tracks.

And the music sounds fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noise Cancelling Headsets","review":"I read many reviews on Bose, Sennheiser and other manufacturers of noise cancelling headphones. My primary criteria were comfort, size for carrying during long overseas business trips, cost and basic functionality. These PXC350's met all my criteria. They come with a nice, right-sized carrying case that fits easily into my briefcase. The phones are fairly comfortable, get a little warm around the ears, and the cups are slightly too large for my ears / head. But, I wore them on a trip to India and back, more than 24 hours on airplanes and in airports each way. They performed wonderfully for me. I really like the volume control. It rests easily in my hand and allows positive control over the changes in airplane audio. The earcup pads could be a little softer, but that's not a big negative to me.I highly recommend them. They deliver value for the price compared to other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I thoroughly enjoy these headphones.

This can be an inconvenience to many buyers.The plastic shell for the 3.5 mm plug is very large and I found that sometimes the protective cases for various products do not have a large enough opening to accommodate 3.5 mm plug.These protective cases have a hole in them so you can plug in ear phones or a headset. I tried two different cases for my iPod classic but the Sennheiser PXC 350 plug was to large to go through.I also found that the Sennheiser PXC 350 can't be used with a iPod nano when the Dock connector is in use do to the large size of its 3.5 mm plug.

When the noise cancellation is off, the headphones still work, but the sound quality and volume level of music is much reduced.

I can't imagine why -- his post-Ethshar novels (\\"Dragon Weather\\" and \\"Touched by the Gods\\") have each been gripping reworkings of tried-and-true fantasy themes.In the case of \\"Dragon Weather,\\" it's the old young-man-grows-up-and-avenges-wrongs formula, but Watt-Evans manages to breathe his own fresh life into it. Especially refreshing (well, maybe that's not the right word) is the casual brutality he brings into it -- diseased and maimed people fill the pages, much as one would actually expect in a barbaric pre-technological world.Sure, some of the plot points are seen kind of early, but Watt-Evans even manages to bring them around in a refreshing way, even going so far as to pull a triple-cross on the reader at one point.The ending suggests a sequel to the point that \\"To Be Continued\\" might as well have appeared beneath the last few lines. We can but hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawrence does it again","review":"It's been a long time since I enjoyed reading a fantasy novel this much. While a long time fan of this author, I think this is one of his best efforts since the publication of the Overman series.

In fact, the main character, Arlian, follows a very similar path, from a boyhood cut short by being sold into slavery, to his eventual escape and plan to revenge himself on those who did this to him by posing as a Lord and getting wealthy from a hidden stash.

The characters are 12 years old; they're not imbeciles; the story is somewhat original and fun to read.

This little overpriced boombox has trouble with certain CDs - especially RWs and burned CDs. Overall, this unit would be decent if not for the price tag.

What more can I say? The Bose is a nice table radio but a bad value at $499. At best, it's worth about $150."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO HELP FROM BOSE","review":"Was so happy to get a BOSE...then within a year the CD player reads unplayable and spits all CDs out. Unplug and it works hit and miss. Now doesn't work ever. Bose says send it back for $100 processing fee and they will DIAGNOSE it. WHAT??? I thought they had a good reputation and good follow-up service. Why did I pay 499.00? Piece of crap~very frustrating. Now I have to pitch the thing because after the $100 I don't know how much more it will be to repair the DEFECTIVE CD player! Very disappointing. In retrospect not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and thoughtless controls","review":"I love my old Bose wave. Fantastic sound in a small perfect package. Unfortunately, the new wave DOES NOT have controls on the unit itself. Instead, one is forced to use a remote to manage functions. For parents, the cluttered or the absent minded, forget it. My kids would eat the remote for breakfast, and I'd end up with another piece of useless plastic. For my son, I just purchased a Tivoli instead. Both Tivoli and Boston Acoustics produce a fine product that doesn't require a remote. I don't think that Tivoli or BA produce the same sound quality, but what good is great sound if you can't access it? Whoever made the choice to 86 built in controls is a fool or an obsessive compulsive. Did they even bother to test this silly idea with their demographic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound-Not so Great Otherwise","review":"I purchased the Bose Wave Music System for $499.95, after comparing similar systems. I think the audio quality is top notch - as claimed by Bose. However, their commitment statement that they \\"use only the highest quality parts and the latest assembly and quality control techniques to ensure the reliability and long life of their product\\" doesn't stand up. After about two years of infrequent use (less than once per week), the CD player suddenly stopped and was unable to read any disks. They did try to work with me over the phone to diagnose the problem, but were unsuccessful. I had to pack the unit up and send it back to them, and pay $119 for them to rebuild the CD player. I am surprised that the quality of this unit is so poor, and would not recommend anyone to purchase it if they plan on using the CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOSE = Buy Other Sound Equipment","review":"Ugh - I can't believe this thing doesn't cost $20, because that's the sound you get out of it.Even the most well-produced CD's from the mid-eighties when they still knew how to use the format sound like 128 compressed-to-hell .mp3's on this garbage.BOSE is a giant marketing scam. This little thing costs $499 for which you can get a half decent Yamaha receiver with Polk 5.1 system (or JBL, Paradigm, Klipsch, Infinity, etc.) which gives you roughly 30Hz - 20kHz frequency response (+/- 6dB)This Wave radio is about 280Hz - 13kHz +/-12dB which basically means it's rubbish.You're better off just burning your money that spending it on this nonsense.http://www.intellexual.net/bose.html"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift for wife who cooks","review":"I bought this last year for my wife who loves to cook and often listens to the radio/sterio while doing so. Bose unit is compact with rich, full sound that can go to high volumes with no distortion. It is extremely simple to use. We've had it one year with no problems. Although stuck in the corner of a cluttered kitchen counter it absolutely rocks or can play sensitive symphonic music with crystal clarity.Caution: if you need to adjust knobs or need a thumping base for rap music this unit may not please you. But for us its perfect and from all our playing evidence to date it is built to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...buyer, BEWARE!!!","review":"What a disappointment.In the mornings, I like to listen to talk radio on AM. With this product, forget about it!!! The AM reception is a joke (seriously). The Bose techs give you a couple of ideas...1)rotate the entire unit until the reception improves or 2)purchase a Terk \\"Advantage\\" cordless antenna and rotate that until reception improves.Both were ineffective. Unacceptable.The second problem I have is their return policy. Trust me, if you're not happy after 30 days, you are OUT OF LUCK - Bose will not accept the return or issue a credit.So, I say, don't bother. Who needs the hassle of an overpriced product backed up by professional techs who know how to get you off the phone and out of their lives, while feigning unawareness of the product's obvious deficiencies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there is not a rating for no stars","review":"I was so excited to get this new model but terribly disappointed when it arrived. I think that the sound on the old model was as good or better. And the lack of manual controls was a total deal breaker. All the comments about fumbling around for the remote or buying a second remote are true. Within two weeks I sold it on eBay. Since I wanted a bedside CD radio alarm, I replaced it with a Boston MicroSystem CD radio player. The sound is not as good as my original Bose was, but I was so disgusted about the lack of manual controls on the new Bose that I was willing to settle. BTW, the first Boston MicroSystem had a broken CD player. Second one worked OK and is still going a few years later. Stay away from Bose for now!! Maybe they can lure some of their old customers back ONE FINE DAY with a better product.

When I bough my first one (2005) I though it was pricey but it sure sound good. It lack, at minimum a battery backed clock. It really would have been nice if it had a radio controlled (atomic clock) but that may have been asking too much.I purchased the second one about 6 months ago for my father in-law who was turning 85. It was and received as a special gift and both my mother in-law and father in-law like the it. Where I find it falling short, at $550 is it lacks a HD turner and RDS to display song titles. Pie in the sky would be adding a USB port to plug in your flash drive with your music. I purchased a portable HD radio for only $39 and it has both features, and sounds really good. Come on Bose it is now 2010 soon 2011. Kick it up a notch on the tech side."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic box","review":"This item sounds just like what it is--a little plastic box.

What a disapointment, not only for me, but everbody that I also recommended buy one. EVERYONE I KNOW has problems with the player! And just a few minutes of WEB browsing confirms how widespread the problem is. But no where do I see any attempt by Bose to acknowledge the problem or any sort of mea culpa, rebate, anything. Just send it back for an expensive repair! We deseve better! DO NOT BY BOSE! A $25 players from Walgreens has better quality. I am very sorry I ever recommended Bose to other family members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I just received the Bose music system. This is the large unit which has a separate 5 disc CDchanger and a ipod docking system. I just got it this afternoon, hooked it up and popped in a CD. I couldn't believe what all the hype is about. I popped in another CD and the same thing. The sound is not that great and especially for over a thousand bucks. Just to compare I went to my present system and played the same CD's and my current system made the Bose sound like a cheap boom box. I'm a musician (for over 30 years) so music reproduction is something I really listen to and the Bose is not at all what all the advertising proclaims. I'm boxing it all up and sending it back to them. Save your money folks and go to a good stereo store and bring your favorite CD and listen to different systems and choose the one that sounds best to YOU. Don't fall for the advertising, infomercials and marketing schemes. It's way overpriced for what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"FM hardly works if another equipment is nearby","review":"Wave Music System III - Graphite GrayFM does not work if you use laptop or printer in nearby area.

The multi-CD changer portion (separate product) broke down in only about a year and a half, with very infrequent use. Now, after only about two years, this Bose wave CD player will not play all the way through a CD. It plays a song or two and then stops. This is unbelievable that such an expensive piece of equipment would last only a couple of years, and of course the warranty has run out. We have tried using the laser cleaner discs, etc, and nothing works. We don't even know if we want to send it in to be fixed, which will undoubtedly cost a couple hundred dollars, because of the poor quality of the product. The Bose reputation is very undeserved. Incidentally, the sound quality is not that great anyway for such an expensive piece of equipment. I absolutely do NOT recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"What a waste of money, and to think I sold my little AIWA CD player at a yard sale and bought this.

Unfortunately, they system just stopped working after less than 6 months. I unplugged it several times and it still did not work. You can only operate the system with the remote. The sound is great, but there is something wrong within the system. I have seen numerous reviews expressing problems and disappointment with this system. I am very disappointed that Bose would charge so much for a product that does not have the quality to match the price. Reminds me of the recalls on the Toyota's.

It is useless.I found out later that there are other companies with same or better quality.Hope this helps. The radio tower is great but the changer and the customer service IS HOPELESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced Boombox","review":"Bought ours a year ago. Finding info on warranty, right out of the box should have been a sign. The thing started having problems within three months, and now is a glorified clock. No sound comes out at all. The \\"wave\\" system, for all its hype, is no great shakes. Worse, when we wanted to add speakers, found we had to spend another small fortune. When we researched other systems to see how common a problem this was, we learned that other systems make it much more convenient to use. Compared to many of the other systems out there, this one seems antiquated and underpowered. It's old world technology, and that comment comes from someone born in 1954 who used to build short wave radios as a teen. I cannot see any reason to spend so much money on something you cannot put your faith in, especially when so many of these things offer much, much more for less than half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"For years I've heard so much about how wonderful the Bose Wave Radio is. I finally broke down and bought one, and man, what a disappointment. The sound is crystal clear, true- but it's also tinny and not rich at all. Candidly, the radio on my $40 clock radio sounds better.Why anyone would pay $500 for this is beyond me. Mine's going back to the merchant first thing Monday morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Remote Control fails, Bose steps up","review":"I've had a Bose Wave II Radio for a couple years now and it has very good sound and it worked just fine until now when the remote started acting up--sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't work there's nothing to be done because there's not an on-off button on the radio itself.I had earlier posted a rather agitated comment here, and Bose found out about my problem because they monitor comments. They contacted me via email--twice--and offered to replace the remote free-of-charge. I'd already ordered one from their web site ($10.80 including shipping) so I declined their generous offer.Here's what I think. One, the Bose Wave Radio is a good product. Two, Bose sincerely cares about their reputation and their customer's product experience. Bose Customer Service is superior to many of the other companies whose products I've purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Triumph of Marketing Hype","review":"Make no doubt, this system looks beautiful, but Bose sells what they make, rather than make what they sell.

And I will say it has some nerve claiming in the booklet that failure of the unit to play CD-Rs is probably due to the recording process, when all of them play just fine on every other player I have. The sound quality wasn't bad when it did work, though not enough, I'm thinking, to justify the price tag.

Her hair looks greasy and horrible. Her face is dominated by ENORMOUS lips and if that isn't bad enough they are outlined outside of her lips to make them look even larger. Her eyebrows are huge & dark; her make up looks like it was done by a drag queen in the 80s. The thick foundation looks like you could cut it with a knife.

I couldn't get past her appearance she looked dirty and worn out. She had on way too much makeup and blush she looked awful her hair looked dirty and tangled, you can see her black roots, the camera did a close up of her face and you could actually see the lip liner around her lips it looked so sloppy it was ridiculous. The actors were terrible in this film there were so many holes and unanswered questions I just couldn't bare to finish it. I gave it two stars because I like Brittany Murphy but who ever directed and produced this should be ashamed of themselves for allowing Brittany to look like this on film and in her last apperance none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful","review":"I just saw this movie on Lifetime Movie Network and I thought it was great.

I was and still is a fan of Brittany Murphy, from Sister Sister with Tia and Tamera, to Clueless, to Uptown Girls, to Little Black Book, I could go on and on and on. All her movies may not have been blockbusters, but I think she was a great actress and she had a lot of movies that were great. She also had a beautiful singing voice as well.

Was an enjoyable read with a twist that I did not expect, although come to think of it, there were plenty of hints throughout.The whodunnit premise makes it more interesting than your typical historical romance novel and no misunderstanding in feelings for the characters. The dialogue and tension between the characters are completely different at the beginning (very confrontational) and there was really no gradual change, just all of a sudden it changes once they admit and act on their attraction (which happens early on). It felt like Aubrey was a different person (when she met Giles) to when she capitulated to him as was Giles (from complete control to the opposite). Regardless, it was a sweet romance and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"Carlyle's last few novels have been rather disappointing in comparison to her first works. This last one is a perfect example. Very little character interaction, no suspense and, honestly, no story.When one reads her novels concerning Cole and Jonet, Elliot and Evangeline or Helene and Treyherne, their complex relationships that build and the danger/mystery in which they are involved, well, Giles and Aubrey's relationship is both unbelievable and boring. There is no suspense in any part of story, whether it be the relationship, who Aubrey is or the \\"mysterious\\" death. It's all obvious.The only interesting characters and aspects of the novel involve the uncle, the Delacourts, Kem and Max, and they appear too briefly. My advice is not to purchase this one new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story!","review":"This is the third Liz Caryle book I have read and I am liking her writing more and more.

It is one of the best I have read for Native Studies. There are many facts and other pieces of information that I had not found in other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education for Extenction","review":"Education for Extinction is a book about the Boarding School Experience of American Indians. The book is one that will bring you to tears, but it also shows the incredible resiliency of the children who endured the Boarding School Experience. This book is a true portrayal of the Boarding School experience; the good, the bad, and the ugly. This book gives you a harsh look at why Indian Boarding Schools were created in the first place and the connection between American Exceptionalism and colonization. I recommend this book if you are willing to take a harsh look at the oppression of American Indians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed Full of Great Information","review":"This book had so much great information and provided some great details as to the philosophy behind Indian Boarding Schools as well as what was occurring at the schools themselves. In other reviews, it was stated that the author, David Wallace Adams, tried to cover too much. To this I would say that I don't think that is possible with a book on this topic. There was so much to be covered and there would be no way to leave any of it out and still portray this part of our history accurately. He did go into significant detail on some topics, but this was necessary in order to get an accurate understanding of the events that were occurring. He incorporates many different resources in order to represent all the different view points and experiences of those involved in this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse at True American History","review":"I found Education for Extinction to be a well written, informative, yet fairly easy read. Adams' use of language created clear illustrations of the boarding school administration, the staff and the students. He was also able to capture the heartbreak and despair felt by Native American students and parents as their lives were forever changed upon entrance to boarding schools.Adams did appear to minimize the atrocities of events that happened within the boarding school system. Although he touched on some of the abuses that occurred, it appeared as though they were minimized, which I hope was for the benefit of the reader and not based on the subjectivity of the author.Education for Extinction provides a clearly written account of the near genocide of Indigenous People in America through indoctrination of boarding schools. A highly recommended read for anyone interested in learning true American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired genius?","review":"This is what the genius behind the music of Pink Floyd sounds like on his own...and it isn't pretty.His other solo albums are better than this one, but not by much. After all these years, I still haven't been able to figure out how the same man who wrote _The Wall_ was willing to make this uninspired, derivative (and now very dated) piece of work public. Perhaps credit for _The Wall_ doesn't belong to him alone as he would have everyone believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Roger, no more solo albums like this, PLEASE...","review":"I can't figure out what Roger was thinking when he put this mess together. I thought David Gilmour had an ok recording with 'About Face', nothing great just ok. Roger on the other hand records this mess and I'm sorry to say that I can't even say it is ok, it's just bad. Listen to me when I say that Roger and Dave do their best work when they are together in the studio fighting and screaming at each other over what works and what doesn't and in the end it is always perfect, some of the best music ever recorded.I don't think there is anyone telling these guys or challenging them when they are in the studio, someone should speak up and say, hey this is no good how about doing it this way. Imagine saying that to Roger Waters whose ego is bigger then than the earth itself.

I am not sure what he was trying to do with this record... and by his own admission I read that he said 'It was a failed concept, but I didn't realize it until it was too late.' I agree. HOME is the best song on the recording. but no worries, his classic Amused To Death more than pardoned this weak effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like all Waters/P.F., excellent music, mediocre lyrics.","review":"\\"KAOS\\" was the usual Waters treat for me; from him I expect excellent music, and can put up with the [mostly]absurd lyrics. As a result of the previous reviews on your website, I went to see \\"In the Flesh\\" at Darien Lakes, NY, last Saturday and enjoyed the evening tremendously. Clearly, the crowd liked all the old Pink Floyd stuff best. Clearly, Roger Waters liked his new stuff best, and I enjoyed everything. To me, \\"Home\\" is without peer among anything else he has written recently. Too bad he didn't perform it Saturday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds dated but....","review":"Before you jump to any conclusions...Yes, the album can sound dated. Many albums from the 80's can and do. There's also the classic concept album motif that Roger always employs on his albums. He enjoys telling stories through the music to make you at the very least think. This is a man with a message. You may not always agree, but he does make it interesting. Remember also the 80's was all about The Cold War, Nukes, Reagan, SALT, etc...Rocks songs about Geo-Politics don't usually fall into the genre of pop. Roger Waters does NOT write pop songs. Thankfully the man has something more important to say than Britney Spears. They say the man is bitter, but he's also devilishly clever and an extremely talented song writer and lyricist. If you love Floyd, then KAOS will not be a problem. The songs are there, even if the technology has aged. The story may get a bit confusing, but the album wraps up nice with \\"The Tide is Turning\\". It's worth the listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEEP FAR AWAY FROM THIS","review":"I gave this one star, because I had to give it something to get to the body of the review. This is so bad, please stay way away from this. The premise is silly, the music is terrible. Roger Waters is a bass player. Where is he on this disc. The songs have no substance, no point, nothing musically. The social commentary is just self-indulgence. It is painful. I'm trying to stress this. There is nothing good on this. No reason to have anything to do with it. I love Pink Floyd. I do not understand this. I just know that I bought it used and 5 minutes into it, I ran out of the house screaming. Aside from the no music that is on this disc, the sound is dated also. So it is 1987 again. This ages badly. I begged the guy who I bought it from to let me exchange it. He did.

Putting a brief shot from the show in here (blink and you'll miss it) was a cruel tease. This is, essentially, four music videos, and they're bad. I don't think there's any point to me trying to be eloquent about it. Roger Waters has had some of the most underwhelming music videos ever (which is shocking, coming from the man behind The Wall). If you want to see some bimbos singing in a darkened studio while Roger sways lamely in his seat, that's fine. Me, I say Radio KAOS could have made a good full-length movie -- but this definitely isn't it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the $#@!&% is this #$%@!?????","review":"A completely horrendous failure in Roger's exploration of his pathetic egomania."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Kaka, from the man who brought you \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", The Wall\\" and others...","review":"From the opening track, which is not only quite lame, but also the best one in the album, you can't help but wonder if his ego ever allowed him one second of regret for leaving Pink Floyd. Roger Waters' best days are way behind him. His constant bullying of the other members of his former band as well as technical assistants finally gave fruit when he was left alone to pursue his dreams of grandeur. For a man who despised his former mates, he sure milks \\"Dark Side..\\" and \\"The Wall\\" every chance he can, as no other artists or bands are breaking down the door to cover his later works. This album, s well as \\"The Cons and Pros of HitchHiking\\" deserve a worse and more humilliating death than that of the Soviet Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh By The Way, Which One's Pink?","review":"Back in 1987 Roger Waters and Pink Floyd had competing albums and tours. The winner was Floyd by a long shot. Sure, the Pink Floyd name carries more weight than Waters. However, Floyd did have a much better release. To be positive, Radio K.A.O.S. does have three good tunes which are \\"Home\\", \\"Four Minutes\\", and \\"The Tide Is Turning\\". But the concept here just sucks. Billy, a kid in a wheelchair, is able to pick up radio waves and launches a simulated nuclear war ala War Games. This is the type of CD you listen to once or twice, than you put it in your CD collection never to be touched again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!!","review":"I had seen this show in 1987.

Bad, bad, bad....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 80's Pop-Rock","review":"This is a great pop-rock album. Paul Carrack (Squeeze, Mike and the Mechanics) sings backup and is fantastic.A lot of people miss the point of why this album is so 80s pop. The album is about an LA radio DJ who is called by a mysterious listener called Billy, who is able to manipulate radio waves from this wheelchair. The songs are smart (especially \\"The Powers that Be\\" and the title track) because their supposed to be top 40 pop songs you would hear on the radio. Only they're not. They're a Roger Waters' versions of top 40 pop songs. That's why they're brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only KAOS is in Roger's songwriting","review":"This album is not quite as appalling as its predeccessor, the virtually unlistenable \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchiking.\\" Nevertheless, it is still a trying experience. Strip away the fine instrumentation of Pink Floyd (Waters's former mates) and all that remains are leftist political ratings from a guy who must have ENJOYED reading Karl Marx's \\"Das Kapital.\\" Not to mention the fact that the album's topical concerns (anti-Reagan, anti-Thatcher) are relics from the bygone Cold War era. We could hope that someday Watters will come to his senses and rejoin Pink Floyd. Alas, that hope is probably in vain."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's alright.","review":"the effects on the songs are dated,but even the songs themselves(lyrics,structure,background vocalists)just don't meld together well for me.I was expecting more I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid work...no Floyd though","review":"Roger Waters is one of my favorite lyricists of all time, and both The Wall and The Final Cut are my two favorite Pink Floyd albums of all time. However, the 1980's came, and swept most frontmen from the 70's up. Waters' friend Don Henley embodies cheap 80's music, and this album seems to be painstakingly trying to resist \\"modern music\\", however the keyboards carry a heavy stentch of the 1980's. As does the opening tune, \\"Radio Waves\\" sounds more like a Talking Heads impersonation than work from the man who brought us 'Brain Damage'. Overall however, this album is good. It's solid. A good buy, but don't expect to find Dark Side of The Moon's influence anywhere in this package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much message, too few songs","review":"In thel latter days of Pink Floyd, Roger Waters turned his attention from proper songwriting to delivering his own political and ethical messages. In short, writing decent, cohesive SONGS was set aside. Which is a shame. Radio KAOS doesn't suffer from this as much as Amused To Death, but still lacks memorable melodies, catchy choruses and punctual playing. Instead, we get an album's worth of political and sociological commentary & criticism. Which is fine, but not on a rock record. Unless you want to delve deep into this modern-age protest songmanship, this record is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Kaos","review":"Love this CD but had to replace it as my old one sat in the sun too long and was ruined.

Well, you'll hate this cd even more. Listening to it, one suddenly wonders how Roger Waters has made it this far. Life is simply not fair to have Syd Barrett end up how he did, and have Waters, a fat old geezer, dishing out this pseudo-intellectual garbage.As for the story line? It (...). Rent the movie \\"The Boy in The Bubble\\" and you'll be FAR more entertained. Better yet, to put it into terms of the era in which this was released, rent the movie \\"D.A.R.Y.L\\" (about the robot-boy-wonder-long-before-A.I.).Stay away from this one like the plague. It's not worth the cd it was printed upon, and certainly the liner notes aren't worth the paper they're on.However, if you're into collecting cd's as coasters or extra little \\"somethings\\" to prop up that wobbly leg on the couch or dining room table, then by all means, get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to you, rog?","review":"I feel that an album of such trivial nonsense as this is beneath even Rogers contempt.

(And i dont even want to mention what he did to floyd songs on the tour that followed this album) another strike against kaos is the down right silly plot. as other reviewers have detailed, it involves a whelsh boy in a wheel chair who hears (what else?) radio waves! somewhere along the line, the kid (billy) leanrs to speak, and gets a hold of jim ladd, a radio dj. from there, billy goes on to stage a fake nuclear war with his semi-telepathic abilities. honestly, what was roger (whos other solo albums i enjoy immensly) thinking here? ...i'll just blame paul carrack"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex (a little) but no car chases..","review":"Book loaned by a friend who noted that I was a John Mortimer/Rumpole fan and who thought I might enjoy Inspector Morse. I am sure there is some grist there and other reviews are probably more valid than mine owing to my decidedly pedestrian tastes.The book started out with an interesting premise (but don't all mysteries?) but quickly wound its way onto a labyrinth of side plots, sub-narratives, and entanglements with, frankly no redeeming steamy sex (except when Morse and Lewis visit the strip tease show) or car chases to revive my interest.Our poor old C.I. Morse even makes several self-admitted blunders as he stumbles into the mystery's resolution.Mr. Dexter is a very good writer; I am just a very poor reader....short attention span and all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusing mess","review":"This book seemed promising at first, but got worse as the chapters went by. A poorly constructed plot with bland characters made it hard to stay interested. The seperate parts were not well connected, and it was hard to lose interest. Even the mystery was not intriguing, and hardly made me want to find out what happened. There was no action, and it mostly consisted of interveiws and dialogue with no real point. However, there were some clever lines that showed Colin Dexter has some talent. This was my first book by this author, and it will probably be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very clever, very funny, an excellent leisure reading","review":"If you are tired of American detective stories that contain so much violence and gore, you will find this British detective story like a breath of fresh air. It doesn't matter if this is the first Morse story you read. The characters are so well written, the plot so well developed that it will keep you guessing till the very end. Morse, until those \\"supercops\\" in American's novels, uses his wit instead of muscles, logic instead of guns to solve crimes. Yes his personality is less than perfect, he makes mistakes from time to time, but that's exactly what makes this character believable and likable. And he's got that British sense of humor, too! I have to tip my hat to Dexter for his fine writing, and I will certainly look for more of his books. If you like well written, clever, funny detective stories with a dose of British humor, look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, even if enjoyable at times","review":"Of course I know the Morse television series, but this is my first Morse novel. I will have to try another one. This book is disappointing for the reasons stated by other reviewers, especially a plot that is excessively labyrinthine and, to be honest, not terribly gripping. The ending is also unsatisfactory. Dexter is not a great writer, but I'm sure he's done better work than this one. So I'm not giving up.

For just a small amount of money, this piece of equipment is very handy. It saves a ton of space by eliminating the need for an extra stand. It also helps keep the equipment close the drum head, making the range of motion needed to play smaller. It has a wingnut on it for tightening the rod, which works effectively.My one criticism - since it attaches to one of the lugs, it cannot be tightened enough for my taste. It still wobbles back and forth a little. If you tighten the lug nut more to eliminate the wobble, it tightens the head too much, knocking the drum out of tune.

It is very Bible-book based, which is great, but it also has some other games based on other Biblical and Christian topics.

The chapters ill-prepare and ill-equip the student to solve any of the exercises. In addition, the book provides no key figures or key points for which a student can guide himself. It seems that the motive is to deliberately confuse the student and obfiscate the topics. In using this textbook, you are guaranteed to need supplemental textbooks, workbooks and study guides in order to get an adequate understanding (and how nice... they offer these items for purchase!). I really question the authors' intent and purpose given their unnecessary obscure approach to the topic.

It contained very little explaination of the problems given, and it was very wordy. I think it would have helped to have a workbook with worksheets for the very lengthy assignments, because I wasted three sheets of paper for one problem!!

The authors expect you the student would have all the time in the world to read all the unnecessary detailed remarks in the book and the main points can only be found after extensive diggings.

This volume also has a transcription of the \\"Galop infernal,\\" which is a lot of fun. It is not 'tour-de-force' music, but both albums are delightful, and are excellent background music for reading or housework, as you can pay as much attention to the music as you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantum Leap delayed","review":"Don't take me wrong...

If that's been edited, there's no point in buying it.Disappointed that this is what the studio chose to release - all 3 seasons of Due South I've purchased came with the original tracks (I also own the music cd's - that has to have been expensive for a small Canadian series to track down, but they did it). The price was higher, but I'll pay full price for the real thing.Unfortunately, I won't be buying this one - I'll be looking for someone to record it for me instead.(To the marketing wiz who decided this: lots of people may watch the show, but only FANS will BUY a series on dvd - fans expect to get the real goods!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great.","review":"I read about the music changes, and figured I would give it a shot and buy it anyway. Unfortunately, since I had seen most of these episodes 15+ times apiece the changed music is so distracting as to completely ruin the enjoyment. They should have just removed the background music when they could have instead.I can only imagine why they removed so much music. But I bet it all comes down to the greed of the RIAA. Greed to the point where, IMO, it just about completely raped the entire season of QL episodes.I really hope that, if this debacle doesn't kill sales to the point where they don't even consider releasing season 3, they don't mangle the music again.I would have paid an extra $25 for the season if they would have at least not screwed up the M.I.A episode. I am crushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the show- hate the DVDS","review":"I have to side with the rest of you- the shoddy reworking of the soundtracks for this presentation is not worthy of the show. SHAME ON YOU Universal!Guess I will be taping these from Sci Fi on my own DVD recorder and editing out the commercials later - I don't mind fast forwarding either.Fox did this to an extent with Roswell as well which is why I have taped a full set from broadcast TV. I believe that was due to Warner Brothers owning much of the music which was ok to use while on the WB but not for DVD release without paying royalties. Hey music execs and TV execs- why not offer a special original broadcast special edition set for more money? Fans who want it will buy it- other more casual viewers will buy the second rate soundtracks. HBO charges big bucks for their series and they are worth it- you get to fully enjoy your show as you recall it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music issues blew it for me","review":"I am yet another fan of QL that has a problem with the music. I was disgusted when I got to the episode \\"Good Morning, Peoria\\" and found music of the music altered. The replacements sound so generic, that it just blew it for me. Music makes the scene and it is something Universal didn't even bother with. If they couldn't get the rights, then they shouldn't have bothered.I even sent a complaint to Universal to tell them that as a fan of the show, I felt like my intelligence was insulted.I know it has already been said, I just wanted to add my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable!","review":"I'm sorry, but if Universal is going to willfully release a sub-standard product, then the least they could do is warn me before I drop $45 on it. I am so upset I can't even say. I feel absolutely cheated by this DVD set. What does Universal have to say for itself? I mean - it's not like they didn't make the movie \\"Ray\\" - so don't tell me they couldn't afford the licensing for the original music for MIA. They're just being cheap and downright sleazy in my opinion. And what's with promising bonus material on the box and then not delivering it? Isn't that false advertising? And isn't that illegal? I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't worth buying.","review":"My main complaint is the double sided DVDs.So far the first ep doesn't work right. Around 32 mins in, it stops working. I usally try to put movies on my Zune Media player. So with this problem with the DVDs, it's not possible. From reading other reviews, other people are having this problem. So far the music edited isn't a huge thing for me, since I can't remember much about the show with the music. I do think the music editing was a very bad idea though.I hope in the future, they will release the seasons on one sided DVDs, and with the music included.I'd buy them in a heart beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the original TV show","review":"I buy \\"complete\\" TV series because I want the COMPLETE TV series!

Music has been EVERYTHING for the atmosphere of QL since its first episode. I remember when I saw the first episode on TV, so many years ago, and went after the soundtrack of Picnic and my old Pat Boone's albuns just to hear those songs again. I did that all over the series and even put a lot of the original songs on a tape to listen in my car. I LOVE this series and can only join all the others that urged here for a real COMPLETE release with all original songs.

It wasn't affaid to tackle issues such as sexual harrassment and many others. The show has two very talented cast members Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell. The reason I say this is because the both of them can act very well. My favorite episode of season 2 is Good Morning, Peoria. I can't say any thing bad about the show except when they looped the song Georgia On My Mind Played by Ray Charles in the episode M.I.A. Otherwise another wonderful season of Quantum Leap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing music but still good","review":"Okay, I agree, the ommission of the music sucks. However, the story and acting are still the same (fantastic) and I wouldn't avoid the buying it over that. The only music omission that seriously po'ed me was Georgia on My Mind because it was specifically stated by Al as one of Beth's favorites.As for the two sided DVD's, maybe you people have crappy DVD players but they work perfectly fine on mine. I've had other two sided discs and never had any problems with them. The first set I picked up did have a scratched disc though which I had to exchange. So, in short, if you enjoy the show more for the story and acting than the background music, it's still worth buying. Oh, I admit the ommission of bonus material was a bummer. I thought it might be an easter egg but no such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub par double sided DVD","review":"My favorite series of all times. I'm disappointed with season two for all the above reasons, and POOR QUALITY DVD PRODUCTION. The double sided DVD plays poorly on both my DVD players.

They changed the music. Yuck. They used two sided disks which don't want to play in all the dvd players. And they say right on the box there is bonus material on Disk 3, side b and there isn't any. It was like trying to watch those rip off dvd's from asia."},{"rating":"1","title":"No extras and important music removed!","review":"All right, what in the world was Universal thinking? First, they advertise on the box that there are bonus materials, and then there isn't anything on the DVDs. Secondly, they have stripped music from many episodes. The songs used in episodes such as \\"Good Morning, Peoria\\" and \\"Another Mother\\" really set the mood for the episode, and with the muzak they use instead, it really ruins the feel of the show.Worst of all, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" by Ray Charles was taken out of the episode \\"M.I.A.\\", one of the pivotal and most emotional scenes in all of QL.Universal has angered a lot of fans through this bumbling. I realise that music rights could be an issue, but there was obviously no effort on Universal's part to try to keep these episodes as they originally aired. You can't call it the \\"complete\\" second season when this set is far from complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with you all!","review":"First, I would like to say that Quantum Leap is the greatest show I have ever had the pleasure of watching! I watched all of Season 2 this past weekend and had not read any reviews until now. I was amazed to find how many true QL fans there are out there that noticed the same many flaws with the music that I did! The missing bonus material was pretty rediculous too. This season, I feel cheated and angry that Season 2 was so sloppily put together. What also irritated me is that they double sided the DVD's and I had to keep getting up and turning the disc over to watch the other side, instead of laying on my couch and watching all of the discs in a row. I truly hope Universal takes the time to properly put together Season 3, or I won't be buying the 3rd season set, I'll just rent it from Netflix instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show... Universal screw-up!!","review":"I was really excited to get this until I found out that they have changed the music in the most important scene in the whole series. They have removed \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" from \\"MIA\\" and inserted some generic music. Without that song the scene, and consequently the entire episode (if not the entire series) loses it's much of it's emotional resonance. True fans of the series will understand what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the original music???","review":"I bought this DVD because i'm an old fan of the series and have the episodes on VHS. i wanted to update my collection, butfind that mostly all the original music to accompany the episodes has been replaced with non verbal schmaltz. it's terrible, the music made the episodes what they are from that period in time, and by replacing it they have taken away part of the charm. i loved some of the songs that accompanied these episodes and feel they have just been robbed from the program. whatever the reason for this, it's not quite the same quantum leap that i know and love and i'm not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks To All The Previous Reviews....","review":"I am very grateful for all the previous reviews warning the fans that this series has been butchered. No doubt the music was edited out for cost reasons (as I've heard with other series) but c'mon, without the original soundtrack you might as well have released this in black and white! I am also sorry so many people got cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first.","review":"Beyond having more than twice the amount of episodes as the first season, the second season of Quantum Leap is a lot of fun to watch. The first couple keep something close to the original opening and closing theme but once you hit the episodes made in 1990 things change a bit. It becomes a bit more ethereal in the introduction but that's nothing you can't fast forward through. The character of Sam Beckett is really rounded out in this season as he experiences themes like bigotry in the 1950s, movements against rock and roll, and what it feels like when everybody treats you as if you were retarded. The last episode \\"M.I.A.\\" is the best of them all, and it alone is worth buying the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normal","review":"For some thing that cost that much.

This is one of the best records to come out of Los Angeles, ever. It's dismaying to read that it wasn't that popular; when I first heard it, a bunch of folks I knew thought Fishbone was huge. Guess they were in some kind of bubble.Fishbone is one of those leftfield bands from LA that's hard to classify. Like other Los Angeles bands like Oingo Boingo, Frank Zappa, War, Ozomatli, Faith No More, RATM, and RHCP (and now, Burning Star), Fishbone resists categorization, but works in many categories. The songs still sound fresh.I heard the bone was back performing again last year around LA. Maybe the world will catch up to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delectible","review":"What a treat! So refreshing to have someone as talented and connected as Niven share his uncensored experiences. The stories of Errol were moving beyond anything I'd ever read about him before. Everyone has sung this book's merits, I want to concentrate on \\"Our Little Girl\\". WHO THE HECK WAS THAT???? People are saying Vivien Leigh (came from Arizona, left her mother behind, had a baby, married a camera man, married three times, grew up in the Hollywood system, a blonde known as the Erector set?????) Vivien Leigh doesn't even begin to fit this description. Lana Turner seems most viable but these details do not fit her story either. Same with Rita Hayworth. WHO WAS IT???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring On The Empty Horses","review":"Excellent sequel to The Moon's A Balloon. Continuing David Niven's life and career and written in his own inimitable and self-deprecating style. Amusing and entertaining. Thoroughly recommended to all but read The Moon's A Balloon first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book about old Hollywood","review":"I just finished reading this book tonight and it was wonderful and interesting..He has first hand stories of Hollywood greats such as Errol Flynn,Clark Gable, Sam Goldwyn, Humphrey Bogart, and many others. You can tell that Mr.Niven really loved life. One of the great things about this book is that he had nice things to say about those he wrote about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful from start to finish","review":"Niven wrote 2 books and they are both very special books that show so much of his life and the people he encountered along the way. All told with such charm and warmth and real humor and insight that you just can't put it down. I wish he had written more he is a wonderful story teller and makes the reader feel like he is involved in the story. I think he must have been a pretty special person himself, the kind of guy you would love to sit down and visit with. I have read both of his books at least twice and always find something that I had forgotten to enjoy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on the Empty Horses","review":"I loved, loved, loved this book! One of the most satisfying and enjoyable books I've ever read. Funny, poignant, interesting, educational, and extremely well-written.

David Niven is a wonder of an author; he goes from insane humor to heartfelt sadness in a believeable blink. Some examples of the latter are Bogie's eulogy, the last visit to San Simeon, and And the \\"Our Little Girl\\" stories, about the very real time he had nursing Vivien Leigh through one of her breakdowns. Wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it","review":"One of the best old Hollywood reads. Ordering a new copy 30 yrs later. Very good funny stories.So is \\" The moons.

Many books of this kind are written in a bitter, sometimes nasty voice as an attack on the people involved, but Niven does not stoop to that level. Not only do you get an excellent first-hand history of the golden studio days of filmmaking, but you get to see a more personal depiction of many of the stars of the era. His style is so charming, and dare I say \\"witty\\", that I couldn't help but laugh aloud at many of his observations. Finally, a book about Hollywood that doesn't leave a bad aftertaste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC READING","review":"I NEED TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

This cable was just needed to connect a small TV in the bedroom with a RF Modulator and a new Zenith HD Upconversion DVD player. This cable was very inexpensive but looks like a quality cable. I was a little disappointed on the TV picture quality when everything was connected. What I found interesting was picture quality improved when I used the (supposed) lesser quality composite connection instead of the S-Video. This may have nothing at all to do with the S-Video cable and may be related to the cheap TV or new DVD player.

Without the Doctor, how will they reassemble the TARDIS?This book is set concurrently with Iceberg, where the Doctor has an adventure without his companions. With two very strong character as Bernice and Ace, it is possible to write a novel without the series' lead character.Nigel Robinson's second original Doctor Who novel is an improvement on his first (Timewyrm: Apocalypse), which seemed too bland for my tastes. By focussing in on the two companions, amongst the most popular in the series history, and having two interesting and strangely linked settings, he appears to have hit upon a combination that suits him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now Doctor Who Free!","review":"I've made the complaint before that many of the Virgin Who novels are lacking in the Doctor. \\"Birthright\\" most hold the record for the least amount of Doctor Who involvement; he doesn't show up until the very end! Okay, I know you have to read the novel \\"Iceberg\\" to find out why he's missing in this book, but that sounds like a cheat to me.There's also the mystery of who the old man at the end of time is.

Though his name may be familiar to all of us, his work has been habitually detested and forced into obscurity. Not only was his theatrical realism unfashionable in his time, but his sacrilegious subject matter and use of lower class models were violently scorned. Caravaggio's great work had the misfortune of enduring centuries of disrepute. It wasn't until the end of the 19th century that he was rediscovered and, quite posthumously, deemed a great master. He is now considered the most important painter of the early Baroque period; without him there would have been no Ribera, Zurburán, Velázquez, Vermeer or Georges de la Tour. Franz Hals, Rembrandt, Delacroix, and Manet would have been different. In this new book you'll find over 50 of Caravaggio's best paintings; we think you'll agree that he was a genius beyond his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Excellent Service","review":"Tech For Less handled everything with perfection.

The Vigata police are an interesting bunch and as Montalbano and his crew go about solving the big and little crimes that land on their doorstep they do so with typical Camilleri flair and style. The plots of these books are never all that simple to figure out but Camilleri brings us along as he gives us yet another slice of Italian/Sicilian life for us to chew on. This book is an excursion with the witty, clever and insightful author acting as our tour guide.Hop aboard. It's worth the ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Montalbano mystery","review":"The pleasure of reading the Montalbano series is not only the mystery itself but the characters: Montalbano and his team -- Fazio, Mimi Augello, Cat -- are funny, offbeat characters.

I'm looking forward to the next one due out in November."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleasant 'excursion'","review":"There were some interesting facts in the book---- mostly about Italian cuisine and a bit about Italy. The rest of the book was a cross between a simple mystery and slapstick humor of the vaudeville variety. And the book never figured out which it wanted to be.

Mish-mash is the best description."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointment","review":"Maybe the translation took something away from this book. It seemed disjointed and hard to follow.

I wish that you would be able to use the remote to turn on the mobile anytime you want, but it only stays active for like 10 minutes tops and then you have to hit one of the buttons on the actual mobile for it to be able to be shut off or on with the remote. But, the baby really likes it and she usually falls alseep within the playing time of the song and it's not much needed. I haven't used the remote at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"This mobile is cute and easy to assemble. Haven't turned it on yet (note to self: get D batteries!), so I can't attest to quality or staying power. I really like that it can convert into a music box/nightlight for later stages. For those who are wondering about attachment, it essentially hooks onto the back of the crib and is tightened with a big plastic nut. I was a little worried about fit as I have a sleigh-style crib, but it was not a problem, and feels plenty sturdy. Can't wait to see it in action!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I bought this mobile, and we assembly all the parts with the batteries and it doesn't work.

I just received it in the mail today and my 2-month-old son was fussing up a storm. As soon as I got the mobile put together (which was easy) and I laid him underneath it, he stopped crying and started smiling and cooing at it! I actually couldn't believe it! He doesn't even smile at his dad or me yet! I love the music options and the softness of the spin and of course the peek-a-boo leaves. The dangling toys are adorable and seem to be smiling down! I would highly recommend this product to anybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"My son loves the mobile!

When mine didn't, I decided to attach it (secure and safe) to my headboard. Curious about reports that it's not loud enough, I laid down and had a listen. It's plenty loud enough, even at a distance of 2.5 feet overhead. Remember, your infant hasn't spent time in front of the speakers at a Counting Crows concert! When the baby (9 weeks old) finally got a shot at it, he was enchanted, stimulated, very excited. So much for soothing -- but it's wonderful to know that while I'm having to fold laundry he's watching the bright colors and listening to lovely music. A great addition to the day with baby..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy for the crib, going back","review":"This mobile is way too heavy and big for myBabyletto Modo 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Two Tone, which is by no means a flimsy crib. The whole thing feels top-heavy and leans towards the inside of the crib when installed. The clearance between the bottom of the mobile base and my 6.5\\" mattress is also less than the 7\\" minimum required according to product instructions. On top of that, the music is way too soft even on the highest setting. Therefore, the mobile is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit on my crib","review":"This looks like a very nice product, but the bracket to attach it to the crib didn't fit on our crib. Its small and leaves only a narrow space for the railing it sits on. If you have a convertible crib with a thick top railing this probably won't work for you. Instead we got the Fisher Price Precious Planet mobile with the projection, which attaches with straps and is more flexible to the size of your crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This mobile is absolute junk! From day one the thing would stop spinning at times unless you tapped it to start again. Now after two weeks the only thing it's good for is playing the music. It doesn't spin at all now.

Definitely a good mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes loud clicking noise when rotating","review":"I can't use the rotate setting because it makes a loud, continuous clicking noise.

Still, it's fine since I oiled it :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor stopped working after 3 months","review":"We read the reviews for this product and noticed that some people had listed mechanical problems as one of the primary risks for this product. We ordered it anyway thinking that many of the reviews did not encounter the problem and that we may therefore be okay. I can assure you that this problem occurred rather quickly with casual use on our part. We play it for our 4mo old son before he goes to bed on most nights, but certainly not all.This problem having shown up so quickly with casual use on our part make me suspect that the quality is inferior for the drive mechanism. The music and speaker portion still work.Overall, the quality of this product is obviously lacking and you should be aware that you are taking a reasonable sized risk when purchasing this product that the drive mechanism will stop working. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"I purchased this product after comparing it to the mobiles that project onto the wall. I was super excited to get it in the mail but after I put it together and purchased the batteries for this thing, it didn't work right. Only the leaves would move and they did that very poorly. The lights and sound didn't work at all. Also, this mobile is RIDICULOUSLY LOW. Once your baby can reach up, that things is coming down!! What a piece of crap.

I really wanted to move to this mobile because it has the same \\"characters\\" to it. It is a bit quiet and on the bassinet mobile, I was able to start louder to get her attention and drown out other sounds, then turn down the sound once she was focused in and ready to be soothed -- this was very effective and I don't have that choice with this mobile. Another thing the bassinet had was a flashing light feature that helped to draw her in and become ready to be soothed - also absent on this mobile. The music on this mobile is better quality than on the bassinet mobile. This mobile is a very nice one and I am pleased with it, although I'd like it even better if the features from the bassinet mobile were incorporated into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this mobile!","review":"My 4.5 month old just got this mobile and loves it! We were looking for one that moved and played music for longer than just a couple of minutes to replace one we had from Pottery Barn.

Love the bright colors and shapes as well as the multiple choices for music. All that, and not a bad price at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit","review":"cute looking but doesnt fit on our crib. nowhere did i see on website that it may not be compatible with all cribs. our crib is also brand new. the top bar of the crib where the mobile should be mounted is either to thick (the lengthwise bars) or graded (the widthwise bar). the box did say it may not fit all cribs but how was i to know until i tried to install it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"very colourful and good quality musical mobile.My baby loves it.Only disadvantage may be the low volume of the music,but in a way that encourages sleep.was very easy to assemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Vibrant Colors and Fun Characters","review":"This baby mobile is very vibrant in color and the characters are fun :) My son loves it! There is a variety of classical music to choose from. The sound is not very loud, but when you want your child to calm down and go to sleep I guess that is good. I am happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mobile","review":"This mobile works great. Both the music and the bright colorful animals get and hold our son's attention and he still enjoys it after 9 months. We used any combination of the three songs whenever he would go down for a nap during the day and the 'Rainforest' sounds whenever we put him to bed for the night. Just one more thing we did to help him differentiate night time from nap time.We ended up barely ever using the remote as most of the time our son would fall asleep before the time limit on the music would end but it was nice to have at the beginning when he would occasionally take longer to get to sleep.Even though he stands up in his crib now and pushes the button on/off this is still securely fastened enough that we don't worry about him getting it off his crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had hoped it would be good","review":"This mobile looked and sounded (from the description) like a great mobile. Our son loves to watch things move and loves animals. Unfortunately the music was SO soft even on the loudest setting and the mobile itself was SOOOO slow that it would not keep his attention at all. Looks like a great mobile but just didn't live up to its description. Also, if you have a crib that does not have straight sides (e.g. there are some curves) the mobile attaches to it but it's very temperamental when it comes to the movement - you have to move the mobile to try to get it to work. Not the best unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped rotating","review":"After using for just one month, the rotating part stopped working. Just the music box alone is working. Called the service center people but was not helpful. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product. I want to marry it.","review":"After crashing through three weeks of motherhood like a wild boar, I realized dimly in my sleep-deprived state, that I owned this mobile. It was placed on my registry as an afterthought, urged by overzealous parenting magazines and bolstered by good reviews. Though it didn't fit my crib, I affixed it to the back of a dining room chair. As I write this review, I listen to my baby sleeping peacefully after listening to a round of Mozart. I feel like shaking the baby monitor to see if it is broken. Four days ago I told my husband, \\"if this isn't a fluke, I swear, I am going to write the best product review ever.\\" This is what I could muster without mentioning promising sex acts to the product makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops moving after a week, gets stuck!!","review":"Length:: 1:16 MinsI Bought this Mobile and it stopped moving in two weeks per the attached video. It works fine if you remove the fabric leaves that come with it. I would recommend this if you are ok this happening as a couple other people have pointed it out in reviews. However the fact that it stops working deserves low marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit","review":"I was very disappointed when I went to attach this mobile to my crib and it doesn't fit! The attachment is meant for small railings, so if your crib has a lot of wood trim, do not buy this!

I was finding a lot of the mobiles out there were kind of girly. The mobile is soothing, colorful and is just great. However, if there is only one thing I could change it would be the volume. It has 2 volume settings however, they are both low. That is why I only gave this mobile 4 stars. Other wise its perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I would have paid attention to the reviews","review":"Like many other reviewers, our mobile had issues with spinning after a few weeks. The music played and the light worked, but when the parrot got to a certain point in the rotation it slowed down to a snail's pace for about a third of the rotation. I called Fisher Price and they were willing to replace the defective part. However, they wanted me to ship it to them before they would send out a new part, which they said would take 5-7 weeks (which was way too long to go without one for our then 3 month old). So I had to pay for a new mobile and wait to get a credit for the defective one. Almost immediately the new one also had issues and one of the leaves stopped flapping. This was a fairly minor issue but still frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed for lack of info","review":"Kinda disappointed and thought this can be used for my daughters Graco Crib. Turns out that this device can be used for a wooden crib. So, beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It works well but not really what I expected. When I saw Peek-a-boo I really taught that the animals were hidden an showed back. It is just the leaves opening and closing. But it has great color and my son like it so...I like it, after all, it is for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mobile","review":"My four month old does enjoy watching this mobile in her crib and it will quietly entertain her and sometimes even put her to sleep. The music is not very loud, but since it's soothing that seems ok to me. We used rechargeable batteries with it and they did seem to run down quickly, but they always run down faster than regular batteries. It was easy to install on the crib and seems stable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We purchased this mobile after seeing all the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I guess we're in the minority. When the mobile arrived the music worked but the motor did not. We had to take it apart and fix it before we could get it to turn. Then, one of the leaves wouldn't work correctly (it stayed stuck in the up position unless you manually tapped on it). I also agree with other reviews about the music being a little too quiet. It's too bad because our daughter did seem to enjoy watching it turn. Anyway, this was a return item for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit crib","review":"This mobile is adorable, colorful and engaging. Unfortunately, it did not fit our \\"Emily\\" crib so had to return. Major bummer, it's the only mobile we really liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention-grabbing mobile","review":"We just put batteries in this mobile a few days ago for my 7 week old since he's starting to pay more attention to things around him. He was immediately captivated by the animals spinning around. The rainforest sounds are also very soothing, and I joked about using it for myself once he has outgrown it! I don't use it to put him to sleep, but just to keep him entertained while I get quick things done. So far so good!I already wish it didn't take batteries ( 3 D's) since I'm sure it will get tons of use. I haven't quite figured out how to do the different timed settings, but I know it turns off on its own and that's what really counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mobile","review":"We just got this the other day and my son is mesmerized by it. he's 2 months old and loves to watch his little buddies spin around. my only complaint is that while it plays for about 20 minutes it plays the same song over and over again. It doesn't seem to bother the baby though.Update: We've had this for a few days now and I love it even more. My son isn't much of a self soother, needed to be held and rocked to sleep then I could never put him down without waking him up. This mobile keeps him happy and quiet long enough for him to fall asleep on his own in his crib! That alone is worth its weight in gold to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"first time to review a product","review":"don't know why these new things can get so many scratches.

Had it up and running, playing music, spinning. The baby just loved it.Day 2: Turned it on and it would not spin. It just made some clicking sounds and played music. Filled out an Amazon request to return due to defect.Day 3: UPS picked it up for return to Amazon.Based on the number of negative reviews if you buy this product your just gambling if you need to return it or not. I would recommend keeping the box for a few days that way if you run into the same problem the return process isn't that difficult. If it breaks outside the return window you are out of luck however so you may want to consider that when making your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! A must have!","review":"I was not sure if my baby needed more stimulation especially while sleeping when I purchased this mobile. Thank goodness I did! The soothing nature or classical music is not cheap sounding. The animals are soft and engaging for baby to watch. Nightlight is available if you choose. I found that the combination of the quiet music and gentle animal movement is a great que for bedtime. Sometimes she just watches the animals quietly until she falls asleep. The mobile function did stop working, frustration gallor. However, with one quick request from amazon we had our replacement the NEXT DAY! She is 9 months and still enjoying this mobile as are her parents! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!!!","review":"We are sooo disappointed and upset. As a child, I grew up with Fisher Price. In fact, as an artist, I have even incorporated the classical toys in my Motel Series paintings; however, their quality has gone to the toilet. :(We purchased this mobil for our baby as she has had sever acid reflux and we were hoping it would help soothe her. It DID! She LOVED to watch the animals go round and round in the little increments of time that allowed her to be at her 30 degree recline... This all lasted less than a MONTH! :( :(Not only are we angry about the consumer \\"rip off\\" we are also VERY angry about the WASTE that will go to the landfills. SHAME ON FISHER PRICE for making such a crappy, throw away product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent toy for babies","review":"I had this mobile on our crib from the day my son was born. He has loved it since then. the colorful animals moving back and forth thru the leaves, the music, the light that comes on, absolutely favorite.

It is by far the nicest one I found after much research. Much larger components than others so baby can see the figures move. Music is great, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, a few things could be improved","review":"The best aspect of this product is the natural sounds that lull baby to sleep. The music option is bad, like many baby toys, phony tone and annoying. The leaves that open an close while the animals rotate are very cool. The light on the base is alright, nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"This product was a dissapointment. The motor worked for about 15 minutes, then died. The sounds worked fine, but FisherPrice really dropped the ball and used the cheapest, weakest motor they possibly could. This was a big waste of time and money on all sides of the Amazon equation. I will hesitate before ever buying a FisherPrice item again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommy","review":"My daughter, she loves this musical mobile. It has long music also has a light. it has a remode for you to turn on and off music. I love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and fun","review":"My son absolutely loves this mobile. He'll stare up at the faces of the little creatures (a lizard, parrot, monkey, and bug) and giggle like crazy, it's hilarious to watch.What I really love about it is that it's super bright and colorful; my son has no trouble focusing on it at 4 months old. It was also easy to put together and simple to attach to the crib. The music box part plays 18 minutes of classical tunes and its volume settings seem adequate to me.The mobile portion is detachable for when baby doesn't need that bit anymore, and the music box has a nightlight (not too bright) which has proven useful.All in all I love this product and definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes squeaking noises as it rotates","review":"My 6 week old likes this mobile. I like the rain forest sounds and adjustable volume (although it only has 2 levels), the remote is convenient, the animals are cute (parrot, tree frog, monkey, and dragonfly). It was relatively easy to install (you will need a small screwdriver to open the battery compartments on the mobile and the remote). It does NOT come with batteries (needs 3 D batteries for the mobile and 2 AA for the remote). Unfortunately, it makes squeaking noises as it rotates and sometimes when I switch it on it will not start rotating, I have to push/pull on the leaves to make it start. If it weren't for these faults I would love this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant hear the sound/music","review":"I bought this product because of the high ratings but the sound or music is very low. I can hardly hear it.

It looks great and operated beautifully for 3 weeks before the motor stopped working (i.e. the leaves stopped rotating and opening/closing; the music and light still work though). I threw out two sets of batteries assuming that was the problem.Choose a different mobile because chances are you won't have time to deal with the warranty or get a replacement mobile once your baby arrives... I wish I had heeded that advice from other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor failed after a while","review":"My baby enjoyed this mobile. There was a period (when he was 2-3 months old) when he would stop crying and kick excitedly whenever we placed him in his crib and turned the mobile on. But after about 3 months of not-too-heavy use, the motor started making a whirring noise, and would struggle to turn. We replaced the batteries several times (which did not fix the problem), and decided to put up with the whirring noise and the slowness. It finally stopped turning at all after 6 months. I disassembled it, and found that it was cheap plastic construction, which relies on a thin rubber band to rotate the whole assembly. I cleaned the plasticky gunk from the belt-wheel (another plastic piece), but shortly after being reassembled, the mobile slowed down again. It's going in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very peaceful","review":"Someone else mentioned that this was not loud enough. I have to admit I was surprised how \\"mellow\\" the tunes were as mobiles we have had in the past have been much \\"brighter.\\" However our little guy doesn't seem to complain & I LOVE the Rainforest \\"medley.\\" I have found that if he wakes up a little too early for my liking & certainly way too early for music LOL! I can turn on the Rainforest & he will happily lie there looking at the animals going around & we can go back to sleep for those precious few more minutes. It's quiet enough not to disturb us but loud enough to keep him occupied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Great mobile!

I purchased this when my daughter was 6 weeks old and she absolutely loves it. My husband had to build a mount for it to hang on the wall since she sleeps in a pack-n-play and it wouldn't attach to the model we have.

What is the point of having a mobile that doesn't spin?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit on convertible crib","review":"I will be returning this mobile, unfortunately - it will not fit on the Ragazzi Etruria shaker stage crib, and I feel there might be similar issues with other convertible cribs - a definite design flaw, considering the current popularity of convertible crbs. The top railing is too high to allow the crib to be mounted, since the lip determines the placement, and the bottom of the mobile does not come down far enough to expose the hole where the clamp attaches. Wish I knew about this before I ordered - every other Fisher-Price model shows the mounting in pictures, and all the other mobiles use straps to hold it in place, not a lip plus clamp, and this mounting style was NOT apparent in any of the stock photos. Not recommended for convertible cribs."},{"rating":"1","title":"already broke!","review":"I splurged on this mobile for my 2 month old... and he delighted in it! I really liked the way the objects moved for him; it is entertaining but also peaceful. It helped train him to fall asleep for naps on his own. However, I've had the item for not even a month and already the thing won't spin anymore. The music plays, but the objects won't turn. I am very disappointed that I wasted my money on it, especially since I've thrown away the packaging and probably can't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead on arrival","review":"Looks so cute and it promises so much, so for the price it sounds like an amazing deal. I wish it worked. Ours was dead out of the box. Took the time to put it together, put the batteries in and...nothing!

It never worked: never turned on, never made a sound. Very bad quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Star Worthy!

Now on my 2nd mobile (bc I returned the 1st)...and this mobile does not even work..AT ALL! Brand new batteries...and the mobile will not function! No music! No motor function!

The tension is not enough to hold up the mobile portion-it immediately tipped forward. Rather than return it, we just secured the mobile by tying a strap from the bottom of the mobile pole to the peg. This is a pretty major design flaw, which is why I don't think the full retail price is fair.I was able to buy this on sale for less than $30 and that seemed a fairer price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I was very excited to get this mobile and we were so disappointed when it didn't turn.

I didn't buy this book to read about the lifestyles of accountants and typists. A lot of the info is simply stories and anecdotes and it is very light on data, but I guess that is what you get when you buy a book from a journalist from the New Yorker instead of an academic who has deep data and knowledge.

It allows readers to take a peak into the aspects of Bond they might have missed whilst reading. Amis has taken Fleming's original facts, ellaborated, and made his own humourous, sketchy, and facinating observations. As a literary master himself, and a long-time admirer of what he calls 'the Fleming affect', Amis expertly takes apart, not just the world, but the man, James Bond. Fleming veiwed the manuscript of this book shortly before he died, and approved every part save minor quibles of what James Bond ate, drove or drank.As stated earlier, Amis was himself a bond-fan, and said to Fleming once: \\"Mr Fleming, You are the only author whom I can say 'I have read all your books, and have enjoyed them thouroughly'\\".

Most of which Shepp and his friends play are blues. Seems he's returning to his roots here.

For an experienced or even novice painter with an airbrush there is no knowledge to gain. As a collector's item and item from the late 40's the book is interesting - it has a nostalgia value.

All but two of his characters are well developed .There is too little history about Roger, and thus Koontz gives no enlightenment of his psychotic motive/s.The other dissapointing character was Pete,one would expect that after Harry disclosed the true nature of Brian's accident to him(together with Koontz's physical description of him),that he would play some major role in the climax"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the most loyal of Koontz fans","review":"Wow! I read Watchers, Strangers, Dark Rivers, and fell in love with Koontz' supernatural thrillers. Then Icebound: just an ordinary adventure, with a very ordinary bad guy lurking around... no supernatural stuff; no mind control, no boogeyman, no poltergeist, etc. By Koontz' own admission, he wanted to try writing a story like Tom Clancy or Clive Cussler... he did an OK job. That's the problem: I don't like spending precious time and dollars on an ordinary adventure.

Smith's overall conclusion is that the existence of God is \\"impossible\\". The rational, logical mind must agree that the existence of God is \\"possible\\". Why? Because the atheist cannot provide adequate proof of the non-existence of God. Therefore, Smith's conclusion that the existence of God is \\"impossible\\" is irrational.

We are talking about the Universal Source of our existence, and the sustaining reality of \`being'.Personally, I believe there is a depth to life, and after reading many books on contemporary cosmology, a spiritual dimension in the Universe makes more than good sense.

It is important to read GOOD representations of both sides. Read this book on atheism, but also read a book on apologetics, perhaps by Geisler. Neither side is going to be able to PROVE anything (or else there would be no debate), but I've just found through investigation which side I find to be more probable, which is the existence of God.

Satan's first lie to us was that we could be like God (decide good/right from evil/wrong). In all our science and \\"logic\\" patterns, we do not have the capacity to understand what is beyond our natural world. Life is is a miracle. It is infinitly complex and it's design is far beyond our comprehension. Speaking in terms of probability, the odds of the components of a single cell forming by chance is impossible. God is real and He cannot be minimilized away by some guy with a Darwin-Fish on the back of his Volvo."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Atheism - the vice of a few intelligent people\\" (Voltaire)","review":"Well-written, with sound arguments and reasoning. It stands well enough on its own as an accomplished attack on theism, but also serves as an excellent primer for tackling even more detailed work by atheist philosphers (such as) Michael Martin or Theodore Drange. As is witnessed by all the hysterical and incoherent \\"reviews\\" already posted, Smith's book touches a nerve with the believers. To borrow the phrase of one such reviewer, when the rubber hits the road, and the theist is driving, look for reason and intellectual rigor to become roadkill. This book is a nice antidote to such god-talk. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The book begins by properly defining what atheism is. This seems like it would be unnecessary, but many theists, and indeed some atheists, don't understand this concept. The book then goes into showing how the belief in the supernatural, especially in gods, is ridiculous to the point of absurdity. The author then goes on to destroy the concept of the Christian God, showing how his assumed qualities are contradictory in nature. He then goes on to show how faith is the enemy of reason. Later, he dissects the philosophical arguments for god, showing them to be fallacious. The next section is about how superior rational morality is to divine morality. Lastly, the author goes into detail to prove that Jesus is not some paradigm of ultimate morality as many uninformed Christians think; he is actually a copy and a fraud. After this book, theism has no place to hide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book to grasp the atheist perspective","review":"I read this during my transition phase. It really makes you think and clearly demonstrates why there are doubts for the existence of the (Christian) God. It gives solid rebuttals to several supposed arguments for God. This book by itself probably won't persuade you one way or the other, but it will challenge your beliefs and adds to the \\"debate\\" in a civil way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atheism: The Case Against God","review":"In \\"Atheism: The Case Against God\\", Smith makes a very good case against God and for atheism. He also shows that many of those who call themselves agnostics really are atheists.He points out many inconsistencies in the Christian god and shows that it can not possibly exist, and also gives many good arguments against gods in general. He makes a good case against faith as an alternative method to reason of acquiring knowledge.The book almost deserves five stars, but it tends to get a bit repetitive at times and some parts are a bit heavy handed. Anyway, this is definately a book that everyone interested in religion or atheism should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"God and other imaginary people in the sky.","review":"I like the review that states \\"creation of a single cell is impossible\\" (or something like that) but GOD is real! What in the hell is that? Just the simple statement is ludicris. Just because you were stupid enough to believe that there is an imaginary man in the sky watching you all the time and he knows if your're doing right or wrong and you will have to answer to him,don't think the rest of the world is as gullable and stupid as you are! What's the difference between god and Santa? To a christian the difference is GOD IS REAL! To all others who have enough intelligence and common sense there is no difference. Tell me do you believe in Santa?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Regarding the review entitled, \\"atheism is just plain wrong\\"","review":"In your review, you state that Jesus Christ is God. I must ask...when was the last time you read a bible? The version I grew up studying begins with God creating the earth. Jesus, his only son, was born later of the virgin Mary. I would recommend that you attend a remedial bible study course and get your facts straight before you continue your crusade against atheism.As for the Bible, it is nothing but a collection of stories written by people whose aim was to bring order to society by scaring them into thinking that their actions would have consequences from God."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you define \\"atheist\\"?","review":"This book confirms my own experience that most of the people who declare themselves \\"atheists\\" are in fact \\"anti-religionists\\" which I think is a much more accurate term. Anyone can focus on the hypocrisy of churchgoers and the unbelievability of miracles which require suspending the laws of thermodynamics--but let's remember that religions are man made. To believe that there is not a creative intelligence in the universe is to believe that an explosion in a print shop can produce Webster's unabridged dictionary. Or, if you are an \\"evolutionary\\" atheist, that a billion explosions over a million years will in fact produce an unabridged dictionary. Thus argument is more ludicrous than many of the miracles which many religions proclaim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks George Smith for a great book","review":"I read this book, for the most part, where I work.

Whatever your background, don't be quick to dismiss this book, it really does explain atheism pretty well, and its one of the best that I've seen of its kind. I used to be a xtian, then after seeing what xtianity is really about, I deconverted a few years ago. Its the best decision that I've ever made. Now I'm a skeptic and realist and my life's been better ever since I've let go of xtianity and supernatural beliefs. But I've only recently discovered this book and it really confirmed my thoughts on what I already thought about religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Every time I have asked a Christian \\"What proof is there that your god exists?\\" I get the same answer... \\"The Bible\\". First off The New Testament was written some 40 years after Jesus was supposedly crucified. Secondly, historically what was going on at the time (Rome doing ALL that it could to totaly destroy their opposition...the Gnostics) had a HUGE hand in what was placed in \\"The Bible\\". Just do some simple research on what The Vatican decides to be holy and what is heresy. You'll only see the things that propagate their cult...anything that goes against it is heresy.Imagine that a world war occurs and that all books are burned except \\"The Lord of The Rings\\". A thousand years later when people emerge from their underground bunkers and find TLOTR they accept it as fact. Next thing they do is go searching for Mordor to find the Ring.As for the book (ahem...) very well argued and simply brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"Smith presents and interesting and often compelling case against God. However, none of his ideas are new. Instead, they are simply rewordings of his predecessors like Kant et al. Nonetheless, it does present an interesting case that causes Christians to think. However, as a Christian, it does nothing to deter my well-reasoned belief in God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rational Condemnation of Mysticism","review":"Just a well written book. It totally destroys the theists at their very root by showing how they can't even define the word god and takes it from there. It also then goes on to make the destinction between reason and faith clear as possible to avoid any confusion that the Christian might use to his advantage. Don't be suprised if Christains give this book a one or two, Smith leaves them no room with which to pull off equavocations by making sure to keep precise definitions. Many will call Smith's style dogmatic... totally ignoring what the word means. However Smith's style is just confident...and honest, if not too kind to a belief system that has failed to come up with one shred of evidence to support itself in 2000 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apparently complete source of arguments for non-theism","review":"Well done for what it is. It is a shame that other proponents of atheism do not read this book and avoid many obvious errors in their denouncement of their detractors (\\"nature our only example of reality\\" being narrow in its positivism and unnecessarily ignorant of metaphysics and ontology). Primary use as a reference book is valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job But To Limited Audience","review":"The author has presented the case of Atheism quite well. The main gist of his work is to establish where the burden of proof lies and I think he has done it perfectly.Apart from that, I don't think that the author has spent much time on the theist assertions. The articles on first cause and design arguments are not very elaborative and lack in their depth.Another thing, which I would like to mention, is that the audience of this book is quite limited. It mainly addresses Christians. Since I belong to another religion, most of the stuff in it was irrelevant to me.I do not agree with the author on many issues but that does not mean that I should diminish the value of the work he has done in this book. It's a well-done book and a good challenge to any theist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophic Discourse covers the bases and shatters superstitions","review":"Don't lose track of the basic points that are made in the first few chapters as they are the foundation for the rest of the argument. Overall, it is very good and well written, similar to Darwin's Origin of Species in it's plain-spoken modesty. However, it is also replete with cutting criticisms of illogical behavior and irrational thought. I would recommend this to atheists and theists alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read on the subject of atheism. This is not a venomous, vitriolic attack on religion. Rather, the author just lays out the arguments in favour of rational scepticism. With impeccable logic and reason, Smith carefully analyses all of the arguments that have been put forward by the great christian thinkers of the past, and shows how shallow and self-contradictory they are. I cannot recommend this book enough, it is an absolute must for anybody seeking and in-depth philosophical discourse on the case for atheism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book with nothing new to offer","review":"I was hoping this book would provide me with new insight into atheism, but found myself very disappointed. However the author is knowledgable about the subject and demonstrates his position well.His examination of bible passages was out of sorts with common Christian theology which he must regard to prove his point. The author falled to understand that faith and reason are not divorced from each other. He implies that Christians operate on faith alone which is simply not true. Faith has two sides;one, is that a believer put trust into the object of his/her belief and second, faith is a supernatural event given by god.His first attempt to dispute god by defining the word \\"god\\" away is simply silly nonsense. The point is that the word \\"god\\" has meaning and content. The point is that believers know it and use it and understand it. The author should spend less time devoted to redefining words and more time in critical thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still an excellent choice for any CISO and security practitioner","review":"This book has withstood the test of time with respect to the way security affects service level agreements and why security needs to be incorporated into service level management plans and service support for all Fortune 1000 companies.ITIL security guidance should be an adjunct component used with an overall security program and information security framework such as ISO 27001 and 27002 or COBIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I purchased this to travel by myself from Alaska to Nevada.

My car seat was not one found on the GoGoBaby site, because I didn't realize they had a list of all approved carseats for the dolly. But mine worked. It was light enough (along with my carseat and baby 17lbs) to carry the baby down the stairs to get out to the small prop plane and up the stairs into the plane.Baby loved it! Just watched all the people!Not once did the carseat come away from the dolly.

It was awesome when we had to run to catch a flight in Houston. Extremely stable and smooth through everything we went through. The GGK Travelmate easily fit in the overhead compartment or under the seat on the planes we were on.

(The only option was to turn the lawn mower over and dump the oil through the filler tube. - Talk about dumb designs!) This oil extractor did not work as expected; it extracted about half the oil.Oil changes on the snow blower and another lawn mower produced the same results - only half the oil was sucked out.Next I used it on the car. Well, I stuck the tube all the way down to the stop and drew a suction. After about a half hour it gurgled and there was a little more than 3 quarts in the container. Since the capacity for my Chrysler with a Pentastar engine is 6 quarts, I drained the remainder via the drain plug and collected another 2 1/2 quarts.What a waste of money! Unfortunately by the time I used the thing it was well beyond the period for which Amazon would take a return."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay...","review":"Maybe it's just me, but this is the second pump I've bought and neither worked well. First I tried a hand pump and no matter how hard I pumped I was only able to remove about 2 quarts. Using this device I got about 3 quarts out but finally had to just give up. Each time I warmed the oil running the engine but the pumps just aren't strong enough to keep a continuous draw going. Unfortunately I don't have the means to get the container lower than the engine. I'd opt for a larger vaccumm vessel next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oil change tool","review":"I have used the oil extraction device twice and it works well. For a car or truck it requires several cycles of pumping a vacuum to keep the oil flowing out at a decent rate. It takes considerably longer than unscrewing the drain plug and draining into a pan but you can do it from the top of the engine. The only problem is you still have to go under to remove and change the oil filter! Of course that is not the purpose of the extraction device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing since sliced bread...","review":"This pump is very well made, very easy to use, and though expensive, will pay for itself with just a few simple oil changes.

The first is that the soft rubber earcaps fit comfortably and snugly in the ear. The other, oddly enough, is that I'm hearing A LOT LESS noise and static through them that is apparently caused by the fluorescent light transformers overhead in the ceiling at my gym. (Go figure.)

I purchased it to brighten dingy white shirts that I had. I followed the directions on the label to a 'T', adding oxyclean to the wash as instructed on the label. All my shirts came out of the wash with orange streaks!! I phoned the company which said that there was a mistake on the label and I should not have used oxy at all. Well, I followed their label. The rep told me that they would make things right and not to worry. I was told to provide the replacement value of the shirts and show pictures of what I had. I did. The replacement value of the shirts was well over $400. White Brite ruined 14 of my shirts. They gave me a lousy $140 for shirts They ruined because I followed their instructions, and said that that was it. So wrong in so many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I use warm water and dissolve the powder.

My cousin has one of the other MP3 players and it is a piece of junk. The songs are only organized into 1 long list of songs so if you want to find a song (..and you have 300) you have to scroll down the list until you find it. With Ipod, the songs are separted by album, artist, genre, composter, etc. and you can make your own playlists on Itunes to play any collection of songs you want.

It's the only mp3 player that I have ever owned. But the Itunes software is terribly annoying. My first beef with it is the size of the program; it is SLOW. It takes 2 to 3 times to bring up as windows media player. It rips a CD at nowhere near the speed of wmp. Also, it destroys any type of organization scheme that you develop on your own. If you rip a CD using Itunes, it will put the files in my documents\\\\my music\\\\itunes\\\\itunes music\\\\artist name\\\\album name. If you have multiple iPod's sharing the same computer, forget trying to keep things straight. Also, apple has added the \\"convenience\\" of only being able to upload to your iPod using the Itunes software.

The only sufficient method I have had in using it in my car has been the tape player (who has a tape deck anymore??) and in my new MINI Cooper I paid a ridiculous $150 to have a dock installed into the stereo.

Why books like these win national book contests remains a mystery to me. I can see that this book would stand out among a sea of dull manuscripts, but it is hardly good enough to be published in this series and by HarperCollins, no less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Book","review":"The negative reviews of this book were undoubtedly written by poets (the only people who read poetry)who are likely far less skilled than Mr. Short and have probably had their manuscripts rejected a humorously high number of times by the National Poetry Series and other book contests and such. You people run so hot/cold, gee. Short's book is a good read, elliptically elliptical, and won't put you to sleep. As for overgleaning some of his gorgeously elliptically elliptical phrases from Mr. Clover's book, I wouldn't know, I've read that, like, four times, and still don't remember a word. Though it is a real swell book, too. Peace out . . .(I am shocked that the NPS would choose a work of such inferior . . . hey, call the waaahhhhhhhbulance? Ok?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TOUR DE FORCE!","review":"Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design. Laced with a surprising amount of dramatic moments, little laughs and a sweet side. It's less about the dangers and pleasures of the unchained id than the giddy anarchy of the unbound imagination. Compared to most of what else is out there, though, it's so good-natured and tame that you can't help but let it win you over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break","review":"This collection offers little to recommend it. Self-conscious and heavily indebted to Ashbery and just about every offspring of Ashbery, Tremolo should make us question why the National Poetry Series (since it publishes collections like this and Tenaya Darlington's Madame Deluxe) can continue publishing such drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expansive Symphonic Work","review":"There is an openness, a fullness, an expansiveness to Malcolm Arnold's symphonies that is quite appealing. While these are not romantic or pastoral compositions, they are, nonetheless, quite accessible, unless one has a problem with the presence of any dissonance. On the whole, this is quite an enjoyble CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"worst premium cologne i've ever smelled\\"","review":"This cologne did not smell like cologne. More like a spray. It didn't have any kind of masculine or even sweet smell. Can't really explain it, except for appalled. I would'nt endorse it. But it's just my opinion. I bought it because of the Gucci name. But it's irrelevant. Hope Guuci does better in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story has been better told previously","review":"A First-Rate Tragedy, while certainly well-done adds nothing to the earlier \\"Scott and Amundsen\\" written by Roland Huntford. In fact the latter does the job in more detail, with greater insights into the time and context of the Antarctic Expedition. It also covers both Amundsen as well as Scott. Finally, the author serves at times as an apologist for Scott - perhaps this is so as she is British herself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, but take it with a grain of salt","review":"What struck me after reading this, wasn't so much that it was a great book, but that the events surrounding the \\"Race to the Pole\\" are so intense that even a mediocre book on the subject can be truly rivetting. This was the first book I read on the subject and it left me hungry for more (and less biased) accounts of these times.Even while enjoying the book, it was easy to see the author's skewed point of view towards Admunsen - how she characterizes him as somehow being sneaky or dishonorable simply because he suceeded (on much more limited means) where Scott failed. Her pro-English arrogance shines throughout the book, condenscending to non-Brits if they fail, crying foul if they suceed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Characters Come Alive....","review":"Last month we had a vicious snow storm which dumped 2 feet of snow on Illinois with sub-zero temperature and howling winds. While spending all day scooping snow I kept thinking about early polar explorers. I, like many, had seen the old black and white 50's movie about the Scott party and the PBS series on Scott and Amundsen several years ago. So, I decided to learn more about Robert Scott and ordered the book. I was not disappointed. It was a fascinating character study of the early explorers at the turn of the century. The mental and physical isolation and hardships which Scott and his crew endured is a tale that still haunts me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and honest analysis of Robert Scott' s fatal journey","review":"I previously reviewed this book, and still have the same thoughts. I think Shakelton would have been the one for this journey. Preston brings out the ill prepared journey in graphic and sympathetic terms. I do not, however, quite understand how Scott has reached such a high place in the role of Engligh heros. After all he failed in his attempt, and although courageous it is obvious he was ill suited for this journey. It was another \\"Everest\\" case, rivalry led to the death of these obviously brave men."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Rate, My Bottom!","review":"I found this book to be nothing but a load of tripe. None of the characters were the least bit sympathetic, and, indeed, I was elated when they got what was coming to them. Ms. Preston's revisionist account of recent history is as appalling as it is untrue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roland Huntford's book is much better","review":"...because it provides a comparative perspective. It's hard to see why people like Preston continue apologizing for Scott, an arrogant, clueless man who was out for his own glory and cared little about the safety of his party, scientific results, or any kind of real thinking about how to do things appropriately and get home afterwards. Huntford's biography points out why Scott died on this trip: because he let his ignorance cloud his judgment and shut out information from people who could have helped him. It's really annoying that people still go on glorifying Scott--who didn't make it home and caused the deaths of others who accompanied him."},{"rating":"1","title":"British writer defending British explorer","review":"What a biased load of baloney! Typical British attitude that because he was British, he was the better man even though he screwed up everything he touched, AND was beaten to the pole by Amundsen. Apparently, Amundsen's sins included planning his whole trip with an actual clue about what he was doing, unlike Scott. I don't believe I have ever read a book based on a more ridiculous or indefensible premise. Do yourself a favor, read one of the other accounts of this trip, or even one about Shackleton and the Endurance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight Treatment of a Heavyweight Subject","review":"I have recently discovered the \\"doomed adventure\\" genre, and would have enjoyed this book were it the only one of the genre I read. I felt that the author skimmed over too much detail that, for me, makes these tales so compelling. For instance, how did they cook their food at such high altitude and low temperatures? What did the men back at base camp do all day? Why did Scott insist that one of his colleagues abandon his skis in favor of marching through deep snow and a crevasse-strewn landscape?I realize that she was working with diaries, and was hampered by the fact that the pole party did not survive. Still, some \\"nuts and bolts\\" of the daily processes and challenges faced would have been much more satisfying to me, and perhaps would have shown more in-depth research of this fascinating subject of early polar exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality at a great price","review":"The fit and quality is equal or better than OEM and the adjustment settings go from softer than stock to seriously hard, which let's you dial in bounce control very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored board","review":"This board works great, but the processor that I paid big bucksfor wouldn't work in this board.

They arrived broken and I sent them back. THANK HEAVENS! They were huge, gaudy, and extremely cheap looking. Note to self, do not trust jewelry online! These were truly horrible. The picture is cute and, if they had looked like the picture, I would have been happy. The colors were not true, they looked like costume jewelry from a gumball machine not the quality I expected at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent results","review":"This product arrived in a very timely manner. It dissolves easily and does not have a strong flavor. This is a real bonus since my sister in undergoing chemo and her taste buds REALLY do not like a lot of the protein products we've tried. This product disappears easily into other food or juices without leaving an aftertaste. We're ordering more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than a Ghost","review":"While there's no denying that the author is a gifted writer (in the sense of her verbal dexterity), the plot was too thin and frankly incomprehensible. How did Simon acquire his powers of animism? How did Cameron, the lighthousekeeper go unhinged in the way that he did? How did that little girl get there? Where is everybody going? Which one's real? Which one isn't? The lines between ghosts and human and dream figures was too blurry for me to enjoy.The book's too short! (And maybe 15 pages were devoted to beautiful but baffling diary entries.) Only Simon, the farmer magician was developed as a character. I didn't think I had picked up a blood-curdling horror novel. But I expected a ghost story to give me, at the very least, a few shivers of uneasiness.As it is, it just makes good copy for a travel guide for Scottish lighthouses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really beautiful writing","review":"I love mysteries and supernatural stories which is why I picked this up but I must say I was really impressed with Alice Thompson's style of writing. She is one of the few writers I've come across recently who really know how to summon up the perfect adjective or metaphor. I also appreciated the plot and the suspense and read the book in one evening. The only real flaw is that one of the main characters goes beserk seemingly overnight. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys taught suspense and superb writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a small surprise","review":"A weird, sparse, charming little ghost story. I bought this on a whim someplace (as a fan of such tales), and it's a lovely read. I will point out that the book is rather short, though; so if you're uninterested in spending full cover price for this hard edition, I don't blame you.Pick it up used or, if available, in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thin","review":"It is just too thin.

I did notice that the new silverware I just recently purchased from here felt lighter in the hand than my old stuff that I had gotten approx. 20 years ago, but it's not super noticeable. The pattern is exactly the same and very pretty. I love it. Even being 20 years old you would never guess it. We must've thrown some of the spoons out since I was missing 4 of them and decided to just get a whole new set for 4 people. Amazon shipped it right away and in perfect condition.

It isn't often a gay man finds a story he can really relate to, at least that is how I see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and Overdramatic","review":"I was looking forward to begin this trilogy of White's work. I received the \\"The Farewell Symphony\\" and decided to start from the begining. I found this piece to be overly wordy and over dramatic...I often found myself skipping through the painstaking descriptions White feels necessary for the reader to know. I does appear, however, that he's trying to stretch out the book as to add pages to the novel. It is my hope that the other two novels are less wordy and more to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never have I ever","review":"had a book affect me like this one did. it will seriously get inside of you, and for some reason you just have to read it over and over again. so if you are looking for a book that you can call your \\"all time favorite book\\" give this one a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much","review":"I didn't really like this one. In a way its worth reading as a coming out story and the writing was good enough to keep me reading. But the story...not so much. I found alot of the stuff that happened wierd at best and ridiculous at worst. And the end {bites}. I mean I got to the end and was like...um...ok...? I can't say I regretted reading it but at the same time its not something I need to remember. It jumps around alot, and it lacks valid plot points as far as I'm concerned. But I think its the kind of book you need to make up your own mind about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and disappointing","review":"Not only is the ending a tribute to absolute betrayal, but the entire book goes in circles without ever getting anywhere.Graphic description of feeling, sights,sounds, etc. is wonderful but when it is overused as much as it is in this 'story' it becomes extremely tedious. The entire book is almost one long string of tiring metaphores.The main character starts out confused and ends up hopelessly lost. It is obvious that the main character doesn't have a clue what he really likes or is attracted to. Utter confusion of this magnitude is a very poor way to convey a point.This work is a tragic insult to the entire gay culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"When i stumbled upon this book in the library, i decided that it looked interesting enough to read. As soon as i got home, i read it all the way through, and was not impressed in the least. As i look at everyone elses reviews, i am confounded as to how this book has garnered so much praise. i have no idea why this is considered a classic, or why it is published by Modern Library. It doesn't deserve it. If you want a good book about homosexuality, read Giovanni's room by James Baldwin. Don't waste your time, as I did, on a book that fails even to elevate itself above bad soft-core porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A meaningless trist that finishes in a dead end","review":"I read this novel thinking that it might be a welcome addition to a an avid reader of gay lit.

His cover version of Major Harris' 1975 hit \\"Love Won't Let Me Wait\\" is a great throwback to his early-'70s Stax works--and earns points just for trying. His remake of Billy Joel's \\"She's Got A Way\\" is respectable if innovative while \\"Eye Of The Storm\\" and \\"Let Me Be Your Everything\\" vare quite intersting. The other tracks, unfortunately, are veasily forgettable. All in all, \\"Love Attack\\" has its strengths and moments but sounds dated to some extent."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this review could talk.","review":"If only this bass could talk displays Stanley Clarke's amazing bass playing talent. In the opening track he primarily uses a 12 bar blues tapping line with a chorus effect that is just astonishing. Along with the help of tap dancer Gregory Hines, the duo fulfill the track with a percussive sound that is rarely heard. We hear a similar sound on track 9 on this album. The duo is a great combination, it's almost a shame that more of this album wasn't just the two of them jamming it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINGER LICKIN' GOOD!","review":"Stanley Clarke makes his guitar sing sweetly and he makes it seem effortless. Gregory Hines steps in literally and taps out a beat as he and Stanley trade off in the title cut. That leads into a powerful \\"Goodbye pork pie hat\\".

It's interesting that it's ok for her mother's loved man to try and kill her but it's not so ok for her to kill him in self-defense.2. The usual, power goes to head of young person who is not equipped to deal with massive amounts of power, plot is truly a pain.3. The, \\"let's strip the main character of everything she loves in life\\" plot device gets tired, FAST.4. Jenna is just irritating...period.5. Jenna's mom is amazingly self-centered, kind of brings a bad name to mothers in general.6. Book doesn't seem to have much going on except for lots of betrayal and gore.I'd say, save your money. Except that a large number of people seem to go in for this type of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Developing Vocabulary Skills","review":"I found this book extremely well planned and easy to use. Whether the individual is using it or it is being used by a teacher/tutor, it is a great resource. The format of breaking the vocabulary down into the category of words is helpful. For example, one chapter focuses on noun suffixes, which describes those words that are always nouns with those endings. The word is later reviewed in the adjective suffix section. This enables the student to see that the same words can be used in a number of different ways. It is irrelevant if you are not familiar with what the category of the words are called, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.; it is all explained. Rather than just a list of words to memorize it gives you a strategy to learn to use all the words you may encounter. This book can be a resource for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful Fingers...","review":"If you are just starting with woodcarving or even if you have been doing it for years, be kind to your fingers.

Once the recording is finished, plug in the USB and use the explorer to drag-n-drop the files onto the computer. i can also delte files from the player using explorer. nothing could be easier.the only problem i have is that it sucks the life out of batteries very quickly. i highly recommend rechargeables.as for the other stuff, i wouldnt use it as my regular MP3 player because it is very small, the buttons are not that intuitive, and 512 MB is really nothing to get excited about. spend a few more dollars and get more storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent player","review":"I just bought this tonight.On my XP system, works great.

I have no idea how long these last, tho.I'm upgrading from a CD-based MP3 player, and I use this primarily to listen to voice files, so my expectations/ demands are not great. But all said, this is a good buy.One thing, MS Explorer doesn't do complete file management; for instance you cannot check \\"disk\\" for errors, size, fragmentation, etc. SO this bodes for possible problems down the line if/when file errors develop on the chip.All n' all, glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A damn fine read","review":"If you're a runner, this book is a must read. Mainly because no matter who you are or where you run, you'll know someone who fits one of the characters. And that makes it fun.

Part of the problem is false advertising. While most of this was recorded at the Greek Theatre in 1986, some of it was from the Mountain View Music Theatre in northern California.I give it two stars only because it does capture the feel of a Diamond concert just a bit. Still, other than, I am I Said, Cherry Cherry, and Hello Again, the songs are simply butchered. To make it worse, the album is poorly mixed.If you want later Diamond live material, checi out \\"Greatest Hits 1966-1992, or Stages. Avoid \\"Live From America\\" like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it is fun","review":"I'm a fan so don't hate on me, but this is so bad it is fun. Listen to September Morn and if you are a fan, I promise you a cringe. It use to be that Diamond would put one bad song on each album so you wouldn't take him for granted; now we get one good song.

Sometime in the late 80's he stopped singing most of his songs and started to talk or yell the most important lyrics. It was like he last all tone and rythm. I grew up being rocked to sleep as a young child to the original Hot August Night, but this album still gives me nightmares. Every couple of years I put in in the CD player just to give it another try and it always goes back on the shelf, replaced by the original. This album includes his great late 70's/early 80's songs, but they are butchered, much like his other classics. Having seen him in concert no less than 10 times, each live show is so different, sometimes smooth and classy, other times like this album indifferent, out of tune and careless. It just give rise to the question did the age, number of live shows catch up with him in the 80's?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the one.","review":"Although Neil Diamond has some other fantastic CDs, this one does not fall into that category.

He is quite a performer, and this live concert album is just like being there. The orchestra sounds great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love you Neil, But...","review":"this was awful. The acoustics were terrible, the band was below average and Neil Diamond ended up screaming most of the words to his songs. Even a haunting, beautiful melody like \\"Love on the Rocks\\" was tortured by Diamond and the band. It seemed like this was an excuse to have a sequel to \\"Hot August Night\\" (which was superb), but it fell flat. If you are a Neil Diamond fan you will be disappointed. I know I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album for old-time and novice Diamond fans.","review":"This is a fun record to listen to. It contains a lot of Neil's hits (America, Sweet Caroline, You Don't Bring Me Flowers, etc.) along with a couple of lesser known songs. It's his ability to keep the old songs sounding fresh and energized that makes the CD such a pleasure to experience. If you liked his studio versions of his work, you will enjoy these live cuts as well. It may never be as popular as the original Hot August Night album, but it is a must for any Diamond fan. It is an excellent starter CD for the newcomers to the Diamond fan club, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!","review":"Save your money - this is a WASTE! I couldn't even listen to the entire CD. As a Neil Diamond fan from way back, and someone who had the original \\"Hot August Night\\" on tape, I thought this would be all the old greats. Also, the first one was a fun \\"live\\" performance. I think if I had been in the audience for this concert I would have left. Not one song sounds like the original.

This man doesn't seem to have failures. He did get a bit raucous sometimes, hence my not giving a five star rating. However, he may have been driven by a little over-enthusiasm. I really purchased this to hear him sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and it was well worth it. I also enjoyed his professional introduction to the song.

The word was later mispronounced and gave birth in the 1930's to the modern day philosophy of Wicca (Thanks to Scotman Gerald Gardner).Wicca writers, especially those simply pumping out titles, should stay away...far away from the celtic religions.

Even the word \\"Wicca\\" itself is believed to be a fabrication. McCoy is aiming at the Irish-American market with lies.

Potatoes are -not- native to Ireland: they came to Europe with the Conquistadores from their colonization excursions in South America. They were not widely eaten in Europe until the 17th century, because they were considered poisonous. They were not widely planted as a food crop in Ireland until the end of the 17th century, and they did not become a staple food until the 18th century.The 18th century, while it was a long time ago, hardly qualifies as ancient.Oh, and by then, the Irish were all converts to that \\"new\\" religion, Christianity. Not many Goddesses in Christianity, now, are there?

There is plently of literature about the history and archaeology of Ireland (Pre-Christian Ireland and The History of Ireland).

The Banishing pentagram is always drawn in a counter clockwise direction. \\" This is obviously tradition specific because in my tradition those Pentagrams are right based on the concept that the top point is spirit, so coming from spirit is Invoking, going to spirit is Banishing.

I know I am a little late reading this book but it was a must read on my list. Craig's writing style is really what makes his books so attractive. Craig is very experienced and wise but that does not always translate into a great book. Chazown is all about discovering the vision for your life and for you church, ministry, or business. It is a great book to read whether you need a refresher on vision or you are simply lost and need direction. Craig writes this book from his life experiences in college and starting a church from scratch. He is not afraid to be brutally honest and speak of his failures and lack vision at times. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is refreshing to see someone who is so transparent in his writing. Chazown will upstart or refresh this vision and drive for your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chazown","review":"Chazown is a challenging book written by Craig Groeschel. The beginning is a little slow to start but overall, it is worth the time to read. I thought his insight into the calling that God has on your life was important and refreshing. I found it hard to sit down a read the entire thing at once. I read a chapter at a time and I enjoyed it.I would recommend this book to others. In fact, my husband is reading this book right now. I have read a couple of books by this author and I have been impressed by each of his writings.

When it arrived, I put aside what I was working on, and dug right in. The topic of personal vision and how to find it is not unfamiliar, which is perhaps why I found the material cliched and not up to par with his original thinking from previous books.Reviewers seem to be mixed on Chazown, depending, it seems to me, on whether they had done much reading on the topic. If it was new, and you were seeking, this fit the bill; if wasn't, it was old hat.For those looking for some guidance and some passion, Groeschel will be a good guide for the beaten path, but not a trailblazer.FTC Disclaimer: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Not Sure What the Big Deal Is","review":"After reading the first several chapters, I put the book down and haven't gone back to it. There's nothing wrong with the author's ideas per se, but there's also nothing particularly earth-shaking. Groeschel has a strong grasp of the obvious - God made you unique, he has special plans for your life, etc. That's all fine - but I found myself saying, \\"O.K., so...? Where's the so-called different way to see my life?\\" The book is just a gimmicky repackaging of fairly obvious, common principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Wisdom","review":"I recently read Chazown and was thoroughly impressed with the theologically practicality.

If you are looking to discover your God-given \\"Chazown\\" then this book is for you! There are also great online tools once you are done reading the book to help you discover and bring out your Chazown.

Why do people have to pull down those who have vision and ambition? And not just in the inner city I'm afraid. There is an anti-intellectual, anti-learning, anti-caring about anything climate nationwide. This book just reveals it to us more than we like to admit to ourselves. Then I felt angry to read of the airheadedness and political indoctrination at Brown University. He (the young man who was the subject of this book) poured his heart and soul into \\"making it\\" and was \\"it\\" worth it? All in all, it was a good read. Well written and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civics book review","review":"This book is about a young man named Cedric Jenings, who was striving for success. The book is non-fiction. It is based on a true story that grew out of a series of articles written by the author. Cedric, the book's protagonist, had a rough childhood because his father was not around. On top of that, he went to a really bad school. Cedric went to a school where most of the kids did not care about getting good grades or doing well. Cedric was one of the few students who earned honors and really cared about his grades. However, Cedric had to pay a price for doing well in school. He was teased mercilessly. For instance, after he received recognition for academic honors during a school award assembly, he was booed and called a geek. The only thing that wouold keep Cedric going was the motivation from his loving mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserving of a Pulitzer?","review":"My only real compliant with this book is why does it take a white reporter for the Wall Street Journal for this story to be acceptable and validated? I know plenty of students from the inner-city who defy the odds on a daily basis (I am one of those students myself) and it bothers me that it is not until a white person writes this story that our voices get heard. I am sure that there are folks that will argue that at least our stories are getting told and we should be grateful. However, I am concerned about the invisibility of poor and minority folks from the inner city and the politics involved in journalism. Had this story been written by a person of color would it have garnered the same type of public attention? I sincerely doubt it. I applaud Cedric and all of his hard work and dedication. I am just not convinced that Suskind is deserving of a Pulitzer Prize...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A South Africa in America!","review":"This book has revealed many concealed events about America to me. I am a South African, and I have lived with many American kids in South Africa, both white and African-American kids. I was always told by my peers on how perfect America was. A hope in the unseen has revealed many secretes to me, through this book I have learned that all countries have similar social problems, except that some are smarter than the others in concealing their shames. After reading this book, I have started to look at America with a different eye.

This book was very interesting to read. I liked it a lot. It will catch the interests of readers of all ages. It is about a boy who grew up in an Inner City neighborhood and how he was able to defeat all odds and go to an Ivy League school. The challenges he went through and had to overcome were great, but it made the happy ending so much better. I reccomend this book to everyone who loves a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A great book! I read it cover to cover in a day, it was compelling.

I too attended Ballou High School about 15 years before Cedric Jennings. The school was rough, but nothing compared to what Cedric described and survived. I highly recommend this book to every inner city teenager as encouragement and as testimony of what faith is really all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful testimony","review":"Ron Suskind's brilliant narration of a young boy's journey into higher, ivy-league education sheds insight into one of the most controversial education debates of today. Suskind does not offer up any answers to how to solve the problem of troubled inner-city schools and whether or not affirmative action is fair and/or effective, but simply weaves together the story of what it is like for Cedric to grow up, and be educated, in one of the country's worst public schools. This book reads like a work of fiction, and pulls you into Cedric and his family's world in Washington DC and beyond. An incredibly inspiring story that challenges the current discussions on how to improve the educational system, sheds light on how even resident's of the nation's capitol often are behind the rest of the country in being able to achieve their goals and dreams.A wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of sheer human perserverence","review":"I am a freshman at a small liberal arts school, and this book was given to me by the school as a common reading experience for the entire entering class. The book presented many facets of life that I have never known, and probably never will; however, this true account of Cedric's life brings to the forefront what is lacking in today's public schools; congruence. But despite the lack of congruence, Cedric, through his own will and determination, found a way to succeed.This book was an amazing eye-opener to me as it presented me with how many different lives people have, and how hard it actually is to melt everyone into one pot. This book; however, shows that it can be done, and it can possibly give hope to people that don't think that they can quite make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required Reading","review":"It was required for me to read this for college.

It's easy for \\"people like us\\" to think that we can level the playing field by spending a little more money and making a little more effort; the story of Cedric Jennings shows us how far America has to go. The author stays out of the story, describing intimate, sometimes harrowing scenes between mother and son, student and roommate, in an effortless way that never betrays the feelings of the subjects, and never betrays the enormous, painstaking care that went in to this sort of up-close reporting. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Story","review":"This was easily one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. A well-written, inspirational story of a courageous, driven young man (and his mother) who refused to be held back by his circumstances. Would that all young people in his situation were as focused, brave and driven to succeed as Cedric. This book should be required reading for every student in junior high school. It moved me to tears no less than four times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hope in th Unseen Review","review":"I really enjoyed this book and reading about the life of Cedric. In many ways I could relate to Cedric, having the experience of attending a D.C. public school and being an a single-parent household stuggling from paycheck to paycheck. I liked being able to recognize street manes and places in the book. It was if I was there with him and actually was understanding what he was going through. But I guess I didn't have it as bad as Cedric in that I eventually recieved a scholarship to attend a D.C. private school. I think this is a must read for anybody and everybody. this book tells about the terrible situation of the D.C. public schools along with telling the plight of many of these D.C. residents living on the other side of the Anacostia river that are forgotten. This book truly brings these situations to light. Hopefully this book won't just be read and put down but people will go out and make a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Find","review":"Rarely does one find a writer that tells a story so simply and compelling. From the start the reader is drawn into Cedric's world. This is not a black boy's world but a child's/adolescent's world. Suskind tells Cedric's story with detachment yet interest. From the start I needed to know how Cedric faired. I recounted my freshman college days with glee."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriquing Odyssey","review":"\\"A Hope in the Unseen\\" is an accurate portrayal of Cedric Jenning's struggle to succeed despite the poor education that he received at Ballou High School in Washington, DC. I believe Ron Suskind did an amazing job recounting Cedric's emotions throughout his experiences in high school, at the MIT MITES program, and at Brown University, especially since he never actually asked Cedric exactly how he was feeling at these particular moments. Reading this book was an eye-opening experience that made me realize the importance of drive and persistance and taught me that when you put your mind to something, you can accomplish anything, despite the obstacles put in your path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad journalism","review":"This truly is terrible journalism. For one, Ron Suskind never even alludes to the fact that he was following Cedric around through all these experiences and sitting in the corner of his dorm room watching him and taking notes. Secondly, he doesn't even muse what kind of effect this could have had on Cedric's actions and the story itself. Suskind clearly had a vision of what he wanted this book to be when he set out to write it and wasn't going to let facts get in the way of that. It is a real travesty that he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for this piece of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hope in the Unseen: An American Odyssey from the Inner City to the Ivy League","review":"I was not happy with this orders, Bluewater.

It is an inspirational story of perserverance and endurance. It is one of the best books that I have read, and gives a clearer picture of the struggle it takes for teens and young adults to find themselves and their place. I am a teenager, and this book has helped me to gain a better understanding of myself and my possibilities.

I must admit that I do not identify with the Mods but I can identify with the angst and frustrations of the young man portrayed here. Pete's songs are timeless and not many groups today can put together an album such as this. Entwistle and Moon have never sounded better than this and Daltrey has developed into one of the finest vocalists in rock. This CD is a rewarding experience and the sound thunders out of the speakers. Too many great songs here to list highlights. If you are looking to by a Who CD, buy Who's Next first, and Quadrophenia second.

This is a noble project taken as a hisory and homage to the Mod phenom of the 60s but it was a little much to also try to pass it as somehow biographical of the four band members (John Entwhistle as \\"romantic\\"?). Still, it contains some of Entwhistle and Daltrey's best work, not to mention the last good showing from Moon. The synthesizers work great on the instrumentals but otherwise we seem to be awash in a synthesized sea. (This could explain their absence on \\"By Numbers\\".) This album has held up better over time than I thought it would as demonstrated by the magnificent 1997 Summer tour rendition. (Hint: Why no album from said tour? The band was in much better form than the old \\"Tommy\\" tour.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Is It? I'll Take It.","review":"Wow! After Tommy and Who's Next, there was almost nowhere but down for the next Who album. But, instead of playing it safe, the band actually tries to outdo Tommy, with another so-called \\"Rock Opera\\" and two-record set. And they come sooooo close.Quadrophenia marks the end of an incredible run of Who genius, from Tommy to Who's Next to Quadrophenia. If I had to pick just one to take to that proverbial desert island, I'd sneak all three aboard.Completely different than Who's Next, and nothing like Tommy, Quadrophenia instead breaks new ground with four separate and distinct sides of music reflecting four different personalities. The result, from \\"The Real Me,\\" to \\"Had Enough\\" to \\"5:15\\" to \\"Dr. Jimmy\\" is just incredible. This album would be any other band's crowning achievement. Instead, it's \\"just\\" their third straight 5 star album. And that's only because there aren't 6 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"O melhor disco de todos os tempos!","review":"\\"Quadrophenia\\" mostra que The Who no apenas era a melhor banda de rock do mundo à época, mas, precisamente, a melhor banda de rock que o mundo já teve ou terá. Canes como \\"The Real Me\\", \\"5:15\\", \\"I'm One\\" e \\"Quadrophenia\\" so simplesmente geniais, comparáveis às melhores criaes de Mozart. O instrumental é poderosíssimo: as guitarras de Pete Townshend rugem, os vocais de Roger Daltrey o mostram no topo de sua forma e a cozinha formada por Keith Moon e John Entwistle é a melhor da história do rock. Eu, que, à exemplo de um sem número de infelizes brasileiros, nunca pude conferir The Who ou mesmo Pete Townshend ao vivo, sinto-me feliz apenas quando ouo dos primeiros acordes de \\"I Am the Sea\\" aos últimos de \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor value.","review":"Over $100 for this? a) Only some of the tracks are 5.1. b) No Who demos, all Pete. No Who outtakes. No Who alternate versions. c) Some of the demos have added (redone) drums. d) No extra live stuff either. e) The 5.1 mixes aren't even that great. Tommy was much better. More immersive, more \\"powerful\\". Shame. Even if we would have just gotten the whole thing as 5.1 I would have been happy. But no. This is a half effort ... and for over $100.

A double CD which unlike most other double CDs, consistently showcases the Who at their hard rocking best from one track to the next. Musically, Townsend's guitar and Daltrey's vocals are in top form, with most tracks being the stuff of a \\"greatest hits package\\". Lyrically, Townsend's songwriting explores the pain, confusion, and feelings of betrayal experienced by a neurotic adolescent trying desperately to fit in with his peer group, ultimately to no avail. Just don't expect the main protagonist of this work to \\"live happily ever after\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who's greatest album showcases Townsend's talents.","review":"Who fans have been enjoying this album for decades, and rightly so with the intricate weavings of the musical score that seem to be constantly interconnecting providing the listener with a depth in musical recording that is rare in this day of pop hits. The song Quadrophenia will blow you away and I deem it worthy of being the Who's finest instrumental material with four themes introduced separately and then woven together like only the masterful Pete Townsend can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?????","review":"I agree with the other reviews that this remaster is the pits! It's been 30 years since I listen to the original Quadrophenia on vinyl and I wish I had let those memories alone. Maybe in a nod to their fallen band mates, Keith and John's parts are relegated to the background in the mix. While the raw aggression of the original recording remains on some tracks the overall effort is a bomb. Love the songs but this remaster SUCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who's Best Masterpiece!!","review":"I recently purchased Quadraphenia without hearing it except 2 songs-The Real Me and Love Reign O'er Me. It is the best rock opera that Pete Townshend penned. The instrumental Quardraphenia is of many musical highlights. So is Doctor Jimmy. Keith Moon was at his peak as a drummer. After this album their other releases were good but could never measure up to this masterpiece.

Highlights include (well actually the whole album is a highlight) Had Enough and Doctor Jimmy both of which contain many themes. At times it sounds very heavy, folkish and even classical.

Contrary to the Amazon description this is NOT a digitally remastered version of the classic LP album. It is exactly the same as the last edition of the double LP by Track records (which I have) and contains NO new material and sounds the same. The large photo book that comes with the album is GLUED to the inside of the record jacket, not loose like the original issue. To add to the insult, there is an annoying number of pops on the record: so much for quality control on these reissued albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best concept album ever","review":"Some people seem to think that angst in music begun with Nirvana.

Though it lacks the consistency of earlier (and some later) efforts by the Who, it more than makes up for it in quality.

It has pure classic rock songs like The Real Me, The Punk And The Godfather, and Doctor Jimmy. Then it has laid back songs like Cut My Hair,I'm One, and Sea And Sand. Then it has powerful songs like 5:15 and Love Reign O'er Me. It also has the two instrumental songs, Quadrophenia and The Rock, that are awesome without words anyway. It's just a great CD and a must have if your a real Who fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Then Original Recording is Better!

I didn't enjoy the remastered version. The original soared and roared. Moon was great on lead drums; John Entwisle simply was the best ever-Bass player.

Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend are currently touring this album (as of Jan. 2013) and I highly suggest seeing it!

This album is a perfect example of why everyone should listen to The Who!\\"Is it me, for a moment?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Could And Should Have Been Better","review":"First time I heard this album was in 1980 and thus became the soundtrack of my teen years and young adult life. So when I discovered Quadrophenia was getting the box treatment, I was moderately excited at this release though proceeded with caution. Took a chance and purchased the director's cut on Amazon and upon listening was terribly dissapointed. No where in sight was the OG 1973 mix. The demo discs had Pete add drums played by some unknown to his beautiful demo recordings. Why, who knows. Doesn't add anything. If not taking the time to remaster the OG 73 mix (or at least presenting the entire 96 mix in 5.1) at least a complete live performance from 73, warts and all, could have been considered. Packaging was OK but overpriced considering the Floyd immersion sets are a little nicer and much cheaper. 2 stars for the music, but could easily have been 4 if more considerate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Value for the $$$","review":"I would have bought this set in a second if it had included a full version of the album in 5.1.

It's lost it's edge!!!","review":"If this is the same recording as being sold online, it is no where near the original. If you could somehow remaster something for \\"political correctness\\" this is what you would get. The original Quadrophenia was a reflection of an age in turmoil. Where drugs,death were common and young people questioned those in authority and their values. This \\"remaster\\" has removed the artists original with sanitized copy. If you ever heard Quadrophenia on vinal, this isn't even close. What has been done in remastering is akin to letting a four year old mark up one of the \\"masters\\" paintings with colored markers. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the most overrated albums in the history of rock and roll!","review":"Let me begin by stating that I LOVE THE WHO!

The first album I heard by this band was Whos next followed by Tommy, so when I heard about this double album I was beyond excited. coming after those to amazing records this was a huge letdown. First off all the songs sound so damn similar (wich would be ok if that song was great) but thats not the case here.

They died with Keith Moon. Everything else Townsend has released under their name since then has been a cheap imitation culminating with that pathetic Super Bowl performance. When it first came out Quadrophenia was an album that the critics hated - especially Daltry's vocals, but I sort of liked. My main criticism was that there was not enough good material for one album - let alone two. Then after Keith died the Who released The Kids are Alright and the Quadrophenia movie. Of course the movie came with yet another soundtrack. All of the sudden this was classic Who. Now Townsend is looking to cash in one more time by further padding this album with demos? How many times do you go to the well. I'm sure he will want to do a Quadrophenia tour now. Rip off. If you want to hear and see the Who in all of their glory buy the Isle of Wright video from the early 70s'. Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Husband hates it","review":"Bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves 'Who Are You' and other Who songs. He said it is the worst cd.

Who's Next is timeless, Who By Numbers is timeless, Live at Leed's may be THE best Live album EVER, but Quadrophenia is THE absolutely required Who audio experience. All of the aggressiveness, raw energy, spirited composing, and flawless execution is evident in the genius of Pete Townshend on this effort (notice how i twice resisted the use of ALBUM as not to show my age?).I know that this is completely a puff for the Who, but i've owned this album as a double album, a cassette and the remastered version on CD, and the sound is absolutely incredible, the songs written in 1972-3 still stand (as does everything from Live at Leeds on) and sound timeless, like they could have been recorded yesterday (or today).Buy it, you won't be sorry, and if you are, listen to it again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"I thought it was the entire album.

Save your money and listen to the Quadrophenia album on YouTube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Townsend's Masterpiece","review":"Quadrophenia is consistently overlooked in discussions of the greatest rock albums--I still haven't figured out why. I ignored this album myself for quite some time, dismissing it as inferior to \\"Tommy\\" or \\"Who's Next\\". After further listening, I can't stand by that statement any longer--this album (IMHO) gets top honors for The Who. \\"Quadrophenia\\" is probably the last great British rock album before punk, and finds the band in peak form. Considering its thematic material (teenage angst and lonliness) provided the entire grunge movement a reference point, it's importance cannot be overstated. As time goes on, \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Who's Next\\" will fall out of focus, and \\"Quadrophenia\\" will most likely be hailed as The Who's greatest gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you ever feel lonely or out of place..here you are","review":"This first song I ever heard from Quadrophenia was 5:15, and frankly, it blew me away. I searched online for people that knew or owned the album and was very much suprised by the large amount I found. I remember one that sticks out in my mind, which a person said \\"When you listen to this album, and I mean really listen, you have to do it all at once, or it loses effect\\" and I made a vow not to listen to another song...so when I bought this album I sat down and spent most likely the most valuable 80 minutes ever listening to music.

It is obvious that by this point in his career, songwriter Pete Townshend had reached a sort of creative overdrive (which he would gear down considerably on the band's next album, \\"The Who by Numbers\\"). Nevertheless, there are a lot of tremendous performances on this record. It climaxes with \\"Love Reign o'er Me,\\" one of the finest ever vocal performances by lead singer Roger Daltrey. Not as good as \\"Tommy,\\" but still very much worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat your ears to the amazing and the thrilling Quadropheni","review":"This album is so extraordinary that it can't be totally understood on the first listen. Pete Townsend mixes every type of music from the time and the final result is perhaps the best album of the seventies. Don't hesitate on buying this selection, your ears will thank you as you literally feel the sound of the sea in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"No live set, same '96 mix=ripoff","review":"The best reissues---Pavement, REM come to mind--offer a remaster of the original album, b-sides, unused tracks, and a live set from the era. If any record deserves this, it's 'Quadrophenia'. The band was at its live peak. There's no official Who live album between 'Live at Leeds' and the horrorshow of 'Who's Last', so a Quad tour set would have helped the band's diminishing legacy, and made this box set worth it. The demos are good, but some have seen release on 'Scoop' and soundtrack albums. There's no unreleased full band track, no live set, no remaster. Who's running The Who's release projects and legacy? Even Courtney Love would do a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album.","review":"I'm sometimes hard-pressed to name my favorite bands, but one group I can always put at (or near) the top of the list is The Who, with \\"Quadrophenia\\" definately qualifying as my favorite album ever.What really makes this album for me is the ability to identify with what Pete Towshend is writing. One only needs to look at the lyrics for \\"I'm One\\", his greatest piece, to see how this album will resonate with generations of put-off tenns and young adults. Jimmy is complaining how, once again, he's the outcast kid with no real friends, just like last year, and wonders how the clothes can really make the Mods. Between this song and \\"Cut My Hair\\", Townshend really nails what alot of us were (or are) thinking.In this age where almost every new \\"rock\\" group likes to think they're different by singing about how much their parents hate them, and that they're different, it could help to look back on this album and realize that The Who were singing about it over 30 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece","review":"This is, in my opinion,is The Who's finest work!The music is a rock n' roll symphony and the words are modern poetry in motion.My hats off to Peter Townsend!The performances by Roger,Keith,John and Peter are astounding.Long live Rock n'Roll!This body of work is to be listened to from beginning to end.It truely is an amazing journey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Schizophrenic?

If you have never heard this album, be warned: this album will blow you away, and it has the power to change your life.

The new remaster absolutely sounds cleaner to me than any other version of Quadrophenia, particularly the bass and drums. Yes, the guitars and keyboards are not as prominent, but that may be partially because the rhythm section was never this clear before. I have to hope that since Pete signed off on this, it's the way he envisioned it. After all, his instruments are the ones seemingly lower in the mix.As for not using the original vinyl mix as originally announced, there's a post on Amazon UK's page for this item which states that Jon Astley, who coordinated the remaster, found those tapes to be sonically unacceptable when compared to the 1996 CD masters. The decision was therefore made to polish the latter for the re-release. I leave it to others to debate the technical aspects of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beach is a place where a man can feel.....","review":"While there's a lot of Tommy fanatics out there...and Who's Next is also at the top of most lists, for pure passion and just solid music, to me nothing beats this album.

I felt that the lyrics spoke directly to me with all their angst and questions about life and the future. I had my problems with hooligans in the area, girls, school and my parents. Its hard to nail down any one song that did it for me.Pete Townshend has always been a thinking mans rock muscian. His lyrics and music have always pushed the inside of the envelope out.

NO, I am so glad Ihave the Mobile Fidelity version which uses a first generation tape from Pete Townsend own collection.If you think it's worth it, you must be a real die hard Who fanGive us the music not all these little trinkets, they said only eight of the songs were available for the 5.1 sound, sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"SACD only","review":"I'm not reviewing the importance of this recording in rock music's history.

It is not a mainstream movie by any means, as it includes a midget King, his oversexed Queen, and topless princess with a whip as well as Danny Elfman as Satan doing his best imitation of Cab Calloway (with Oingo Boingo as his backup band). If you have already seen this, what are you waiting for? If you haven't, same question!

The music of Danny Elfman and the acting of the entire cast were great. I lent a copy to a friend and it was lent to one of her friends and I had to buy another copy. This copy is in color which was well done. Campy, cult, comedy, musical, some nudity and adult content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't replace it - strap it","review":"The hold down latch on my charger broke, and after reading the experiences of other people, I decided not to replace my charger. Instead, I made a strap out of two 1/4 inch wide tie wraps to see if strapping the top plunger down would work. The strap worked perfectly. I then made a more permanent strap out of narrow nylon strapping. Simply hold the plunger down, slip the strap around the whole unit, and clean and charge the shaver. This is a cheap and simple fix that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so hard to find?","review":"Ditto on the lock down mechanism. That's why I'm buying this. In fact, I had trouble finding where to buy this. If it is indeed NOT built to last, this base unit should be more readily available.In trying to get the original one to work again, I believe I freed a spring that was malfunctioning, preventing the arm to stay locked down. I can use the original still for cleaning, manually pulling the arm out of the razor end, but I somehow also broke the connection which allows the razor to recharge while connected so here I am buying a new base.If you're reading this, you probably already have this razor, your base broke, and you're looking for a replacement so none of this should sound unfamiliar to you. What I would recommend is bookmarking this page because a year or so from now, if still using the razor, you'll probably have to order this again because it's definitely not built to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaning Base not Worth the Price","review":"As others have written, I have now had my cleaning base break three (3) times. The first two times were under warranty, and I \\"only\\" had to pay an extra $10 each time to have it shipped to a repair facility. The third time is out of warranty, and Braun Customer Service is telling me they are unwilling to do anything for me. Very disappointing for a Braun product that obviously has a design flaw. You won't find me buying a replacement for a product manufactured poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean and Charge Replacement","review":"For those of you that have a broken arm that will not lock down, Shaveroutlet has just the top part (Just the arm) for $16.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Cheap Manufacturing","review":"I bought this charger (with the shaver) and it broke within three weeks of purchase. I took it apart and fixed it, but it just kept on breaking. Take the other reviewers advice and just use a large rubber band or strap to hold down this poorly designed charger. For such an expensive item, I was amazed at how badly this was designed and how horribly unreliable the mechanisms turned out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but fragile","review":"I like the overall idea of the system, and the razor itself works well. However, the base wears quickly. The latch holding down the charging arm breaks in a year or so of use. Given how expensive replacing this is, I'd expect it to last a much longer time. Say, for the average life of the razor itself. Problem is, the latch is made of soft plastic when it should be made of either a hard plastic or a metal. If buying a new razor, go with one that doesn't have a push down arm on the cleaner base."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd time.....and I'm done","review":"Yep, the charging handle broke again.....so this would be my third replacement.....I was hoping to see a price drop, considering my razor is now 10 years old. But then again, why would Braun sabotage a perfect system of ripping of the customer. You pay out the nose for a great razor....$200 + when I got mine. Well, I guess since the razor will last forever, Braun will just gauge us $70 a pop from here to eternity. So you're essentially buying a new razor every 6 years, since these things only last about 2 years. From now on, like my grandfather used to do....straight edgde. I'll use the Braun when I travel and clean it manually. Braun can kiss by behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALERT: D E F E C T I V E P R O D U C T","review":"The Braun 7000 shaver is a great shaver, however the clean & charge base unit is defective as you can see from all the reviews.Like everyone else, the base unit spring mechanism stopped functioning after 2 months which left me jury-rigging an elastic band around the unit to hold the spring mechanism down.Save your money and use a spray-on foil cleaner if it breaks and don't buy one even if you feel lucky...well do you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Don't buy it!!!

The cartridge must be ordered separately at an additional cost of close to $12. This seems pretty high considering the base itself is almost $50.Worst part is, no prompt comes up saying that the cleaner cartridge is a product to be purchased at this time. So you get the $50 unit, open it, see a gaping hole in the bottom and then have to figure out if the cleaner cartridge was just not included by error or to be purchased separately.$50 for just the base, although it works, is not good value because it cannot \\"clean\\" as the title infers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product matched picture","review":"Just wanted to add a quick note to clarify description, you only get one of these even though the product description states \\"packed 10 per carton\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they break","review":"I've had about 6 pairs of these over-glasses sunglasses.

Until this record, I had found them very good, but at the time, thought U2 was so much better. This record changed my mind. This is the best album that I bought in the late 80's. It is full of passion, anger, angst, and wonderfully crafted musical hooks. This is what all people should strive to accomplish at least once in their lives---- incorporate a deeply rooted set of beliefs into a work of art. Looking back at this album ten years later, it has lost none of it's value.

With an incredible presence and his cutting voice, this last brings an awesome punk/heavy-metal touch to the songwriting!Included in the great Oil's period (1982-90), this album is on my mind one of their best release at that day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic and energetic---what rock should be.","review":"Though this lead singer is (by conventional vocal standards) horrible, this is a GOOD rock band. These songs sizzle with intensity, the guitar parts are beautifully crafted, and the grooves are second to none.

If you're a fan of great, intense, burning radio-rock, you'll love this album ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Oils' Most Popular Album","review":"\\"Diesel and Dust\\" marked the peak of popularity for Australian troubadors Midnight Oil (in America, anyway). The single \\"Beds are Burning\\" was staple on American rock radio in the late 1980s, which is interesting since a close listen to the lyrics will reveal that the song is about Aboriginal land rights, not exactly the kind of topic that normally inspires large sales. The fact is, the song's fantastic hook is what sold it. That is also true on the rest of the album, especially on tracks like \\"The Dead Heart\\" (the follow up single to \\"Beds\\"), \\"Warakurna,\\" \\"Sometimes,\\" amd \\"Bullroarer.\\" The rest of the songs fill in well among the highlights.Overall, Midnight Oil had the talent to become the Australian U2 had they toned down the (leftist) politics in their lyrics and concentrated instead on the musical side of things. Even so, this is still an excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"Good on first listen, great by the third. A band with passion and conscience. Highly recommended.

Like Marvin, Midnight Oil were also able to sing political songs without them sounding like textbooks (listen to \\"The Dead Heart,\\" one of the catchiest songs ever). In fact, this album was SOOO strong, when I saw them in concert for the \\"Blue Sky Mine\\" album (another classic), they played every single song from \\"Diesel and Dust!\\" Still a great album to listen to in the summertime, on a road trip, where the heat can make pontificate over these amazing lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible passionate story!","review":"This book touched my soul and made want to keep reading and reading..

At times it is even evident that some members of the audience are having conversations. And then American audiences are so ill bred. They never wait for the music to finish before they start applauding, drowning out completely the last minute. To top it all the recording engineer seems to love applause, because he never fades it out, but keeps recording until it dies down by itself. As if the listener would be more fascinated by applause than by the music itself.My advice to prospective buyers is to stay away from this one.

Their shared interest in bluegrass and acoustic string-band music has produced some very fine modern bluegrass, with the requisite mandolin and fiddle playing set against acoustic bass. What sets this threesome apart from Alison Krauss, Nickle Creek and others exploring the same contemporary ground are the dream-time tempos of their original ballads, and the contemplative introspection of their vocals and harmonies. Engineer Gary Paczosa (Alison Krauss, Dolly Parton, Nickle Creek) captured the acoustic picking and the intertwined harmonies with tremendous clarity, bringing The Greencards' charms right into your living room.

My main complaint is that she only works one side of the body. Jillian starts all her moves on the left leg throughout all three workouts. She doesn't reverse the move to start with the right leg. So if you want a balanced workout you need to remember to alternate legs yourself OR redo each workout using the other side of the body.

Take the tutorial at the beginning and your good to go.If you are a beginner (especially with any form of martial arts, tybo, etc) than this is fun, good work out.If you are intermediate or advanced, it can be a fun quick work out if you don't have time to do a longer one and still want to kick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, fun, sweat","review":"If you like Jillian and want a quick calorie burn this workout is the one. The kicking is fun and easy to modify for beginners or advanced users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work out!!!","review":"Does exactly what she says it will... Burns your muscle good workout... you will enjoy this very much 2 Thumbs up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Flirty","review":"This DVD is much more fun and cutesy than the shredding videos. A lot of high kicks and some difficult combinations. Not as much upper body and abs as the shredding. It's, understandably, a lot of kicking and punching and twisting. good to get the anger out! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard workout","review":"First Jillian workout. Since I love kickboxing routines tried this one. Love it!!!! Very hard!!!! I am always pouring sweat after finishing these 20 minute wourlouts. I always feel the burn afterwards too!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a 20 min workout","review":"Unlike some of her other workouts (ahem, 30 day shred...) where she claims it's 20 minutes (they're 21 minute PLUS warm up and cooldown/stretch) this one is 20 minutes including the workout and stretching. So when I'm crunched for time or just have a day where I am not feeling like exercising, I can commit to these short 20 minutes. They're intense (level 2 - lower body is the most challenging) and get the job done. I don't think you'd like this for an every day workout and should aim for more than 20 min most days but when you just aren't feeling it, this is a great sub. Love kickboxing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This is a great workout. I love kickboxing and took Les Mils Body Combat for a few years. The intensity is not the same but it's a fun, fast paced workout. It goes by quickly and gets you sweating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"The sound quality is very poor on this item.

But super super challenging!","review":"I just bought this DVD at Walmart a few days ago and have had a chance to try all 3 workouts. Once again, Jillian doesn't disappoint! She kicks your butt! At the same time though, I had a lot of fun doing this DVD because I always thought it would be fun to take a kick boxing class and this is exactly that! This DVD is definitely a good DVD to add to your Jillian Michaels collection or if you just want to try something new and fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, Jillian has better workouts","review":"I got this with instant on amazon, so they did not think a tutorial was needed I suppose. Personally, I find it very hard to follow along as it moves very fast and doesn't provide much time to get the moves down. I've done this workout twice now, 1 and 2 back to back, (20 mins is NOT enough!) but I think I'll stick with rotating other Jillian videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Kicks Your Butt","review":"I love Jillian Michaels and I was excited to see a new DVD. I have 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, and Burn Fat Boost Metabolism.I have only done workouts 1 and 3 and both of them left me sweating. I do agree with the other reviewers that said take the time to watch the tutorial and even preview the workouts if you have time. The first time I did level 3 it seemed like the kickboxing flew by and I missed a lot. She doesn't break it down as much as the other videos. The second time was easier to follow.The workouts are only 20 minutes but you really work the whole time. At first it doesn't seem bad, but I was hurting the next day. Definitely adding this to the rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ached afterwards for days","review":"I was impressed! Don't be deceived by the moves combo, seems easy even for 20 minutes and I was aching afterwards for days! I like it that the whole session was 20 minutes, which is great for my life right now, and I can choose one of three workouts. But you can combine all or another one, which I think is a great idea as excuses come in the form of 'I just dont have time' and now I have no excuses. Session one is for upper body and you need a set of weights, session two is for lower body and third for core, which is never my favorites. Although this DVD is focused on kick boxing, there are a lot of familiar moves from other of her DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO'S BAD?!!","review":"This workout is awesome and is exactly 20 minutes. When you're punching and executing these combos, you feel like a bad mother:) Now you will have fun with this, but you have to focus on what you're doing and most importantly your form. Thankfully Jillian Michaels includes a tutorial to all the moves used in this DVD. WATCH THAT FIRST!! When you begin it is FAST AND FURIOUS! Anyway if you want to have fun and burn some serious calories BUY THIS DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian's Best!!","review":"I pre ordered this DVD and it landed on my doorstep yesterday, I was ssssoooo excited!!! I've anticipating it's release for a long time. I immediately popped it in and began with the tutorial which is a must if you are not a kick boxing pro. The only kick boxing I've ever done was the little bit Jillian incorporated into her other DVDs. I've been dedicated to Jillian for 1 1/2 years using her work outs 5-6 days a week and alternating between the 7 JM exercise dvds I own. The Kickbox Fast Fix is by far the BEST and is my new favorite. I have done all three workouts on this dvd and all three are hard, fast, and very intense. I love that there are more girls in this dvd, it makes the workout fun. Never thought I would say that about a Jillian Michaels workout! This dvd is an absolute must have!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Received it in spanish","review":"Not sure what happened...I bought this for my kindle and it's in spanish.I do not see in the description that the video was in spanish. Not sure what happened"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The work out is too complicated & she doesn't work both sides of the body evenly. Combo moves involve too many steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to the workouts","review":"Ok even though it took a while to learn all the steps in this workout, i got it now and love it. Don't be discourage when you first start if you cant keep up the steps. In time you will get it and love it. Overall good workout and as always loves Jillian because she delivers results.Update i had to come back and update about this workout. Wow my abs are so tight and flat i can't believe my eyes. I use to do taebo but jillian workout got my abs in better shape. At the beginning i did not like this workout due to the moves. Boy im i glad i did not give up because once i mastered the moves, i now cant go a day without do it. This is my favorite workout out of 100s that i have from different trainers. Jillian pleeeease make more of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get if your computer/DVD player is older than 3 years old","review":"My laptop is 4 years old and I use basic Windows media player. My dvd player is 10 years old. This is a re-writable DVD and will not play on older versions of media player or older DVD players. However, it plays on my two year old desktop, in my office, with no problem. I am now annoyed because Amazon does not allow returned DVDs after they are opened and this DVD is useless to me. I was thinking about buying the downloaded version from Amazon, but I might just buy a regular DVD copy from a store to avoid future problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I like Jillian Michaels for the most part but I did not like this workout and I've been doing cardio kickboxing for years. The moves are way too quick so they don't flow well and Jillian doesn't work the other side of the body for the second circuit. If you want a good kickboxing DVD Cathe Friedrich is the best!!! I own three of her DVDs and love them. Cathe's DVD are a little more expensive but don't forget, sometimes you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I recently bought this and her 30-day shred. I am in good physical shape, and I go to the gym 3-4 times a week. I was looking for a quick 20 minute kickboxing routine that could suffice on the days I just couldn't drive to the gym for 20 minutes...I figured if anyone would be intense in 20 minutes, it would be Jillian. The workouts do get you sweating, but I am seriously annoyed at the fact that she does basically every sequence on one side only. Really? Was this when you knew nothing? How can you do all the sequences on only one side of the body? My right arm is going to be ripped. My left, that's another story. Also, she cools you down so quick it's from 60 to 0 in .2 seconds. That's bad for you. Overall, to make this a good routine I'll have to switch sides halfway through sequences myself and cool down slower and longer. I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced?","review":"It was weird...in each workout, she does not balance it well...for example, kick with right leg is not balanced with the same moves to kick with the left leg. Every single circuit was like that. Kinda wierd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I love Jillian's videos but this one is really short you have to do it after you did something else before, I believed it was going to be like the others so, no I will not recomend this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good...","review":"I have several of JM's workouts and this is my current least favorite. It was a lot of up and down and just wasn't as well put together or inspiring as some of her others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout- Just a Little Adjustment","review":"I was a little wary to buy this because of some of the negative feedback on Jillian not keeping it even. I love Jillian and kickboxing workouts, so I decided to try it anyway. She does each circuit twice, so I just adjusted the workout by changing my stance to the other side the second time around so everything would be even. It's a little annoying that way, but the workout is great otherwise. It helps me burn calories, and I feel myself getting stronger every time I do it! I also like that the other girls in the video are clearly fit, and even they are struggling a little bit by the end of each segment. Makes me feel a little better about my fitness level, haha! Give this one a try and I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian is 'kick-butt' fantastic","review":"I have several of Jillian's workout DVDs and have really enjoyed exercising at home with them. When I searched Amazon for a new one, I was so happy to find a KickBoxing workout. I watched each level before attempting to actually do the workout. Before I moved on to Level 2, I made sure I could complete Level 1 two times in a row. The instructions are clear and you can go at your own pace if you are new to her exercises. I strongly recommend this DVD if you want to really burn calories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It's a little technical but a great workout!! The three workouts feel fairly similar in the sense that although they are supposed to focus on abs, legs, or arms...they seem to all work them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente Video","review":"Excelente Vídeo, lo recomiendo. Me encanto, muy dinámico y muy bueno. Tiene muy buenos ejercicios, y lo mejor es que cada nivel dura 20 mn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love kick boxing and I love this workout.

I have never done any of Jillian Michael's workouts, and this really kicks butt! I did level one and i was pouring in sweat. Will definately recommend. Going to do level 2 and three tonight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast","review":"I bought this DVD to try to add a little variety to my workouts. I have done kickboxing DVDs before and was excited that Jillian had one too. I guess the title says it all and I should have been more aware that \\"Fast fix\\" meant fast paced! The tutorial section is great, but I like it better when Jillian gives instruction while she is working out, not in a separate section. I had a really hard time remembering the correct positioning and trying to keep pace with the group. The transition from move to move was way too fast for me! This is not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"I've been doing Tae-Bo for a while and wanted something different. I got a little tired of Billy. I like Jillian, so I thought I'd try her kickboxing work out. I was very disappointed. It didn't seem like anyone was together. The moves were confusing at first and it only worked one side of your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"EliD","review":"Anything from Jillian Michaels is awesome. Love this kickboxing dvd. Each workout is only 20 min, and it leaves you pouring sweat. If you're consistant you will get results."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Impact","review":"I love this workout. My only problem is the fact that it is only 20min long. By the end of the first workout out, I'm always left wanting more, so I combine two. Even though each workout is 20min, by the end of each you are sweating...alot!It is very effective. This is one of the first kickboxing workouts I have done, that actually makes me sweat!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, too fast, no fun","review":"I am a big Jillian fan and have been a faithful user of her workouts for a long time now. I love and use many of them. I have enjoyed many of the kick-boxing-eque moves in the other DVD's so I thought I might like this workout as well. Turned out I did not enjoy it one bit! I watched the entire tutorial before attempting the workout but once the actual workout began I spent most of the time just standing there with my mouth open, brow furrowed. She went waaaaaaaay to fast for me and the moves changed up too much and there were far too many nuances involved. I was so frustrated that I was near tears! My friend encouraged me and said \\"Try not to beat yourself up.\\" To which I replied, \\"I can't beat myself up! I'm not coordinated enough to do that!\\" Ha! At least I can laugh at myself. But sadly, I regret purchasing this particular DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good workout, hate the commentary","review":"The workout is great. I break a sweat and feel exhausted afterwards. However, I hate doing this workout because I hate Jillian's commentary. I feel like she is sexually harassing one of the other women working out. I am not biased against anyone's sexual preference, but Jillian needs to save the flirting for another time.I'm anxiously awaiting the point where I know this workout well enough that I can turn off the sound and turn on my own music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete dvd","review":"I downloaded this dvd on Sunday, tried it out yesterday. Like other reviwers have said, the music at times is too loud and its difficult to hear Jillian's instructions. The workout is excellent. My issue was that the dvd on instant play is incomplete. Jillian's website and she herself mentions a tutorial where you can learn the steps but the instant play version does not have the tutorial. So i would not recommend downloading this from amazon.Now to get the complete dvd I'm going to have to buy the dvd and pay an extra $5 and wait for it to be mailed. I'm rather disappointed with Amazon's lack of scrutiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I love Jillian but this was not her best! For the 2nd workout she only does it on one side!!! I bought this on a whim & wish i read the reviews first. It gets you sweating but it's jus not balanced! Her ripped in 30 is soo much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I am a huge fan of Jillian Michaels and am always impressed by her workouts. This one did not fail to deliver. It's high intensity cardio and I found myself having a great time learning kickboxing moves along the way. The one negative thing I will say is that by the time the 20 minutes were through, I felt like I hadn't really started. These workouts are exactly 20 minutes as opposed to her other videos which tend to run over. This video starts strong and ends strong. If you are in the intermediate to advanced stage of your fitness, I would suggest doing at least two or all three of the workouts. If you are a beginner, I would suggest trying one of the circuits. She doesn't really give you too many \\"beginner moves\\" but, the encouragement from the girls helps to push you along. Bottom line: I didn't waste my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Jillian","review":"My wife has a collection of Jillian workout cd's including this one. Wanted to get her body back after our last baby. Utilizing a combination of Jillian workouts, and my smith machine, she is now back lean and hard at 115lbs. Indeed, she now thinks my equipment is hers! Thought Jillian was for girls, but after seeing her results, I have also incorporated Jillian's workouts into my routine with great results. I have lost 10lbs, added muscle tone, and greatly strengthend my core in the last two months with Jillian's 30 minute routines at the center of my workouts. My abs are ripped!!! If you get her routines, be ready to work. If you do the work, you'll see results. Thanks Jillian - from a guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was meant for the Gen-4 audio only iPod","review":"This does fit a 60GB video iPod but not very well.

The armband is to thin and cuts into your arm. It also does stay in the clip well at all. I have had it drop to the floor twice in the middle of workouts. The clip is also very cheap. You get what you pay for, go for something of better quality and a little more money. I am now shoping for a new workout case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This is a cheap and flimsy armband. NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE.

Great vendor!","review":"This case works very well for the price. It fits my 30G video iPod very well and functions as indicated. The armband stays intact, but the device seems to slide ocassionally when doing high intensity workouts (running). Overall, this is a good product and am pleased with its performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for running or jogging--just a case","review":"I wouldn't call this a \\"sport case\\" for even a second. It's basically an ipod case with a belt clip that includes an accessory that's an elastic armband--I'm a girl with pretty skinny arms and the armband fits pretty good. But unfortunately if you try to jog or bike or anything with this, your ipod will be flopping all over. I use it at the gym if I'm using the weightlifting machines, but that's it. The quality of the clip doesn't even seem to strong, but for $7.49 it makes a pretty good protective case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This dealy is pretty decent. It's got a belt latch type of thing on it which is pretty much all I need. I haven't used the armband yet but it seems like it would work out pretty well for those who do low impact exercises. Only thing that kind of sucks about it is the screen on the front sticks to the iPod and looks weird. Good PRICE though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jipped","review":"Originally ordered a COMPLETELY different model armband for 15 bux.

However, I was a a bit disappointed. There is constantly fluctuating static in the background. I assume this is due to the fact that the device carries an electrical current to charge the Zune while transmitting simultaneously. It seems that the underlying electrical current interferes with the FM transmission. This is very noticeable with music and especially with podcasts. Now, I use an Aerielle i2i Universal FM Transmitter which provides perfect, static-free reception of my Zune"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with an AUX cable","review":"I've had my dealings with FM transmitters before, from DLO to Monster FM transmitters, you name it I've had it. All I have to say is that they're really a waste of money. The only good thing about them is that they charge your ipod or zune, otherwise then that their sound quality sucks, never a good reception. My suggestion is this, buy an AUX cable for $3 on Amazon and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, Junk, Junk","review":"This product is a total piece of junk.

The storyline was not bad but the flow of the writing felt disjointed and choppy. It may be a result of translation but at times, it seemed like I had accidentally picked up a book from the young adults section. This, combined with occasions where detail was put in which felt more like loose threads that were not woven into the whole story made this a less than satisfactory book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's a mystery, how did this get published?","review":"I purchased this book after a glowing review on NPR. Big mistake. Perhaps it is the translation, but there are, no joke, 2 or 3 exclamation marks per page! The writing is stilted and filled with stereotypes. The central mystery lacks any major surprises and Tursten even fails to capture the omnipresent chill of a Swedish winter. If you want to try some international crime fiction, try the excellent 'Shape of Water' by Camilleri or 'A Very Long Engagement' by Japrisot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oof...how clunky can you get?","review":"I'll blame the translator. Huge fan of northern European detective fiction - Mankel, Nesbo, Larson, et al. - so ordered Tursten's book. Not even close to the others, partly because of what I assume is a terrible translation - sorry but the words \\"slammer\\" and \\"consolingly\\" don't fit in the same sentence. The translation veers between slang and Henry James - and not for any particular reason - Steven Murray just does not have the \\"flow\\" that other translators have. Too bad as for Huss, she is an OK character, although her reflections on her life are rather cliched. Her observations and ruminations lack something that other writers from northern Europe seem to have found. I've moved on to Iceland and Indridason who is right there with the best. As for Tursten and Huss, go to the library and read a few pages/chapters before investing."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just a mystery, but a fine novel","review":"Only a few words to say this is certainly a five star mystery and novel. Tursten is an excellent writer and keeps the reader engrossed in the Von Knecht mystery as well as the life of Det. Inspector Huss and her family, living in contemporary Sweden. Her characters are vividly drawn, the setting is fascinating, especially for those of us who have not been to Sweden, and the mystery is complex enough to keep you guessing until the end. I was also impressed by how she wove important contemporary social issues into the novel. She has the toughness of the \\"hard-boiled\\" writers and the grace of a P. D. James. Very well worth reading. I look forward to the other two novels in translation and those that are still in Swedish.Let us hope they are translated soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Gem of the 32-bit Era","review":"This game is one of the best gems of the long gone 32-bit era. Developed by Sonic Team, it pits the player against perhaps the more ominous and everpresent danger of all: Fire.As a fresh rookie working for a futuristic fire department, the Burning Rangers, your last is to rescue people from flaming sites in revolutionary 3D polygonal environments with several paths and floors.This is a game best played with headphones, to listen carefully to the tips and indications given by your superior over the headset and the tiny sound effects and big explosions within the fire sites. I recommend using the 3D Control Pad for this game, it feels natural and intuitive.Excellent game, an absolute underrated classic, well worth its steep price."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are thinking about buying this book - don't!","review":"Strozer offers no new insights - most of what she says has been argued elsewhere more convincingly. Her style is rambling and unappealing. If you are looking for an informative text about language acquisition after puberty I would advise you to turn to a different source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy, yet very original ring","review":"This is an extraordinary ring, a bit vintage with art deco aspects and very original. You can wear it all day, it stays well in place and it is very light. It will go with everything from casual to smart. But more importantly, it has an aura of mystery to it and that is why I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real poster.","review":"I was under the impression that this was a real poster that I was buying. Now it was the actual size described, but you could tell it had been printed up. It wasn't an actual movie poster. Ink job was crappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought for my Houdini","review":"My dog, easily broke from wire cages. I bought this in anticipation he would stay in with the lock. A no go-he got out in minutes. I guess he uses his body weight to pop it open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Airlines","review":"I purchased the pet carrier for my little maltese. It was actually a bit too big for him but the main thing was he arrived from NJ to UK perfectly and the airline accepted the carrier. It is very sturdy and well made. I would recommend this item for animal travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best crate","review":"Wow my dog love this crate goes in and out by herself to nap and I am looking for another one as I write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puur-fect for a cross-country trip!","review":"Purchased this product based on the brand name, customer reviews and the need to transport our cat from NH to NM via car with room inside for him to stretch, place for disposable litter box, toys and blankets. Can be easily disassembled for easy storage between uses. Rear and side vents allowed for air circulation and sunlight to overcome the stress of such a long trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product - except NO rear vents!!","review":"We bought two small size crates. Petmate makes a good crate! But, international air flights in particular REQUIRE venting on all four sides of the crate. The small crates are not vented in the rear. We solved this issue by drilling a bunch of 1\\" holes. This is not an impossible fix, and the crate is very sturdy, but you have to have a powerful drill as the plastic is tough. I would have given the product 5 stars had the description been correct. With a correct description, I probably would have bought the crate anyway and drilled it, as I know the brand is good, but I was very annoyed to be fibbed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We've had a lot of plastic crates over the years and this one is one of the worst. It does not have ventilation in the back as shown in the picture. It also has a new turning type door closure that I don't care for - also not shown in the picture. The way this new door is installed, it narrows the crate entrance by at least 25-30%. The measurements list it as 48\\" long, but the interior floor where the dog lays is just under 40\\"! Would not buy this crate again, but it's size and weight make it difficult to return. This was an expensive mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - shipped without a door!","review":"Just a word of caution - I received my vari kennel at what I thought was a good price - didn't fully open it right away. When I did, I discovered that it had been shipped to me without a door. A serious drawback for a dog crate! Unfortunately, it was beyond the return period and now I'm stuck with a crate without a door. I'll have to order my own door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for airline travel","review":"I was worried because of the previous reviews but ordered the kennel with time to spare before I shipped my 65 lbs boxer 1500 miles. Due to her size and breed I ordered the XL size. It does have ventilation on all four sides and seems to be doing OK. It made the trip with no problem. The only thing that would be better is if it came with food and water bowls."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BIG","review":"This is the perfect crate for a big dog. My dog is of medium size and loves the extra room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petmate Vari Knnel","review":"The kennel came broken in the edges where the screws go. It is very difficult for me to return it, but i wanted it to let you know so you can better monitor future shipments,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Kennel","review":"Very Good Kennel, easy to assemble, just missing the rear venting. Very big in Roomy if getting the 90 to 125 lb size."},{"rating":"2","title":"kennel","review":"Petmate Ultra Vari Kennel-its a great kennel & great price- prompt delivery. Seems sturdy. I have a Pitbull. She likes it better than the wire cage. I didn't feel safe with her in that. This one, I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Crate for puppy.","review":"Although this crate may be seen as being more suitable for a medium sized dog, our small dog much prefers it to the smaller crate. She has enough room to be comfortable and turn around without difficulty but not enough to allow her to soil her sleeping area. She has no difficulty walking in there now when it's time for a nap or when we need some time to do chores where we can't watch her as much as we need to. It works well as a transport crate and makes her feel secure and comfortable when she's in the car. An all around good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Carrier","review":"This is a roomy carrier especially its height. It is also very sturdily built and has more head room than some of the others I have bought. I feel good about it because my pet no longer looks crouched up in his kennel. The plastic screws on my previous kennel broke and I had to reinforce it with pieces of wire. This one seems much sturdier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant crate received not as advertised","review":"The giant crate I received is not the one pictured, it is not IATA compliant as it does not have holes in the rear of the crate. I could have bought one like this local for $100 but instead went with this because I need a crate that is IATA compliant as I will be moving my pets internationally. I cannot really return it because the amount I would pay for return shipping on something like this would be so huge I don't even think it would be worth it. I guess I'm pretty much stuck with it but I'll look into it further. But as I said, if you're travelling internationally and are buying the Giant Kennel, don't buy this one, it's not compliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizes Aren't Right","review":"I have a 60 lb. dog and the kennel description says it fits up to a 70lb. dog. I think the kennel is good for up to a 50 lb. dog and that would be pushing it. I want to return this item but it would be a fortune to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they used to be.","review":"Have used these crates for 40+ years of showing dogs and they sure are not what they used to be. Crate was delivered in large cardboard box and when opened corner was badly chipped. Plastic is much more hard and riged then my older cages. I am sure it will not stand up to much usage. Note to self, better go back to metal dog cages in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as described","review":"This kennel does not have rear vents as described, and is not \\"linen\\" white as shown. It is more beige color... the older version. I notified Amazon of the lack of rear vents (required on airlines) but they have not updated the product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimentions Wrong","review":"I orderd this Kennel through dog.com and the dimentions were wrong. I was trying to fly my Great Dane from KS to AK. My parents drove 3 hours to the airport in Omaha only to find out that the Kennel was an INCH to big to fit through the cargo doors and to fit in the bay on the plane. This wouldn't of been an issue if I wasn't using it to transport my dog and that it was very important that they were accurate when they told me the dimentions which are also posted on the side of the kennel. I contacted the company to get my money back and they didn't seem to care about the stress they put on my dog or the huge inconvience they caused me and my family. DO NOT buy this kennel if you are using it to transport your pet on a plane! I realize this could of been just my kennel, but it is the company that is selling the product responsibility to check it and make sure it is correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for future use","review":"I was hoping this product would fit a young person but they were still too big. They will be used in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cheap protection","review":"Haven't used much yet, but, should do the trick for someone who is prone to slip with the knife once in a while (most anyone)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greasy","review":"I would agree with everyone else. These are notably very greasy but still taste good. I got into the habit of wrapping them in paper towels, which is a little foul now that I think about it.

They're a staple stocking stuffer in our house. This was my first online bulk order. I'm not sure what happened to the product as I've never had this problem before. But whoa... something changed. I love salty food, but this is quite a bit saltier than when I've bought it in the store. I could prob live with that. Until I found myself chewing on gristle every third bite. Ugh. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too salty for me","review":"I have enjoyed several types of Jack Link's 2oz steak products, including teriyaki and oven roasted turkey, but this particular variety seems much saltier than the others.

These things were terrible...really fatty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best baseball game ever","review":"Michael Cieslinski has thought of everything in designing this game. Weather condition, different umpires, ballparks, and the element of chance all play a role in deciding the outcome of the game. Rolling three ten sided dice and comparing the result to the complex, but very easy to read, player and ballpark charts gives the result of the play. You will need a set of game charts and dice which the publisher will send you for free after you purchased the game book. It's not a cheap game, but for true baseball fans, this is a game you won't be able to stop playing with yourself and your friends. The publisher by the way also maintains a web site which lists other people and Dynasty Leagues around the world seeking additional players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over produced crap","review":"In an effort to revive their careers, outside songwriters are brought in and slick late 80s production (keyboards, highly processed guitar soungs) dominate. I guess it paid off because \\"The Flame\\" was a huge hit. It's not terrible as ballads go, but it's a pretty lowest common denominator kind of song. \\"Never Had a Lot to Lose\\" is top notch Cheap Trick pop rock and the Elvis cover \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" is fun. The opener, \\"Let Go\\", is alright but beyond that it's thin pickings.If you're looking for good Cheap Trick try any of their first 5 albums (Cheap Trick, In Color, Heaven Tonight, At Budokan, Dream Police), the 1997 self titled CD on Red Ant Records (very hard to find these days) or the recent two CD Budokan Set. That'll put the power in your power pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lap of Luxury (1988)","review":"After a decade of falling further down the charts, Cheap Trick came bouncing back towards the top with 1988's Lap of Luxury. By 1988 Cheap Trick hadn't had a hit record or single in years, but Lap of Luxury changed that. Lap of Luxury briefly brought Cheap Trick back into the spotlight. While Lap of Luxury is not Cheap Trick's best album it does have quite a bit to offer however. Lap of Luxury spawned the hit powerballad \\"The Flame\\", and a cover of Elvis Presley's \\"Don't Be Cruel.\\" Other highlights include: \\"Ghost Town\\", Let Go, and Never Had a Lot to Lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dylan's Second Poorest Album Of The 80s","review":"This awful album is outdone in crapiness only by the even more awful \\"Knocked Out Loaded\\".

Consider the other efforts at the time: \\"Knocked Out Loaded\\" and that dreadful tour with the Grateful Dead...captured in all it's weariness with the CD \\"Dylan and the Dead.\\"And yet \\"Down in the Groove\\" is the worst of it all. Even \\"Silvio,\\" considered the highlight of the album by many, would have been left off most other Dylan CDs. He recorded this album as if he simply didn't care, and Dylan fans at the time must have thought \\"the finishing end\\" was at hand.But Dylan is Dylan. The slump would soon be over. Big time.

There is so much information presented in a clear and consise manner. It covers just about every major event in Native American history. There are many side bar sections that higlight special people, places or events to give the reader more detail. I am somewhat familiar with Native American tribes, but I did not know there were so many different tribes until I read this book. It did not just focus on the major well known tribes. The book also uses a set of symbols thoughout the book so the reader can tell what section of the country the author is talking about.Overall I rate this a very good book and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in Native American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This is a pretty good cd.

But the prime cut here is \\"Chiseled In Stone,\\" which to my mind rivals Jones's \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today\\" as the most heart-breaking recording of all time.

Because we work in loud environments, I thought this one would be great since security guards at bars & clubs tend to use the clear headsets.

When speaking, it's very clear. We put our mics on the edge of our jackets and lined the wire underneath our jackets so it doesn't get tangled, that worked out great. Overall, it's a great product.

Eventually Raul's body is found, he and the tech, who has been wtching him hit it off and the evil head of the company where they work is sent to do some mandatory doppling. This movie was made by PBS, which is pretty sad, it also hates anteaters for no particular reason. It's a bad movie, but is also sadly one of Raul Julia's last films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digthis... Casablanca in the computer!!","review":"If you liked ice-pirates or tron or dark-star then this may be for you. No its not over produced. No you won't be distracted by ridiculously professional special effects. But this movie is cool with a captial coo! If you consider yourself a computer nerd, logic designer or electronic engineer and don't like this celluloid sequence... previously know as a flick, then turn in your keyboard and become an accountant or truck driver now!! I've been a programmer and dumpster diver and biker since I was 10 and I love this flick!!! If you don't love this flick then you must live a life free of cheesyness, cheapness, and Orwellian-ness.

Horrible acting, horrible production values, horrible writing. Now I know it was a public television movie, but two hours of Sesame Street is more entertaining than this. To give an idea of just how bad this movie is, Mystery Science Theater 3000 even made fun of it. And if you want to be entertained by this movie, I suggest you wait until the Mystery Science Theater version is put out on VHS or DVD. Raul Julia must have been hurtin' for cash in order to star in this monstrosity. That is, if he even got paid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bankrupt at the Mind Bank.","review":"Who could imagine that PBS would sponsor such tripe? The script had to have originated in the mind of a high schooler: the plot is plotting, the acting aching and the production values nearly worthless. That Raul (a Puerto Rican-born actor whose character's name sounds Jewish and whose mother looks Scandinavian) would stoop to being in this futuristic soap opera cum sci-fi braindrainer is a sad commentary on his ability to choose a script. However, the concept is a good one. Buy Total Recall instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm, I'm so torn between loving this movie and burning it.","review":"Well I'm gonna go ahead and guess that everyone seeing this movie has seen the MST3k version, but the movie itself can be viewed without those witty quips. Enjoy the soup scene. Thrill as Fingal drinks his reconst and Appolonia eats Flav-o-fives. Cry as the Renfield-like henchman of Rick dies in a hail of gunfire from the Fatman. Perhaps everyone should see Overdrawn at the Memory Bank just so we can all have some common terror in which we can all associate."},{"rating":"2","title":"work great!!","review":"This is a great item at a great price.

So I'm giving 4 stars since it's the OEM product (and not 5 stars, because it's still more expensive than it should be).It seems that at least in my case, they've worked out the issue of these being HP versus another brand.

It was a pleasant surprise that the other tracks were just as strong lyrically and vocally. All tracks are well arranged, with Terence's excellent voice really coming through.

Ok I am a Prince fan and this album had some of that flavor with a mix of European soul. It was many years ago I first heard this album and I still really like the songs on it. I also suspect these songs came from a place of deep reflection as there is a \\"rawness\\" to them that conveys deep sincere feelings.

Once again, thank goodness for Amazon.com!My ears can still be delighted with Terrance's voice, and I can groove my body to his funky rendition of \\"Dance Little Sister!\\" Terrance is amazing, and a talent like his needs to be heard by everyone.

The team of Patterson and Ledwidge is a masterful combination of talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step On a Crack","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I enjoy all James Patterson books.

I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very superficial book!","review":"I've read some other James Patterson novels and found some quite entertaining and an easy read but this one was no good. Honestly, I didn't care for the writing style. The sentences don't flow nicely at all and there's no depth of story or character.

Two talented authors could have, should have, done better!I've read just about all of Patterson's novels, loved them all, love Alex Cross, but my favorites were Beach Rd and Cradle and All.

I have read almost all of James Patterson's books - I love the Alex Cross series, and also enjoy the women's club books. I cannot believe that \\"Step on a Crack\\" came from the same author. The storyline was ridiculous, the characters were slapable - all I could do was shake my head. Halfway through this drivel I had to give up.Trust me, this book is a huge disappointment. Read \\"Cross\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing new character","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Patterson had an opportunity to create a fresh character, but instead he just wrote Alex Cross again. His relationships and personality seemed like carbon copies. Although the story line was an interesting one, I thought the villian was extremely uncreative. The OCD behavior of the villian was so stereotypical and added nothing to the story, but in fact made him comical. I would recommend skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I picked this book from the bookshelf of an apartment we were renting in Europe because it was the only one in English and I was out of reading material.What dreck!

They weren't Tolstoy, but were a good read. This shallow attempt at a book makes me want to get into writing. The formula seems to be: find a famous author who doesn't want to write anymore, write a lousy book, pay the famous author to puts his name in front and then, voilà: a best seller. I don't know what Micheal Ledwidge's (the real author) percentage is, but James Patterson must be making a killing on this sausage factory approach to literature. The book is not completely unreadable: I did manage to finish it. However, I had to skip over large portions in order to survive to the end. It had it all: two-dimensional characters, stifling political correctness, unbelievable plot twists, sadistic violence for no reason, etc.Stay away from any book that has James Patterson's name along with another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Carlin would puke!","review":"I have been a big fan of Patterson. I even like his flying kids. This book is way below his standards.1. The hard core characters say \\"friggin\\". One of things I liked most about Patterson was his real dialogue. This book reads like he's trying to sell to a fundamentalist junior high crowd.2. The main character is a fallen devout Catholic, who is angry at his Irish qrandfather, a priest. His wife is dying of cancer and he has 10 adapted children of every race.3. His villains are the strength of this book. The plot is decent and the bad characters are real, except for the \\"friggin\\" speech. The plot saves this work from a \\"one star\\".Patterson is better than this. I hope this is not a sign of deterioration with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"I bought this book as a gift and it was a great one. My father loves James Patterson and this was a great addition to his collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be a fan","review":"I've read quite a few books by James Patterson and frankly I think he's lost his touch. Maybe he should stick to one author books instead of teaming up with someone because it looks like it interferes with his creativity. This detective having 10 kids with someone who is so angelic that she doesn't sound real is lame. It is pointless to give your main character 10 kids if they don't have anything to contribute in the story. I must admit that I wasn't expecting the villains to be who they are. However, I thought it was pretty corny that in this book as well as in \\"2nd Chance\\" it took someone outside the field to tell the detective who he should be looking for.I didn't like the book nor would I recommend it to anyone. It was boring, uninspiring, and the attempt at humor lacked lustere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Another good book.

It's a shame this is available on any shelf and lesser known authors who have some craft are ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Irritating!","review":"This was a very tough book to get through. The first 1/3 of the book was interesting and seemed promising, and then...it just got so awful.There was no plot thickening except at the very beginning and the very end of the book (complete with plot holes!). Throughout the rest of the book, was just a bunch of nonsense to show how bad the bad guys really were and how good the good guys were. At least throw in a couple more plot twists while you're at it.The personal side of the story with the 10 kids and the sick wife was sweet at first, but it was so excessive and sugary it became annoying.The crime is solved mostly by accident. I was hoping SOMEONE (FBI, NYPD, anybody!) would actually use their noggin and make some connections through deductive reasoning, rather than continuing to rely on failed hostage negotiations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step on a Crack","review":"This book is a total sham. Patterson is a good writer when the Alex Cross novels bear his name, but this co-writing (read, \\"Ghost Writing\\") has gotten worse and worse.I gave \\"Step On a Crack\\" zero stars! It is the final insult to Patterson fans. This new \\"co-writer\\" sounds like a high school English student, and an average one at that.

Lacking in substance, plot and suspense, I found I was skim reading the pages just to get to the end of it.The words felt like a \\"stocking filler,\\" ie. just written to plump out the book.

Not believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Has Happened to James Patterson???","review":"Ever since James Patterson has teamed up with co-authors, his books have been on a down-slide. This book is just plain boring - entirely too many characters. What does ten kids, a dying wife, a nanny, and an Irish priest/grandfather have to do with the plot?? I waded through this book, and am reticent to read any more of Patterson's books. The last few have been disappointing. He is no longer a best seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy the ride","review":"When reading a James Patterson book, it's best to suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride. In this book his hero is Detective Michael Bennnett who has a terminally ill wife, ten adopted children, a dead former first lady and a giant kidnapping scheme all to handle at the same time. All in a day's work! As in all Patterson books, the chapters are short, the pages turn quickly and soon the reader is immersed in an intriguing, if unlikely, story. Michael Bennett and his family are loving and loveable and provide good relief from the evil doings of the bad guys in the story. The motives of the perpetrators are rather thin, but the plot is elaborate and interesting as it unfolds. So suspend disbelief and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Again JP!","review":"I don't understand all the negative reviews, maybe people are looking for something different out of the books they read or maybe people just feel the need to bash his books because he is a bestselling author.

This is a concept genre, and as a concept, it is sort of interesting. The presidents wife is assassinated while eating dinner. It looks like murder. Only when she has her funeral at St. Pat's in NY, her memorial is over run by what might be terrorists. All of the celebrities and political power-houses are then held as hostage while the world looks on.I have to admit, this book had me for a while. As it unfolded, I was pretty interested to see exactly where it was going. However, once Patterson has laid out the entire concept, it feels to me like he did not know exactly where to go with it. In the end, the story becomes stupid and the writing becomes less cared for.I would suggest that you stay away from this book. Not good at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson does it again!","review":"Well, I could not put down the book, as always, and read it in one day.

Each subsequent \\"Patterson\\" novel is dramatically worse than the previous one.It's time for Patterson to hang it up and stop littering the landscape with his paper products. I would much rather see the tree from which the pages were made.Other's have written a synopsis of the plot (such as it is). Suffice it to say that the REAL author must have flunked Creative Writing I.If you feel this is too severe, I could tell you what I REALLY think !"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed again","review":"Having read all of the Cross novels I was unaware that a good deal of the other James Patterson publications were co-authored. I bought this book mainly as a reflex \\"I'm sure I'll like it\\" based on seeing the author was James Patterson. Wrong, really wrong. I don't know who actually wrote this one, but it wasn't the James Patterson novel I was expecting. Contrived, thin, paper thin plot, nuisance subplots and disappointing rhetoric led me to give it up after about reading maybe half of it.

More significantly, I felt like Detective Benett's actual role in the events of the novel is minimal, particularly in regards to the conclusion. It seemed like a lot of time was spent on scenes involving his dying wife and kids, but, while I felt bad for him, it didn't endear me to the novel or Benett as a character.There was enough in the story to keep me reading to the end, but the climax was a major let-down. The way the case is eventually solved has literally nothing to do with Benett's detective work. A much larger roll is placed by happenstance, and the ending felt tacked on, like the authors just picked the easiest segway into a dull final reveal. Hopefully with his wife out of the way the Benett novels can trend up from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"This book was definitely a good read and I would recommend it to others.

Can New York City be saved even in the aftermath of the death of the woman he loves?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unbearably formulaic","review":"Fans of James Patterson, beware! I love his earlier novels, but this was a bad imitation. It seemed to me as if Patterson himself had probably developed the character and outlined the plot and then had his co-author do the actual writing.Whatever the process, it was mind-numbingly bad. Chapters of just a couple of pages for those with flickering attention spans. Unbelievably simplistic, cliched writing. It was like Patterson badly reproduced by a computer program -- formulaic, cliched and an utter waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of Patterson's Best","review":"I've read several of James Patterson's books and this one has to be the worst one that I have tried to read. I made three attempts to give this book a chance hoping that it would get better & it never did. Patterson's Alex Cross books are much more excited to read...I highly recommend one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson? I don't think so.","review":"There are several authors that write so well and are so gifted that I will buy their books without even cracking the cover. James Patterson was one of them. I bought \\"Step on a Crack\\" like that. I got home and settled in for another good read. After I got into the first chapter I started thinking, \\"Did I buy the wrong book? This isn't the James Patterson I'm familiar with.\\" I closed the book and looked at the cover only to find another name on it.My fault no doubt, but I feel like I got ripped off. He's obviously not writing these co-authored books. I have eight of his Alex Cross novels sitting in my bookcase, so I'm very familiar with his writing. He may be reading the manuscripts with red pen in hand and making notes in the margins...maybe. How about the real author's name on top and at the bottom: Edited by James Patterson?Anyway, I can't help you with a review of this book because I never finished it, nor have I even picked up another one of his (?) books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"I took this book with me to jury duty and finished it before I left for the day. It is a very quick read. I've read the other reviews on amazon.com and I have to disagree. I've read pretty much every thing James Patterson has written and I was more disappointed with some of the Alex Cross series than with this book. I found it to be suspenseful and heart wrenching all at the same time. Having 10 children never seemed outrageous to me, some people do it. Being married to and the daughter of police men, having to work around Christmas and family tragedy was not far fetched to me at all, it's part of the deal. I cried at times and laughed at others. I thoroughly enjoyed this book to the point that I was hoping Mr. Patterson would make a series of it. If you have an open mind, this is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it was cracked up to be","review":"This was an unfortunately shallow book with inadequate character and plot development, feeling more like a storyboard than a novel. The newly introduced Mike Bennett is a seasoned officer with a human face who could go places in the future if only the writing would take him there. Better to write fewer solid books with some depth than a spate of predictable, disappointing ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Humdrum","review":"To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I use to eagerly await the latest James Patterson book. Sadly, Patterson has taken the route so many writers take when they become successful - they write to meet the demands of a publisher who has signed them to mega-dollar contracts. Step on a Crack was boring and hum-drum. Where normally I do not want to put a Patterson book down and read every word to see how he develops the chararcters, I found myself skipping pages and whole sections of the book - because I knew I wasn't missing anything. While I thought the ending was clever, it was not really shocking. In hindsight, I should have done what Billy Crystal did in the movie When Harry Met Sally - read the last chapter to see how the book ended. I wouldn't have missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad!","review":"As good as Patterson's early books were, this is the worst. I read at least a mystery a week. There are no redeeming qualities to this book. The characterizations are grade school level, the side remarks of the characters are so pathetic. I don't begrudge him selling out his rep by using unknown authors.......in fact good for them. But this is drivel. How unfortunate for persons who are drawn to him by his \\"Best Seller\\" history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step on a Crack (Michael Bennett)","review":"I really love James Patterson books & I think he is a great writer. To be honest I read the book until chapter 8 & stopped because it was too dry & boring to finish reading.

Truly compelling and sad at the same time. What a great start to a new series. Looking forward to more from Bennett and his family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Sentimental Short Story","review":"I've read ALL the Patterson books. I found this one a real disappointment. It was an overly sentimental short story disquised as a novel with large type and copious amounts of white space. Of course, it looks marvelous after being packaged and advertised by Patterson's considerable marketing machine. He takes on co-authors like changing clothes in order to put out three or four books a year. Unfortunately, I think he's lost his edge and is in it now for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This book was not good and i am very dissapointed. I am an avid reader of james pattersons and have enjoyed the entire alex cross series in addition to the others ( I havent read the womens murder club ) but this book was unrealistic , the dialogue was bad and to be honest i found myself thinking - this was not written by james patterson. James - start writing your own stuff again and stick with alex cross - a detective with 10 adopted kids is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"While I am a huge James Patterson fan, his latest book fell short in several ways. First of all,the improbability of it all went beyond the norm, i.e. why were the children still having a Christmas pageant blocks away from the siege of the century? The characterization was weak, and the seeming most influential protagonist went missing for nearly two-thirds of the book. Usually I can't put his books down, but this one took me a little longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson, Step on a Crack","review":"As I have already read all of James Patterson's Alex Cross books, I am almost done with the Michael Bennett series.

Definitely rate is a five!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting thriller","review":"I really liked the story line of this story. The former first lady has been murdered, but made to look like an accident. In steps Michael Bennett. He has to talk to the hijackers to help free the famous hostages. Patterson weaves in a twist to make it an enjoyable thriller.The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't like how short the chapters were. Bennett is also made out to be some super cop. I would not think anyone could handle his wife dying in the hospital and the stress of this job without having a complete melt down."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson-Michael Bennett","review":"Michael Bennett, the epitome of a NYC Irish Policeman.

I purchased a stainless set with palm trees design on the handles--I love them; very nice looking, a dull finish, good weight, but every piece is soooo big . . . the 'teaspoons' are more like the 'tablespoons' of most sets!! and they are longer. It's like they were made for a giant's hands. I am using both sets & am very happy. Oh, the only drawback with the American Harmony that I noticed is the pretty salad forks' tines are rather thick and don't pick up salad greens well, or anything delicate. Just a warning!

When I finally learned how to do it super-well, I reasoned, I could design my OWN oragami figures, of ballet dancers..... and of formal gardens.........and of great English manorhouses.............and tiaras, computers, computer printers..etc! The world would beat a path to my door to see my beautiful creations, and I'd be famous!Sadly, however, none of this ever happened....because the instructions in this book are hard to follow. I could do nothing except a few folds.

She mastered most of the models fairly quickly and now my 5-year-old son has become obsessed with doing origami. Every day he comes up to me with this book in hand and asks to do origami! This book is very simple and the steps are easy to follow once you understand the key in the beginning of the book. Every so often my son will get stuck on a step and I help him through which ends up being a learning example for the next model. The end results are rather complex and beautiful designs that will give a young child a wonderful feeling of accomplishment after having completed them. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Children","review":"I recently purchased this book for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She had previously enjoyed making boats and therefore thought that the next transition would be an actual origami book. This book is great for her, easy step by step instructions (with the help of an adult) and within minutes she gets to make a new beautiful creation! My 7 1/2 year old daughter can follow the instructions by herself but for someone slightly younger they would need the help of an older person.Overall this is a great addition to your kids books. I give it 2 thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction To Origami! Recommended","review":"We gave \\"Easy Origami\\" to my son when he was 10 because he asked to learn how to do Origami. This book was an inexpensive way to introduce the basic concepts and provided him with 32 fairly easy projects to learn. Two years later and he is now doing advanced Origami, but he started with this book.The projects included in this book teach the classic Origami shapes (Swan, Frog, Boat, etc) and some fun shapes, like the Box. The skills learned using the projects in this book can be used when moving to more complicated projects.Recommended!

As I eagerly began reading it, I realized that it consisted of a series of anecdotes, all related to women being oppressed by men, by society, by whatever. But the common theme was that women were oppressed, and then...women were oppressed, and then again...women were oppressed, and oh, by the way, did the author mention that women were oppressed? Sigh. This is a story that deserves telling, not one that deserves to be hijacked by a woman with a cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive to southern women","review":"Laura Schenone's book is more a tribute to rewriting history through the eyes of political correctness than a scholarly work. I found her comments in chapter 3 about southern white women so offensive I stopped reading the book. I felt her comments showed little research into the lives of most southern white women, and no attempt at all to try and understand how the agricultural economy and lifestyle shaped southern cooking. Her vision and understanding on the mid-1800 south seems to have come from a novel, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\"I bought this book because I thought, based on reviews, this was a scholarly, historical, book.

When playing, the animation was choppy. Playing it was worse, the controls were delayed and frustrating. I didn't get it from Amazon.com, and I wish I did since I had one hard time trying to return it. Eventually, one of the techs loaded it on their computer and was experiancing the same thing.

The book constantly bombards you with mistreatment of Blacks and other minorities as well as women.

This, despite the fact that Volkov (who worked for the paper that published these) denies any knowledge of them.'Testimony' should definitely be read alongside 'A Shostakovich Casebook' (edited by Malcom Brown, 2004) if fellow readers wish to gain a more complete understanding not only of these 'memoirs', but of Shostakovich himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop buying this book","review":"Regardless of this book being a \\"good read,\\" I think its existence is harmful to the name of Shostakovich.

Will Puchase again.","review":"I bought these for my husband to use at work, His fingers become swollen and callused from using his tools all day long. He needed something tough that could protect his fingers without making it difficult to use them as he needs to feel the vibrations from the engraver and drill to do his job right. Well these did the job just fine. My husband already wore through his first one and I'm not sure if it was the product or if it was just because of his heavy use of it. They are cheap enough that I don't really care if I have to buy new ones after a 2-3 months though.Will purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"split seam","review":"I ordered this and loved the way it fit my thumb, but unfortunately, the cap seam has split within a couple hours of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful Fingers...","review":"If you are just starting with woodcarving or even if you have been doing it for years, be kind to your fingers. Get this leather thumb guard AND the companion finger guard. They will be your first line of defense against ugly cuts, ouches, and boo boo's. I found them comfortable to wear, and they allowed my fingers to move naturally with no worries, no stiffness. Well worth the price in my estimation!

I have a decent 5.1 setup and the sound is great on mine. The surround mix is pretty good, you can clearly hear all the instruments, it is one of the better live DVDs I have sound wise.I have been disappointed in some of the video quality (grainy and black is not very black) on the disc, looks like it was filmed with some cheap cameras or something compared to some of the other videos I have, but it also could be the video conversion from PAL to NTSC. I rate a 4 because of the video quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong set, very good performance, great DVD","review":"This DVD was recorded in 2000. There is no songs from their new album, CENTURY CHILD, and also features their former bass player, who was replaced for the recording of CENTURY CHILD.Anyway, the set list is very good. The show is amazing, the enrgy of keyboarder and band leader Tuomas is fantastic. Tarja's voice sounds as great alive as in the studio. The drummer is also something verys trong in this band.All in all,a marvellous show (It's 80 minutes of show - the rest are interviews, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent band but Very bad sound on this dvd","review":"Just to start. I have a very good system (amp and speakers) and the sound is horrible! I tried many setting and nothing seem to reach my expectation. I was really disappointed about this dvd and even regret that i bought it! Nightwish is one of my favorite band and i can't wait to see it live Decembre 16 2004 in Montreal to hear the real thing.I am really sad to say this but when you are use to good sound from their album, you expect at least the same if not better for a dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Concert DVD!","review":"I bought all of Nightwish's albums about 8 months ago and they quickly became my favorite band. This is the first concert DVD of any band that I have bought and I must say I am completely satisfied. All the band members, except the bassist, really show the fun and energy they have while performing. I've read where they are going to be recording another concert in mid-October and this one really has me looking forward to it.I would consider this a required purchase for any Nightwish fan and strongly recommend it to metal fans in general, especially those into Power, Symphonic and/or Goth Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great DVD by a great band","review":"Nightwish is among my favorite bands, and I guess its because I never heard any band that had an opera singer like Tarja in it. The concert shown on here is excellent; the set list has a little bit of everything from their albums (with the exception of the newer one). There are also numerous other special features, such as interviews with some of the band members, two music videos, a photo album, some more footage from different concerts, and other stuff.Its a definate buy for fans of the band, and possibily anyone interested in Nightwish."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"Nightwish is one of my favorite bands on the planet. when i heard about their dvd, i bought it from Helion Records in Brazil while making another purchase. i couldn't wait to get it.watching them live was very exciting. i had never seen this band, aside from pictures from their website and cd booklets. and the songs were really well performed. my biggest problem was the sound quality. it was terrible!! i am so used to hearing their albums on my stereo with excellent bass, clear vocals, and defined drum beats. but the dvd sound quality didn't allow for any of that.i was very disapointed. but i suppose it's possible that i just bought a bad copy... in any case, i still love this band more than anything. i just really wish that their dvd was something i could stand watching and listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly authored","review":"The performance itself was very enjoyable, but the every 2 second jump cuts that are standard in modern music video was very annoying as usual.My major complaint is the disc itself. Whoever authored it was an idiot. Rather than doing the right thing and deliver a disc in anamorphic widescreen, they delivered a 4:3 presentation matted to 16:9. If you're going to deliver a 4:3 disc, don't screw the customer by cropping the top and bottom of the image, wasting vertical resolution on \\"black\\" bars rather than viewable image. On 16:9 displays you get side bars too, so the actual displayed image is perhaps half of the available viewing area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Band, Bad DVD","review":"I don't know why everyone is complaining about the sound, the sound is fine!But the DVD is destroyed by the fact that the audio doesn't match up to the picture.

It distracted me, and I found myself doubting the rest of the concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Further Con","review":"From an Artist of Deception who is NO scientist. I just don't buy the arguments of those who admit Castaneda is a fraud, but his books are really, really interesting. Look, this book didn't make it to the FICTION best seller list, but to the NON-FICTION list. The guy tried to claim that the events depicted were literal actual happenings. In thinking, BE MATURE! How can you claim that the inventions of a liar are valuable spiritual wisdom? Why do you want to believe that? Why would you not instead prefer to find out the truth about REAL spiritual traditions that offer AUTHENTIC wisdom teachings, instead? If you buy into Castanedas fraud even to ONE iota--they you are letting yourself become a victim. Don't be a victim. Fight for your right to know the truth! Fight for your right to not be deceived! Fight for your right to know reality without the false embellishments. Don't give your money to these liars and cheats..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlos begins to see","review":"Castaneda's books are pure poetry. As with any experience not our own, I would encourage the reader to enter and explore the tale as one would slip slowly into a deep pool. Wonder at the possibilities that it contains, even if you are, like me, confined to the limits of \\"ordinary reality.\\"No book on true spirituality is a how-to manual. Only by slipping into the cool silence of Castaneda's story can one hope to touch the wisdom which flows through it. For those out there looking for confirmation, this book is worth reading. For those bent on analyzing and questioning, learn to accept your own perpetual state of disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for sharing this with us...!","review":"It is a relly fantastic book. It gives you the oppotunity to see the world around you in a different poin of view, and I'm glad that he wanted to share his experience no matter what anybody said to him about his unusual apprenticeship. It is very rare that an ordinary person could met such a man with fine experiences of life and be able to have him within forever no matter of death or destinity, and therefore I admire him, and all of us who didn't had the opportunity as he did will learn and enjoy by all of his books.

Taken for the message of this book, I have learned what it means to be in line with the way of the warrior. A warrior is one who is not afraid of waiting and knows for what he waits. Patience is the theme of the author's account of the teaching of don Juan. No matter what you believe in (I'm most aligned with atheism), the practices of seeing and sorcery are tests that develop the will so that one finds himself able to embrace the mystery of the world and be in unity with all that is around him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drug travelogue not needed","review":"Sorry, but though I keep trying (it's at least a trilogy, after all), this story is just not interesting. Castaneda talks about alternate reality, but I can talk about one too. He puts this story forward as a true record of a meaningful other world out there. All I see is a guided drug trip by a Mexican Indian friend. A magical \\"ally\\" in the shape of a giant gnat? Come on. If you're drugged out and doubled over on the floor, and a gnat lands next to your eyeball, I bet that's what he looks like.At best this is a drug travelogue. At worst it's mediocre science fiction. I admit I did learn one thing from his wise guide's musings -- that we all talk to ourselves -- at least in our heads, and it's a challenge to shut up and listen to the world around us. But again, no drugs needed for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS AWSOME","review":"A separate reality was a great book.

As many of you know Carlos Castaneda past away some time ago so he will never be able to read these reviews.

I read it dilligently searching for the \\"pearls of wisdom\\" which never quite or completely materialize. It is weird and non-sensical but it sucked me in. Even though I had to push myself to finish it, I feel compelled to read more of his books. I somehow feel the total impact or lesson or whatever will only come upon finishing the whole series since that was the work of his lifetime and I'm sure it did evolve over time. In reading this one, I am getting that it was Castaneda who did not completely understand or completely/correctly convey the message of don Juan (at least early on). Why else would he spend 20 years with a man who seemed unable or unwilling to give a decent explanation for anything?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great mystery","review":"Another great mystery from Anna Katherine Green.

Josephine Humphreys portrays Lucille as an amiable and loveable teen that questions her identity. Because of Lucille's insightful personality and idealistic views, I was drawn to her character. Unlike your average teenager, Lucille possesses a mature and parental quality, as she looks out for the well being of her obsessive father who spends the majority of his time pursuing his wife.

Furthermore, I also find it hard to believe that Lucille could be so anaylitically mature for her age. I feel betrayed after reading this novel because Lucille was introduced to me as an innocent girl, yet in the end she turned out to be more malicious and different than I had anticipated, which I found discouraging.

Although Lucille is obviosly mature for 17, I think she had feelings and articulated them in such a way that was too complex for her age.

With nearly four hundred opus numbers, he has something to offer even the most discriminating classical music lover. This particular recording has a nice mix of concertos and duets for guitar and flute that seem to be the perfect combination for music that soars along.

These cartoons are all pathetic remakes of the original, hilarious series. It is a travesty that they can be sold as \\"The First Complete Season\\". They must be the first complete season of remakes. I saw the original Jetsons as a kid and when I started watching what is contained in this set---forget about it!!! I would have asked for my money back but the kid I bought it for wanted to keep it--since he didn't know the REAL JETSONS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash from my childhood","review":"This is so fun to watch. I loved the Jetsons as a child and wanted to relive some of the younger days. This was great to see some clasic cartoons again...to bad they are not on the air anymore.."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Happened to Season 2 DVD??","review":"OK Warner Brothers...let's keep them rolling along with Season 2 release! Fans want more of the Jetsons along with nice extras, and DVD quality prints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 2 info","review":"A few answers to questions and misconceptions about season 2 of the Jetsons. While season 2 was produced by Hanna-Barbera, it wasn't distributed by Warner Bros. it was distributed by Worldvision. Which may explain why it hasn't been released. Many properties owned by Worldvision (Tales from the Darkside, Monsters to name two) haven't been released on dvd.No, Season 2 isn't from the golden age of Hanna-Barbera, but indeed it warranted the return of it's three major voice talents, all nearing their 80's: George O'Hanlon (George Jetson), Penny Singleton (Jane Jetson) and Mel Blanc (Mr Spacely).For animation purists, this revival may not be as good as the first season, but it certainly doesn't deserved to be panned...it's fun and that's what cartoons are all about (isn't it?)By the way, buy season 1 - you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the future!","review":"It's great that all of these \\"classic\\" TV shows are now on DVD. They give me a chance to relive the good old days and when I show them to my little girl I know they're cute, wholesome & won't force her to grow up too soon! The best part is singing along with the theme song together. The Flintstones are next! Yabadabbadoo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classics","review":"ahhh the cartoons of old....so much better than the cartoons of today. I am so happy my 5 year old likes the old time cartoons it's a joy watching them with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOSTALGIC PLEASURE","review":"It's great to have and see this great program in its original season. Great childhood memories evoke as you watch this episodes. My family and I enjoy very much all the Hanna-Barbera series we've been purchasing: Flintstones, Top Cat, Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear. We are waiting for other series to be available: Shazan, Herculoids, rest of Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, Wally Gator, Ruff and Reddy, etc.My only complain is that the Jetsons, some of the Flintstones seasons and Yogui Bear does not include the spanish language too. No problem with our english, but the mexican /spanish original dubbing is outstanding (i.e. Top Cat characters have different personalities vs the english voices). The Jetsons mexican / spanish voices are no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Future was then","review":"I still can't believe there were only 24 episodes of the Jetsons. This show was always on when I was a kid. How many times did I see these episodes? 100? It's nice to have the boxset so that I can work myself from the first to the last episode in order and know that I have seen them all.While they're not as popular as the Flintstones, I enjoyed seeing the future according to Hanna-Barbera. When will I get a space car that turns into a briefcase?The bonus features aren't that amazing. But I'm happy with the set at the new lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I love this DVD set. My kids had never seen the Jetsons before. They look forward to each episode now that we own the first complete season. I look forward to owning season two when it is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"well, well, well ...Carla, you did it again","review":"This is definitively Carlas best...The compositions are tight and very original (check samples)and as the title implies, it is all about mechanical structures with looser parts all around. The solos by some of the guys in the band are amazing ....not that they are fast or anything...they are totally original and wacky for the most part, and fit well with this type of music. In this period i think Carla did her best music...check \\"social studies\\" if you like this one. Highly recomended to Jazz , jazz rock and progressive / avant garde music fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE PHONY SONY BALONEY ABOUT SXRD LAMP LIFE","review":"The lamp for my SXRD 60A2000 last just one week longer than the 1-yr warranty period. Without warning it just went Phht. So much for the lamp warning message Sony so proudly yaks about it the manual. BALONEY.4 hrs a day should have gotten me 3_ years. But reality is just 1 yr of service per lamp and then you have to spend 10-percent plus of original sale price to replace each year. I would never have bought this TV if I knew I would have to do that.PLUS, the phoney sony baloney people at sony style said my extended warranty would cover lamp replacements...but now of course they do not cover \\"consummables\\" (i.e. lamp replacements)Run away as fast as you can fgrom PHONY SONY BALONEYYes I am a disgruntled customer and you will be too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamp blew after 18 months","review":"Without warning the lamp went. We were nowhere near the 8,000 hours of use that SONY predicts the lamp will serve us before it burns out.Went to the store where I bought it and spoke to the same salesman who sold it to us. He didn't say a word. Took my paperwork walked over to three different computers and typed in a bunch of numbers and letters in each one. He wrote a phone number down and handed my paperwork back to me. He would not have said a word except I inquired if this was common for the lamp to go so soon. He told me that the lamp on his TV was five years old and he had heard of others lasting a year or less. Not very comforting.Called the number and spoke to a woamn who didn't want to hear about complaints she only took orders. So for $285.49 I get a new lamp in two working days. Not happy at all. Will not buy another SONY or go to Bernies again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets all of my expectations.","review":"I'm totally satisfied with this purchase. Great picture. Solid features. Digital tuner works great with an antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one by","review":"This is a rare find, a book for which I'll bother writing a bad review.This book has things like \\"Create your own faery being for protection.\\" And essentially, how to pick out a type to order around and use. Obviously the author would not do well at a Peter Pan show \\"Do you believe in Fairies?\\" Edain McCoy in this book teaches disrespect, at a time its really not needed. As some other reviewer recommended, read Katherine Briggs - who was a great author on the subject of Faeries. Courtesy is important and valuable in dealing with the Fair Folk. This book is horrible, badly written, the scholarship stinks, even if its premises of how she would have people treat the Folk (if they allowed it) don't offend a person. The seeker for the Faery tradition would be looking elsewhere, and confused what to do with this item should it arrive - do they burn it? Can they get it recycled?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely sight but confusing","review":"When I saw this book it cought my attention immediately, the title couldn't suit me better and the art on the cover is magnificently gorgeous. However dissapointed afterwards at all the myth about the Fae! It's a mixture of a bit of truth and a lot of myth and superstition.The rituals are somewhat nice and it contains some interesting information such as the Faery Dictionary, not that I think anyone CAN put faeries into a dictionary lol. Overall it's a nice book to read if you want to learn about faery myth and superstition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book is an excellent guide for people who are interested in working with the fae. I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice book, but some fluff...","review":"Edain McCoy has another good book with Faery Folk. It is a must-have for any collector of all things fae, however, like many Llewellyn publications, there is a percentage of questionable material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Total turn off!","review":"The reading in this book was interesting enough, but it was hardly a decent work on the subject! It was more like fantasy, and McCoy should have marketed it as the fiction it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"much better resources available","review":"Written in fourth-grader style, not well researched, and frequently inaccurate. Author quotes books of nursery rhymes, Mother Goose, Brian Froud, the 'Enchanted World' series of Time-Life books, and her own works in the bibliography; the closest this book gets to genuine research is an abridged version of Frazer and a speculative work of Joseph Campbell's.Use this book for magic at your own risk!Or, save yourself the trouble of having to relearn the right information later, and instead buy a copy of Alexander Porteous' The Forest in Folklore and Mythology."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"Oh my God, After reading this, I feel I must repent! Since I'm young I've been praying to Mario and Holy Peach! I really believed that they were the only mean to salavation... I was blind, but now I see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Story + Elegant Watercolors:=Ageless Picture Book","review":"I picked this book because I love turtles and I was intrigued about what on Earth (or anywhere, for that matter!) the Broken Truth might be....Through Douglas Wood's narrative, I was taken to a land where every stone was a teacher and every breeze a language, where every lake was a mirror and every tree a ladder to the stars.....And then in a brief moment, the sight of the Broken Truth falling to the ground in an especially poignant watercolor by illustrator Jon Muth.I found the unfolding story to be told gently and with great care. As one other reader noted, it echoes so clearly many of the challenges which are inherent in humankind today.And then, on the other hand, I am very familiar with this place where every stone is a teacher, every breeze a language, every lake a mirror and every tree a ladder to the stars.... Very worthy read... and very worthy of sharing with children and grown children everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most children's books aren't just for children...","review":"This story of a broken truth and the secret to peace and happiness is a remarkable tale for children and adults. Children may not grasp the full meaning of the story, but they may appreciate that it is a child who helps the world. Adults will find that the simple truth gives them chills. The watercolor illustrations are as beautiful as the tale.I bought this book for my friend's birthday. Once you read it, you, too, will want to share it with those around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are all loved.","review":"We enjoyed this book very much. I think it has a good moral to tell. The humans only have of the truth and really begin to worship it and fight over it. Eventually a small child finds the other truth and unites them all. I have it recommended for grades K-3rd but I would recommend it for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas wrapping?","review":"I found this tape in a discount store years back not knowing what to expect, but it was worth the price. I have quite a collection of christmas music, so this one-of-a-kind collection of holiday favorites rounds it out. It was well done and with precision, but not musically ingenius. They present a mix of both the religious carols and 'fun' songs, but all done in a high spirited way, making them fun to listen to. Whoever this Crew X is, they get a thumbs up for innovation and delivery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RAP with a C!","review":"This 1992 recording is so out of date in terms of current rap that it is painful to listen to. We did not get through more than two songs before we opened the car window and did a full eject, Please put a disclaimer on this CD to forewarn customers that this CD description is deceptive.Caribbean Kevin"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment","review":"I have been searching for a copy of a particular Percy Sledge track 'Thief In the Night' for some time now and to find it on this newly released album was a real treat. Unfortunately the Album is not. The recording quality is appalling, muffled and with waivering intro's. I have heard better on home made vinyl to Cd conversions. There's plenty of Percy Sledge around, so don't dwell too long considering this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a fan to a fan....","review":"Kent brand of journalism has the distinct voice of a true fan behind it. He lays out the histories of such luminaries as Brian Wilson and Miles Davis, as well as tragedies such as Syd Barrett & Brian Jones, with humour and insight. His sketch of Keith Richards and the Stones' decline has to be the most entertainingly anecdotal I've ever read. Just four stars, though, because of his rather cranky disregard of Kurt Cobain in the postscript, as true as it may or may not be. Otherwise, excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Nick Kent does not fall for the pretentious...spewed by many rock stars. His writing is intelligent passionate and best of all funny. Does anyone know where I can most easily read Kent's work now? I've been dying to read what he's done since 1995. Thanks in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Rock, bar none.","review":"Can't remember how I first found this book, but it has been my favorite ever since I picked it up. I was only buying extra copies on Amazon to give as gifts. Personally I prefer Nick Kent to Lester Bangs, but that is just a taste thing.Buying The Dark Stuff and Please Kill me would bookend a fabulous book collection on late 20th Century Pop Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellow-House is better, but this is still good","review":"Because this album tends to be a little more random and spacey than yellow house, I find it slightly anxiety producing, but overall I think it's a great album, but for me, only when I'm in the right mood..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"I bought this CD after listening to one of the songs remixes. I expected somthing more of a trip-hop nature. Nidless to say I was complitely disapointed with the style of the Grizzly Bear, wainy and mindnumbing. But I have nobody to blaime, but myself. Should of listen to more samples. I guess this type of music is way too depressive for my taste. I doubt I will ever listen to this CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH ! ! !","review":"I own a restrauant and we use these hammers to break up big clumps of ice. One came with the handle loose at the head; and the other one had a big crack in the handle, 4\\" long.A friend got me 2 more for half the price and no defaults. If it would be worth my time and trouble I would demand my money back. I'm just to busy to deal with the little stuff.Buyer beware.Thank you for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear scope","review":"The definitive book about the effect of death on human culture is Becker's Denial of Death. This meandering tome pales in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand the positive reviews","review":"Apparently the lead actor in this movie is famous in Australia or something, but I've never heard of him before this. It seems like the other reviews are written by young girls who like him.The storyline seems a little old at this point, the actor doesn't come off as much of a \\"victim\\" considering that he did sleep with the girl. Which also brings up the point of *how* exactly did he sleep with her?Cliche scenes that have been done many times before, not scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"The description of the movie sounded like it would be interesting, but after watching it, I was seriously disappointed. Most of the movie moves very slowly, but then the end is very abrupt. It would have been much better if there was more of a build up throughout the movie, and also if the ending would have gone on a little longer. The way it is presented is like they ran out of money and had to cut it where they did and left it incomplete. I may not have felt that way if they would have explained things a little better, but this film was very poorly constructed."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],W={key:0},B={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-0f2e9261"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/32.md","filePath":"people/32.md"}'),R={name:"people/32.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
