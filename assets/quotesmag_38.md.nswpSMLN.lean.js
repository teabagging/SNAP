I was looking for more extensive and dynamic exercises, ways to improve all around performance that I wouldn't see other places.

Grant Morrison has a real talent for ending his major story arcs, and this book, ending Volume two of the series, is no exception.There are a lot of twists and turns and the story benefits greatly from it. A number of loose ends are tied up and really shows another talent of Morrison as a storyteller. The Invisibles, through most of the previous series, seemed to be messy and out of control, but he reigns it all in and begins to form the whole picture for us.The last issue is a real testament to the creativity of Morrison. I admit, the added violence in Volume two was surprising, but in the end it all seems to be part of a much bigger plan.This book has it all and the increased clarity makes the previous stories more enjoyable. There is a real sense of closure in the end.Isn't it exciting to know there are 12 more issues to read?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Success Indeed","review":"I work for a real estate firm that is small in number of staff but not in volume of business.

I am amazed daily how the information in this not very large book really makes a difference. Not only am I more efficient - I'm less crazed. And that's way more important - less stress at work definitiely means a better quality down time!! I think that Stan Dubin has done a real service to the small business.

For those topics, I recommend the much more current books from Western Horseman (available on Amazon, too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional with questionable design","review":"The Master Lock Bike Rack for four bikes works but it is a cheap and poor design. The bikes are held on by a separate piece of metal with padding that bolts on to the rack. Every time you need to mount or dismount the bikes, you need to spin off three bolts rather than a clamp or even two bolts. Three bolts would be fine if I were a Martian with three appendages with opposing thumbs but with two paws I can only turn two at a time and have to constantly switch bolts. The second complaint is that the reciever hitch part is too loose and wobbles in the hitch. For the price it is a good idea to dig deep and pay a little bit more for a more convienient model."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book provided a bond between my Father and I.","review":"This book is just a silly little book about the journey of a bad baby who is ungrateful.

However, this is a great film with suspense and drama that is truly entertaining while being disturbing. A low budget film that delivers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHIN', BUT ENDED UP BEING NOTHIN'...","review":"We've seen the story before, but for some reason it's always great to watch: nerds in high school battered & abused by their popular classmates seek revenge to teach them all a lesson...in grisly ways! However, this movie turns out to be nothing special. The only twist is it actually sort of defends the popular \\"victims\\" instead of the nerds they abused. Pretty odd, since most similar movies always root for the underdogs. Despite the nerds planning out some pretty great torture treatments with a grand finale, it ends with them realizing they're being too \\"brutal\\" and attempting to end the cycle of violence. Gag! The only upside: one of the main nerds is from DeGrassi, the Canadian TV show. So, that's about the only positive here. To sum it all up: if you like cheering the high school sad sacks on in movies and seeing the mean pretty people suffer...then skip this preachy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story but poor execution","review":"The story is very realistic and you really sympathize with the characters that were bullied. Unfortunately the middle part of the movie fell quite below average. When I say middle I mean basically 80% of the movie. I was sitting there thinking \\"what the hell is going on\\" several times during some of scenes. To some degree I was thinking \\"that doesn't seem that bad\\" but maybe my mind is just much sicker than the director. Also, the acting for MOST of the characters was also pretty bad making a lot of the scenes seem less believable. That said, it does end the movie fairly well.To some it up, start and end is good. Middle is bad due to poor execution on both acting and not so interesting scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tourtured souls","review":"After Dark delivers the type of movie for those who have been stepped on. It tells the story of outcast kids at a high school who plan out revenge on their torturers, bringing them to a deserted ranch for what they think is a party. But when they awake from the drugs there given their placed into a nightmare, and made to suffer as they made them suffer. One of them is left in a wheelchair for the rest of his life, a girl losses her fingers on one hand and her face is scarred for life. One boy manages to get free and gets help from a neighbor who served in the Vietnam war, calls the police and the remaining outcasts committ suicide to avoid prison. The movie closes with the girl with the scarred face trying to live her life and discovering that this was what her victim was trying to do, and its next to impossible for her now as it was for her. A good independant horror film to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Ridiculous. The acting was way over the top, the punishments were vague and ill placed. There wasn't really a lasting impression made, on anyone. I finished this movie feeling disappointed for the outcasts and for myself for wasting 90 minutes of my life on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me my time back...","review":"EVERYTHING about this \\"film\\" screams amateur at the top of it's lungs. The concept is intriguing, but the execution could not have been worse. It must have been slim pickings at the After Dark submissions office for this turd to sneak through the cracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary at all and not bloody enough","review":"This felt more like a drama than a horror movie.There was only one scene where body parts were actually cut off and it was very fake. It was the finger scene and it looked like carrots being cut.There wasn't enough blood or .. well... horror.The movie felt like it was censored for broadcast television. Sort of like those old A-team shows where there's lots of bullets flying but nobody is ever shown injured or dying. I didn't see anyone die in this film. Even when people were shot, it was done outside of the view of the camera. Lame!And whats up with that 1970's jalopie police car? I know budgets have been cut but that's ridiculous. They could have spent an extra $500 and bought a modern car model to use. Attention to detail?I knew this wasn't going to go well in the opening scene when the supposed high school students looked like they were all in their 30s."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISH SERVED COLD","review":"Revenge forms the core of this brutal film. \\"Different\\" teens who have been bullied all their lives turn the tables on their persecutors. As a film out to explore the psyches of all the teens involved, there is a certain pleasure in seeing the jocks and the \\"mean girls\\" blubbering for mercy. But the vengeance is so brutally served, it makes the nerds more despicable than the bullies. Isn't it possible that Dane and company are just psychotics using bullying as an excuse for their own failings? Victims are only victims because they allow it and blame society for \\"failing\\" them.The movies is effective but has some plot holes and its tortures ultimately empty and unjustified. Horrorfest 4 is not very impressive this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorky","review":"The movie was not worth the very cheap price of rental. Free, maybe.

A bunch of amateurs killed a potentially awesome movie. Well, I'm disappointed. I'm a little over a half ways through and I think I just want to skip to the last few parts, it's just too weak to watch. It was laughable and pathetic.Was it seriously hard to guess who the bad guys were from the victims' point of view? I mean seriously, they did drop some major hints.

Hardly the case. This is a good cd. Contrary to other opinions, I think it gets better as it goes. The first two songs seem to be transitions from the first cd, then it really gets interesting, with taste of Ozzie, Def Leppard, and White Snake. The songs, It Should Have Been You and Winds of War are classic. Winds of War sounds like it could be a Kansas song. The bonus track, though a good song, is just that, as it does not mix well with the other songs. Overall, the songs on this cd are better than the first cd minus the all-star musicians, though the musicians here are great especially Mike Slammer. 4.5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Higher expectation than I thought....","review":"Well, when an artist releases a debut album, he wants to introduce his \\"Sound\\", then, the second one is to set what he has been done and make it better, not in this case, I felt a little disappointed (just a little...)in this The Raging Fire, less \\"rest-songs\\", less invited guests, less inspired melodies, the best ones are The Sun Will Rise and the hit Always From the Heart, the first one is still a \\"Classic\\", if you like it, you can also get \\"Power from Kansas\\", which is costing a budget around, if you wanna have this Raging Fire, go for US edition, which comes with an extra song, I bought the imported and missed it....(but I'll buy the US Ed. later, when the price falls down down down...eh-eh-eh...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy, What happened?","review":"I expected more from this CD.

The french, spanish, and german voices were not too bad. I was also disappointed that I could not figure out how to enter pinyin chinese and radical chinese characters, even after reading the poorly written manual three times. The clincher for me was that the headphone jack did not work, it just muted the voice feature altogether. The unit does have an AC jack, but does not come with an AC adaptor.

It took me about 15 min to have ease with all the buttons and what they do. **Don't count on the phrase book to help you any - that's bad!

Well, I got the look, not so much the sound.Sadly, I really can't recommend these headphones. First off, they felt cheaply made. And you can't turn them up loudly without a lot of distortion and the sound isn't very crisp at all. The highs, mids and lows sound like they are all being squeezed through the same frequency, if that even makes any sense. There is very little separation of frequencies.I wanted a vintage look and great sound and got only the look. So, I returned them and went on Ebay and bought a pair of vintage Koss Pro4aaa's from the early 80's. They're made better, more rugged, and sound awesome.

This all in all makes for a much better listening experience. Also they are about twice as loud. This is no doubt largely because of the superior isolation and snugness.Also the build quality is fantastic. I don't see these breaking any time soon and that was the main reason I got them!The inner part of my ear lobe rubbed against the inside/unpadded part to the point where it was noticably red and irritated... no matter how I tried to position them. I fixed this by inserting some light thin foam padding... something I feel they should have done to improve the comfort of these.When I need more sets for my studio I'm building, I'll probably buy several more of these unless I see something better... but for the price I doubt it! :-)I give em 4 out of 5 because of the lack of inner ear padding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculously awesome sound.","review":"These phones are heavy, a bit awkward, and look a bit dated unless you want to look like your about to construct aircraft carrier traffic.

Nothing has changed in the last 20+ years. They are still great headphones, and they still weight too much. However, you cannot beat the sound, and if you are listening while hanging out in the house or at your desk, there is no significant issue with the weight. If you plan to go jogging, you may want to consider a lighter pair.UPDATE: Since writing this review so long ago, I finally bought a pair for myself. They are just as I remember my father's.

For the price and sound quality they are excellent. As to the weight, I don't really notice it. One thing that you'll notice if you buy these, is that you'll discover more of your music, in some cases. (In the case of Ayreon and Billy Cobham for me.) In other cases, you may discover that the music doesn't sound as great with the headphones, and it could leave you a bit disappointed.

However, when I received the unit, it had some type of two-tone color scheme, including some green, and definitely not all beige, as displayed. In the insert on the display ad, was a model in green, but no way to choose on the order blank. The headphones are very tightfitting and heavy and, after a while, become too uncomfortable to wear. The headband is not flexible. While the sound quality is very good, the tight fit and heavy weight of the headphones is just not worth the listen. When opening the box, the headphones could not be removed without tearing the box. In addition, the process to return the item was extremely difficult to follow. When adding up the cost for returning and restocking, along with the possibility that the damaged item might not be accepted, it was not worth the effort. So, I will try to find someone with a head size smaller than 6 7/8 and give the headphones away.Disappointed in Michigan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgruntled Koss fanboy","review":"I purchased an arbitrary Koss headset from a non-name electronics store in South Africa, which blew my mind with its quality for 4 full years before breaking whilst changing continents.

Koss normally sounds great to me, I am not an audiophile, but some headsets are better than others and Koss is the best I have heard. This set did not deliver on this basic actuality, and I drastically prefer the sound from even Porta pros over this.I don't know if my set is broken or not, or whether the 3.5 mm jack I am driving it from simply lacks the oomph required to make these sound decent.I consider myself to be relatively robust, and these headphones seriously put a kink in my neck, which I could tollerate if the sound quality warranted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Sell These With Aspirin","review":"The sound from these circumaural headphones is superb; no surprise judging from its excellent impedence and sensitivy ratings.

My biggest beef is with the title, because we're all free to envision alternative history as we wish, but the author's perspective seems to taint his assessment of the impact certain decisions and individuals could have had on the German war effort.

As other reviewers have noted, David is a classic narcissist and I've always found his political evolution to be interesting from a psychological angle since it clearly isn't from an intellectual or moral level (unless you enjoy viewing the erosion of the latter). This isn't an entirely worthless book however, reading it did remind me of how finite life is and how many more things there are to do with the precious time we have than in reading mash notes a bitter man on the wrong side of history writes to himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"They ran away from people like YOU, of course","review":"Oh, yawn.OK, we all get it.

Well, it's not--it's so much more than that. To my surprise, my 6 and 4 year-olds were thinking and asking questions about this book for days after we read it. This led to several long discussions (all initiated by the kids)about how we humans impact the environment.

Thus, within a couple of tracks, I find myself drifting through space enveloped by gentle atmospheric music, and next thing I know, I'm completely zoned out. In this collection of unreleased and B-sides tracks, Jonas Munk mixes up dreamy shoegaze and ambient synth sweeps with airy beats and soft vocals, that lullaby you into a deep, deep, deep well of oblivion. A few albums on my iPod are reserved for airplane travel (The Future Sound of London's Lifeforms is one of them - because of its \\"in between states\\" quality), and this collection, in no doubt, will be added to that list [I guess that explains why I only remember the very first tracks... heh].

The story has some unexpected twists and turns. Chris's character also grows and learns and the story is chock full of pop culture references, puns and literary quotes.

Instead, it has been replaced with a naive faith that CIA is simply too smart and professional to be fooled.Codevilla, from years as a Senate intelligence staffer, knows otherwise, and he chronicles one blunder after another.

Reading it, one does move through the different rooms of the author's life, and shares the whole range of her emotions and experiences. The writing style is quite lovely and lyrical, moving between prose and poetry and song, and connects with the reader's imagination to paint the scene in one's mind.The author, LeAne Austin, does what all good writers do. She takes her personal experiences and makes them yours. She takes her unique perspectivesand makes them universal. I'm sure everyone that reads this will find passages that they can relate to, that will bring back a cherished happy memory, or bring light and healing to an unhappy one.She speaks from her heart, and will speak to yours.

It is a great story which derives its energy from two sources -- illuminating a great character (not true of all of Perez-Reverte's books), and bridging the gap between two types of literature (the narcocorrido and the literary novel). Anyway, as all the reviewers say it is completely entertaining and engrossing, and it has all of Perez-Reverte's usual strong points (I know much more about the fine points of drug smuggling and bars -- cocktail and sand -- on the Costa Brava than I used to).I understand why the Alatriste books haven't been translated into English, but this one should have been for sale in English long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small & Expensive To Make","review":"After I purchased this item, I said to myself....\\"Why am I going through all this hassle and expense of making such a small quantity of ice cream when I can just buy a half-gallon of ice cream at the grocery store every week for around $2-$2.50 on sale????\\".You will say that to yourself to if you buy this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries not included","review":"I just received my Panasonic BH-941P Ice Cream Maker and was real excited about using it but no batteries was included.

It sounds like a wonderful idea to be able to pop the whole unit it the freezer and magically get out ice cream, but the way that good, smooth ice cream is made is to freeze the mixture _fast_. Having ice or a bowl with frozen gel allows heat to quickly conduct out of the ice cream mixture, discouraging the formation of large ice crystals and creating a smooth result. This unit, however, relies on the cold freezer air to freeze the ice cream over hours. The result is a grainy mess. High-fat mixtures do a little bit better (the formation of ice crystals is limited by all of the milkfat), but forget ice milk, frozen yogurts, or frozen fruit desserts. The result, quite literally, will not be much different than if you just placed a bowl in the freezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good but way too small...","review":"This is a nice little unit that is way too samll.

It too started ripping and fell apart. Now they say the warranty was fulfilled so they will not replace it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent introduction to mass transfer and separations","review":"I used this text for a junior level mass transfer and separtions course at Michigan State University. It's a good book because it covers everything from the basics of formulating mass transfer models to convective mass transfer to distillation, absorbtion and extraction, but I believe the book is better suited to graduate students or chemical engineering professionals. My undergraduate course only made use of the second half of the book, and I didn't feel it had enough design and application material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreamly Poor Quality","review":"I ordered this book because it was required for my class. After seeing that a new book was about the same price as a used one I decided to go with a new one thinking that I wouldn't be risking getting a book with missing pages. This was not the case. The book I received was in extremely poor condition. The first time I opened it four pages fell out and a many many more pages fell out. Recently I have found that the book is missing pages which are important to my course. I do not recommend purchasing this book from this distributor because they have poor quality control.

Dish out the extra bucks and get pampers which are great! they fit comfortably, they don't fall off like huggies (which fall off no matter how tighly you put them) and they don't leak, my son loves them and he is a wiggler(8 months and crawling strong!) and they are really soft. huggies has def. made a permanent pampers customer out of me! it's pampers for me wipes and diapers all the way! they have the best products out there hands down...hopes this helps you mommies out there and good luck with your little ones :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandson had allergic reaction to diapers","review":"Sent these diapers to my grandson size 4, he had an allergic reaction to them not sure what is in the diaper to cause this.

They are flimsy, the elastic is non-existent and the color from the diaper design leaks all over my son's thighs, and it makes them appear bruised.

I got the 150-something count size three, and I've had to throw away at least four CLEAN, unused diapers so far. When I gently pulled on the front strap to close the diaper around my 1 yr. old daughter, the strap has pulled completely off. I don't pull that hard. Very poor quality. Four diapers so far.

I do have to say that Pampers Baby Dry are less likely to leak at night since they have their new dry technology but as long as I don't give my daughter a lot to drink before bed, there isn't a problem.

It was dumb on my part but I didn't think about the diapers causing the rash until I got the next box that happened to be the older diapers that we used to love and the diaper rash immediately went away.

After put the diaper on my baby, the stuff in the diaper breaks and form several big chunks ever when the diaper is dry.

I was using Pampers and my son was developing a slight rash in the folds of his thighs so I thought that maybe it was the diapers that weren't fitting correctly in that area. I remembered seeing Huggies branding with the SnugFit design and thought maybe this would offer better protection. Well, I was wrong! Although these diapers seem to keep the leg area dry, his rash never subsided (only diminished after I used a plethora of powder every time), and almost EVERY time he would leak out of the top, especially during the nighttime. It's really frustrating to CONSTANTLY be changing and washing wet baby clothes. I will definitely be switching back."},{"rating":"1","title":"For newborn only?","review":"We had tried out step 1-2 when our baby was first born and it did a very good job and the diapers were very absorbent. However, problem arised when our baby is now 6 weeks old and the diapers did not fit any more. The cutting is already too small even she weighted only less than 9 lbs. I called Huggies 1800-544-1847 directly and the representative told me that different babies born with different shapes and likely my baby not fit the diaper's \\"cutting\\". I had tried out Huggies Supreme step 1, Papmper swaddler size 1 and they fit much better than Huggies step 1-2. Also, the Huggies said \\"step 1-2\\" means it is \\"a guideline to fit baby up to 15 pounds\\" only, and so it is ALL step 1 diapers and not mean the case contain both step 1, step 2 diapers. My overall experience is consistent with the majority of the other reviewers and found this product disappointing. Probably it is better labeled and be used as full-term \\"newborn\\" baby only for practical reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok diaper, graphics transfer ink and stain clothing","review":"The diaper works well but the outside graphics have stained my children's clothing and washing hasn't been able to remove it.

Since I was already placing an Amazon order I decided to add a box of Huggies Snug & Dry. What a HUGE mistake. They leak so easily that we might as well be putting him to bed without any diaper at all. I'm writing this review at 4:30 am because I just finished changing his sheets after another leak - the bed was soaked, but the diaper was barely damp! These work okay during the day when gravity pulls the wetness into the small absorbent area, but if they are laying down - forget it. Get ready for sleepless nights and wet sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain!","review":"When I purchased this item I used the \\"subscribe and save\\" option.

My kid gets a rash with any other diaper and pull-ups. These are better than the 'Natural Fit', because there is more padding and less leakage. The added padding is not tremendous- it doesn't inhibit movement and has helped cushion the falls of toddlerdom! I love these diapers and recommend them to all moms. The ONLY reason I don't give them 5 stars is that I've had to throw out at least 3 diapers per pack due to ripped seals or tabs. Still, I don't use anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leak and mess","review":"We bought Huggies and hoped they would be snug and dry and they were for the 1st hour or so, then they leak not from the sides,(like if they are wrong size) but from the surface, which I can't find the reason why.Liquid just sips through, even when they half full and you end up with clothes wet and your arm smelly when you pick up your baby.Contacted company which produces Huggies, they positive because of wrong size ( too big), but our baby within that size range, so I don't know what's wrong with them. probably will switch to another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Huggies + Subscribe & Save program!","review":"Using Pampers with our first son, we changed to Huggies by six months due to leakage & sizing. We started son #2 with Huggies from the start and have never had an issue. I am a diaper changing fanatic, though, not leaving a diaper one for more than a couple of hours. We use Amazon subscribe and save and it's great! We don't have Costco as another mentioned, so I can only go on comparisons to Walmart, Meijer, Sam's Club and the likes. Pricing and convenience is a winner! We save money and don't have to rush out to buy diapers because we always know a supply is on it's way and the progam is so flexible - we've bumped up delivery dates without a problem. I recommend Huggies and the Subscribe and Save program!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pampers are so much better...","review":"I was given a case of huggies newborns for my baby shower, and proceeded to use them once she came home from the hospital.

When I was at a friends house on vacation I ran out of diapers and sent my spouse to the store for diapers, and he brought back pampers, well needless to say the rash was gone within 48 hours. I honestly believe that the diapers caused her rash. I haven't used them again since then, and she hasn't had another diaper rash since, and she is now 8 mths old!!!

We made the switch and ordered 3 boxes. Unfortunately, the diapers caused my boy to develop a bad diaper rash. We tried ointments with no luck. We bought a small pack of Pampers to see if it could be the diapers and sure enough the rash started to look better in a few days. He's since been rash free. I feel this is mostly due to the way the Pampers absorb fluids as well as draw them aware from the skin. If you have a sensitive skin baby, try Pampers and avoid the Huggies. Also, the Pampers tend to fit a little better, helping to eliminate leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad quality","review":"I used Huggies diapers before, that were good.

Leaks!","review":"We have tried several brands of diapers and different styles within the line from Pampers Swaddlers, Swaddlers Sensitive, Huggies Little Snugglers, Luvs, Kirkland and now these, Huggies Snug and Dry. Our favorites so far have been the Swaddlers Sensitive and Little Snugglers because it had the softest, cushiony quilt but they don't make them in size 3 and up. The Huggies Little Snugglers run a bit smaller than the Pampers Swaddlers. We've had rear blow-outs with all of these at one point or another but we've had the most with these Sung and Dry ones. The inner fabric doesn't seem to be as thick or as absorbent as the Little Snugglers and it is definitely not as well fitted. For breastfed babies whose poop is more runny, these don't work. They don't absorb fast enough and ends up leaking through the back when you lay baby down to change. Now we are off to try the Pure and Natural which a friend says is much better fitted and cushioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Diapers are cheap and plastic feeling...

This is the first time I've ever received a box where at least 1 out of every 5 diapers has one of the velcro tabs missing which makes them unusable. I realize with mass production things can be missed but I've never encountered so many defective diapers in one box.

Both of my boys leak through these thin diapers in about 6 hours. Which means almost every night.I have had better luck with generic store brand diapers than these.

No gaps that allow leaks. I definitely recommend these diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first but quality has declined","review":"This an update of a previous review. At first the Huggies helped to eliminate our baby's rash and we signed up for subscribe and save service. The last few boxes, however, have been a real disappointment. When you first open the diaper it seems the leg bands are stuck to the diaper (more so than any other diaper, including previous Huggies) and the strip inside the diaper seems off-center. The real dissapointment, though, is how much they leak even though diaper is fresh and nearly empty. We have had problems with the last 5 boxes (size 3) with leaks around waist and around legs, both in the daytime while playing and at night. We do not recommend these diapers and will be switching brands. After trying Pampers and Luvs we were surprised that Luvs did not leak and did not give him a rash and we will continue to use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked more than any other diapers we've tried","review":"As compared to the Pampers Swaddlers and Nature Babycare diapers, these leaked much more often. I tried these instead of the Nature Babycare for price reasons, but should have known that you get what you pay for. Before we tried these, we had maybe 4 or 5 leaks since our son was born (he just turned 1). We tried a box of these for a month, and he woke up soaked at least once a week. We tried the user tips of unfolding them all the way, etc., and that didn't seem to make a difference. We won't be ordering these again-it's not worth the mess, laundry, and baby being uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got cheaper","review":"I have been receiving these Huggies size 4 diapers with my Amazon Subsribe and Save subscription and have been very happy with them until now. However, when I got my latest shipment, I noticed they had a new design, and, now I see,they are cheaper quality as well. Although I had always needed the Overnites for overnight, now even during the day the outside of his diaper feels damp every time I change him. I think they are also stiffer and thinner. Oh well, we thought we had the ideal diaper for him, but now we'll have to reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky and smells funny","review":"Very dissapointed in these, now I know they are the cheaper of the Huggies brand diapers but I've had nothing but leaks and they have a terrible smell soiled or not.

From Swaddlers to Baby Dry to now Cruisers with Dry Max. My parents bought these Huggies diapers for my brother's kid who came to visit them, but they didn't end up using them. Figuring not to waste them, they passed them on to us. We used them and it seems like every single time she wears these diapers her onesie undershirt ends up wet or covered in poop. We took her to the dentist the other day and were totally embarrassed about the leaking on both sides of her bottom all the way through her leggings when we went in-- good thing she didn't care!

We didn't even purchase them and we regret using them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best diapers out there","review":"I have used Huggies for all of my children for years - both for boys and girls! Excellent leak protection and are not scented like other diapers (Pampers, Luvs). There are enough smells that go along with having children, who needs another one coming from the diapers?! If they begin leaking consistently, then you need to go up a size. I never use them all the way up to the recommended weight, we usually switch at 2-3 lbs. less than the weight on the package. Keep in mind some diapers will NEVER hold certain \\"loads.\\" Just part of life... Don't forget to join [...] for free stuff or to donate diapers to those less fortunate.

Great fit and at a great price from Amazon. A friend, who also buys hers from Amazon, warned me she was having issues with the new style and I should've listened. The night we opened the new box, my son leaked out onto his PJs by the time morning rolled around...and has every night since. Some nights I have had to change my 2 y/o in the middle of the night because his jammies are so wet. The diaper won't even be completely wet, yet it leaks. We never used to have this problem and I am extremely disappointed. I haven't noticed staining from the dye...yet. I guess I'll have to examine his clothes more closely. What the heck, Huggies???

Any how, my son would wake up wet EVERY MORNING. These wouldn't hold his urine. Not only that, but even if he wet in it once they had a foul smell to them. We had to get rid of these diapers ASAP. Going back to Pampers. Just not a fan of Huggies:("},{"rating":"2","title":"great daytime diapers","review":"I choose these diapers over any other brands for daytime use.

I've tried multiple brands of diapers (including store brands) and none have given us as many leaks as these diapers. Huggies have leaked on us 4 times now, with only using about 20 of them. That's too many leaks for me! I do have a son, and it seems people with little girls like these diapers. Maybe there just isn't enough wetness protection in the front? One of the diapers even came unvelcroed, which we've never had happen with any other diaper. I'm sure these work well for some, but they didn't for us. We now have about 170 diapers that we can't use, which goes against all my \\"smart shopper sensibilities\\".

But being an objective consumer, I really don't care what others said. This is the worst diaper brand, period. The material is thicker than Pampers Economy or Luvs, it feels sturdier. But somehow it doesn't absorb pee as good as Pampers Economy or Luvs. My baby butt always feel damp wet if I use this \\"entry level\\" Huggies brand and not as dry as Luvs or Pampers. About 20% of the time, the poo leak from the side. As a result, my baby has more diaper rash when using this Huggies Snug & Dry brand.

I stopped using these diapers, cloth diapered her for the day and she is now in Seventh Generation. The rash is fading. It was not diaper rash, it was from these diapers.

Unfortunately, I'm about to cancel my delivery subscription and switch brands. The past two shipments have both caused color transfer from the diaper to my son's thighs. Quite literally, the blue decorative stripe of color around the legs is rubbing off and discoloring my son's legs. This and some of the general green color combines into this god aweful bruise like color. The first time I noticed it, I nearly had a heart attack thinking my daycare center had caused horrible deep bruises on my son's legs. The daycare center thought the same thing about me. We are chuckling about it now that we realize it washes off with soap and water - but I won't be buying diapers that stain my child's skin. I don't know what Huggies changed, but it is unfortunate. They have lost a customer because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Product My Family Has Ever Bought.","review":"We bought these Huggies for my one-year-old, and they turned out to be a nightmare. They fail to hold his leakages. Every morning, we have to change his bedding covers, not to mention that we have to bathe him entirely. Furthermore, these diapers did not come cheap. They were quite expensive. We are asking that Huggies either refund us the money or mail us a new product, one which meets quality standards, etc. We are saddened that our consumer agencies are not doing their job to ensure that we, Americans, are fully protected against defective products such as these and a plethora of others.

Not only does he still go up his back, these diapers are not as soft, irritate my sons skin (and he's not sensitive to other stuff), and now he has daily leaks out the legs. Really an inferior product. I know...these are diapers, but more mess staying in the diapers means less laundry and happier baby. These definitely don't keep the moisture away from the baby's skin as well as Pampers either. Switching back now. On a positive note, Amazon has great prices on Pampers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huggies CHANGED","review":"I have been a die hard Huggies user since my son came home 6 months ago. We tried everything else, but that elastic in the back just makes for a better fit. Unfortunately, though, this last shipment I received was NOT the same diaper I've been using. There is now blue dye inside the diaper (one of the biggest pros for me was dye free next to his skin). They are also considerably larger than the last box of 4's.

My local wal-mart is still cheaper for these diapers, even considering that I pay tax there. But when Amazon runs the special whereby you spend $99 and later get a coupon code for $30 off a future purchase, you can't beat this deal. I use the $30 voucher for more diapers and I basically pay $0.99 for a case of 120+ diapers.

Especially since every diaper is stamped with a \\"1\\"? And they all fit exactly like a 1? These are fine if your baby is a true size 1, but when I bought them (right at the tail end of my son being able to wear a 1, just getting into a 2) they were too small. I had to buy size 2's in smaller packages at the supermarket. The warehouse clubs by me all offer these \\"size 1/2\\" diapers.Otherwise as far as Huggies diapers in general are concerned, Huggies are fine for some babies. Babies do come in different shapes; a diaper that is perfect on one baby will cause leaks on another. It's hard to judge the general quality of a diaper based on a review. You really should buy a new brand of diaper in a smaller package to make sure it's going to work for your baby before you buy huge economy sized packages."},{"rating":"2","title":"to the person that said they leak after 3 hours","review":"well, after 3 hours of not changing them - you wonder why your baby got a diaper rash? i didnt think i'd write a review about a diaper - but, common now - common sense would tell you that sitting in your own pee for 3 hours would cause a rash! need i say more?

I have over 150 left from the box and am throwing them in the garbage. What a waste of money, and they're not even soft! They feel like plastic and are worse in quality than the ones at Walmart.

The only visual difference between the old/new diapers are a light blue background/tint on the new version while the older ones had a all white background/tint to them. It is not about how often we change the diapers, it is the fact that they changed the way they make them and we are \\"soaking mad\\" about it. The new Huggies are no longer worth it at any price!!!

It has kept many \\"near misses\\" at bay. I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 because they are not as soft as the huggies pure and natural or pampers. We won't put our son in these overnight, because he will get occasional chaffing from the edges. We try to alternate with the softer pure and natural diapers during the day so there's never any chaffing. Once I did find a plastic thread sticking out of the diaper.

I switched to another brand,, which also had color lining, but it did not bleed onto the skin. I decided in October to give Huggies another try, I ordered size 4. The first inside pack was fine, but when I switched to the second, the dye started to bleed again onto the skin.

I was so happy to have had those diapers on a flight and I was singing Huggies' praises to everyone I met.But I bought these size 3 Huggies Snug & Dry on Amazon and they do not have a leak guard in the back. They have the snug waistband, but not that extra guard, which was the ONLY reason I loved Huggies. Without that leak guard, I might as well get just about any other brand.

As a matter of opinion, I slightly prefer Pampers, but I'll use either.Huggies are better constructed, they fit my son better than Pampers, and they seem to do better in terms of overnight use. The tradeoff is that, in our case, Huggies have a slight urine smell soon after they've been peed in. I've never noticed this with Pampers (except with overnight use). They're not nearly as bad as Luvs, which I absolutely detest, but I would choose Pampers over Huggies if the former were cheaper.On a side note, Amazon is the absolute best place to buy diapers!

We really really liked them, for a newborn. After he was out of size 1 we moved to Baby Dry, mainly because they were cheaper.

Pampers don't have the elastic over the butt like Huggies do (and at least one store brand), and holy cow does it make a difference. Twice now I've seen poo all the way to the elastic and then stop. Woohoo! For some reason they don't leak like they did before so these are our new diapers. They are also super soft on the inside and don't have that weird blanket texture that the Swaddlers have.

We tried the Pampers diapers from the hospital with my second son, but he had lots of blowouts in them. Huggies has been the only diaper that has consistently been able to contain everything for our babies. I find that when the Huggies diapers start to leak, it's time to move up a size and then the problem is solved.My only complaint about the diapers is that with white onesies the print rubs off onto the fabric and it doesn't come out in the wash.

With the 30% discount they rivaled target generics in price (my favorite diapers ever).Well, these diapers suck. Unfolding them is difficult because they are so stuck on themselves that it's actually tricky to open them up before using them! Several of them have structural integrity issues such that the little gel beads are easily escaping out of the diaper (there are holes in the paper that they are getting through).Tonight as I had another issue with them I decided that I would just use up what I had and switch back to the target brand.

I am very unhappy and called Huggies right away. They said they would refund me my money if I sent back the diapers. I am satisfied with their service but not the diaper.

Other brands do not have the amount of elastic to make them fit snug around baby's bum. The Supreme's do fit much better, but are not as cost effective. The Pampers do keep baby drier, but do not have the elastic to fit snug and therefore leak more than these. These diapers are used day in and day out here and baby rarely has diaper rash.

A cut better than Pampers - kinder on skin, unfragranced, and don't sag as much - Huggies diapers I think are best on newborns till when baby is learning to walk, so they don't sag and they hold a good amount of waste. I love the elasticized back that helps to contain less than solid poop within. However for toddlers, these diapers sag when a quarter full. The leg elastics are so stretchy they just give and give. Thankfully the side velcro tabs aren't that stretchy or the diaper will fall off as what I've experienced with Pampers, these will only stretch so far and then it stops stretching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I like the dryness on my baby's skin and hold a lot of pee and poop.My baby sleeps through the night with this Huggies with no leaks.But compare to Pampers Swaddlers, it is a kind of hard for new born.But overall we love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for the money","review":"With two kids in diapers, Huggies brand not only are a good value, but good quality also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Box of diapers came super fast.

I thought, huggies diapers are huggies diapers - but the moment I opened up the package for a diaper change, I immediately felt the difference. These that I had purchased through Amazon felt and are a lot thinner than those from Costco.

But then I noticed a TON of blowouts. My husband and I went on a two week trip and we bought the pampers size 2 while we were gone and didn't have a single blow out. We came home and tried size 3 of the snug and dry (since i had heard a lot of blowouts typically means its time to change diaper sizes) and we were back to major blowouts with my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huggies Snug & Dry size 4","review":"These diapers are great.

The diapers are great. He has sensitive skin and can only wear select brands of diapers - this being one of the best. It's so convenient to have them re-ordered and shipped without me having to do anything. Also, the discount on the price can't be beat! Thanks Amazon!!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"I've tried several different brands of diapers and these are NOT my favorite. They leak a lot, both urine and poo. The inner lining on these is stuck down and the diaper is not very well made in-general. (Found some reject diapers in each package) Pulling up the inner lining helped a little bit with leakage, but we still have leaking issues. I don't recommend these unless you don't mind having pee and poo leak everywhere. lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate Huggies!","review":"These are truly terrible. I've tried numerous brands including Pampers, Target, and Kirkland (Costco brand) and Huggies are by far the worst offenders when it comes to leaks, usually on the backside. Even when fastened tightly, they sag quickly which causes leaks. My preferred brands are Pampers (on the expensive side) and the Target brand (inexpensive and keep baby dry throughout the night)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied customer here too!","review":"I got a box of these as a gift and was excited it had size 1 *and* size 2. Like others, I found only size 1's! My baby is on the smaller side and still couldn't fit in them once she reached 12lbs. I normally use Huggies Supreme, which I'm fine with, but I wish they had these megapacks in Supreme and will never use the regular Huggies again--they don't hold as well and the elastic parts come off easier than Pampers (and Supreme). If you want good diapers, you'll have to spend a few bucks more (and less on diapers!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Diapers. Here's a little advice.","review":"I like Huggies. I also like that I have figured out how to use them. First, you must make sure to \\"open\\" the diapers before you start to change your baby. The elastic is folded into the diaper and a gentle tug of your finger will flatten it out. Second, you must make sure that the elastic is not bent inward when you put the diaper on your baby. Follow these two rules and you shouldn't get many leaks. (You may be able to tell that these rules are based upon experience.) Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huggies- please return to old diaper style!!","review":"We loved Snug and Dry diapers until they updated to a new look. There's two huge problems with the the new diaper- the cyan color transfers to clothing and we received more than one bad batch which just leaked right through. We noticed the \\"bad\\" ones are manufactured in 2010 and the ones we love are manufactured in 2009. We could tell as soon as we opened the package that the diapers looked and felt different. Please return to the old diaper model! We're be switching to another brand until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad batch of diapers - will ruin clothing","review":"I have used Huggies for four years and two children and have been very happy... until recently. The Disney Babies pattern is terrible. The dyes rub off on the baby's clothing, staining onsies (and all else that touches the diaper) blue. It does not come off in the wash. You will ruin clothing with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diapers get even better!!","review":"I love Huggies diaper. The feature I like the most is the stretchy waistband, the best out of every diaper in the market. Also, these diapers absorb wetness quickly (reducing leaks) and feel dry even when wet (reducing diaper rash). The Baby-Shaped diapers (with Lion King characters) are now Snug and Dry (with Mickey characters), they are considerably softer than Baby-Shaped (inside and out), and the waistband has more folds than before so it is even easier to fit the diaper around baby, which is great. Other than that, they haven't changed much, and it is still the same great product, just getting even better.I have tried Pampers Swaddlers, Pampers Baby-Dry, Luvs, White Cloud, CVS, Especially for Baby, Top Care and I regret not having tried Huggies before I tried all those other brands. This is by far the best diaper out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new versions LEAKS","review":"Always loved Huggies ,but the ones with the bigger/brighter Mickey designs always left me leaky and wet diapers!!

Upon further research, I found a lot of parents with the same issue posting in various online communities. The common denominator appears to be Huggies Diapers. The dye from these diapers rubs off and absorbs into baby's skin. The dye doesn't wash off in the bath and only comes off with rubbing alcohol. I won't be using Huggies anymore.

Amazing.

Practically everytime my daughter has pooped. Everytime I would see that face, I would cringe and reach for the back of the diaper to try to contain the mess. No kidding, practically every time she pooped, it came out the back of the diaper and onto whatever she was wearing (and whatever was around that). They were great for pee and overnight pee, but I shouldn't have to panic everytime I see her about to poop while she is wearing a diaper!Note also: I switched to Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive which, for the most part, contained the poop, but gave my daughter a horrible rash.

Too bad... it was nice having them delivered to my doorsteps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You might as well buy store brand","review":"These diapers are terrible in comparison to the huggies little snugglers or pampers. They are a rough texture on the outside which rubs up against my son's legs. When he poops it comes out the sides or the back 9 times out of 10. In fact, I'm surprised when it doesn't come out, that's how often it happens. I have NEVER had that happen with other diapers. I realize babies have explosions up their back once in awhile, but not 90% of the time. They feel cheap...and I feel cheap putting them on my baby! I might as well buy the store brands because they are cheaper and I will get the same results. These fit more like small size 1's.

I am definately disappointed with these. They leak up the back and through the legs everytime my son poops. The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is only because the urine doesn't leak. Unfortunately, I bought a ton of them when Amazon ran their Huggies $30 off $99 coupon. Take this mom of 5's advice and spend the extra money on Huggies Supremes, or buy Luvs or Pampers instead. In my experience it is very rare to have leaks like this with the Luvs, Pampers or Huggies Supreme. These other brands have a much tighter fitting elastic leg band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked!!! Save money and aggrevation and try the Target brand","review":"My husband got a 36 pack of Huggies Snug & Dry for about $9 at WalMart during our trip.They leaked two nights in a row.

It was very disturbing for a whole family during our precious vacation days, all because of the leaking diapers!These are neither snug, nor dry. I discovered the Target brand diapers at one of the forums, and after trying them out, I switched completely away from brand name diapers.

However, my major complaint is that the wetness is not absorbed evenly; it is mainly absorbed at the front of the diaper, which creates a big lump on her front side, and the rest of the diapers is practically dry. This causes the wetness to work its way up and leak through the front and sides of her clothes.Another issue I have is the adhesive on the diaper. Apparently, Huggies makes the adhesive to only be used once. What I mean is that when you remove the straps to check to see if the diaper needs to be changed or not, the straps will not stick back on well, which causes leakage every where else such as the back and in the leg area because the diaper eventually loosens up as she moves. I think I'll switch back to Pampers and see how that works out."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"These diapers are perfect, no complaints!

My son had no problems with rashes with the other diapers, but he actually got a rash every other day that we used these diapers. We had bought these instead of Huggies Pure and Natural to save some money, but we had to go back to the Pure and Natural because these were so awful.

It was very embarrassing when it happened at the DMV. I am almost to the point of throwing out the rest of my huggies and going back to Luvs. I gave Huggies a try since they were going to be the most economical. I typically buy Luvs. I am just tired of having to shampoo my carpets and change outfits on myself and the baby. I would say Huggies are comparable to the Kroger brand of diapers.

I use pampers and love them. I have also used the target diapers and like them. Both choices are sooo much better then huggies.

While Pampers Cruisers are really good in being leak-proof, they were not fitting well for my lean but tall baby. Then I went on to try others. Kirkland's are really soft and have nice fit for size 3 very much comparable to Huggies.Earth's best was so expensive with the \\"green\\" thing and wasn't working on my budget even though they are so leak-proof.Huggies through Amazon came out just fine with the fit, holding for 10-hr, soft and the design. With being Amazon-mom, I get the best price for these diapers as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Huggies Little Movers","review":"I previously used Pampers Swaddlers and Huggies Little Movers. But the only ones they had at Costco were Huggies Snug & Dry. I saw that the reviews for Snug & Dry on Amazon were decent and I figured they can't be too much different from Little Movers so I bought a giant pack. As it turns out that was a mistake. I don't know what the difference between these and Little Movers is but they simply don't last more than a few hours before starting to leak. That's fine most of the time during the day since they get replaced frequently but it's not acceptable for night time. And they don't handle larger bowel movements well either. Sorry to say that I'm very diappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, Leaks, and More LEAKS!","review":"My son is 10 months old. We have been loyal Pamper Swaddler Diaper users since he was born. When the price of the Swaddlers went up, I decided to give Huggies a try since they got such great reviews. I also know that Costco sells them and I love Costco's products. After using Huggies for just a couple days, my son was wet at least 2-3 times a day. These diapers were horrible! I am not talking a small leak, his pants would become saturated. I was very disappointed. Changing a fussy baby is not fun! I will be going back to Pampers Swaddlers.....paying the extra $5-10 so my baby is happy and DRY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huggies just don't work as well for us","review":"We should have known...we'll be sticking with Pampers.

I do diaper changes any time I notice it's dirty or just kind of wet and hasn't been changed in a bit - basically, what I'm saying is it's not like the kid was sitting in a super wet diaper for hours - yet the ink still leaked allover everything. I didn't really have any issues with leaking or blowouts, so that was a plus, but the fact that the ink leaks is reason enough for me to run back to my chlorine free, gentle Earths Best diapers in an instant!

I have also had the same problem with the Huggies overnights. I was so unhappy with this recent purchase that I switched to the Fisher Price brand diapers, which are ALOT cheaper, come with 2 bags day and 1 bag overnight diapers and I have had no problems with closures, sagging or leakage from any of them.

The diaper rash came back immediately. Our baby girl is very hearty and hasn't been allergic to anything yet, so I was surprised she had that reaction.

It is certainly stylish, well-crafted and engineered. But the click was loud, heavy, and sluggish - possibly owing to the fact that the left and right buttons are made of one continuous sheet of plastic, bent and split in the middle so as to provide separate contacts around the wheel. What's more, the height of the click panels is more than I was accustomed to. I began to develop a small ache after several minutes.All of this may be a simple matter of personal preference.

It is the longest history of Australia published. Clark has the reputation of being left wing and in fact in recent times sensational allegations were made that he was awarded the Order of Lenin by the Soviet government. These allegations would seem in retrospect to be absurd.Despite that Clark sees history as an epic struggle between forces which he sees as \\"good\\" and forces that he sees as \\"bad\\". His writing is torturous and filled with florid word pictures. The sun does not rise but rather but rather the yellow orb raises itself in the east.Clark has no real sense of economics or other issues as simply writes history as a chronicle. Whilst this book is dreadful the tragedy of Australia is that there is no competition. No one else has written more than a short history of the country.

I tried calling them and got a recording--figuring they were probably just busy because of the time of year, I also sent them two e-mails. So far I have not heard back. The shipping label was attached directly to the SINGLE pastry box (rather that being affixed to a larger cardboard box that could possibly hold two) and said BOX 1 of 1, so I know it wasn't a delivery service problem. They simply only shipped one of the two boxes that I ordered.Mistakes can happen to any company, but the fact that they are hard to get in touch with and won't return my e-mails is just poor customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy it in the mail","review":"mine came tasting old. it was in transit for 5 days in the heat.

Secondly, there are mistakes--pick your favorite series and browse and you'll find some--I did (in the SPACE:1999 section if you must know.) Also, each show is kind of reviewed but individual episodes are NOT reviewed, which was not the impression I got from the TV commercial. And there is even a British series that the channel shows (MONSTERS) that is not listed. Now, if you were the sci fi channel, wouldn't you at least make sure every show that you broadcast was in the book?? Now, I gave the book 2 stars because it does have an awful lot of info in one convenient place. Still, I would recommend that anyone interested in this LOOKS at it first. Don't buy it sight unseen.

So it costs me 14.00 for a piece of junk I had to send back.It's a fooler....the display suggests it has digital readout...but the reality is it has LED's behind a piece of dark plastinc.

The capture-top pillowcases are a failure--fabric is not generous enough to make the design work and the bottom sheet does not fit squarely. Additionally, the type of cotton used for these sheets could be sold as a lint magnet. Unlike any other sheets I have ever owned, they come out of the dryer looking like they need to be vacuummed and forget about hanging them on the line; you would just have to put them back in the wash.

Go ahead, buy the set--you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad.","review":"Unfortunately, after reading the excellent Consumer Reports review of these sheets, I bought two sets (cordovan and chamomile). They are not soft at all, wrinkle badly in the dryer, and look worn out from the moment they come out of the package. I personally think the stretchy side panels are gimmicky and don't look as crisp and nice as a regular sheet looks on a bed (ok, trashy is the word I'm looking for). But most important, I'll repeat--not soft. The best sheets I've bought were a random brand from Marshall's and were extremely soft and have worn well.

My husband and I like the feel of 100% cotton, and were looking forward to finding a set that would fit our bed nicely. The fit of the sheets is great. Wraps around the whole mattress without coming off on the corners. The sheets felt wonderful in the package, but after the first wash, they were horrible! I even used fabric softener and it made no difference. It felt like they were a polyester blend, very scratchy. We decided to keep the sheets in our closet for 'emergencies' only and found some wonderful sheets at Target instead. They are the new bamboo sheets - very soft, wonderful fit (even better than the Sealy), and wash very well. Sealy has it right....they do have a good fit.

Even Jenni who is just a livingdoll is walking around with this look of ..... fear on her face all the time. Yes its disquieting, yesits cringe worthy, no its not interesting, and it is absolutely not entertaining.I watched the entire season on DVD while they paraded through new character after new character that justdoesn't fit, and they are all mystified and terrified by Jeff who has by now just become a raving lunatic.Some extra behind the scenes features but honestly who cares.

No one else I know was interested in learning, so I thought a DVD would be the best option. When I got the DVD, I was a little worried because it looked pretty lame. But you shouldn't judge a DVD by its cover! The instructor is a little odd, but an incredibly good teacher and pretty funny. She's very thorough, so it's perfect for someone starting from scratch. Also, you don't need a partner to learn. Another plus! The music is done by a Grammy-winning polka band, the Versatones.

This product was in the range of the best price I was able to find. It worked very well to rake pretty much all of my back roof (~9' high at gutter) and the extensions were enough to get the important first 5' of my front roof (~15' high at gutter). It also has the nice rollers to protect shingles and is constructed of aluminum making it light in weight and rust free.

It would have required unwelding the bolt and reattaching it but not everyone has a welding machine at home. To the company, Curt Manufacturing's credit, they sent me a replacement part but it took nearly a month for them to do so. The person who spoke with me over the phone even said that he would check the part before they sent it out. Unfortunately, when the part arrived it had the EXACT SAME problem. This time I noticed they sent a thinner bolt that did not match the size and strength of the original which I believe was an error in packing on their part. So, if I could have given zero stars for this product I would. kudos for the company for trying to fix the problem but very disappointing that they couldn't live up the Made in the USA brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly suprised","review":"This cd gets its fair share of rotation among my ambient space music collection.

I wish this book had been around when I first learned my aleph, beth, gimel's. Ross has produced a triumph of an introductory textbook. Not only are the essentials of the language here, but much additional, yet useful information typically left for the student to dig out of reference grammars. Beyond the standard set of paradigms, basic syntax is covered well, and principles of word formation are treated with what I can only call elegance. Best of all, the final section teaches actual analysis of the BHS edition of the Hebrew Bible, including use of the critical apparatus. Let the spirit of prophecy come over me: Ross will become the standard for the next generation of seminary students!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminary Books","review":"As a seminary student, I need to use many books to effectively understand the subject matter.

I can't agree with that. It's definetely a literary gem of a novel, complete with excellently drawn characters and a deep sense of place and culture. Although there is high tension in the novel, it's more the characters that keep you turning the pages. I finished it in a couple of days, despite being busy with a hundred other things. I certainly recommend it.Charles GramlichAuthor of \\"Cold in the Light\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic dialogue","review":"Loved it!!

They don't have the all original cast member, and it isn't the same. The episodes aren't as funny as the used to be. Another thing this DVD doesn't come with extras like some of the other DVDs of el chavo that I have. What they added as addional material were 4 tv spots that are 30 seconds long each.

This was because the plot was thin, and I got a sense of \\"I've read this book before...\\" feel from the book,but mostly the book was not very interesting. For example, (without giving too much away), one of the characters betrays the rest of the team for reasons there were...well, not original. Out of all the reasons the authors could have used for a book that was set in the future, the character's motivation was not original. I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't.On a positive note, I thought the military culture written in the book was well written.

Williamson, the primary writer, does a fantastic job of creating engaging characters and keeping the pace of the story quick enough that you have a hard time putting the book down. His combat scenes are top-notch, gritty, and realistic.If the book has any weakness, it's that Ringo hasn't fully revealed his Aldenata universe to us, and that Williamson is unable to flesh the novel out with the backstory of the thousand year gap to save room for future novels set earlier in the universe.If you are able to look beyond that limitation, the book is incredibly enjoyable, well written, and just a plain fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum - Not \\"Ringo-esque\\" AT ALL","review":"John Ringo has a Rep for mind blowing Action stories.

Actually the ending is horrid. What I did enjoy was learning a bit more about the \\"Elves\\" as well as brushing against some other aspects of the Polseen universe and its history.Mr. Ringo is a skilled storyteller who has brought me countless hours of happy reading.

The parts about dusting the bald wig to make it seem more realistic for a kung fu master were very David Sedaris-ish. Salzman is funny and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Witty and Insightful Tale","review":"Mark Salzman tell a witty and insightful of his less-than-normal adolescence set in suburbia Connecticut and the culture of the 70s. The story follows Mark from grade school through college and with the recounts of his experiences; you might catch yourself laughing out loud. Mark trains to be an astronaut by sitting in a cardboard box, walks barefoot to school to attain enlightenment and does push-ups on asphalt covered with broken glass in an attempt to become a kung fu master. Many of these experiences and the characters in the book seem to be a bit exaggerated, but the exaggerations often make the story even more interesting. These hilarious and sometimes ridiculous experiences allow Salzman to explore larger ideas about adolescence and finding yourself and your relationship with the universe. I would recommend this book because it is an easy read, as well as comical and intuitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in Place","review":"Lost in Place, By Mark Salzman was a very attention grabbing book. I also thought that people reading the book could relate to him in real life. Growing up with a pessimistic father...it's hard to stay focused on one thing because you will always see yourself as a failure. I think that his main goal in life was to do something his father approved of and most of all something that made him happy.I thought this book was pleasureable to read. I know there are some depressing times that Mark goes through, but I think that it kept me intrested because I wanted to know what he was going to do next.I would definitley reecommend this book. I am a college student and I could relate to it, so I am sure that if a teenager Mark's age read it...they would find it to be more so related to their life. I think that it relates in the way of teenager's trying out new things and trying to please their parents.Great Book!

This one really is that funny. Teenagers will love it because they can relate to all the big questions being asked. Questions like, \\"What is the point of learning how to do anything if it doesn't really matter in the end.\\" And they will keep reading in hopes that the answers will be discovered. Older folks will nod at the lack of a good, concise, initial answer. Then after all the experiences are accumulated, the devastating revelation comes in one single word. What I want to know is this: \\"Why was Ozzy Osbourne mentioned on the back cover when his name appears no where in the text?\\" There must be publishers somewhere nodding at the lack of a good answer. Perhaps...\\"Sales.\\" Existential angst ensues. Somehow, is all this Ozzy's fault?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highly Recommended Read","review":"In reading Mark Salzman's Lost In Place, I felt that the narrative was an easy read and very interesting. The characters, with their unique antics and personalities, gave an almost humorous appeal to life and growing up in the suburbs. Although the characters themselves were not easy to relate to, the ideas that were the basis of the book (self-identity, motivation, coming-of-age) made this a novel that would be applicable to almost any brilliant mind. As a narrative, it is satisfying to know that there was someone who went through a similar childhood, wanting to impress those who were important and wanting to know the purpose of one's existence. Overall, the narrative was marvellously written, and I reccommend it to anyone who wishes to write their own novel someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"gib a keek, already !","review":"oi gevalt! after hearing the first few bars i was reminded of a schmaltzy little megilleh about Aunt Sophie walking in on her pisher nephew as he was trying to play \\"hide the kreplach with the shiksa\\".this musical excursion is gahntseh from bubkes to bruches already... in short, these shtayim-live (yet remarkably glatt) jews will make you plotz, and that ain't no trayfe drek. i hate to be a nudnik kvetching on about this already, so don't you be a shlameil - get off your tuchas already and shlep your mouse down to the \\"order now\\" button!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Listen To","review":"Fiddling With TraditionThis comic music is absolutely painful to listen to.

I would say that both books have unique strengths and weaknesses and choosing one over the other is more a matter of personal preference. The advantage to this one, however, is the value if you get it as part of the boxed set.Among the strong points of this book are the self tests and practice exam questions.

If you think this is \\"Princess Stephanie of Monaco\\" I suggest you come out of your shell and educate yourself! This is Stephanie who helped make '80's dance freestyle ( commonly known as \\"bubblegum\\" music ) what it is today. She was one of the first female artists to give us those bass-booming, latin beat influence \\"heartbreak\\" music. If you know anything about \\"freestyle\\" music you know what I mean. Look at Debbie Deb, Shannon, Meg, Judy Torres, and Cynthia ( for example ) and then you'll know where Stephanie fits in. Stephanie's \\"Get Away\\" album drops hard and rolling beats mixed in with a couple slow songs. Her vocals are fine and the production is exceptional.

I think the idea is just wonderful, and the illustrations are exquisite.The authors show that if we only open our eyes to every-day people, we will see how skillful they are in their jobs. It shows, for example, how a food carrier could be a STRONGMAN in the circus, and how a window cleaner could be a trapezist.I really agree with the idea, I think the circus is so great because it is a place where we open our eyes and our minds to the human abilities.

Dr. Lam does an excellent job at breaking down 6 fundamental forms from the Yang 24 routine. This \\"mini-form\\" is easy to learn (after you get through the challenge of understanding the ' brush-knee/twist-step' - probably the hardest form on the DVD to grasp). The warm up and Qi-gong finish are very gentle and useful. I highly encourage you to get this title if you are new to the wonderful art of Tai Chi. The other title I recommend for beginners is Terry Dunne's \\"Yang Short Form\\" - which is more in-depth, and very well produced (which is a rare quality with most Tai Chi videos)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This DVD is great for the beginner.

You'll get alittle confused at first, just follow the instructor and practice each step before continuing to the next one.

It may be fine for someone who knows the bare basics, but for someone who has never attempted Tai Chi, stay away from this one! Dr. Lam does, indeed, break down the forms, step by step - but he very quickly shows one step, very quickly you view the step with his assistant (from behind), and once more with \\"the class\\". That's it, move on, next step. Don't know how to *smoothly* get your hands from point a to point b because you were trying to pay attention to the feet? Don't know how to coordinate the feet & hands? Feeling completely akward? Too bad, next step! Definitely NOT relaxing and meditative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and Disappointing","review":"I've been very excited to try Tai Chi for a while now, but found it frustrating and ultimately impossible to watch Dr. Lam's video. Four key reasons why this didn't work for me:1) The pacing is all wrong. There is not enough time for me to emulate what the instructors are presenting before they move to something else. It also continually shifts from position to position, and I lose track of where I should be starting from and moving to.2) There is no philosophy taught behind the movements. I wanted to know a bit about the reason for each of the movements and the philosophy of Tai Chi.3) These are real-life people who have no stage training. Their talking is stilted and disjointed.4) The production quality is low. The navigational elements are minimal, and the studio set looks like a junior-high production.Ultimately, I'm now shopping for another DVD that I can actually watch and from which I can learn something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I'm confused how anyone could rate this DVD five stars??? Are Dr. Lam's friends writing in? This is by far the WORST instructional video I have ever seen. Talk about low budget...it looks like it was filmed in somebody's basement!I've never written in a review before, but I feel compelled to warn people not to be deceived here. This video is truly awful. A complete waste of money. Nothing to be learned. Sorry, but there is just not one single redeeming quality about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"made like an instruction manual","review":"This video breaks Tai Chi into pieces. The instructor of the film doesn't practice Tai Chi; one of his students stands by him (a mute white adult male) and moves through a given maneuver. He then holds it, and the instructor explains what he has done. After a short, uncomfortable silence between the two, the instructor nudges him to move forward, and the mime progresses to the next step.If you like reading manuals and don't want to watch this more than say... once... then I reckon this is a great movie. He does go through the steps, he shows very well and throughly what it means to hold your hand upright, what a \\"straight\\" back means, etc. This kind of piece-mail approach is thus somewhat scientific, though I felt entirely mechanistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAHHHHH!!!","review":"I can't believe this is one of the top-selling videos. This was the most excruciatingly boring video I have ever seen. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. If this is what I need to suffer through to learn Tai Chi, then forget it. Or maybe I'll take a real class..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I got this DVD for my husband, who has been interested in trying Tai Chi for a while. I decided to try it out first, and only managed to get through ten minutes of it. This video is painful, and I do not mean physically. The instruction is very poor, most of the movements are shots of the back of the instructors, and the set is honestly the worst I have ever seen. I agree with another reviewer that it looks like it was shot in a basement. This is the first time I have ever wished I could give a video 0 stars.

This means that the iPod volume control is not involved at all and you use the stereo to control volume. As the signal level coming out the dock connector is matched to what stereos expect at their line inputs, the sound you get using this cable is way better than you get from a cable hooked into your headphone socket.Buy this cable, it is way cheaper than a dock for your iPod, so it does not charge the iPod, but then I don't know of many people who charge their iPods in a dock."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cable is the bomb","review":"This cable is EXACTLY what \\"Colton Cat\\" described and the sound of the ipod using this cheap cable, is totally and absolutely the bomb.

The book goes from explaining grammar and pronunciation right into dialog, with no pronunciation or sentence structure breakdown accompanying the dialog sentences. Unless you take to the cyrillic alphabet right away, there will be a lot of flipping back and forth to try to figure out the words. The pace presented was just not a beginner's pace. The spoken words on the tapes are not always clear and unless you have the book in front of you in a quiet room, they're difficult to follow. The overall contents of the package may be thorough but for someone truly starting from scratch, this set was not a good first step. I couldn't get past lesson one without giving up in frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Challenge for Speaker of Mongolian","review":"I have a BA in Mongolian Language (old script) and wanted to find a book to review and bring it back. I saw that this book was rated as difficult and fast moving by most reviewers so I figured it would be great for me. I ordered the set with a book and CD. The book is indeed hard to follow and lacking in a lot of clarity and missing needed explanations. The CDs are sadly read very monotone, which for a language that is full of excitement in intonation is a pity. If I were to use this book as a true beginner with Mongolian I can see that it would be quite frustrating.If you have a background in Mongolian language this book will help you to review the language. Mongolian and Japanese are very similar in their syntax so maybe it will be easier to learn if you speak Japanese, but there is still a lot of lack in clarity and ease of use in this book. It doesn't seem to grasp the true essence of the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exemplary","review":"Sanders was lecturer at Mongolian at London's SOAS, and this is a thorough and well written course.

I often wonder what other books people read before they read the one they reviewed. I thought this book was average at best, and at worst I had to struggle to keep interested. The plot was the same as ten other novels, the story was so over-explained as to be ridiculous (this could have been a 100 page novel and still got its point across). I will say that the action is well written, so I suspect that consequent novels will be better conceived/written.

But who knows as there is a short explanation at the beginning of each chapter, but this is not enough to get the concepts over in a clear manner. The print is very big too!So thats the problem, the material may be very good but it is ruined by badly edited explanatory material. The catchy chapter titles (what on earth is a \\"Cookie Cutter\\"?) do not make up for the complete lack of decent, relevant tutorial information.And then there's the CD - its not linked into the book at all. I assume its supposed to be to give you some material to play over in given keys but its hard to tell - some chord charts might have been useful (or have I missed the point, who knows?).

Basically there is a picture on the right page and an explanation of why the picture was taken on the left page. It does tell what equipment was used along with the descriptions, but mainly this book should be used for inspiration. If you already have most of the technical aspects of your equipment figured out but are still left wanted something more, this book is a nice break from the typical photography book that talks about shutter, aperture, rules, etc. This book also makes a nice coffee table book since you don't have to know anything about photography to appreciate the photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong","review":"As a relatively new fan of Sweet, I have recently bought his four \\"Fine Art\\" books.

I was not interested in being told at length about the history and value of Tai Chi, I just wanted to learn how to do it.I gave this two stars because the instructors broke a basic rule for teaching any kind of physical movement: they started their teaching of each position while facing the camera, thereby forcing the viewer to try to learn by mirror image. They did break the positions down into steps and slowed them down, but as someone new to Tai Chi I still found it nearly impossible to follow along with a mirror image. Eventually the teachers turned around, but at that point they demonstrated the move at regular speed, assuming you had already mastered it. Which I hadn't. Not an insurmountable problem for the basic positions, but when they moved on to the advanced ones I gave up. And I'm not new to learning steps or positions, having had 20-plus years of dance lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"first tai chi book","review":"hard to follow.

I did note that these are mostly recent recordings (2000-2005), and that they seem to hit on a number of styles. There are some liner notes, but they are not extensive.

I have read many dragon based books and enjoyed almost all of them. However, most of them are from the point of view of the human or the dragon's rider. This isn't the case in this book, it tells things from the point of view of a dragon and makes things like eating an innocent child seem completely vindicated. Knight did happen to with the idea of hominids trying to hunt and destroy dragons, which honestly is quite over used. But with his ability to tell events from the perspective of the dragon in puts an unusual spin on things and makes the book exciting. I would say this book is worth spending a weekend only reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A n outstanding start","review":"This book made me order the next two in the series.

Buy it and read it, however, and you'll find paper-thin characters and a plot of uneven speed -- years occur in paragraphs with mighty happenings referred to in passing, while other brief periods in AuRon's life are written over chapters with long descriptions and yet fail to bring the characters to life. In places, E E Knight falls prey to the sin of describing the action (he was very tired) instead of writing it (on the 17th day of the journey, no water was in sight).A very good concept, executed middling-well. One of the few series starters I've read for which I have no desire to read the 2nd installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utterly dissappointing book.","review":"I picked up this book with extremely high hopes. Finally a story with a dragon as the lead character. I was in for a huge disappointment. Auron the dragon is an evil dragon who's only thoughts are for himself and wanting to kill his brother. I found myself identifying more with his brother than with him. True the book does create a very complex story and background which would have been great...if the main character of the story wasn't truly evil and if the dragons were more dragonlike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around book","review":"I have read the first three books in the series, and the only one I would say I enjoyed is the first. 4 stars for this, 3 for the next two. Dragon champion was better because the main character felt more driven and intelligent. His story is in depth, detailed and I enjoyed the antagonist. On top of that, the fact that he is born with a weakness forced him to adapt, making him even better. The premise itself was very good. Reading a book from the perspective of a dragon was awesome, and I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the story. I would recomend this one, and might read it again if I ever have some time to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Knight","review":"I have read all of the Vampire Earth novels and was a little startled to see that Knight had written a book about dragons. Not only about dragons but from a dragon's POV. I said WTH and picked it up. I was immediately entranced. The first chapter alone had me hooked. I read this book in two nights I only put it down to sleep. Like his Vampire Earth books this novel has all the elements of a great series. There were several scenes when I actually teared up.

Sadly, it was not. The characters are mostly surface, with a few (unsuccessful) attempts to deepen them, and every challenge the protagonist faces is somehow miraculously (and unbelievably) dealt with in a snap. Still a somewhat entertaining read, though, if you like dragons - there were a few new ideas regarding dragon biology/behaviour that made it worth exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very original","review":"These books are good. 1 and 2 are both good.

Well-told stories of activists doing the only effective thing to save the environment - get to the root of the problem and stop the individuals/governments/companies that are polluting the environment or needlessly killing endangered animals for profit or lack of responsibility.

Brave Soldier is awful---doesn't lather at all; very messy; a waste of money for a rather smallish tube, and it just clumps and clumps. It is even difficult to wash out of the sink or tub. Forget this garbage. However, I highly recommend Lab Series shave cream...absolutely the best I ever used. But a caution: Remember, these are not like the foaming shave creams, so you need to use a larger quantity of the product....I often use the Lab Series as a base and add the canned shave cream to it. But as for Brave Soldier, take my advice and do not buy it or you will definitely waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The cleanest, closest, most non-irritating shave I've ever had. For the 1st time in YEARS, my skin did NOT burn after shaving. This is high-end stuff. I think it's a bit high-priced, but I am completely sold on this stuff. It also smells good as well. Wonderful product, really softens skin and hair for shaving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product - not worth the price.","review":"This product provides a very smooth shave and is easy on your face, however, I don't feel that it is worth the $15+ price tag.

I am so glad that I didn't have to pay for this book. This was one of the worst books I have read. No point in even picking it up. When I finished I threw it in the trash and will never recommend it to anyone. I hope to just forget that I read it all. The author needs to pick one of the two stories and go with it (meaning the gamer Llewellen or Marnie) I thought the gaming aspect was very cheesy. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!! The only good thing about reading this book is that I did it at work and got paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK LET ME DOWN!","review":"Ok, you guys. As I have stated, this book let me down! It practically ends on page 195, and there's still 65 pages to go! My advice-Don't even start it. Also, I tried The Killer's Cousin. I wasn't pleased with that, either. So, my conclusion: If you're looking for a good read, don't expect Nanxy Werlin to fulfill your needs. If you need good, suspenseful stories, try Lois Duncan or Caroline B. Cooney!

We see a huge improvement in their subsequent albums resulting in the Peter Paul and Mary phenomenon throughout our country and the world for these many years.

However, this pastry blender has not quite lived up to the name. I like the handle and long upright position but the the flat bottom has only hindered my success in adequately cutting fat into the dry mixture. In a round bowl the cutting blades don't fully make contact with the surface, leaving butter somewhat untouched and sometimes taking some pretty deep gouges out of the bowl surface. If the bottom had a more rounded cutting area this would be the perfect product for me. Until then, I am going to need to look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Is the Best!","review":"Like the other reviewers before me, I found this gem of a kitchen device and have never looked back. It is the BEST pastry blade/blender I've ever used. I make pies regularly and making a crust is easy thanks to this tool. It's good for making guacamole, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use, Made in China","review":"The blades are very thick so it's difficult to cut cold butter chunks, the ergonomics are quite strange, and it has sharp corners at the base that scratch the bowl. It is a very strong blender, but the blades still bend. I found an old Ecko brand pastry blender at a thrift store that actually works much better without bending into a pretzel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price, less expensive dough blender works better","review":"I paid a lot of money for this item because it had been given a great review by some magazine I read. The handle is very comfortable and it is very well made. But the bottom side edges are not rounded. They handle comes up at a 90 degree angle from the bottom. So it is very difficult to actually blend the pastry dough in a rounded bowl. My $3.00 Ekco pastry blender does a much better job of blending the pastry. I think any dough blender with a curved surface at the bottom would perform better than this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut splitting...","review":"This is a hilarious movie.

The lid snaps on extremely tight. While the manufacturers present this as a \\"bottling bucket\\" I have found that the 6.5 gallon size and the location of the spigot (1 inch above the bottom of the bucket) makes this an excellent vessel for fermentation. The trub (sediment from fermentation) of a 5-gallon batch does not rise above the bottom of the spigot; I'm able to use the spigot, rather than a siphon, to bottle. The spigot lever has \\"On\\" and \\"Off\\" in raised plastic - white on white. I used colored Sharpies to highlight \\"Off\\" in red and \\"On\\" in green. Make certain the spigot is closed before filling! There is a slight tendency for the spigot to leak when one is opening it, but it's just a couple of ml. The bucket has a sturdy wire handle with a rotating plastic grip in the center."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great improvement over far more expensive conical","review":"This bucket is much easier to use and clean than my expensive conical fermenter and is about 1/10 the price. The tap lets me sample and check the gravity during fermentation and the seal is less susceptible to leakage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect sturdy bookcase","review":"I was prepared to have trouble putting it together - nothing like it, easy, everything worked perfectly and it matches my folding desk also from Winsome.

It's solid wood; the quality of the wood isn't the highest but it's reasonable given the price. The shelves ship partially pre-assembled (the hinges are already attached, as well as the pegs that the front of the shelves sit on). Even so, building these shelves is rather annoying - but again, for the price, it's still a good deal.On both shelves I've bought, the tool included for the screws has been low-quality and has stripped. Have your own set of hex keys ready. Be careful to only finish tightening the screws at the end, and don't overtighten the shelf screws. My shelves are fairly solid and will even stand up when folded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winsome Wood Foldable shelf","review":"Not the same quality I bought 10 years ago. I just wanted to match my Mission style shelves, but it was a disappointment. The wood and craftsmanship are inferior. I bought Foldable 4-Tier Shelf, Foldable Cart and Foldable desk. I kept the first two, but the desk was so bad, huge pieces of broken wood were patched with the wood filler on top and the bottom of the table, I had to return it. I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to put together, but easy on the eyes","review":"Like others, I had a tremendous amount of difficulty putting this together, and this was because of the folding mechanisms. The accompanying Allen wrench was also shoddy and stripped quickly. Luckily, I had a replacement that I was able to use to get the job done.And when I was done, I was quite pleased with the results. As a fan of mission-style furniture, this is a really nice addition to my home office, and it seems to be quite sturdy.I'm not entirely sure I'd recommend it based on the difficulty I had putting it together, but if you're more interested in a nice, inexpensive, good looking bookcase, then this may be one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed","review":"I purchased the Winsome Wood Foldable book shelf. I tried to put it together but the allen wrench they enclosed stripped the screws and I could never tighten them enough. The screw and peg holes were too small, and all the screws and other hardware were cheap. It took be two hours to put together, and was so wobbly that I took it apart and mailed it back as a return. Most foldable bookshelves come already constructed, so I ordered one from another company and it was great, just unfold and start stacking books on it. Avoid this one, it is not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to assemble!","review":"If you are a single person DO NOT purchase this product!

The overall look and finish is above my expectations of the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Assembly because of Manufacturer Error","review":"I normally do not write reviews - however, after assembling this book shelf I thought I would caution potential buyers of some of the problems I encountered. It should be very easy to assemble - but the holes predrilled were not large enough. They enclose a hex head wrench which is small and really can bruise your hand when trying to get the screws into the predrilled holes. I finally got out my drill and enlarged the holes to make it somewhat easier to assemble - even then you need to use caution as to not make them too big. It is a nice piece of furniture - but assembly is difficult only in that it is not drilled properly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Assembly, Attractive Results","review":"My husband is struggling over the assembly of this bookcase as I write. The wood is split and scratched in places. An Allen screw head is stripped, the Allen wrench is weak and bending, a screw is sticking out making it difficult to insert the little wooden screw-cover. The wood is mismatched in places. BUT, (an hour later) now it's finished and it feels sturdy and looks attractive from across the room. So, overall, I'd say, \\"You get what you pay for.\\" What can you expect for less than a hundred dollars. It's an \\"over-flow\\" bookcase in a back room and I don't regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Holes, Not That Easy to Assemble","review":"On the left side panel, 3 out of 8 holes for the back braces were missing. It took two people to assemble. The final product is decent. But for the price I paid, I expected higher quality in manufacturing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"This is real wood, not particleboard. Extra points for that. Plus it has nice details - the mission sides, smooth edges, and beveled top. We are not using its portability - it has added usable space to a corner of our kitchen. We put our toaster and Cuisinart on top and it's the perfect height to use them. The shelves are deep enough to store pots but we're using them for towels, plastic containers, etc. Our handyman put it together in a few minutes with no problems. The only small problem is that some of the screw covers (= little wood button caps) -- another nice detail -- didn't stay in their holes and had to be glued in. They'll probably pop out again so I'll need to keep an eye on them. Big deal. It's a very good value, well above the average put-it-together melamine stuff I'm used to getting. I'd order Winsome stuff again. Also, it came extremely fast, like a day or two after I ordered it. Kudos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same faults as \\"Dark Lord of Derkholm\\"","review":"Like its predecessor, this book should have been better than it actually is. Like its predecessor, it is full of things the reader should apparently already know, too many characters, too many plot elements that are used to no good effect, too many deus ex machina solutions, and some disturbingly dark elements that I don't find appropriate in a book aimed at children. And in \\"Year of the Griffin\\" you can add to that some utterly silly plot holes.I don't know, some may find this unfocused tale of students at wizard school seeking to redefine what magic is and can be engrossing . . . But I didn't, because the characters aren't very interesting, there is no sense of time passing, the issue of magic's potential goes nowhere, and the novel ends as an excuse to reintroduce characters from \\"Dark Lord of Derkholm\\", tie up a few loose ends, and marry everyone off.Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, for a sequel","review":"In this sequel to the terrific The Dark Lord of Derkholm, Derk's youngest griffin daughter Elda sets of for wizarding university. Her father, now a hero after helping rid the world of Mr. Chesney's tours, disapproves of the university and only agrees to let Elda go after she pushes a mountain slightly out of shape. Needless to say, the school has never had a griffin student before and some adjustments are necessary. Elda soon makes a group of friends among the other first year students; none of them are exactly average, either. Multiple adventures ensue...This is a good book: well plotted, occasionally touching, and certainly funny. My only complaint is that it does not live up to Dark Lord and The Tough Guide to Fantasyland. Few sequels do, I think, especially when the first book(s) are so very original. But don't let this put you off the series. Start with one of the first two -- it doesn't matter which order -- and then try Year of the Griffin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the funniest of DWJ's books","review":"I've been rereading most of Ms. Jones' books in order to find a phrase I remember but can't place. In the last week I've read Deep Secret, The Merlin Conspiracy, Archer's Goon, Mixed Magics, the second Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Dark Lord of Derkholm, and now Year of the Griffin. While all these books are entertaining and fun, Year of the Griffin is the one that is consistently amusing to the laugh-out-loud point. I think this may be because so many of the 'main' characters have such sarcastic attitudes. Everyone has a quip for the occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing songwriting, pop/folk/rock at its best","review":"JVA's albums are consistently powerful - combining eloquent and captivating songwriting with music that delivers Costello-esque catchy pop hooks as well as deep and intriguing lyrics reminiscent of what a Graham Parker-meets-Dorothy Parker album might sound like.

This is one of those very rare albums that comes along about once in a decade. It cannot be pigeon-holed as new age music, because in my humble opinion, it is better than some of Philip Glass's best work. This is a life-changing album, in the sense that it will open many new doors into your consciousness when you listen to it; you will see relationships amid the complexities of your life that you never saw before, you will become more compassionate.

The radio was attached to the kayak and got wet, not for long and not at all deep.

While reading Abiding Hope, especially the parts where Benjamin tells of the countless atrocities he not only witnessed, but was also forced to participate in, I couldn't help but think, \\"this couldn't have happened; certainly he's made up these 'exceedingly' horrific parts.\\" Benjamin's story forced me to, once again, question my own biased beliefs about the Holocaust.

It has many features and modes of operation but here is how I set mine up for basic use: I connect my incoming phone line to the input port, my answering maching w/phone to the TAD port, and my fax machine to the fax port. When a call comes in the Comswitch \\"picks up\\" the call on the first ring and listens momentarily for a fax tone. If there is a tone it immediately switches the call to the fax machine and then transmission begins, if it is a voice call it immediately switches to my anwering maching which then begins ringing, working as it usually does with any incoming call. For my answering machine connection, the only difference from before the Comswitch is that there is one addtional ring before the call actually starts to ring on the anwering machine. However, all of this is invisible to the caller. It also is supposed to work with voice mail systems too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The Comswitch 5500 works great if you have a single line phone, with no extensions, no caller ID and no DSL on the line. Then it is quite capable of discerning fax calls from voice calls. But if that's the extent of your setup, you may not really need to buy an additional piece of equipment.However, if you have any of those other things, be prepared for the following:* DSL on the line will require 3 to 5 filters to prevent static. The usual is 1 filter, the manual tells you 2 filters but customer support and actual experience will tell you 3 to 5 filters are required (at $10 to $20 each if you don't happen to have a bunch of them not in use).* If you have more than one phone extension, be prepared for the phones that aren't connected to the 5500 to ring once and stop.* If you have caller ID, be prepared for it to display during the first ring only - on all phone extensions.I was not prepared to deal with all of those conditions and returned the machine for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"the saying \\"you get what you pay for\\" does not apply here. i paid over $300 for this and the craftsmanship is horrendous. nearly every screw on the backside was installed crooked. the unit does not sit level. the space above the side doors is clearly different on each side. only one screw was used to secure the finger handle on one of the side doors so it swiveled...the other sign was fine. to top it off, when the unit arrived, the base that the legs attach to was detached...the dowel pins were sheered in half. i don't understand how someone can stay in business selling something of such poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great company!","review":"Excellent item came in exactly as described.

Patricia Telesco is a fantastic author. The Basic magickal components (Herbs, stones, etc), and their traditional/suggested uses in Folk Magick was well organized(alphabetically, by category) and well explained! This book is unintimidating and easy to refrence. She also gives the reader a good neutral foundation on which they can build their own opinions and practices. The very best aspect of this book was the fact that she presented a concept that is very much tied to various Earth Religions, but didn't give the book a religious slant at all. (Being a Christian Witch,) I appreciated the fact that there wasn't a pre-set religious affiliation to the information! This allows one to learn just \\"Magick\\"...leaving the religious application up to the reader!! The book is and easy read for the beginner, and a valuable refrence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Resource!","review":"Magick Made easy was obviously designed to be a recipe book focused on components rather than spells themselves - the idea being to encourage us to find our own combinations of magical ingredients to make that special spark happen in everyday life and Circle. Folk magick, as explained by Telesco, IS simple - but NOT fluffy. The difference is attitude. This book isn't for ritual magicians, it's for kitchen witches and everyday folk who want to bring an extra spritual dimension to things. I also loved the cover - very clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magick made easy","review":"I am a big fan of Patricia Telesco's works, as she offers practical usage for modern, everyday items in a magickal context. Although this book seems like a sequel to Spinning Spells, Weaving Wonders, it is different enough to warrant a purchase. The first part of the book, \\"Off to 'Oz'\\", answers common questions about magick, such as \\"does folk magick have a religious element\\", and Telesco offers her own rules of magick, much as Cunningham did. Getting started in folk magick is discussed, as is folk magick fundamentals. The second part of the book, the Components, is divided into Traditional and Modern components, and covers such items as coral, hawthorn, lead, snakes, batteries, blenders, and more. These entries are in alphabetical order and include themes, elemental correspondences, and sample applications. If you are looking for practical ways to use ordinary household items in your magickal practices, this book is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe this to be the first magick book I ever bought","review":"and was that a lucky coincidence.

First, it does give ideas, but there is no need for instructions, because the ideas are very simple... Don't get me wrong, there are some very nice ideas, but it's nothing you can't find in any scrapbooking magazine or online.

This malfunction must have been intentional because there are many free progams that can do this and this won't do and you pay for it. The softwae that comes with it crashes the computer regularly and prevents many other programs from running. After wasting my time looking for a fix on their site, i decided to look at some other sites. After many hours of searching, i found a fix (it was not made by ati) and after that the program worked.

Two of the tales star Claire Malloy and two others Arkansas Sheriff Arly Hanks (the Maggody novels). Those four tales alone would make the short story collection worth reading, but the other seven tales are also well written with six containing the author's renowned humor with a wink. Surprisingly, the final contribution seems out of place, as it is more of a psychological suspense thriller than Ms. Hess's typical satirical biting social barb that leaves no one standing. Besides the writer's fans and towns with populations under 800, anyone who appreciates a strong anthology will want to read BIG FOOT STOLE MY WIFE! AND OTHER STORIES. Additionally, Ms. Hess' readership will also enjoy her previous collection, DEATH OF A ROMANCE WRITER AND OTHER STORIES.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"1","title":"has no padding","review":"Decent outer layer with plenty of room.

Some pretty good lines are given to her, and they fall flat every time.But the boys are in top form here. Great scene at the night club where they are forced to do an impromptu dance and comedy routine.The plot doesn't always make sense, but it doesn't seem to matter.

The teachers of the three year olds said the book was beautiful, the kids really got it, they sat still to hear it (a real accomplishment), and the teachers liked it themselves. One parent who took it home to read to her 4 year old boy said that Come Down And Play was wonderful and a really neat book.I like the book myself because it is well written with a touching, upbeat subject with good answers. The illustrations are colorful, show a real boy in a believable setting with good detail, but not too fussy. The pictures and text go together very well.

That nation's god of war, Ogun, plans to inflame his people against the Amazons. And Ares, the Greek god of war, protector, and defender of the Amazons, is powerless to help his subjects because Zeus, his father, has forbid any Greek god from interfering in the affairs of foreign gods.In order to save the Amazons, Ares must join forces with Hercules, which is no easy matter since Ares hates his brother for being their father's favorite son.The story is very enjoyable.

Being a hockey fan, naturally I was intrigued. It's the story of how Ted Lindsey took the destiny of the National Hockey League into his own hands and fought (literally) to form the NHLPA. It's a great story of a great hockey player who could no longer stand idly by and watch former greats die penniless and see his fellow players sweat over where their next meal may come from. The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it comes off like a made for TV movie, in other words, the production value could have been better, but the perfomances, story, and direction are top notch. In lieu of the current climate in the NHL (i.e, the lockout, which hurts the game as a whole and the fans who love it), I think it would do some folks up at the top (are you listening Gary Bettman and Bob Goodenow?) to watch this film and remember why the players formed a union in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Waxman!","review":"This is one of my absolute favourite labour movies. Though it has its share of hockey scenes and is larded with sports references, this is a film about trying to organize a union.

Excellent sound, charges your sansa mp3 player while you listen, easy to move from room to room. As for the comment from someone on the sound...I played it in a room with the windows open and you could hear it at least a block away. Maybe they got a bad one...should exchange it, not return it. Also, it does come with an \\"attention\\" insert that explains you need to update the player before using the product. It only takes a moment and it's simple. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality, and the sansa player has an equalizer so you can change the \\"type\\" of sound...such as jazz, rock, pop, etc. A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little speaker system...Big disappointment","review":"I don't know if the unit I got was a lemon, but it had very poor amplification even with the latest firmware on the e260.Returned it for the Altec Lansing IM4, which met my expectations for sound but the IM4 doesn't have a cradle that recharges while connected. All of these systems seem over priced for what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altec Lansing IM510 Speaker System","review":"Not the greatest sounding speaker system, lacks bass, sounds like a transitor radio. Also very overpriced for this item, very small and simple unit with not allot of options, but seeing not many units like this are available for Sansa they are sticking it to you. If you really want one you must consider the additional sub woofer as an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"small, good sound","review":"This works well with our Sansa e280.

The Sansa 250e did not play when plugged in to the unit. When I contacted Altec about the problem, I got a surly tech person, after the innumerable phone button presses, who told me, in barely intelligable English, I should update software on the Sansa 250e. I contacted the pleasant and helpful people at Sansa and did indeed upgrade the software successfully and am able to play the unit over the Altec speaker system. Since my experience with Altec, I do not expect that I will be seeking out Altec products anytime in the future, near or distant."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced and tiny!","review":"i was thinking about taking this unit to work, but i don't work in a LIBRARY! the drone of machinery and my co-worker's radios will squelch this device's output leaving me straining to hear its contribution to the din. do not doubt that this is a glorified transistor radio, it's light and very portable. it does have handy appliances and it is pretty. it is lacking both power and substance that the price demands.this \\"radio\\" strikes me as a gimmick gift for opening a bank account or filling out a credit card application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product for a great price","review":"I am surprised at the sound this little unit puts out.....It's well made and the only small thing I would change is the volume push buttons, other than that, it's Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set of speakers, perfect for home or office","review":"I was very pleased with my Altec Lansing Sansa dock/speakers. Contrary to what's stated in other reviews, I've found that the speakers have more than sufficient sound output. If you're looking for something to rattle windows or rock a house party, this isn't it. But the unit gets more than loud enough to be heard clearly a room away, while still preserving sound quality. I paid $60 to an Amazon marketplace seller for the unit, and I think it's worth the price. It works great in my office. It can run off 6 AA batteries, or AC, has an audio input line, and a bass out line.My only complaint is that the space for docking the sansa is too narrow to accomodate the tough-skin cover I have for my sansa. The toughskin is mandatory if you ever take your otherwise scratch-prone Sansa on the go, and it's a slight pain taking it on and off every time I want to use my speakers or take my sansa for a jog. Other than that, I give the speakers thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"IM510","review":"This little speaker system ROCKS, big sound from a small package.

Cast iron is heavy, but this holds up just fine!I bought two thinking I'd stack my pyrex baking dishes in the other, but those are in fact too tall for this. Just FYI.

I left it in the package in the box so that NOTHING could happen to it before it was time to wear it. I should have pulled it out and at least looked at it. That was my mistake. When I took it out of the package as we were getting ready the back had runs in the nylon around the behind area and the stitching that held the top and bottom halves together had come apart in the back. It was awful. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun!","review":"I bought this costume in toddler size for my 2 1/2 year old son. He is probably average in size and the costume fits him without being too big or too small. We went to a Halloween party and I was able to fit jogging pants and a long sleeve tee under it without it being too tight. It seems the fabric has a little stretch to it.To say my son loves this costume is an understatement. He wears the cape and belt every day, all day, taking it off only for nap and bedtime. It looks like the cape is attached to the costume from the picture but isn't. It clasps together in the front with velcro. My only issue with the costume is the belt. The first time he wore the costume the belt started to fall apart. The belt has a front piece that is sewn to a piece of fabric on each side and they tie in the back. The fabric is barely held on with a piece of thread. After I sewed it back on, it was fine. No big deal really for the use it is getting. I recommend this costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointment","review":"Poor quality, I'm very disapointment with this costume, I bought it thinking that was cute but I made a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering About The Overall Quality","review":"I read the reviews on Disc 1 or 2 of the series and as far as I can tell, these jams were ported from vinyl with all of the imperfections, scratches, hisses, etc and without proper analog to digital transferring and related re-mastering. If that's the case with any or all discs in this series, they are worthless to me. I depend on digital production firms such as Rhino for their supreme re-mastering efforts.

The next day I ordered the CD on Amazon.com and when it finally arrived, I listen to all the other tracks and I would rate this album with 5 stars because this is one of the best ambient works I have heard in a while and I have heard them all.

Although concurring with the general feeling of melancholia addressed by other reviewers, I always saw this audio landscape as more of a reflection of solitude, amplified by the subdued ambient wilderness sounds, much as one would hear along the Bruce Trail.Of the tracks, \\"Remember Summer\\" strikes a particular chord with me.

She loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A twist on A Christmas Story...","review":"My pastor read us this story on Christmas Eve, very much like a father would read to his children;in front of a faux fireplace and Christmas tree in a large overstuffed chair. He even had people acting it out behind him on stage dressed as Satan, and Gabriel, and so on.. I have never been so moved by any one book. As soon he finished it, I made sure to put in a order at my local bookstore and read it 3 times the first day. It really makes you realize how much the Lord loves us. More importantly it shows how much Satan wants to succeed in making us FAIL. I have since recommended it to every person I know, and have told a dozen more about it. It's a very beatiful, very different spin on the traditional Christmas story. Let's face it, we all know why we celebrate the season, but do we know the reason behind God's plan? Even thought it is a work of fiction, I think all will agree this book is very worth taking an hour out of your day to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"People seriously read this stuff?","review":"I hate to be negative, but come ON. Aside from the total audacity of the book and the side stories within its plot-- I was surprised at how many liberties Lucado took with the story-- the writing style itself was juvenile and mediocre. It read like something a thirteen-year-old boy wrote for a creative writing class in school. The jokes weren't funny, the details trivial, and I felt like it made a mockery of real literature. It literally took me twenty minutes to read, and I STILL wish I could have those twenty minutes of my life back.You want a story about Jesus's birth? Stick to the Bible. If you want to read about flying through space and meeting jackal-headed demons, read sci-fi. The two just don't properly mix.To anyone trying to decide whether or not to buy this book, save your money.

All the cliches are there...cooking up crack in the kitchen...a gang member gets shot and his homies vow revenge...[junkies]begging for drugs in the street...etc. There is nothing original about the story line, and the poor writing and acting did nothing to keep me engrossed in the film, as was the case with Boyz and Menace.

WB should be ashamed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"8-film collection","review":"As a huge Harry Potter fan, I like this collection because I got it for a really good price. I used to have all the individual movies on DVD, but they were all stolen when we had a break-in. I wanted to replace them but not spend a fortune on all the individual movies again. This did the trick. It is not fancy, they do not come in their own little movie sleeves on anything. If you are looking for the movies but not for the frills, this is a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"Great purchase! Really worth as a collectable.

We put in the first DVD, excited to see the film, and we could barely distinguish one word from another, even with the sound turned way up. The words are not crisp and clear as they are in most films. We were so very disappointed! And every one of these is the same...we have a relatively new SONY TV, and we can hear other films perfectly, so we don't think the problem lies on this side.If you are thinking of purchasing this set, be aware that the same thing may happen to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Collection","review":"Perfect!

Far from it. This is a bare bones set with only the 8 films. No extended cuts or special features to speak of.At least the Lord of the Rings Theatrical set included some featurettes. And then a year later the Extended set was released. These sets happen to be published by Warner, which also manages Potter. See what's going on here? They are trying to rake in money by releasing rubbish collections first with the good one later on.Warner Brothers even had the gall to have released a trailer for the \\"Harry Potter: The Definitive Collection\\" before this set even hit stores.Please, don't buy this set with a better one on the horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy via UK site","review":"After reading another reviewer I decided to check the Amazon.co.uk site. Better 8 disc box set plus 3 extra bonus material DVDs. Total US Dollar price at checkout $48.16. Pre-order to ship Dec 1st. Can't wait. Might have to pay a conversion fee on the credit card, but still works out cheaper than this price. So it'll be about $6.25 for each BluRay disc! Way cheap!!!!

Great Price, for all 8 movies!!! I've been waiting for this box set since Blu-rays first came out. I know another ultimate box set is coming, but I couldn't wait.

The title of this release is \\"The 8 Film Collection\\"; it is not called \\"Collector's Edition\\" or \\"Deluxe Edition\\" or \\"The Bonus Features Galore Collection\\". This is a nice little set for casual fans who simply want all 8 films on blu-ray. And considering this set is (currently) less than $80, how can you complain?Yes, if you're a huge fan of the franchise and want extended cuts and bonus features, save your time and money and wait for a possible future release.

I have been waiting to get this on blu ray until I had a blu ray player. As I was researching and reading reviews I saw that many people recommended getting this on the Amazon UK site. Boy, were they right. I got this exact set, plus 3 bonus extra footage dvd's for $35.67 USD including the shipping cost. I can't believe the U.S. Amazon site it charging so much for it. The shipping was only $5.00 to sent it to the states from the UK.

I have the UK Blu-Ray box set that has 11 discs in it instead of the 8 discs in the US version. All 8 movies have tremendous quality and Bonus Features. The only thing is that he cases are a bit flimsy and that may have a bit better if the cases were a bit stiffer, but otherwise a Fantastic product.

This was a sweet deal at about 80$, that's 10$ per each blu-ray dvd, which is a steal. Quality was great but on the second disk (HP and the Chamber of secrets) there's about a 7 minute lapse, basically the disk just fast forwards the 7 minutes regardless of what you do. It's not a huge deal, and it's the only problem out of all eight disks so I'm not gonna bother sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry","review":"Very good movies!

I didn't think she cared about watching extras since she never does any other time we watch the movies but oh well, she was excited Christmas morning and hasn't stopped watching them over and over and over again since then.

We both love the Harry Potter films, and, when I saw that the entire collection was available on Blu-Ray, I simply had to make it a gift!While the quality is excellent, and you do receive some special features with this collection, the only missing component would be an upgrade in packaging for the complete collection. Each disc comes separately packaged, and then all of the discs are gathered into one large cardboard (?) sleeve. While that has nothing to do with the quality of the item, it does matter to those of us with a concern for aesthetics, and the appeal that can be brought when purchasing an entire collection instead of purchasing each film separately.The films are an excellent buy, and definitely worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon..","review":"I love Harry Potter and was stoked when the complete collection finally came out on bluray.

At first it was very disappointing as the person I gave it to reported that the discs didnt play correctly and often skipped past sections of the films making them unwatchable. I did some research and I urge everyone who has had playback issues to look into this, check your model of bluray player and check to make sure you have UPDATED THE FIRMWARE! Issues were on a Samsung BDP-1600 which was running 1.01 firmware, upgrading to the latest 2.19 firmware fixed the playback issues - there is nothing wrong with the discs in this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this series","review":"My boyfriend and I love this series and were really excited to own them all on blu-ray.

It's only 1 disk per movie!!So this obviously means they just got all the individual movies that didn't sell, threw the \\"Extras\\" disk away and put them into this 8-disk package.I bought this because I still have the \\"years 1-5\\" DVD box, so I just replaced the DVDs with the blu-rays.But this is not the box to buy if you want a \\"Complete Film Collection\\", despite of what the product name and description says...[]'s"},{"rating":"2","title":"BOX Set","review":"The item was a couple of days late arriving, but the product itself is very nice.The box set also allows a more compact storage for the 8 disks versus the original single movie cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Harry Potter!","review":"My only issue is that because this is the first one to come out the later ones will likely have more special features and that is only my theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased as a gift.","review":"Purchased this set as a gift.

In reading reviews of this item \\"collection\\" problems had been noted as described above ...THEY ARE REAL AND EVIDENTLY ONGOING!

Come on really all but 1 movie. So not a surprise that they would give a bare bone 1-8 to start. I avoided dipping into the Blu Ray Harry Potters knowing I would end up double dipping for the Ultimate collection of all 8 films. I guess next Christmas we will see the 1-8 with all the deleted scenes and with any luck extended viewing instead of just seperate features. So Warner please stop wasting our time, just get with the picture and give us the real complete set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodgpodge of Audio Formats","review":"This appears to be a repackaging of existing versions, aka money grab. Look at the back packaging audio specs. They are a mess. DTS-MA for 7 1/2, True HD for 6, PCM for 1-5. Will wait for a proper collectors box set. I don't expect to see anything proper that coincides with this release.Geraldo V."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for a great collection","review":"We don't own any of the Harry Potter movies so we purchased this set. The price was well worth it, and the marathon Potter sessions are fun for the whole family. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true collection","review":"This set is just a hodge-podge of extra discs that were laying around that didn't sell. They ARE blue ray. They are legit movies. The Order of The Phoenix disc says Disk 1 on it. The Hallows Part 1 looks like a photocopy label. There isn't a Main Menu in the first 5 disks - You have to use the remote to bring it up. Very Disappointed. It's all the movies in one box - that's all ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for a reasonable price","review":"Exactly what I wanted: a complete set of all the Harry Potter movies. Very good quality too, and was shipped on time (just like every Amazon item I ordered)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For Everyone Except the Tech-Geek","review":"I understand what others are saying about the sound quality, but we just turned up the volume alittle on our TV and found no difference. If you are buying this just to enjoy the movies than this is the product for you. If you have a home theater and want the best of the best and always comment on the clarity, sound, etc... than wait for the deluxe edition, but for the majority of us who just want the watch the movie it is perfect. Also, they are the full length of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Flawless","review":"The transfers themselves onto BluRay for the first five films looks absolutely gorgeous. Smooth, crisp, vivid, delicious 5.1 audio. My only two complaints are that it features very little bonus material, and the packaging and BluRay art are just taken from previous BluRay releases, and feature 'Disc 1' written on them. And the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is literally just black with the name written on it, which looks very cheap and out of place among the others. But if you don't care about the bells and whistles and just want the films in excellent HD quality, then this collection is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the US edition","review":"Check and make sure you received the US edition before you unwrap it.

It may not have a lot of special features but I figured it wouldn't since all 8 films are in this collection. Hours before I bought this I went to Target and saw they had this exact same item for $75. I was glad I bought this because it saved me a lot of money.

Fans of the series likely have these already, and if not, a little looking can net you all 8 of these for a slightly cheaper price. Much like the Lord of the Rings extended version, the upcoming Harry Potter Complete extended edition will not only pack in a few scenes that were cut from the movies in the interest of time, but are purported to add cohesion to the films, and a slightly more depth the the characters. Either way, you can save money by purchasing the discs separately, or wait a bit a get the upcoming extended version. (I recommend the latter.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I, like many others, had been waiting for the whole collection to be released. The fact that there are not many special features does not bother me. What does bother me is the simple fact that Warner Brothers rushed this out too soon. The images on the discs are pulled right from the old ones (The Half Blood Prince has disc 1 on it, when there is only one disc). The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a plain black disc with no image. It took me forever to get the Deathly Hallows Part 1 to play because it kept bringing me back to my blu ray player's home screen. I will be calling Amazon customer service and probably returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!!!","review":"In the product description, it doesn't tell you these are wide screen editions. And that's not totally true because all except one of the DVDs was wide screen. Random. I tried to return the DVDs because I didn't want them wide screen, and Amazon charged me a $17 restocking fee, plus some other fees! I paid about $34 and am getting less than $14 back. So you better be sure you want these because if not, you're not going to get any money back when you return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well I do not get this hole thing !!!!!","review":"Why would so many people get so worked up about a Bunch of Kids Flying around on Broom sticks !!!

There is no reason to drop $90 on a set that will see major upgrades in an ultimate edition. Why they didnt just release it now and make millions of fans happy is beyond me. Such a great series of movies with such a horrible release of the entire series. Should have been a no brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does the UK get the better and less expensive set??","review":"I really don't understand why amazon.co.uk is offering the same set, more or less, for much less money *AND* they are offering the 3D version as well. Frankly, this would not be as big a franchise without US money and yet we are the ones getting nickled and dimed! No sooner will this less than stellar version be released before WB re-releases another set for more money! Two stars just because of the packaging and pricing. The price has *increased* $10 since the pre-order started."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Waiting","review":"No bonuses or anything. I'm waiting for a proper box set.

My husband and I both are DIE HARD Harry Potter fans and yes! we will purchase this series. Are the extra's really cool? of course they are! anyone who has purchased any of the DVD's in the past have had the \\"extra's\\" included.

I mean it has a sleek black box and comes with the elder wand! I could not wait to see what kind of box set we were going to get here in the u.s. as well as the u.k. Needless to say I was utterly dissappointed.

This set is just not up to basic blu-ray standards. The menus and navigation are terrible. I have only watched Disc 5 so far, but there is no way of knowing which of the two \\"English\\" tracks I was on since there is no menu to select the audio track, and when I use my audio button the pop up text just says \\"English\\". It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to play the movie with out the \\"special features\\" at the same time.It still may be a good deal compared to the future releases, but I have just come accustomed to certain features on a blu-ray disc, and the way these disks are set up it feel more like a pirated copy than an original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter Rip Off","review":"I was extremely excited to purchase this product, however; when it arrived the case was cracked. Okay, that's not really a big deal, but as I watched the movies I noticed that there were scenes missing from them. As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was extremely disappointed. By the time you get to movies 6 through 8, there is either no sound, the sound skips, the picture lags & freezes, the screen goes blank... These are only a few of the problems with these. Don't buy these unless you enjoy being scammed and wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Scenes","review":"I received this set as a gift this past Christmas.

So I paid slightly more since this description stated \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\". Then when it showed up at my door, it was the UK version instead of the US version.I know it's a small thing, and the films work great and all that, but it was the single selling point why I went with this set versus another, and then it turned out to be inaccurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Blu Ray fo sho!

However, you do get what you pay for, and given the cheap per unit rate that I paid for (which is around $10 per movie), I am pleased with the purchase.It is disappointing to learn that this is just a repackaging of the existing Blu-ray discs that are currently in other sets, as well as the lack of proper representation of the disc art as photographed by the product image in this listing. But these are just minor complaints.Again, I was not looking for a LOST style box set, with feelies and loads of extras that are just as long as the movies themselves.

The sound quality was rather poor (I wouldn't use this to play music from my phone/mp3 player/whatever. If that is a feature that you find attractive, search elsewhere.

It is made of hard plastic with odd fins and protrusions everywhere. It does not rest easily on the head. It feels heavy and abrasive. I am surprised that none of these manufacturers have come up with a softer, lighter material, or spent any time considering how to fit a headset to the ears and head. Sony does a better job with its DRBT21G/B, but also falls victim to hard plastic and a hinge in the middle of the set that digs at your skull as time goes on. Truly astonishing.I could not get the unit to pair with my top-of-the-line Sony bluetooth transmitter.

I have other headphones using the same \\"back of the head\\" support that I love.I suspect the main cause is the weight. They feel fine for about 15 minutes, then it shifts to \\"head in a closing vise\\" mode, with the added bonus of feeling as if my ears are being slowly sheered off my head.I keep bending the support band in hopes of finding a sweet spot...no luck yet. I guess my next approach will be padding...then a complete re-engineering of the support.Having said that, maybe they are the perfect fit for someone else's head. That lucky person would probably give them five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Just got this headset recently. It's really a good buy. I can listen to music on my ipod (bought jabra a125s adapter) and connect the headset to my cell phone at the same time.

Also, when I connect it to my desktop, I have to make sure I disable all other speakers before using the headsets then open the music/video programs.Other than those cons, I pretty much love the headset. I can wear them during work just fine and it's battery life would last the whole 8 hours.

Two months later, the handsfree didn't operate any longer...I'm not sure whether using it during exercising got some sweat into it or what, but I went back to Amazon for another replacement...ooops, no dice, gotta go to Motorola if outside the 30 day window. Fair enough...Motorola customer service reps, to whom English is definitely a second language, were confused. It took four calls to get the problem clear to them.

Even the correct adapter fails to work well, the sound comes through good on occasion but it's mostly either too high too low too fast or too slow.There are very few cell phones that support the blue tooth standard it uses so if it's for a cell phone/music player your wasting your money.Finally the only thing that makes it work with a PC (the chord) is so short it's useless.

If you do decide to purchase this product I would immediately glue them in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sound, but heavy on the ears and awful microphone","review":"The headset is cool, and has very good speakers for phone and music, but it is very heavy on my ears. Also, the microphone is not directional, so ALL background noises are picked up, which makes it impossible to use for conference calls in a public place (like an airport)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST so far","review":"The HT820 is the best bluetooth head set that I have used. One of the earlier reviews stated that the headset was not in stereo. Well trust me it is. I play music with my LG fusic phone from Sprint. My last phone also had Bluetooth but did not work as well as this phone. I feel this may be that persons problem. The source of the signal plays a big part of it. The headset also works well with my Mac. I get about a 30-35ft range off both the phone and Mac. It sounds great and the hands free phone funtion works great. My only complant is that it could be more comfortable. I would rate the comfort a 3 out of 5. If you buy this product and set it up RIGHT you will have a great set of headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"When I am on the road each day - you want to be able to make a call safely and using this item will be the thing.

Had issues setting up the bluetooth to work correctly, but that is due to Microsoft's Bluetooth drivers being useless, the widcomm ones not being much better, and waiting to get a key from BlueSoilel for two weeks for $32.99 to get them to do what they should do.I can walk around the same floor of the house, but once I go downstairs the signal breaks up and drops out from the computer. The phone quality is fine too.I like that there is also a cable connection, which means I can put my cellphone and my Sansa mp3 player on my belt and listen to both without any hassles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bluetooth Headset","review":"I purchased this unit primarily to take advantage of the MP3 player function in my new LG Shine Phone.As some of the other raters have mentioned, the fit behind the ears is a bit snug, but it is not as painful as some have described. It sits well on the neck and does not catch on my collar or when I lie down in my hammock.

I wish they would have came with a bluetooth receiver for the PC instead of having to buy one seperately. And also, sometimes when you get a call, it's not so easy to switch back to your music again.Other than those few minor things, they work and sound great. I'd recommend them to anybody looking for a music/phone solution in one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Item","review":"I rate the headset with 5 stars, because it is very easy to use, very confortable and have a great sound quality.

I'd bet my thumbs that Bonnie wouldn't have it any other way, lest her fame overshadow the lesser-known blueswomen heard on this recording. In addition to Queen of the Blues, Bonnie's also known as the queen of payback, making sure others get (in many cases long-overdue) attention, often sharing the limelight (like her live duet with Sippie Wallace, who wrote and sang \\"Women Be Wise\\" long before Bonnie ever set foot on a stage) and playing/singing on innumerable recordings by other musicians - like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits all inflatables, except (of course) Advanced Elements","review":"So I oredered this pump for my Advanced Elements AdvancedFrame Convertible.

The \\"blurbs\\" accompanying the book are extraordinary, announcing Field as a virtual literary savior for her generation. Yet, unfortunately, the experimental, whimiscal, and nonsensical formal play in the book makes for all dazzle and dance and very little else.

Call this genre - entho-ambient, New Age, world trance - whatever you like. But you can't deny this Lights In A Fat City member has plenty of indepth (and uplifting) sounds to put on CD. Line-up: Kenneth Newby - guitar, piano, cymbals, sitar, sampling & voices, Chris Miller - guitar & piano, Mike O'Neil - guitar, Andreas Kabre - percussion and Janet Brook - whistle & voices.

All in all, this album is very good. There are a couple of songs that could have been done better, but taken as a whole, this CD is great. The songs themselves are excellent, and the Christian message is uplifting. Even though I never had the privilege of seeing the performance, I still greatly enjoy the content. I would definitely recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now Listen Up","review":"Ok. I am writing this as a broadway lover and not as a christian (which I am). Ok, first off let me tell you that this album SUCKS. There are one or two good songs, but other than than, it sounds like the 80's revisited. The music is horrible with synthesizers and over produced vocals (what is it with the continous echoes when they sing?) It just sounds like they grabed a few christian artists with good voices, through them in a recording booth and said SING. There is almost no emotion in this. The reason I gave this cd two stars is for the effort in trying to put a christian show on broadway ran by and starring Christians. But with this material, it is going to be gone real quick if it is not already gone from broadway. If you want a true ROCK OPERA about Jesus, go buy \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" or \\"Godspell.\\" Those are the classics and for good reason. Please, please, please save your money.

Eventhough he's deceased, he being dead yet speaketh. The information in this book is excellent. Frequently asked questions such as tongues being used to speak another nation's language, or gifts of healing and working of miracles being the same or not, are answered in this book. It is a great book to study upon besides 1 Corinthians 12th chapter in the bible. IN verse 28, is says that God has placed some in the church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly teachers.

You finish the book with more worries than you started with, rather than feeling good about the decision you made.Certainly everyone reacts to this situation differently but the level of complaining seemed a little excessive.

Infertility is isolating, painful both emotionally and physically, and terrifying on so many levels.

There is also a section on being more educated on african culture, such as going to multicultural events and participating in black history month and kwanza. I already do these things so the last thing I need is someone telling me to do this just because I want dreadlocks.

It does have a little information about how to care for your locs as well as your physical and mental well-being, but it wasn't exhaustive by any means. There is so much more information about how to start and maintain locs and he didn't even scratch the surface.

It's actually a little summary: flower style, plant type, and class e.g. Madame Isaac Pereire: cupped, tall, Bourbon. Very handy.

Grand Hall sent me a quote for just shy of $300 after purchasing it for $600. For that kind of money, I expect that it should last a little longer than two years. If I wanted a grill that lasts only two years, I could have gotten one for less than $200.

His ideas on family are super, but polygamy was a perverse idea that used to be promoted by his predecessors. Only until normal society intervened did this sick tradition get stomped out.

We must work on the inner vessel in ourselves before we cast any stones at others. President Hinckley is just trying to show us how we can do that.

It has caused me to reflect on my life and make resolutions to improve where I need to, and to teach my children those same things. Any book that does this for me is worth reading.I also loved his discussion on the guardians of virtue; marriage and family.

But the fact is, if you read this book and find something you can actually apply to your life to benefit you and/or your family, then Hinckley has done his job. He has set out to give us a few basic, simple methods for improving the society we live in. Honestly, I didn't consider it a page-turner, but I found numerous ideas that I can readily apply to my work, social, and family life.

I found it to be a good reference for everything from the ice ages, to Native Americans, to modern agricultural techniques. This is an interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"STOMP! is a winner!","review":"A fabulous coming-of-age novel, not without the usual teenage angst - but definitely without the usual solutions. Ray & Angie are wonderful characters exploring not only their sexuality, but at the same time exploring the existentialist philosophy. Ray is a bright, sensitive young man and this novel shows his transformation from boyhood to manhood brilliantly. If you're looking for something to read that pushes the envelope a bit, that leaves you thinking about it for days and days, then STOMP! is a book you need to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for last few weeks of pregnancy","review":"I really do believe that this book is the 1 thing that helped me suck it up & make it through the last weeks of my pregnancy and gave me the mental strength to birth my 9.5 lb baby naturally. The stories in this book can inspire anyone to enjoy the natural experience that is birthing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to share again and again","review":"This is my favorite book about birth. I read many others and non touched me in the way that this one did. I've since read all of Ina May's books and bought more to share with first time parents and parents of more than one. I will probably read it a few times the next time we are expecting, it is that good! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful childbirth stories","review":"The stories in this book, of natural childbirth, are truly wonderful. The book focuses on the circumstances, the experience, the miracle of each birth, even the ones that didn't proceed textbook-perfect. These stories are touching, and heartening for someone who's lost faith in our healthcare system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"We're having our first baby and I found myself really concerned with establishing a birth plan. Although Ina May is the leading American midwife this book is still a great book for those of us not ready to commit to a home birth. I am taking my time reading this in an effort to absorb all the fine pointers about labor. I love that this book is written in an encouraging positive way and not designed to scare you. Reading this book has given me a better idea of what to expect while giving birth and has also helped me develop a birth plan that I'm comfortable with. It supports a strong message of positive thinking and how much that can create a positive labor experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much for me","review":"This book wasn't nearly as helpful as I had hoped. The first half of the book consists of hippy birth stories from the 70s. I know that Ina May Gaskin is a highly respected midwife, so I was hoping for more factual advice. I am also not interested in giving birth at any sort of \\"farm\\". I was hoping for advice/techniques that would work for a natural hospital birth. If that is what you are looking for as well, I would skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The #1 book I recommend to all of my clients","review":"I am a doula and childbirth educator. when this book came out I was pregnant with my 2nd daughter. I couldn't wait to pick it up each day to read more beautiful birth stories of women who wanted a better start for their children. Ina May explains so beautifully how the female body works and most importantly the mind body connection. After reading this book it became obvious to me the tremendous power of our bodies and what they're capable of doing. I have a new found sense of confidence because of my abilities as a woman and having given birth at home twice now. Every woman should feel that confident in herself and her body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful on the mechanics, but some misinformation","review":"Don't get me wrong, I was the crunchy-granola, SF Bay Area type who was totally going to have natural childbirth, made that clear to my doctor (and Nurse Midwife!) and hired a doula. My doula gave me this book and I read it. This book is left of left, so be prepared. I developed complications with my pregnancy (preeclampsia) which became HELLP syndrome at the end. So naturally, to prevent my early demise, I was induced, and short of a C-section, I had just about every birth intervention this natural childbirth set despises so much. But, in the end, I have a healthy baby, and I'm alive. The author in this book treats complications like preeclampsia like a fairy tail. No one on the farm got it, so it must not exist!But, if you are looking for some tips on the mechanics of child-birthing naturally, and don't mind a few medical details being off, this would be your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I cannot say enough about this book or the author Ina May. I just wish more women would trust their body and let nature and a woman's instinct do its thing. In only rare cases do we need intervention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming","review":"This is a collection of heartwarming stories of women and their partners who decided to make the birth process their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really what I was expecting...","review":"I bought this because the women on the board I frequent stated this is one of THE books to read for pregnant women. Especially those wishing to use as minimal medical intervention as possible.Part one is all birth stories, about 125 pages long. Its interesting to read about it, but it tells NOTHING about HOW these women breathed/relaxed/etc through their stories. The stories are also very old. I would have like to have seen some more recent stories regarding natural childbirth.If you already have some pregnancy books, a LOT of information is already known to you. I usually dogear any page/section I'm interested in going back to, and the only two sections I've dogeared, I have actually read in other books, that give a lot more information as well as more pictures (real life not a diagram or drawing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"the good and the bad","review":"The first half of this book was inspiring, uplifting, educational, eye-opening. I found it to most helpful in trying to understand our misconceptions about what child birth really entails. However, the second half, though meant to be for awareness of all possibilities during labor and birth, seemed to emphasize the \\"sensational\\" aspects of all that could go wrong. This is best left to the doctors and hospitals who want to keep you in the dark so that they can more easily and time-efficiently \\"process\\" you through your labor and delivery.I HIGHLY recommend reading the first part of this book, especially if you are a grandparent-to-be and your offspring has chosen to give birth naturally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opened my eyes!","review":"I'm only 22 but from a very young age I have been fascinated by pregnancy and childbirth. I picked up this book on a whim and ended up carrying it around with me for several days until I had read every word. This book is invaluable. Every woman who is thinking about getting pregnant, even women who aren't, women who are pregnant, woamn who have had kids, nurses, doctors, doula's, midwives, and even men all NEED to read this book. This book will make you feel like your body is capable of anything and I believe one of the major factors in the increase in medical interventions now days is that woman are afraid and doubtful and to make matters worse, they have nothing to tell them otherwise. This is a GREAT read and very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BOOK!","review":"Has alot of great stuff in it. Two of our midwives were raised on the farm so it's nice to read about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me through Pushing","review":"I read this book at 11 days past my due date. I'd already read Spiritual Midwifery, so I skipped most of the stories. I read the instructions for the mom, and the mantra \\"let your monkey do it\\" is what stuck in my head. Thanks to this book, I knew what to tell myself while I was pushing my son out, and was able to just let go and push. I really think this book contributed to my success, and it really presents a positive message free of the fear many pregnancy books contain. I'm so glad I read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great quick read","review":"The stories were inspiring and the information very useful. This definitely helped me to believe that I could have a natural childbirth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter book","review":"The book is broken up into two parts. The first is personal stories of natural births, the second about the data Ina May has been collecting about natural childbirth at the Farm. The personal stories have a lot of helpful coaching techniques sprinkled in here and there but overall, the book is not a how-to book, it's more of an inspirational book. If you are looking for specific techniques etc, then this may not be the right choice. If you are looking for support in the idea of having a natural childbirth, this book is very inspiring. I've already lent my copy out and will continue to recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"I LOVE this book!! My midwife suggested it since I was having my 1st child (and 1st home birth!!) and was having some fears regarding childbirth. I'm so stoked she told me to buy it! Seriously, best book to read while pregnant (and Hypnobirth!!). It took the fear out of childbirth and really cemented in my mind that I'd made the right choice for myself. Now that my daughter is 4 months old I'm more then thrilled with the avenue we chose and I feel I was as prepared as I could have possibly gotten thanks to these two books, good midwives, and lots of research!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All women should read this book!","review":"After reading this I felt beautiful, empowered and optimistic about my decision to have my baby with midwives at a birthcenter. I also felt very alone. So few women know the truth about medical procedures that are commonly practiced during childbirth. I always feel like I have to justify my decision to others.Women NEED this information so they can make an informed decision about their caregiver and birth place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info, but unclear about some points.","review":"This book is packed with info and great stories. It truly makes a woman feel empowered to give birth naturally. I especially liked the information on positions for birthing and helping shoulder dystocia.However, my only gripe about the book is that she is very anti-medical (which I know most MWs are), and she had an obvious bias in that respect to the point that she actually misrepresented a few facts. The only way I know this is that I work in the medical community and it was obvious that she was \\"twisting words\\" to make things sound the way she wanted. The points were rather small and almost irrelevant, so I still enjoyed the book and feel like any woman wanting to give birth naturally should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Birth Book","review":"This book is an essential read for any woman having a baby. It is very well researched and although Ina May is obviously in favor of natural childbirth she is thorough and as unbiased as possible in her investigation of pain medicines and birthing choices.Whether you plan to have your baby at home or in a hospital this book will give you the education and inspiration you need to feel confident and excited about your birth plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Another must read for pregnant women to know all their options about birth. Gives you a beautiful outlook on the birthing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring birth stories and preachy politics","review":"The birth stories in this book were very inspiring to me. They are written by women of many different backgrounds and situations. Not every woman who shared her story had a completely natural, out-of-hospital birth. I did not like the chapters on how to improve the U.S. maternal healthcare system. Mrs. Gaskin believes in socialized medicine, which some readers will disagree with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!","review":"For all of you pregnant mamas out there: A MUST READ! I am so inspired by this book, which has helped vanish all my fears and made me feel amazingly confident and ready for the beautiful natural birth of our son."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not have had the birth I'd hoped for without this book","review":"After transforming from a pregnant woman who wanted to schedule a c-section to a woman who labored without medication for 40 hours and gave birth to a healthy, loving son, I love sharing my son's birth story with friends and family. I could not have done it without Ina May Gaskin. Her words helped me gather the courage and resilience I needed and as I went into labor I felt confident, calm and powerfully focused. I believe my experience would have been quite different had it not been for Ina May's guidance. Thank you - this book is invaluable as is her guide to breastfeeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my Life Perspective","review":"A friend gave me this book when I wanted to have a baby but was so afraid of birth. This book will change every image you ever conjured up about birth. It debunks myths about childbirth and embraces it as a natural part of life. The stories are honest and beautiful. I stayed up reading it until 3am. I am now pregant and can think of no better book for anyone interested in learning about childbirth to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!!","review":"This is an excellent book for prospective new mothers and for birth professionals. New parents share their birth stories, and one is able to learn that birth does not have to be a scary, painful experience, which mothers can endure only with drugs. The second half of the book details and explains many interventions, tests, and controversial drugs, currently being used for the convenience of doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies. Prospective parents need to know about the pros and cons of these tests, to make an informed decision about what kind of a birth experience they wish to have. Open minded MD's, midwives, and parents will learn and enjoy this powerful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The confidence I needed","review":"While I did not get very much out of the birth stories at the beginning, I am still glad I read them; however, it was the second half of the book that proved most useful for me. I found her approach, information, and statistics reassuring for my decision to have a homebirth, and reaffirmed my belief in my body to \\"do what it is supposed to do\\". Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ina May's Informative","review":"This is an informative book for women planning to give natural OR \\"assisted\\" birth. The real-people stories in the beginning of the book are an added treat. I only wish I knew of a contemporary reference book. This one could be slightly updated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Expectations","review":"The \\"ecstasy\\" of childbirth? Having an orgasm as you push your baby into the world? Giving birth on a \\"farm\\" completely free of medical interventions? These are a few of the ideas this book touts to its readers, while simultaneously discrediting many legitimate obstetric procedures. This book does more to make women feel guilty and inadequate for requiring medical interventions with their births than it does to empower women with tools to use to reach the goal of natural childbirth. Most importantly, it loses sight of the fact that the ultimate goal of childbirth is not to forsake all medication, but rather for both mother and baby to emerge from the experience healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for something useful to the baby.","review":"I'm in my 34th week of pregnancy and wanted to read up on what to expect when I give birth. This book was reccomended to me, but I couldn't stand this book. Ina May pounding the messages of \\"hospitals are evil\\", \\"Doctors are idiots\\" and \\"Men who aren't your husband are all clueless\\" was too much. Since the book had been reccomended to me, I was trying to make my way through it (After skipping half of the \\"empowering\\" birthing stories in the first half of the book) but when I got to the message of \\"ALL prenatal screening and tests are unecessary and postentially harmful\\" I had enough. I'm returning this book to get something, anything better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childbirth - Natural Childbirth?!","review":"I actually have nothing negative to say about this book. It is a must read right along with the book, \\"The Joy of Natural Chilbirth\\" by Helen Wessel. (even if you have tradition, hospital births, you will only be blessed by reading Wessel's book) Between these two books, you will have alot of knowledge of what happens during pregnancy, labor and delivery. With knowledge, fear disappears.Get your own copy of this out of print book:The Joy of Natural Childbirth: Fifth Edition of Natural Childbirth and the Christian Family"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended - best childbirth book!","review":"This is the book that I always loan out first to any pregnant friend and all my doula clients. The first half of the book tells stories of natural childbirth, widely variant but all beautiful. (Many are from the 70s, so they come with some hippy flavor.) The second half is a clear and easily understood discussion of natural childbirth, and helps to formulate the questions every woman should have for her care provider. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and inspiring book","review":"I am pregnant with my first child and am planning to give birth at home with a midwife. The first half of this book, composed of birth stories, was very inspiring. The second half of the book is filled with tons of great information that really helped to build my confidence in my body and the birthing process. I recommend this book to anyone interested in natural childbirth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"Book was delivered quickly and in great condition. The book itself is absolutely amazing. Just reading this has made me feel so empowered and ready to give birth - actually looking forward to it! There are a lot of birth stories to read about other women who have been through all kinds of experiences as well as Ina May's input about different aspects of labor and delivery. She speaks about the labor process and what it happening inside your body. I think I'm going to bring this book with me to the hospital to remind me that I can do this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed our perspectives, opened our minds","review":"My husband and I read this book when I was about 4 months pregnant. To say that it completely changed our view about childbirth is an understatement. The stories in this book are touching, moving, compelling, and very real. They are empowering. We had forgotten how much childbirth is a natural process. We are accustomed to thinking about it as a medical procedure. This book empowered us to rethink our childbirth experience and took away the fear and anxiety around childbirth. In the U.S., we so rarely get to share the experience of childbirth with other people. The stories in this book bring those experiences to us. We highly recommend this too all expecting fathers and mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I do not have enough money take any $200-$300 classes so I decided to buy this book instead. I am so glad that I did. Although I will be having a hospital birth due to the lack of birth centers and lack of midwives in my area, this book had information that I can use for my natural birth in the hospital. The author is not a big fan of hospitals but I enjoyed the book because I could look past her opinions. Some people who are having hospital births may not like the book because the first half of the book talks about natural birth at a birth center. Although I will not be able to relate, the stories were very encouraging. I would recommend this book to first time moms planning a natural birth, who need encouragement after hearing so many horror stories about natural birth. This book surely helped me! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read for all pregnant women","review":"The title pretty much says it all, but I will expand anyway. This book is incredibly informative, descriptive, and just all around amazing. There. That says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST for any pregnant woman!!!","review":"I found this book when I was in my third pregnancy, I wish I had found it with my first! After two spinal blocks that left me with chronic back pain i was not sure what I would do when I found out I was pregnant. This book gave me not only the knowledge of every aspect of what would be happening, it gave me the CONFIDENCE to go the drug free route! I am so glad I did! I realized that fear is what causes pain in childbirth, not the process of childbirth.A very empowering book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Useful Book I Read During My Pregnancy","review":"After reading this book 3 times during my 2007 pregnancy (and taking Lamaze classes), I looked forward to labor and delivery with excitement, rather than fear. I felt confident in my body's ability to deliver my baby safely and naturally without being numbed by drugs or sliced open by a surgeon. This book not only helped me avoid an epidural, but it gave me the confidence to wait it out when I was a few days overdue and my doctor suggested that I be induced. (Of course I would have agreed if it had been necessary, but since all was well with the baby, I knew she would arrive when SHE was ready, and she did, 7 days after my due date.) I had an amazing, empowering natural birth and this book was invaluable to me. I will share it with many women over the years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The simplicity of what we complicate","review":"I was beginning to doubt whether I would be able to give birth to my first baby without pain medications when I started to read this book. I found the birthing stories to be reassuring and empowering; they helped me reconnect with my body and its ability to do what it is designed to do.As a society, I think we have a tendency to stay in our heads and analyse every situation whether it's appropriate or not. When it comes to something as natural as having a baby, I would rather analyse less and trust my body's innate ability more. The two sections of this book were a perfect combination for me to learn to trust my body again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book","review":"I can't believe I ever had a child without this book. She is honest, insightful and cheery. This book is a real asset for any momma or doula.."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Must-read book for Childbirth","review":"Out of all the childbirth books I have read this is by far my favorite. I learned so much from this book and feel at peace now with the natural process of birth. From this book I realized that birth in most cases is a natural, non-emergency and also learned about the complications of routine hospital interventions (Inducing, epidural, and cesareans). This is the the #1 book I will be recommending to all my friends who become pregnant.My mother-in-law just last year had a life threatening complication, possibly from a Cesarean she had 25 years ago. This book really put all the choices into perspective for me. I have now chosen a drug-free, natural childbirth at a Birthing Center.As friends and family tell me their hospital horror stories I now can see what caused that complication in the first place. I no longer feel fear for birth, just excitement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent goal","review":"I got the book when I was pregnant with my first (and only) child. I loved it! It gave me so much insight. Several birthing books out there made me feel a little anxious about giving birth and then hearing people's personal stories really made me concerned. I was not sure that I could handle childbirth! But after reading this book, I felt so confident and it really helped ease my worries. However, despite my goals of having a natural, painless labor, I ended up screaming my lungs out until finally my husband convinced me to get some drugs! Oh the poor people who had to witness that! Anyway I did love labor, contrations hurt like nothing else, but when I could finally push I was so happy. I would highly reccommend this book to any pregnant women. It is so nice to read and to have a plan on how you want to give birth (even if your plan ends up getting altered a little!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed How I Viewed Giving Birth","review":"I'm 17 weeks pregnant, and while I'm overjoyed to be pregnant...I've always been afraid of the pain I'll experience during childbirth. Reading Ina May's book, and the birth stories of the women in it, has changed all of that. I feel that I can handle labor now...and am even toying with the idea of not using drugs. (Prior to this, I used to say that I'd like an epidural plus any other drug they'd give me.) Even if I end up using some pain meds, I know I'll be entering the labor process without the level of fear I had before. That is priceless. This is a must-read for any pregnant woman and her husband...whether or not she wants to have a medicated or non-medicated birth. Bravo Ina May! Just wish I lived closer to TN so that I could use her services."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, Informative, FABULOUS!","review":"You wouldn't expect anything less from Ina May, the queen of midwifery and home birth. This book was recommended to me by a friend who read it during her pregnancy and decided to use a midwife after finishing it. The first half of the book is full of successful, inspiring home birth stories. The second half really explains what happens to your body during pregnancy and labor. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone considering home birth (or anyone who wants a little extra dose of confidence in themselves before going into labor!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Practically all birth stories","review":"Lot of good birth stories, essentially the entire book is birth stories. However, it is clear what her feelings are about ANY interventions. Lots of stats that will freak you out about the problems with interventions. Lots of bias out there for unquestioned Western medicine so it's good to get the other perspective. However, it is overkill if you are taking a natural childbirth class as there is nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories and Theories","review":"The first half of the book is full of birth stories... These are fabulous, as many reviewers note!However, if like some reviewers, you find the birth stories boring, or feel like they're not applicable to you and your plans for a hospital birth, just SKIP THE FIRST HALF OF THE BOOK.The second half is more of a theoretical discussion on labor and birth. It's full of a-ha moments. Sphincter law is relevant for anyone, regardless of their birth plans! If you want a deeper understanding of how the female body works, and how to work with it, not from a medical anatomy perspective but from a hands-on real-life-experience perspective, this is the book to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hippyish for me","review":"I am definitely for natural childbirth to some degree. I think that natural is best but I also don't think that modern medicine should be totally ignored. This is not necessarily a bad book I just couldn't get past how these people sound like crazy hippies. Some parts were just plain creepy and semi-pornographic and I really just couldn't finish the book. I would recommendHomebirth in the Hospital: Integrating Natural Childbirth with Modern Medicinewhich advocates an even (and realistic) balance between modern medicine and natural childbirth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused why this is so highly rated.","review":"Not quite sure why all the reviewers are \\"raving\\" about this book. First of all you can completely get rid of the first half of the book. It provided NO value at all regarding childbirth other than to tell even more \\"scary\\" stories which is what Ina May keeps insisting that we avoid. The second half of the book was informative but outdated. I did not walk away from this book feeling empowered to have a natural childbirth. She does not talk about relaxation techniques that you could practically use in a hospital setting. This would only be a good book if you were having a home birth assisted by \\"hippies\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very realistic for a CA mom-to-be","review":"This book is sweet and old-fashioned but it is all about giving birth at THE FARM with midwives. For somoeone like me who knows I will have the baby in a hospital with a doctor, though naturally, the book did nothing for me. It in fact made me feel like what I wanted to do was not good enough. Plus, half of the book was just people's boring stories, all of which were pretty much the same. If you are in my shoes, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Black and White?","review":"I read this book together with a lot of other books during my wife's pregnancy. The experience reports might be nice for people who like it (which I don't) but the second advisery part is completely unbalanced. The world is not black and white as this book wants to make you think. None of the described evils that supposedly awaits you if you choose a doctor and a hospital during your pregnancy ever happened to us so far. This might have been relevant 40 years ago but with a little knowledge and curiosity nowadays you can easily get the best of both \\"worlds\\" (a differentiation that put me off right away). You definitely should not use this book as your only source of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this before you buy this book","review":"This book was not a good choice for me.

By unanimous agreement, the book is now in my compost bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic read","review":"This is a wonderful book. The stories are so weel written and the writing so weel done.

There is a section of birth stories from various women that will inspire you...that yes, natural childbirth is a beautiful, normal process our bodies are made to go through. She also covers all the facts you need to know in order to educate yourself about the various screening tests, procedures and equipment you might see in a hospital setting. My favorite part is how she discusses the mind/body connection during labor and the stories she tells of women who have either regressed or progressed based on this connection. I will be giving birth in a hospital and feel better prepared, yet this books makes me wish I could give birth with a midwife at home-- unfortunately it is not legal here in AL."},{"rating":"2","title":"is it real??","review":"I think this is a much needed book for moms all around.

It really helped me prepare mentally for the birth. The major thing that I took away from it was to stay positive during birth. If you're negative and crabby, which is so easy to do when you're in a lot of pain for a long period of time, it truly does slow down labor. Ina May Gaskin has such wonderful life experiences and I am grateful that she is so willing to share them. The book includes her knowledge as well as many wonderful birth stories from many different women. A must read if you are preparing to deliver a child or if you just love reading about birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"I'm planning an all natural vbac at a hospital in a few months and this book was a great reference and awesome inspiration to keep me in the right frame of mind.

And it is very nice and authentic to look at ,too, but the story makes no sense what-some-ever.The \\"alleged\\" romance between Elgar and violinist, Jelly d'Aranyi as depicted in this movie ,is no more that mild attempt on Elgar's part to get a kiss from the young woman.The scenes are just thrown together,the script not well written and Veteran Btitish charactor actress, Faith Brook, is wasted in the role of Elgar's critically ill wife, as are most of the other cast members.The only things I felt at the end were confusion over what it was all about in the first place and ,relief that the whole thing was over.Only a dedicated James Fox fan,like myself, would see a good reason to get this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics Headset","review":"The headset works great.

For some reason, just one bird eating seed on a log and then flying off, captured her attention. Subsequently, she left the room. I lent the tape to my dad for his cat to see.

However, you can only do this to just listen to a CD, which means you have to wake up to track one every day. Bummer. Also, I bought this because one of the product advertisers said you could wake up with the MP3 player (amazon doesn't say this, but I saw it somewhere or I wouldn't have bought it) and that obviously is not true.

We keep the volume on the CD pretty low, which unfortunately also controls the alarm as well. The blue light when it runs is not too bright - It actually serves as a nice night light. The nature sounds are very soothing, and we will probably use that feature more when she is older. I wish that these were independent of eachother. Other than that, this has been a super product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed with this alarm clock.","review":"Right from the box, one of the LCD displays did not work.

I am very happy with it so far, but have been so busy at work that I haven't been able to really check it out yet. I don't have a problem with the display or the time setting. I purchased it mainly for the radio/cd player functions. I don't need an alarm, sleep button, snooze alarm, etc. One of the guys at work has the same radio at home and he and his wife love it.

But It's A Biggie","review":"I loved every feature of this CD/clock radio: the design, the easily programmable functions, and the several options for audio (Radio, CD, MP3).But Timex totally went cheap on the speakers. They are simply awful. There's no bass output and the mid-high ranges warble so badly you wonder if the speakers are loose or cracked. The unit does sound great with headphones or stand-alone powered speakers, but who wants to wear headphones to bed? What's the point of buying $100 speakers for my $60 alarm clock?One other small irritant. The volume is weak. I'm getting a little irritated with audio products that produce imperceptible volume until you dial it up past level 4. I mean, it's not my stereo but level 1 - 3 of volume should be level 1 - 3 ... not level 0. Wouldn't you agree?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of Junk","review":"Bought this for my mother.

But within a month the so-called \\"Smart Knob\\" quit working entirely. Now the thing is useless - can't set the alarms, can't change the volume (permanently set at an inaudible \\"1\\").

Especially nice is the large knob on the front which controls the volume among other things. So many clock radios force you to fumble around on the back of the device to adjust volume - no fun in the middle of the night. The digital read-out is large and clear. Controls are easy to use. The earphone jack and MP3 capability show that someone in engineering was paying attention. A nice-looking unit that is a bit tall for the nightstand, but it sure does everything you might ask it to do. My only complaint might be with the AM side of the radio band. As usual with modern radios, the AM seems a bit puny and will not clearly pull in the lower-powered stations in town. Some of us like to listen to AM talk radio at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds are not soothing","review":"The ocean sound would have been great for soothing white noise if it weren't for the squawking seagulls on top of the waves -- makes it kind of hard to sleep to..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eimex CD Clock Radio","review":"This is exactly what I've been looking for, for years, a CD player and radio with push button stations.

All of the controls either stopped responding or began to operate other functions in a chaotic way.

Non-intuitive on how to change anything but the time and how often do you do that, well quite often since the button to trigger it is up high in back where you end up accidental hitting it if you grab the top to find the controls.

I wish you could turn the clock light off at night (although the dim feature is good). It would also be better if the blue light from the CD player was not so bright while it was playing. I had to use a CD to get decent nature sounds because the ones provided are very short sound bites and repeat too often. Unfortunately, the provider of the the ocean waves which I really wanted decided it was necessary to add seagull sounds. It sounds more like a puppy crying and I just couldn't get past that. The other sounds didn't do much for me either. So I downloaded a CD of ocean waves and use that. Luckily I have not had the issues with the CD player, thus far that have been reported in earlier review. I wish too that the alarms could be set for a pattern like weekday, weekend, etc. All in all it is a good a radio and serves the purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product has many features but very poor audio quality","review":"This clock/music player functions, however for the price, the audio quality is very poor for both lower and higher frequencies. In these ranges, the audio breaks up or rumbles. Only mid-range frequencies sound OK.When playing a CD, a blue light shines from the player.

For SIMPLICITY sake. This thing is way too confusing and not user friendly. And it plays your mp3 player but doesn't charge it - so either i plug my ipod into the wall before i hook it up to the Timex = or it's dead when i wake up. The bright lights don't bother me as much as others. My worst complaint - i go to sleep well after my wife and when you set the alarm on it it BEEPS - 2 Times!- and relatively loud.

It was also quite a bit more complex to set up than we wanted. Button functions are unclear. To turn the CD off, for example, you have to hit a button labeled Off/Alarm Reset. Does this both turn off the CD AND reset the alarms? Who knows? You can't tell from the very skimpy manual, either. On ours, the LCD went funny with weird shapes and indecipherable characters almost immediately and the battery backup did not seem to do the job.

I had purchased three, but two wouldn't play the CD and the other had a battery backup that only lasted a few minutes. Then I spotted the Timex T617S and ordered it through Amazon. And I'm happy I did. It's not a bad little clock radio. The display isn't too bright and I can read it from several feet away at night; the CD plays well and I can even use random play; and the battery backup is great - it wakes you with a buzzer even if there isn't any power.

Right now we use it to sooth my infant with the white noise and Lullaby CD's, but soon enough he too will be wanting to listen to his own music and with two of these I don't have to worry about them fighting over it.

The sound from the speakers on FM stations was defective - scratchy, as if speakers had been \\"blown through\\" with high intensity music. It was not an issue of FM reception. Initially, CD player was working, but exhibited same problem with sound quality from speakers. Then it stopped working altogether. I had to return item to the 3rd part seller (at my expense!). Although I asked for replacement, they simply gave me credit through Amazon. I guess they also don't have confidence in the product. The radio has a nice concept and design.

It's also one of the only skins on the market that comes with a built-in hard plastic guard for both the screen and trackpad. All of these things ultimately convinced me to buy this item, and I love it for protective purposes, but I can't hook up my itrip if the skin is on. The rubber bumpers don't allow the itrip sit flush with the ipod...therefore everytime I plan on using the itrip I have to remove the skin.

The dead body frozen in a tree outside his cave is no hallucination5.

He discovers a \\"valentine\\" in the form of a dead body that was left outside of his cave on Valentine's Day and sets out to track down the killer.The movie just rumbles along with plot twists, the mental images are beautiful and the movie is a thriller to the end.I was disappointed with the deleted scenes.

The tight writing and surprising plot twists which frequently caught me flat-footed also delighted me. What I wish to comment on here, though is possibly the best cinematography I have ever seen. Highly surreal and often beautiful still photos and video intertwine gracefully in as high an expression of the film makers visual art as you will ever see. Sometime it is footage that seems to be from the Harlem Renassaince, other times it is a simple black and white still photo or a close in shot of a part of the human anatomy. The effect is stunning.

Not exactly the usual stuff. The plot is just too strange and contrived for it to work, but the acting is excellent. Samuel Jackson is the homeelss guy, and manages to make an unbelievable person believable. (Jackson is one of those actors who can do just about anything)More suprising, though, is Anthony Michael Hall; who would have thought the essence of 80s geek, adolescent division, would turn in a fine performance as a Gucci-loafer-pinstriped-suit yuppie lawyer? In fact, an interesting change would be to have them swap roles. Take the pinstripes and the Guccis away from Hall and give them to Jackson, and dress Hall up as the crazy homeless guy, rags and all.

He tried so hard to make his character believable, but it didn't work. Granted, it wasn't his fault. He did the best he could with a weak role. The script didn't exactly help him out one bit and the pace was slower than it had to be. I hated everytime he would go into one of his \\"crazy spells\\" and see lights and other things that were not there. Everything had a believability factor of ZERO. This is one of those movies where you don't really root for the \\"bad guy\\" or the \\"good guy\\"; you don't root for anyone.

Unfortunately, very little of what made EB such a critical and commercial success is evident in CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE. Not even another winning performance by Samuel L Jackson could save this pretentious clunker of a film. The book on which this screenplay was based is ludicrious enough, yet it seems like Lemmons to go out of her way to make the unbelievable premise even more ridiculous. There was simply no motivation for schizophrenic Romulus to become a crime fighter and there is simply no dramatic pull to keep the audience interested.

The plot is ragged and completely lacks any tension, and Jackson gives one of the worst and most transparent and \\"unresearched\\" roles of his career. Truly cliche after cliche, from the supposed \\"drama\\" of C-grade music, to the weak presentations of supposed \\"mental illness\\", to the hollow and totally unbelievable genius gone mad thing.

It turned out to be a great movie. On the one hand, it's a very decent thriller, on the other hand, it's a good psychological drama.

Second, I absolutely hate the scent. I can't even tell what scent it is. It has that thick old wood/w/e scent to it. Either way, it gave me huge migrane (I'm very very sensitive to scents, I don't use perfume nor get near a person who uses perfume. I also avoid going to Yankee candles). Howere, since I purchased it, I use it on other body parts where I wouldnt smell so much, such as my abs, legs, etc...(just away from my face).

So far, in just 2 nights of use, this serum has drastically reduced some smile lines that were starting to concern me. I can't wait to see what regular use will do for my forehead lines, which are a bit more troubling. I'll check back and let everyone know.One negative....the smell is a bit strong. It smells like a combination of cheap perfume and patchouli. Personally, I just apply the serum before bed and wear it overnight. I don't wear it during the day due to the smell and the fact that it is oily and doesn't mix well with moisturizer and foundation. However, it's perfect as an overnight treatment and the price can't be beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I had heard great things about Hyaluronic Acid and really wanted to try it. I chose Source Naturals because I had heard good things about their products. I read the reviews before I bought this and did see people complain of the smell. I figured it wouldn't be to bad and the product was worth trying. I was wrong. The smell is overpowering. If you use this try it on your hands first, not your face like I did. If you don't like the smell it will not wash off or fade until it has run its course. I was so frustrated I could not get the smell off. My husband commented on it when he got home and walked in the door, he thought it was nice. However, after being in the same room with me he thought it was nauseating. I had only used one pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super stinky","review":"I tried it and just couldn't continue using it. It has a sickeningly sweet smell no matter what I do. The product can be irritating but if put on after splashing your face with water and a little moisturizer, it's fine. I wanted to keep using it but I just could not get over the smell. I don't know if this is with every manufacturer. If the nature of the liquid is smelly. If it is, I'll have to use other products. So yes.. it works.. No, I won't use it because of the smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I liked this product. It smoothed my skin and tightened it.

Unfortunately, my skin never learned to, it burned and irritated my skin every time I used it. I have used another similar serum from NOW that worked great and didn't burn. I didn't notice that this serum was beneficial to my skin, but it may be that my skin is just to sensitive to tolerate it.

There are many fetishes and role playing scenarios that are looked at ranging from basics of clothing to the very intense use of needles or the very humiliating use of human ashtrays.

CC Williams was a different kind of character, and it was refreshing to read a space adventure with such a unique twist. In this novel, fledgling corporate auditor CC Williams is assigned to audit the business activities on the asteroid Vesta. The details about what it would really be liked to travel in space, and live on a micro-gravity asteroid showed a lot of research and thought, and gave this book a really fresh perspective. The plot was full of intrigue, and kept me guessing (which is hard!) and I applaud Ms. Shwartz for writing a hard s.f. novel with plenty of heart and excellent characterizations.I recommend this book to all who like a rousing adventure in space that has a really unique point of view of the future of space travel.-A.C.

Not only do I concur with other reviewers about the weakness of plot and lack of any real action, but it is written very poorly. After the third confusing passage where we start in the present, progress to a past/future flashback, and then end up back in the future present...I gave up. The use of this writing tool in the book makes it completely confusing and unreadable. I hated it, put it down for the day, cussing the entire time, and later burned in my fireplace for kindling.

It pictures, in magnificent detail, a collection of commuter airliners, including the Cessna 402, Embraer EMB-120 and the Fokker 100. There is not too much writing, and I would not hesitate to say that, in some cases, there should be at least a little biography of the aircraft, but this book really does give an insight into how small feeder airlines choose these great, small aircraft.

This band is completely talentless they can't string two words together let alone guitar, rythmn, and vocal parts. The vocalist seems like he is trying too hard and the guitarists seem like they had just started learning how to play a guitar while in the progress of making this album. Basically the only people who really like this album are burn-out stoner metal fans and those fans of metal who refuse to acknowledge that death metal and metalcore are dying breeds of the metal scene. The only reason that I gave this album a 2 star review is because some of the songs possess some pretty memorable breakdowns however that does not even begin to save this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"OmGzZZzZZ","review":"Omg Gloria iz lyke my fav person and this iz my fav book eveRRrRRrrr.

Added to this was a really clunky set of side-stories, not the least of which is the not-at-all believable story of the diagnosis and treatment of the cancer of Matt Gennaro, detective Gloria Lamerino's love interest. Dialog is creaky, characters mostly cardboard. I had to force myself to read to the very end, hoping futilely that I hadn't figured out the denouement, that there might be a surprise awaiting me.

The protagonist was an idiot, the peripheral characters were all completely cartoonish, and everything moved too fast with not enough exposition. I skipped all the way through to the last 30 or so pages and then pieced together what happened from the \\"let's spell it out for the dummies\\" finale. The main reason the book rubbed me the wrong way is because I have a two year old, and the thought of the idiot protagonist allowing his 7 year old daughter into any of the situations they found themselves makes me ill.

Also extremely unrealistic and offensive to me were the conversations of supposedly intelligent and caring adults in the presence of a child.

It would have seemed much more likely that he would be puzzled by all the revelations about his past than angry. The concept of the \\"town gone bad\\" with all those citizens & police in a virtual conspiracy against the outsider is pretty ludicrous & unbelievable, too.

This one deals almost exclusively with the efforts of people to get further and further north, culminating in attempts to reach the North Pole.What makes these accounts different from the others available is its reliance on presenting the stories in the words of the participants. Most of the reading is from the accounts of the explorers themselves. Mowat simply throws in an introduction, occasional comments for each narrative and an epilog for each venture.With this style of presentation, the story is of necessity selective. It does not purport to be a complete account of all polar ventures. It does, however, give a flavor of the times and the trials undertaken by those who lived them.This is a good read for those who are interested in the genre of exploration and adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"How misleading a title can be","review":"'The Art of Elizabeth Blackadder': aha!,thinks an admirer of that fine artist,and orders away .

I was very pleasantly surprised! This is a great book, very detailed with good descriptions of the Karvonon method of calculating HRR (Heart Rate Reserve) and its correlation to VO2 Max and Net VO2 and how to use this information to determine appropriate training zones. It had some good sections on various other fitness activities (such as cycling, swimming and walking) and serves as a good resource for anyone wanting to get fit faster while lowering your chances of injury or overtrainig.I think if you combined this book with \\"Heart Rate Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot\\" you'd posses all the information you'd ever need to train to maximum effectiveness with your heart rate monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book had some good information","review":"I had bought the book to help me with Mtn. bike training and my son with running.

They are repetitive, sale-sy and without any real substance. The contributions by other authors are better, and they do offer some good introductory material for the person interested in fitness training, but little to help in setting up a program, goals, methods, etc. The final discussions about software presents a list of criteria for good software, but no contacts, no list of products or companies, no web page URLs.

This production, performed in Birmingham, England and directed by Derek Jacobi, showcases a young Kenneth Branagh in his first professional attempt at the role. From the first rehearsals, to fight scenes, to interviews with all involved, to the director's notes (a good scene where Branagh is picked on a little by Jacobi), to the eventual performance, this is an excellent primer for what it takes to do this complex play live. Worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product to hear","review":"I like this product since I was a kid. The audio CD works good.

It is very long time ago. The book became a memory of my music life.It was unforgettable that the contemporary music had began with Debussy's \\"Prelude a l'ares-midi d'un faune\\". After reading the book, I analyzed the Debussy's score then I was totally convinced.I met many contemprary composers in this book. I tried to listen thier music later, some of I love, some of not.Griffiths's writing is clear and I think he captures the overall picture of 20th century serious music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy, yet accessible.","review":"The Esbjörn Svensson Trio, or EST for short, are simply the hottest European jazz outfit in the world right now. Their brand of highly modernistic instrumental compositions have won plaudits from the likes of Pat Metheny and Jamie Cullum, while critical acclaim has been unrelenting over their 13-year history - auspiciously they became the very first European jazz outfit to grace the front cover of American jazz bible Downbeat.While maintaining a credible and contemporary edge to their improvisation, the band manage to create instantly accessible and beautiful themes in their music and this is the key to their continued popularity both with audiences and critics alike.'Viaticum' is set for a similar reception, it's an album that grabs you straight from the off but at the same time demands repeated listening to make sure you catch all the detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"GR8 movie!","review":"I loved this movie and will buy copies for friends.

I'm always looking for good family entertainment and this sounded like a winner, but we were sadly disappointed with this movie. The acting was poor (except for the main character who is a veteran of film and TV) and the script way below average. All of my family walked out on this one; I stayed with it till the end and lo and behold the last 5 minutes were the best part of the movie. Finally the dialogue and people stopped being too cute and too forced and became \\"real\\". I've seen much better Billy Graham films than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was an OK movie","review":"The movie was slow. The worst part was the way the girl was dressed.

Just bad, in general. I feel like he should not be encouraged to be a writer. It is what I want to be when I grow up, and I think I can already write better than this, which depends on shock effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provacative in its emotional familiarity","review":"This book was fast-paced and relatively easy to read, yet decidedly unnerving and creepy. Creepy, not because of the characters, who are often downright wholesome and sympathetic. But because, as it turns out, these modern-day Jane Eyre-like folks end up doing things that make most of us uncomfortable thinking about, no less doing ourselves. One can't help identifying with the innocence pervading each decadent and/or criminal relationship. The most frightening thought that crossed my mind was that somehow this book reflects the innocent decadence of our time. To sum up: entertaining throughout and mind-expanding, thought-provoking stuff. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Treasure","review":"For those who think there's no beautiful, vital fiction being written any more, that the modern novelist is getting tripped up by his or her own cleverness, or is stumped by the challenge of emotional honesty, think again. Matt Sharpe has given birth to a fictional hero who could hold her own against Huck Finn. Nothing is Terrible is an understated masterpiece with all the wit, feeling and literary slyness of Catcher in the Rye. This book deserves to be read; and once read it will certainly be remembered.Summary: One of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Splendid","review":"The book itself was in mint condition, and the novel itself is absolutely hilarious! A real knee-slapper. Definitely not terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written But Offensive","review":"I actually agree with many of the reviewers that this is a well-written book and a quick read. I kept reading it because I found it interesting. However, the \\"happy\\" ending, in particular, seems to me to suggest that childhood sexual abuse is OK. (Don't continue reading this review if you don't want to know how the book ends.) It's bad enough for a twelve year old to have an affair with her teacher, but Mary/Paul spends years with her, leaves her, and then goes back, and will apparently now live happily ever after. I found this offensive. I don't understand why people would say this book is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone needs to know this","review":"This DVD is about being fat, the consequences, and options for losing the fat.

We are very close so I wanted to be sure she had some sort of understanding on why her aunt wasn't feeling very well and didn't have hair anymore. It was nice because it doesn't get into too much detail but helps kids understand a little of what is going on without scaring them.

The characters were so realistic, that I found myself wanting more even after I had finished. I would also like to commend the photographer who took the picture of the front cover. The models that were selected made me feel closer to the characters. I loved everything about Jordan and Starris. The fact that he was a strong and intelligent black brother who was also sexy just hit home for me.Starris was a wonderful herione. She was smart and beautiful and a lot of her self esteem issues I found I could really relate to.

Then the other one went on the fritz--it just stops playing CDs in the middle, and sometimes starts skipping. Now the replacement one they sent is starting to skip when I play the nature sounds.

The connectors are very high quality.Now I'm building an entertainment wall and decided it would be a good idea to replace the tool since the blades were getting dull. I've now gone through five of these tools and all broke on the first or second use and were replaced by Lowes. But alas my last one broke also and it's been too long so I can't take it back, so now I'll have to use some other (inferior) connector process.Zenith must have changed something in their manufacturing process.

After only two connections, the tool broke. This meant a trip back to Lowe's to purchase another one. Guess what, this one broke after only one connection. The undersized nut's soft threads stripped. This made the entire installation worthless, because standard RG6 connectors will not fit the Quad shield Zenith cable. Also, the instruction sheet that came with the tool was a very poor quality photocopy, making the illistrations worthless. Lastly, the tool's cable stripper did not work very well either. I plan to pull out the Zenith cable and return it along with the connectors (which were too expensive by the way), and both tools and return it all to Lowe's, with a recommendaton that Lowe's remove these items from their shelf. I wasted a whole day using this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"It was either bad when I received it, or it broke the first time I tried to use it.

I'm 20 year-old college student on a tight budget. There's lots of excellent recipes in here which can be made very cheaply, and I have yet to make one that isn't delicious. The Chilean Quinoa Tabouleh is hands-down the best tabouleh I've EVER had, and I can make a large, large portion of it for around $6-$7. I never conceptualized the cookbook as being \\"authentic,\\" rather I viewed it from the start as a cookbook written by an American woman drawing global inspiration. That's exactly what it is, and it's delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A go to cookbook","review":"It isn't exactly the definitive cookbook for whatever cuisine you are looking for but the recipes are a great starting point for trying new cuisines or exploring those you currently enjoy.

It is truly a might volume of international culinary delights and chock full of information.However, as I am Asian and have traveled to several of the countries written about in the book, I find most of the recipes watered down versions of the originals. These recipes are also lengthy and call for ingredients that you'd have to make a special trip to the market or deli for.No offense meant to anyone, but I find that the recipes here have also been tailored for American tastes.

This is in no way a terrible book, i agree that the way it is layed out can be a little confusing but cook books should be merited on their recipies and not really on the design aspect. Every meal I have cooked out of this book has been absolutely gorgeous and my wife and I keep returning to it again and again. Every time we entertain and cook from this book all our guests comment on the quality of the food and several have bought this book after sampling one of its recipies. As a previous reviewer remarked you could (probably) pick a recipie at random and use it to entertain with knowing it would be a great meal.

However, Lukins said that she was putting her own spin on these things, so I don't feel that there was any attempt at deception.What is there, instead, are many delicious recipes that are neither overly intimidating nor so exotic as to be difficult to produce in an American kitchen. My favorites include the pasta arrabiata (incredible), the caribbean fish pot (wow), the soto banjar (Indonesian chicken noodles), and the tortillas de patatas (Spanish egg/potato cake, similar to a frittata). Those are just off the top of my head-- I don't even have the book handy at the moment.

You end up needing all six types to develop your sity to its full potential, so you have to figure out, via city design or other strategies, how to assure that they don't fight with one another.It's a fun game, and has more than the usual subtleties to it.

I had to align the bottom pan at just the right position to the springform pan before I could correctly clasp the whole pan shut - takes skill and about a minute (it only takes about 3 seconds with the Kaiser La Forme pan). I would only recommend this pan for bakers on a budget, or budding bakers who are just experimenting with baking.

I own three of their publications now, one being '50 Self-Portraits' and another on Tadema. If you have an inclination to dwell awhile on the stunning legacy of Caravaggio, this should more than do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ at the price","review":"I've seen nicer books coming in at several hundred dollars but for the ~$5 you really can't beat this one Plenty of beautiful full color plates this makes an excellent student edition and a reference book for home.

It nearly impossible for the average person to get access to this much comic history in a printed format, even by buying collections and trade paperbacks.

Bo Jackson was my favorite athlete along with Michael Jordan growing up and I was so obsessed with him that I name my cat Bo (my mother wouldn't go for \\"air\\" after Michael Jordan). The book, although interesting in that it chronicles his life and many trials and tribulations, is perhaps most special because of how good of athlete Bo Jackson was and how quick his career ended later. He is without a doubt one of the best athletes of all time and an all star in both baseball and football. He was truly a special talent who if he had not been plagued by injury might have shattered all kinds of records in both leagues. There has not been an athlete like him in the last 20 years so we can only hope another talent like him will come along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I purchased this updated version 1/5/07.

He explains clearly the various methods for brewing (drip, French press, vacuum method, the percolator etc.) And, of course, he has info about making espresso properly.Most of the book consists of recipes, and I appreciated knowing the difference between, for example, the Cappuccino and the Cappuccino Royale (the Royale is a Cappuccino topped with whipped cream, and often with almond, rum, brandy, mint, or vanilla extract).If you're a beginner, it's useful to have this information all in one place, but I must say that most of this is readily available on the Internet.

We don't have a blanket roller--looks like a paper towel roller turned on it's side--so the dragging of an 8 Mil blanket across the decking each day caused it to last us barely 2 seasons. The blanket also only heats the top half of the water, so when you get into the pool the top half of the water is REALLY warm & the bottom half is pretty darn cold--it requires some mixing up.

The author doesn't hide embarassing or uncomfortable mistakes, and openly admits the struggles and doubts he and others faced during this experiment. The other notable atribute of this book is it's broadness, which is in turns both good and bad. On one hand, the author's academic background and lack of previous hands-on experience provide a unique perspective from which he assesses the progress, revelations and the mysteries of heart and spirit that they encounter. On the other hand, given the comparatively short length of the book to the amount of time covered, a great deal of detail that would have been both helpful and fascinating had to be left out.

I too kept reading, thinking there had to be some reason Candace Bushnell is so famous, thinking it had to get better. It didn't. I found myself in that scenario where I can't decide if I should cut my losses or continue because I have invested so much time. The longer you read, the more the conundrum intensifies.

I have around 100 pages left and I am not even sure if I can continue to read. Janey is an outrageous skank with zero morals or ethics. It isn't a fun, sexy book like Sex and the City, or even 4 Blondes. I'm getting bored with all the low class behavior and general lack of plot.

I also loved the book Sex and the City. Now she has gotten to write fiction and released Four Blondes and Trading Up. Trading Up is about Janie Wilcox -- one of the characters in Four Blondes -- and her exploits as a social climber. As I read this account of New York socialites and the people who love them I couldn't help but be appalled by the weak plot, unsympathetic characters and poor writing. Was Ms. Bushnell leaning toward satire with this book? I couldn't tell. And I couldn't care less about the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. This is unlike Bushnell's sharp and risque former sex column. With Sex and the City, she offered an empathic look at the tangled world in which real people triumph, frolic, and sometimes flail in the city. She did not supply the aforementioned plights with this novel. Disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Don't waste your money. This book has no worth.

Just when you thought something amazing, funny, or romantic was going to happen, it didn't. Nothing at all... And the whole book was like that. It was kind of sad at sometimes, and the main character just has this pathetic little life that is very meaningless.

The story dragged on forever. Who was the good guy? Who was the bad guy? What happened to Mimi in the end. The characters were a bore.

Overall the writing was not very interesting. The characters don't really grow and the endless drinking, clubbing, dating and drugging scenes become dull after awhile (if this is how Manhattan functions, boy do I feel sorry for those folks). I was hoping that Janey's constant evaluations of her situation would eventually lead her to enlightenment but it just doesn't happen. The events of Janey's past and the struggles in her marriage were the good parts of the book.

I even enjoyed the original \\"Sex in the City\\" book. But this one, \\"Trading Up\\", was junk. I didn't even get through a quarter of the novel, and that says a lot for someone who was stuck in a cottage with no car and her entire extended family during a rainy week.E."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Janey, Janey, Janey. The fact of the matter is that after reading this book you still won't understand why she is who she is. After being such an avid fan of Sex & the City, I thought why not read a novel by Candace Bushnell. This book certainly screwed up the momentum. Janey is the most annoying character I have ever encountered in a book. Selfish, self absorbed, and stupid, she shows no growth at all and continues to see the worst in others while not examining herself. Don't buy this book, and I would encourage you not to read it...but if you do, borrow it from the library. If this book accomplishes anything, it is making you feel grateful that Janey Wilcox is in fact a fictional character that you will never have to encounter in real life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored, Bored, Bored...","review":"This is a book I'm just so happy I borrowed ftrom the library and hadn't bought. I was just curious to read something by Candace Bushnell after all the 'Sex and the City' hoopla.And boy, was I disappointed. While it wasn't the worst book I've ever read, and I could've continued to read this if I had nothing better to do (which luckily - isn't the case), I asked myself 'Why Bother?'. When I couldn't find a decent answer for that, I just put the book down, and believe me - it's going back to the library ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too shallow","review":"I bought the book thinking it would be on Candace's typical style of narrating one's character but also NYC. Was disappointed because there isn't much character development (as someone else mentioned here) and not too much intricacy about human nature. One of the possible reason being too many characters in the novel and in the end author tried to make a story. NYC is a great background to built a storyline (eg Woody Allen movies) but using it as a stage to make an orgy won't buy too much. Language style is too rubbish to make it a literary piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candace Bushnell is the next Jackie Collins","review":"This book was a complete waste of my time. Trading Up made me want to re-think my policy on reading a book from cover to cover. I kept hoping that the book would bet better, but it never did. The story centers around a shallow, self-absorbed character named Janey Wilcox. There is nothing redeeming about Janey and she is not an interesting character. Couple this with a meandering plot and additional superficial characters who only care about money and thier looks, and you have the makings of a trashy novel.If you are looking for the same wit that Bushnell used in Sex and the City, don't pick up this book. Move over Jackie Collins, there is a new trash novelist in town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trading Down","review":"I was disappointed in Bushnell's newest book. Even though I was anxious to buy it after loving Four Blondes and being a faithful Sex in the City fan. The continued back flash of stories and events made this story run on forever and the actual story was lost in the shuffle. If Buschnell had just told the story of Janey Wilcox from beginning to end I have no doubr it would have been a good read.The book seemed forced, like Bushnell was trying to cover every detail down to the brand of mascara and give you a reason she used it and the entire history behind it. There was nothing left to the imagination.I'm disappointed that I spent $$ on the hardcover version. If you haven't read it wait for paperback, borrow it from a friend, or choose a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicy Read","review":"Ok, so all the characters were horrible people and I found the book to encompass the worst inner character of humans, but it was good. I would get up from this book and have very negative feelings because the characters were so evil. However, I couldn't wait to get to the next page, and the next, etc..... I am now looking forward to reading her newest novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"ambitious","review":"This is about a model who has slept with men to get what she wants, and now marries for money, but finds the \\"respect\\" she now gets still doesn't satisfy. This novel appealed to me because it's about ruthless ambition in a female character. Though it sometimes got a bit too soap opera and melodramatic for my tastes, I found myself hooked by the exploits of the anti-heroine and Bushnell's devastating depiction of Upper East Side/Hamptons high society. Bushnell expertly head hops into the various points of view of an entertaining cast of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved Trading Up, it is a great ride!","review":"Candace Bushnell is an excellent novelist with a brilliant and biting comic voice. I just read Trading Up, and as I flip through the pages I see that I have underlined many pages. Her writing is so sharp and funny, and the story kidnapped me for three days. My husband is reading it now and he can't put it down either.I highly reccomend this book, it is the best book I have picked up all year. It would be perfect for summer book clubs.Often, when reading contemporary fiction, I feel like I am mentally chewing gum. Candace Bushnell's voice is so bright and original and refined, it feels like I am reading a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute waste of paper...","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Candace Bushnell and I was very disappointed. Instead of wasting the paper it was printed on, the story should have instead been made into a cheesy Lifetime movie starring Tori Spelling. The plot was slow, boring and predictable while the main characters were detestable. Don't waste your time reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book I've read, but I still wouldn't bother","review":"This is a pretty mediocre book. Its worst flaw is that every one of the characters is so downright despicable that you end up not caring a jot what happens to any of them. You find yourself hoping that Janey will get her come-uppance, but unfortunately when she does, it's short-lived. The writing is barely okay, certainly nothing outstanding, and the plot development is sluggish.On the positive side, Candace Bushnell obviously knows the Manhattan social scene well and at times you feel that the descriptions are depressingly accurate. I say depressing because it comes across as being such a shallow and superficial world that I am happy to be well removed from it. It's kind of fun to guess at the inspiration behind some of the characters - Gwyneth Paltrow, Rupert Everett, Anna Wintour, Aerin Lauder...I continued with this book hoping it would get better. It didn't. It's not the worst book that I've read, but I still wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book was really not that fun of a read. I was expecting a light-hearted book with a plot and characters I would enjoy reading about, but did not find any of this with Trading Up.The book is about Janey Wilcox, a Victoria's Secret model who uses anyone and everyone that comes into her life to make it to the top. From a socialite to several movie producers to her own sister, she uses them all to get what she wants.The only reason I made it all the way through is because I kept thinking, this has to get better. I was wrong. By the end of the book I really did not care what happened to Janey and therefore didn't care that the ending was as bad as it was.I'm disappointed and definitely would not recommend Trading Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"I had such high hopes for this book, but it was one of the worst I've read in years. The plot was boring, at best. I kept reading and reading, hoping it would magically get better at some point, but it never did. At least 200 pages of pointlessness should have been edited. I hoped it would all come together at the end, but it didn't! There was no moral, no resounding feeling of completion - nothing. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure theft","review":"I threw this book out once I realized it was a rehashing of \\"House of Mirth\\" by the classic authoress Edith Wharton. Right down to some of the names. Does the name Selden ring a bell to you? Ok, Ok, it's the guy's Last name in Wharton's book. Skip this book and read the original!http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451527569/qid=1118684771"},{"rating":"1","title":"Janey Is Shallow, Conceited, and Annoying!","review":"The main character in Ms. Bushnell's story \\"Trading Up\\" is one of the most annoying character's that I've read in a long time. I liked her somewhat in the story \\"4 Blondes\\" but she is shallow, and very selfish. I found this a difficult book to enjoy since the main character was such a snot and the nasty way she used people and treated people that were close to her, never mind how she treated and used people that were simply in her way also became rather tedious.I found that although the overall story about improving ones life through social connections could have been fun this one just really fell short of the mark. IF on the other hand you like shallow, self involved characters then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaves you feeling empty","review":"Yes I had a hard time putting this book down, but only because I wanted it to be over! If I weren't the type of person who has to finish what they started I would have stopped reading it. The \\"protagonist\\" is completely unlikable. As a matter of fact there are few truly likeable characters in the book, Janey's sister Patty and her husband Digger being the only two I can think of. It's about a bunch of narcissistic freaks. I like a summer trash novel where you want the protagonist to succeed or find happiness or love or something. In this book, and maybe this is the point after all, Janey is written to be the protagonist, but is also the primary antagonist as well. The end was also a little quick and neat and clean, leaving itself open to...yikes...a sequel...which I will definitely not read. A great disappointment after Four Blondes, which I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"This was a tough book to get through. Bushnell took her story way too seriously. She chose to spend pages and pages describing every single character and his/her past, yet at the end of the book, she merely forgets to tie up a few storylines. What ever happened to Patty and Digger? What about Mimi's baby--who was the father?Obviously the main character, Janey, was completely unlikeable. But I got the impression that Bushnell wanted us to be proud of her, to cheer her on. I also couldn't understand why the author had suddenly turned Seldon into a creep with 1 chapter to go. Very long, very disapointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I just finished reading Trading Up and was disappointed. I expected something similiar to the Sex in the City. (characters you could relate too and laugh with). I felt that Janey, the main character was cold and unlikable. Someone in the book called her a Black Widow Spider - and she was. I can't believe that I invested 500 plus pages on such an unlikable character who never changed.I kept expecting it to turn around....it didn't... Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"transparent as the character, Janey","review":"If you like to read six-hundred pages about Prada handbags, seducing men, more Prada handbags topped off with a cocktail, this book is for you.

Where was Bushnell's editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This book was boring. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. The main character, Janey, is very unlikable.

Name dropping, sideways glances, lies, snooty women, disgusting men... I made it through the first three chapters and decided my self-worth was much to great than to waste my time on reading even one more page of this book. Unless you like reading about the empty lives of shallow, insecure, unhappy upperclass, purge this book from your reading list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect a fun page-turner","review":"I am a huge Sex and the City fan and was hoping for a fun, interesting summer read. However, I found myself struggling a bit to finish this book (I actually stopped about halfway through and then finished it later). For the hundreds of pages, there's surprisingly no real plot. It's more of an often-boring look at the characters' lives, not to mention, I really didn't even grow to like any of the characters. I'd agree with others that Janey in particular is shallow, self-absorbed and really somewhat annoying.If you want to read a Candace Bushnell book, I would HIGHLY recommend reading Lipstick Jungle. I've been disappointed with a few of her books but Lipstick Jungle was actually a great one that I couldn't put down. Definitely don't waste your time on Trading Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and total letdown","review":"This novel fell short of what I expected.

Do not read............"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow book about shallow characters.","review":"SLOW, uninteresting writing about people that are impossible to care about. If this is really NYC Wanna Be High Society...they can have it, just don't make us read it. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean spirited and no fun at all","review":"I bought Trading Up hoping for an intelligent beach read, having preceded it with the amusing but ultimately middling The Devil Wears Prada. Instead, I was disappointed in both the quality of the writing and the tone of the book. I found her characters to be incredibly mean-spirited, and the whole story distasteful. I did not read Four Blondes, but I did read Sex and the City, and found her observations of life in New York to be well-drawn, if slightly depressing. I think this book had the potential to be much, much better. Usually authors improve with each succeeding book. In this case, I just sense that Candace Bushnell was really ticked off about something and took it out on her characters, none of whom I had any sympathy for whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bushnell Bombs","review":"The back cover describes this book as \\"hilarious\\". Did whoever wrote that review actually read this book? I think not.The Publishers Weekly review on this site says - \\"There is a black hole in the center of the book in the form of Janey Wilcox, a character so dull and humorless that she makes this whole elaborate enterprise one long, boring slog.\\"This review describes this book perfectly. I usually read books quickly, but this one was like digging my way out of quicksand. I wanted to give up, but I just knew I had to keep going. I think a few brain cells died during this ordeal.Bottom line: pass on this one, unless you like putting yourself through pure reading torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"The characters and writing were equally horrid. I'm not exactly sure which is worse. The main character in this book is as deep as a puddle. She is so unenjoyable and poorly written that you feel nothing for her. You can't like or loathe her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or money","review":"I just finished this book, and needless to say, I was EXTREMLY dissapointed. The story just dragged at some points. The ending was terrible. Lots of loose ends weren't tied up, it as if the author just got tired of writing. After all the hours I spent on this book I was left feeling ripped off. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Haven't ever read anything by Candance Bushnell so I have nothing of hers to compare this to, but I found this book to be AWFUL. The main character made me sick to my stomach by her shallowness and how FAKE she was. I find books enjoyable when I can relate to the characters in it, even if somewhat remotely. Everyone in this book was so DISGUSTINGLY shallow, I could not relate to it at all.The only reason I kept on reading was because I hoped Janey Wilcox would somehow redeem herself, but it didn't happen. Waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I'm actually glad that I downloaded this book to my Kindle...so I know to never buy anything from this author again. If there is a storyline, it's lost on me. I'm half way through the book and still have no idea what the point of the story is. Characters are vapid, pointless souls who have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I'm always game for a light read, but this one is just a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I loved watching Sex and the City and Lipstick Jungle so I purchased a few of Candace Bushnells books. I finished reading 4 Blondes (which I didnt love) and started Trading Up. I had to finish it even though I didnt want to. I always pass my books to friends. I offered it to a friend with hesitation. She said she was still trying to get through 4 blondes and I told her not to bother. This book was chucked into the garbage. Im not so sure I want to start Lipstick Jungle now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"Read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down. Excellent characterization, fast pace, tight plot and funny/pathetic scenes make this one of the best books I have read this year. Much better than \\"The Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold, who is considered a \\"serious\\" writer by the critics. I am not ashamed to say I enjoyed Trading Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was published???","review":"I bought this book having not previously read anything by Candace Bushnell, and I have to say, I was really disappointed! The characters all suffer from identity-confusion, not because the author is so \\"clever\\", but because it seems the author couldn't keep track of how she wanted the characters portrayed. The plot (if one can call it that) is thin, the dialogue is not believable, and the ending leaves you wondering why you wasted your money on this book. I did indeed finish the book, giving the author the benefit of the doubt that the story would develop, but sadly, it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"Like others, I enjoy chick lit but this book was horrible. I started skipping around after 30 pages or so and finally gave up after 100 pages. I didn't care enough about the characters to like or dislike them. I don't know how this book got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's raise the bar of women's fiction","review":"1 star to counteract the 2 obvious promotional online reviews at the very beginning, no doubt written by the book's publishing/editorial staff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brava!","review":"I have read SATC, \\"Four Blondes\\", and recently \\"Trading Up\\". I'm a guy, and I didn't catch on until the first two were well into paperback. I have not watched the HBO adaptation of SATC. I purchased \\"Trading Up\\" the day after I saw Candice interviewed. I have deeply enjoyed all of her books. If you liked the first two, this is similar in content: gripping, fun and not for the faint of heart. Bushnell has become a major force on American pop-culture and I hope to read more of her work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspite of the other reviews, I really enjoyed it","review":"Janey Wilcox is a self-absorbed, social climber and not a very likable person, but I could not put this book down. The other characters are completely twisted and not much better than Janey. But it is a fun, easy read and I didn't take it seriously. Candace Bushnell is a fantastic author and I absolutely love Sex in the City. As another reviewer stated, \\"Who doesn't?\\" I enjoyed this book and I will continue to enjoy her work. It's worth a read. It's a look into one woman's rise and fall in the limelight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and the city!","review":"TRADING UP tells the story of Janey Wilcox, an ambitious blonde who has finally made her mark on the fashion industry by becoming a Victoria's Secret model. Now that she's semi-famous, she thinks she can leave behind the world of sleeping with rich men to get ahead, but her reputation precedes her and she still doesn't get the respect she thinks she deserves. Not about to give up, Janey finds herself a high-class best friend and decides to marry a rich older man who just happens to be an executive at a movie company. But Janey still isn't satisfied...she'll do anything it takes, including stabbing her 'friends' in the back and lying to her husband, to get what she wants. I read this novel right after picking up THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, another wonderful if less obviously \\"commercial\\" product. Both books are recommended highly. Lively and fun casual reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A LET-DOWN ... UTTERLY BORING","review":"I was truly disappointed in Candace Buschnell this time around. Third time was not the charm. Her characters were absolute sketches, and I found it difficult to make it through each page. As a former New Yorker, who used to graze through these Hamptons parties...I couldn't believe that Ms. Buschnell was unable to breathe more life into these characters and situations.Save your cash...it's not even worth the gas money for a trip to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I kept on reading it because?! Not worth your time!","review":"This book was one of the worst I've read in a long time. It was too long, too detailed where it didn't need to be, and didn't have much of a plot. I ended up skipping ahead after getting halfway through because I was actually too tired to continue on! The main character never changes her evil ways, and is not punished for being a self-centered conniving whore (I'm using the author's word here). What seemed weird about the book was that the author wanted the reader to see her main character as a feminist. I saw her as a bimbo without any meaning in her life who relied on men to get her through it. This book is not worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this book have a plot???","review":"Or did I just miss it? Make no mistake - usually I actually find a guilty pleasure in reading trashy novels about society life in NYC - mostly because the books are dead on, in a satirical way. I suppose this book does touch upon shallow real life figures - but somehow this book manages to be even more dull and pathetic than the very people it aims to knock. Either I'm as dumb as Janey, or I just can't figure out what this book was about? Who cares about what happens to any of these people? Hmmm, does she like Bill or Seldon or Zizi or Comstock or George or Harold? Are we supposed to get it? Or care?? Is it really just nothing more than what she can get from them? Okay, fine. But wait - what is it that she getting from them? It's not even like I don't like the plot...I just can't find the plot. Here the author has an insider's view to write some type of satirical fiction....but we get about as much as what's in janey's head.....nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I am not going to my waste my time or yours by writing a long review here.

What a waste. Candace Bushnell should be ashamed of this wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long hard slog","review":"I really like Sex and the City, but Trading Up is just stupid. The characters aren't insightful and it's full of cliche, even the ending where everything comes together magically in 8 pages. Barf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appallingly written","review":"La Bushnell should be embarassed by this one. The worst thing is not the go-nowhere plot or the vapid characterisation - it's the writing. The book has the affected, overdone feeling of a high-school pupil throwing in every adjective she can think of to boost her word count and impress teacher. I found myself mentally editing this book while reading it. Not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING & HOPELSS ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone.. it is such a pathetic waste of time and I cannot believe that books like this get released.

Though I had never read one of her books, it sounded like a great 'light' read. First of all, one of my pet-peeves is ridiculous character names, and this story is chock full of them. Secondly, the characters are such a bore. And last but not least by far - I really couldn't care less what happens to any of them. This book has been a waste of my time, and I don't think there is any way I will finish it. There's always something better to do - ie: wash dishes, clean the litter box, scrub the toilet......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts are Interesting but lacking in plot","review":"This too long novel tells the tale of a model who dreams of the celebrity type fame that big screen actresses or pop stars endure. The model, Janey Wilcox, is not short of doing anything to get there including lying to best friends and sleeping with men for money. The novel really does not have much of a plot or twists. The only redeeming feature is to experience life from a socialite, celebrity, or extremely well-off persons point of view. I am sure the author has knowledge in this area being she wrote this after she was very famous herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Majorly Depressing","review":"This is novel is about a psychopath, Janey Wilcox. All she cares about are her looks, her clothes, her jewelry, her hair, her money...and that's about it. She's writing a screenplay, supposedly...but she has no idea how or what to write, and she's spent all the advance money she managed to finagle out of this guy who liked her looks. She manages to marry for money, but of course, wants no part of marriage. Janey loves to damage other people's relationships, and in the end, she (sort of) gets what is coming to her, but I couldn't feel sorry for her, or anything for her actually. I know Ms. Bushnell was trying to show that what goes around comes around, but I don't think we need a whole depressing book to learn this. I certainly don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe anyone found this mildly entertainly","review":"Janey Wilcox is a self-centered model/actress and as the title suggests always trying to trade one step up on the ladder of fame and fortune. I admire Ms. Bushnell for bucking the trend of heroines in need of character growth. Unfortunately the author never makes this character interesting enough for anyone to care. Nor does one care about any of the characters. They are flat, dull and inconsistent despite the settings and the fabulous clothes. Ms. Bushnell's writing style is repetitive. Her dialogue is lifeless. And one lengthy flashback actually has an embedded flashback leaving the reader wondering where the character really is on the time continuum.I can't believe I wasted the money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

In retrospect, I can't believe that she is considered an accomplished writer.First, her obsessive use of italics in every single line of dialogue is annoying and condescending. Apparently, she doesn't think her readers are intellegent enough to figure out for themselves which words should be emphasized in normal dialogue.And how about this: \\"Janey's eyes were shining but blank, as if the high beams were on but no one was driving.\\" WHO WRITES LIKE THAT???The end was soooo weak.

Unfortunately, there's not much to compare her to in the remainder of the cast. I wonder if Bushnell admires or craves being similar to these creatures and the world they inhabit?The characters' traditional values and morals are non-existant, replaced by an unslaked thirst for notoriety, adulation, and unearned money. Even though the sex is minimal, it still leaves you feeling like your mind needs a good shower.The closest this book got to saying something interesting was the brief flashback sequence to the beginning of Janey's becoming a whore, however, when the reason turns out to be her lust for over-priced luxury items, sympathy evaporates. The fact that she is allowed to triumph becuase of her selfishness and shallowness makes me feel about her as the French did Marie Antoinette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother with the paperback","review":"There exists a very fine line between the quick witted tongue in cheek insider humor and the sappy smaltz of Jackie Suzanne and unfortunately Ms Bushnell has descended into the Valley of the Dolls. Who knows, maybe it has something to do with all of the hairspray fumes,or maybe she has simply become one of the reviled 40 somethings, but she has clearly lost her edge. The novel starts well, with her characteristic ascerbic wit, but as she grows her charactersshe seems to take everything far too seriously. After the first 4 chapters, the quirky satire that has been the hallmark of Ms Bushnells work, tries to get deep, and spirals into a very badly concieved soap opera. Barbara Cartland watch out. Janey Wilcox will take you down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, vacuous characters and a waste of time.","review":"You keep hoping Janey will have some redeeming qualities or will have an epiphany around her self-centered life.. but she doesn't. The book is entirely frustrating, irritating and unsatisfying, although it does provide a probably fairly accurate glimpse into the inner workings of New York City \\"society\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Short of Dreadful","review":"This book is so bad, I am ashamed to say I finished it. In fact, it is one of the worst books I have ever read. Janey Wilcox is shallow, unlikeable and completely self centered. I work and live around people like that, so why would I consider it entertainment to read about them? Don't read this one; it's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How else can you say Pure Trash.","review":"This book is trash. Simply trash. The author is trash, the book is trash, and frankly, anyone reading this junk has got problems. This is the type of junk people read when they have nothing redeaming in their lives - there's nothing interesting, the characters aren't the least real, likable, or interesting. This is the type of book a fat girl will read at the gym, wishing her life were different. If your IQ is over 45, skip this and read a gum wrapper instead. It has more intellectual content"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just finished Trading Up the other night...I was not impressed. The book begins fairly well, mainly character introductions and so forth, about midway through the book your interest peaks and then FLOP! Bushnell rambles about J. Wilcox's past for far too long,you loose interest and the book fizzles at the end. The main character is one you can't relate to nor like. I would have stopped reading it when my interest was lost but had invested so much time into reading it I just want to finish this 504 page book. My first comment after was very disappointing. After having read 4 Blondes(which I likes a bit better)This book was a let down. I am not an avid reader of ficton, I prefer non-fiction, so I thought I may have been too critical in my review,however after reading a few of the other readers comments I see I am not. My advice choose wisely it is a long book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loathsome heroine","review":"While I enjoyed SEX AND THE CITY and FOUR BLONDES well enough, this book repulsed me because of its vile leading character. If this book was meant to be satirical, it does not succeed. Its heroine is self-absorbed and unlikable. We're told she's gorgeous, but nothing about her personality or her behavior is attractive, so we never root for her. The only characters I liked in the entire book were her sister, husband and best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast, Fun Read","review":"TRADING UP (Bushnell, Candace) is very similar to both STORY OF MY LIFE (McInerey, Jay) and MY FRACTURED LIFE (Travolta, Rikki Lee).

Horrible writing, no character development, virtually no plot. I have always hated Sex & the City so I don't know why I expected more for my $9 and change from Target.

Raunchy, filthy, not to mention pointless. It was equally as retarted as \\"Sex and the City\\"(The name tells all). Janey Wilcox is the junkiest, most irritating character in any book that I have ever read. I couldn't even finish it because I was so disgusted. To wrap it up(like a bean burrito) it stinks(like rotten cheese), and I reccomend never reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I had a hard time getting through the 500+ pages and kept thinking it would get better and it never did. there really was no plot, the writing was flat, and the characters unlikeable. it painted a very shallow and depressing picture of dating in the city. Don't bother spending a cent on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly disappointing","review":"Just couldn't find anything here to like. I kept waiting for Janey to get what was coming to her -- what a lame excuse for a human being -- but, in the end, she was unscathed. Unfortunately, this is probably the way it works for people like Janey in the \\"real world,\\" but that doesn't mean that I want a story that I read for entertainment to come out this way! The characters I was actually somewhat interested in (Patty, for example) were such an afterthought. They would pop in an out of the story so randomly that it almost gave me whiplash.I loved \\"Sex and the City\\" by Bushnell but this was just disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I usually love books like this, but this was so hard to get into and totally boring. To be honest, I didn't even read it all because it was so torturous that watching paint dry or grass grow seemed like a more preferable option. Sex and The City was a fantastic series (didn't miss 1 single episode) but she can't expect her fans to keep appreciating her work when it's rubbish like this. Sorry Candace. Please go back to good stuff like SITC."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring","review":"I've made it more than halfway through, I'm bored stiff and I refuse to give this book any more of my time.

Spare me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most awful book I ever (tried) to read!","review":"I commute to work everyday by train and usually get through a book a week. I figured this one might be a fun, light read. I am giving up at Chapter 5 because it is the most boring, unentertaining book I have ever picked up! I tried skimming paragraphs to help turn the pages and get to the end of a chapter. NOTHING HAPPENS in this book! The characters are pathetic and there is no plot or even a sliver of humor, suspense, etc. What a waste of time even reading the first 50 pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Just not what I expected after being a loyal viewer of Sex and the City. Maybe a large part of the credit for SATC goes to the *other* writers, the script writers?Like other readers, I struggled to make it through to the end, mainly to see if it would get better and deliver in the end. But sadly, it did not! Luckily, I got this from the $4.98 clearance shelf at Borders. Same with Lipstick Jungle. I don't have high hopes for it, but it's being made into a sitcom now with Brooke Shields so I'm giving it a shot. Stay tuned.But Trading Up, blegh. And I really wanted to like it! It's not as though you expect these charecters to develop a conscience or learn any moral lessons. Their shallowness are part of the entertainment, it's just that it wasn't even very entertaining, at all!! Infuriating when it wasn't depressing or simply boring. Save yourself some time and give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bushnell can do better","review":"Trading up is about a woman named Janey Wilcox , she does everything in her power to become rich and famous. Even things that include hurting the people she loves. I think this is one of Candace Bushnell's worst books. First of all the book is too long for this kind of story. Some chapters are too long and I got easily bored.I see Janey as a modern time hooker. I got disgusted by the things she did. But still, somehow I can understand why she did it. Fame is everything to her, the thing she's wanted sense she was a teen. She does all these things she hates just to get those 15 minutes of fame, which she plans will last for eternity./Jelena Batista"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried but can't even get to chapter five","review":"I am an avid reader and enjoy any genre as long as the characters are engaging and the storyline in captivating.

It is not giving anything away to say that this character does not grow or change as a result of the events of the book, and is the most self absorbed human being on the planet. (Most of the other characters are equally repugnant.) I, too, am disappointed that I spend the money on the hardback edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could get the hours I wasted back...","review":"but sadly they are lost in the depths of this horrible book.

Now, some 15 years later, I stumbled upon this book and, out of morbid curiosity, read it. I was impressed with the thoroughness of the research and informal writing style adopted to tell this story. My only complaint is that the information is dated. Since its printing in 1990, more information has been collected as a result of the continued investigation. Lybia and Qaddafi were the ultimate bad guys here. There was also the successful law suit presented by the survivors of the victims of the disaster.

He loses his job and is befriended by a laundress and an actual rebel who is later killed. The youth determines to return his friend's body to his Kurdish province birthplace.

Others can easily be added by purchasing bolts and washers of appropriate size from your hardware store. Professional pullers often have a coupler slot for the threaded pullers. You must remove a nut cap to install the bolt. Not terribly convenient.Conclusions: For occasional use, it is great and I'm glad I bought it.

The crab metaphor is a nice one, with the people surviving, like the crabs they chase, by turning the waste of their environment into sustenance - plenty of characters abound, including a paralytic leader who observes the world through a mirror from his room, a leper who only goes out at night scavenging his only friend the river, and an old lady who obsessively feeds her pig day and night in hopes of selling it to pay for her grandson's confirmation jacket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"It was my great, great privilege and pleasure to be a student of Frank Hulme in the 1970's.

They would look odd if they were much bigger, so how I can I second guess the designer? There is one hole for the salt so you won't get too much like with a lot of multi-hole salt shakers but there are 5 holes in the pepper base, so be careful. You'll only need a shake or two unless you really like a lot of pepper. It's certainly not a problem however, you'll get the touch down after the first use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but functionality isn't great","review":"It's pretty, but annoying. The salt shaker has one little hole in it. Life is too short to be annoyed by a salt shaker. Buy it for looks, not usefulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not practical, but cute","review":"I do like this set and bought it even though the practicality issues were obvious. First of all, filling the set is a little tricky because the base shaker has several holes on the curved surface that becomes the bottom when filling, causing me to lose a lot more salt than other shakers do ( it is harder to plug than most of my other shakers). The filling plugs are rubber and are tight enough to make it a slight struggle when you also have to keep a finger over the holes. The main problem is the top shaker is a sphere with a flat base and we keep losing pepper by putting it on the base crooked or by it rolling when we move it to the table. These are not big issues and I would buy it again, but in my collection of shakers this would fall into the style over practicality section, but, then again, what's wrong with that now and then?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, good story","review":"This book is very frustrating to read. The writing is horrible - the dialog is so unrealistic it's amusing, the descriptions are clinical and full of \\"I'll use obscure words to make you think I'm smart\\" language, and the characters are flat and annoying. So why read it? It's a really good story, especially if you're interested in the topic of psychotropic medication. Cook's negative opinion of the drugs comes through loud and clear, but it doesn't spoil the premise. The addition of the link to the Salem Witch Trials adds an extra layer of interest. (Although if he referred to it as \\"the affair\\" or \\"the ordeal\\" one more time, I was going to send him a thesaurus.) It's worth reading just for the story if you can put up with the bad writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"The last third of the book will have you forsaking food, drink and carnal pleasures because you won't be able to put the book down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Witch Project","review":"RE: AUDIO CASSETTE VERSION.

I don't think he made it out of first gear until about 3/4 the way through the book. With difficulty he finally shifted into second gear and by the end of the book was cruising at a not-so-exhilarating 30 miles an hour. The medical and scientific details are accurate and fairly well-written. The major subplots are \\"what's for dinner tonight,\\" and \\"what will the plumber work on next.\\" The dialogue is artificial and irritating. It reminds me of a dialogue from one of my third-grader's stories. Using words like \\"modicum\\" and \\"greasy spoon\\" I wonder if Mr. Cook could possibly have been born in the same century as the rest of us.

Still it was a lot of fun and a novel idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking, frightening look at medical ego","review":"After having read most of Robin Cook's novels, I thought I was prepared for anything. That assesment was incorrect. A mild mannered, shy doctor (Dr. Edward Armstrong) is literally transformed by ego and greed into an unfathomable character. He brings along a group of fellow practioners, as well as his romantic partner on his horrific journey. Meanwhile, Kimberly Stewart, our heroine, is seeking answers to accusations about an ancestor of hers believed to have been a witch. Their paths run concurrent as both learn secrets of personality altering drugs, their sources and potential uses. Mounting suspense may not prepare you for the final 40 pages. Be prepared! A great ride for my imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i could unread it","review":"I'll be patient with almost anything with a germ of a good idea, and i thought lab analysis of hallucinogenic mold as an explanation for the witch trials was compelling...together with the pharmaceutical industry, new drug development plot deal...but this book is refried reefer madness (remember? smoke pot and you'll murder the neighbors)...utterly ridiculous, offensive, icky..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, Unrealistic characters","review":"I chose this book because I have long been interested in the Salem Witch Trials. I really enjoyed the parts of the story which dealt with Kim's search for the truth of her ancestor' role in the tragedy. I'll admit that I mostly skimmed the parts which dealt with Kim & Edward's relationship---as characters, they are totally unbelievable and not very likeable. The part I found most surprising was Kim's attitude towards medications, especially considering that she is a nurse. The drug research storyline was so, eh, I don't even have a word for it. Not worth reading.The interactions between the characters in the book are stilted and painful. I think we are supposed to feel sympathy for Kim's social awkwardness & anxiety, but really you just want to shake her and tell her to grow a backbone already. As much as I love reading, I can not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was an enthralling book, I couldn't put it down.","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read.

Don't waste your time.","review":"This is one of Cook's weakest attempts at novel. \\"Acceptable risk\\" is actually a short story, that could have been perfectly told in 100 pages, enlarged with no real purpose (except maybe an editorial one) to almost 400. In the boring middle, one can forsee easily the very predictable end, which becomes even worse when the behaviour of the \\"evil\\" characters turns illogical, unnatural and laughable. Look for another work by Cook. This one is absolutely dissapointing and forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book Acceptable Risk by Robin Cook is a classic.","review":"The book Accetable Risk by Robin Cook goes right along with many of his other books, amazing. His medical knowlage and great suspense writing combine to make the thriller of the century. He explores the contraversy of testing drugs on humans with out approval and the long term effests of it. This is a true Robin Cook page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing read start to finish","review":"In the beginnig of the book we meet Elizabeth and have no idea what's going to happen to her. They talked about the evidence there. And every time Kim got close to the evidence and had to go someplace else you felt for her. A truly engaging character. Edward got what he deserved. Robin Cook writes amazing, intelligent books. And has a new one coming out, can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook does disservice to real-life chemists","review":"In his novel, Cook does a disservice to real-life chemists by trivializing and misrepresenting the drug discovery process. Drugs take years to be discovered, tested, and marketed, and are under the utmost federal scrutiny. As a doctor, Cook should take some responsibility to educate his readers with reality as well as to entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was he thinking?","review":"This book is crap. The idea that he was trying to go after is good, but the way that he executed the novel was almost retarded. It is definately unbelievable and should never have been printed. This was the worst book that I have read by him and the only reason that I finished the novel was to see what other ridiculous things Cook concocted. Two words for this book: table leveler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which witch is which?","review":"Unfortunately, I had seen the made-for-TV movie loosely based on this novel before reading it (though I did not realize that until I actually got into the book) so I sort of knew how it was going to end, but I was not completely disappointed.While somewhat predictable (what, did you think the bad guys were going to get away with it?), Cook still manages to find a new villain and ties the present with the past in a believable fashion. A doctor, he knows what he's talking about but explains it understandably so those with no medical knowledge can follow along.Realistic but exciting, definitely a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with mistakes...","review":"This was one of the worst Robin Cook books that I had the displeasure of reading.Elizabeth Mills was supposedly hanged as a witch in the 1600s. Flash to modern times and we read how Kim Stewart and Edward Armstrong discover the coffin:Edward shined the light into the open end of the coffin. \\"We're in luck,\\" he said. \\"The corpse has been mummified by the cold and the dryness. Even the winding sheet is intact.\\"\\"I think we've done enough.\\" Elizabeth said. But she might as well have been talking to the wind. Edward wasn't listening. To her horror she watched while he put the light down and reached into the coffin. \\"Edward! What are you doing?\\"The book is filled with several instances where the author confuses his characters, and has Elizabeth (who is dead) speaking when he obviously meant for Kim to be speaking...These mistakes take away from the enjoyment of the book, as one begins to become very conscious of all of the author's errors..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was not worth the time. The storyline was great and inventive, yet Cook used too many medical and chemical terminology that only few could understand.

O'Donnell completely rewrites history with a seemingly drug-induced plethora of fiction as he seeks to deny every historical fact known to man about St. Augustine. Indeed, if he was to write a history of Germany he is the very type of author who would use 400 pages to show why you should believe the Holocaust never happened too.A thinly veiled attempt by an ignorant Georgetown \\"academician\\" to defame the name of St. Augustine and to defame the hsitory of the Catholic Church. O'Donnell denies all persesecution of Christians, denies the Papacy, denies Augustine' spirituality and suggests that the Catholic Church violently overthrew the only true and legitimate heir to Jesus' teachings.Revistionist hsitory at its worst ... I suggest we turn this heretic O'Donnell over to the Grand Inquisitor for burning at the stake ... may he ever rot in hell for his absurdly stupid and ignorant comments!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different view","review":"Don't read this book if you don't know anything about Augustine. It's not a chronologically arranged biography, but spends most of its time reviewing Augustine's life as a bishop. As one reviewer said, you wonder if O'Donnell really likes Augustine -- he certainly doesn't present a glorified picture, but blames Augustine's influence on some of the wrongs which followed him. Overall, O'Donnell covers all the important events in Augustine's life, and presents them in a new and intriguing light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the general reader","review":"If you already have a good knowledge of the late era Roman Empire in North Africa and are already familiar with the religious conflicts and various Christian schools of thought going around you might find this rambling biography informative. Just one example, the author mentions religious groups like the Donatists or Donatism numerous places without clearly indicating their beliefs or why exactly Augustine hated Donatus. In my opinion, not nearly enough definition and clarity for the layman to understand what was going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized book","review":"Unless you completely understand Augustine and his life and actual background, you will get totally lost in trying to comprehend what the author is saying. The author attempt with this biography is to write about his background and his personal characteristics by chapter, but at times he gets too lost on a different subject matter unrelated to the chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juice from CHINA","review":"I was saddened to see on the back of my Mott's juice bottle that this product comes from concentrate from Argentina, China and the USA.

I am especially concerned because apple juice is frequently given to children and toddlers. The company didn't even put this on the label but imprinted on the container which is not obvious. It is clear that the company didn't want to advertise this. However, on the company website, they proudly proclaim that apples are from the U.S. I believe this is misleading and disingenuous.

I installed the Motorola Signal Booster after my cable had gone through two signal splitters. It didn't help the problem with my picture.Eventually, I solved my problem by bypassing one of the splitters and removing a signal trap that the cable company had placed on my line when my home was built.

With all of the signal decay, it can take a few minutes for the TV to catch up.

The only configuration that showed very little improvement was when I connected the Motorola booster in one of the outputs of my AR 2.5GHz 2-way video splitter.

I bought it based on the reviews I've read.Here is some advice: if you are using ANY kind of splitter, try bypassing it to see if your splitter is bad. I got 100% of all my stations in Atlanta simply by bypassing my 1 in 6 out Leviton Integrated Network splitter. If I connected it straight to the receiver, I got 100% on my channel meters. When I hooked the booster in, I got max 65%. I tried it in front of the splitter, after the splitter and even without a splitter (reduced signal by half) and is just did not work at all for me.

Also, the analog cable TV reception was hugely improved.I originally installed it in my office where the cable modem and office TV feeds are and got the terrific results above. I decide to try it on the source feed to the house, which splits outside to send a separate feed to our HDTV. This produced the same results for the office modem and TV and greatly improved the AGC numbers for the Comcast HDTV cable box, but VOD ceased working (communcation errror). So, I moved it back to the office feed. The HDTV box reception was OK w/o the amplifier anyway despite poor AGC numbers.Would give 5 stars if it were not for the VOD problem.

The results are OK. This amp is installed directly on the outlet of the DVR. The split occurs in the network junction box about 15' away. From there, the signal travels into an A/B switch, allowing me to display the DVR output or the regular cable output to the other TV's. The output of the A/B switch feeds into a powered 4-way amp feeding the the various TV's. The picture on the shortest run (about 45' total) is the best quality, worst on the longest run (about 200'). Results are very encouraging, enough for me to continue experimenting with feeding 8 TV's in either DVR output mode or main cable mode. I can live with a less than perfect picture for these areas and it beats paying the cable company ungodly rental fees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performance","review":"I did a lot of research before buying this product and am very satisfied with it's performance.

After connecting the amp to the incoming line on the side of the house, my broadband is working great. I also use Vonage which is compatible with this device.

I wasn't entirely happy with the cable signal on my big screen and I thought this would definitely help. I followed all the instructions to a tee. I hooked it up where the cable comes into the house before it splits. After I hooked it up I noticed a marginal improvement, but it still didn't fix the major issues I was having with my signal. That evening I noticed my cable Internet was much slower(!). I didn't think much of it, but the next day when I turned on my television the cable signal for television and Internet was absolutely horrible. Something must have been wrong with the unit, because as soon as I took the booster out of the loop I had the same mediocre signal I had before. I have no doubt this unit can help some, but my issues weren't corrected, and due to a faulty unit they were actually made worse.First item I've had to return to Amazon in 9 years.

I had the cable company techs come out three times to diagnose the problem and they finally decided this was happening due to signal loss through the many splitters that previous techs had installed (instead of wiring the house properly in the first place). So the last tech that was out managed to reconfigure things in such a way that he could eliminate two splitters from the line and the cable began acting fine...for one computer.

But the Motorola tech support guy said yesterday this was designed to boost the signal for a long cable run, not to improve reception for over-the-air TV. He was surprised it's being marketed this way. He said my problem is not a *weak* signal from the antenna but a *bad* signal. The Terk HDTVa works great, however. Apparently Terk's in-line signal amplifier (little black box that goes along the antenna signal cable) does more than just boost--maybe it cleans the signal too? Another possibility is that the Motorola booster is just boosting too much, which distorts the signal, like an overly-loud radio, and the gentler Terk booster is all I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the job quickly and easily.","review":"I split a Comcast signal, one end going to a TiVO, the other to a Comcast digital box, so I could get On Demand. After I did, the signal on the TiVO dropped on some channels to 60%, and several channels would not come in at all on the digital box. Not Good. Ordered one of these thingies - it arrived in two days. Hooked it up to where the cable comes into the unit...took less than five minutes. Ran a cable from it to a three-way splitter, with one of those going into the two-way splitter at the TiVO and...voila! Signal back up to between 95-100% on all channels. Every system and set of circumstances are different, so that doesn't mean that it would necessarily work that well for everyone, but certainly worth a try and the $ spent to avoid a call for a truck roll from Comcast, who would take hours to figure it all out and then probably not get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great for me","review":"Ordered this item a couple days before the Memorial Day holiday and received it on Tuesday, the day after Memorial Day.

Their ultimate conclusion was that the signal was being OVER-amplified at that first TV. I don't know much about cable signals, so I don't know if this is true, but now I have a very expensive signal booster that I can't hook up anywhere.

It felt like the wheels were stiff or something, and it was tiring to go for a walk with it. Then three days after we bought it it got a major tear in the fabric behind my baby's back! We had to drive an hour to take it back to the store where we bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We bought this stroller because it seemed like a good, middle of the road, umbrella stroller. It wasn't the freebie one, but it also wasn't over $100. I should not have wasted my money. First of all, this stroller is NOT for tall parents. You will constantly be kicking the wheels and hunching over to push the stroller. I am 5'9\\" and my husband is 6'2\\". I can barely stand to push it, and my husband would rather carry our daughter for miles than push this thing. Secondly, the material is flimsy. After only a few months of sparse usage, it started to tear right by by daughter's shoulders. A month or so later the holes were so big that I didn't feel safe putting her in it anymore. I sucked it up and bought a Britax Blink for $69 on another website. It is amazing how much better that one is! They don't even compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not enough","review":"Psycobiograghies are new in genre, but they may be enlightening, provided the subject that is being studied is analysed deeply.So, to write a similar kind of work regarding so complex a man as was Richard Nixon requires a good amount of knowledge about his life, his personal and political choices and particularly the latter for the very reason that are the most delicate : how can this be accomplished with a book a mere 149 pages ? Inevitably the informations here given verge on the general and the analysis done seems to be a little bit amateurish. Although the book is good to read, it certainly does not say the last word on Nixon'personality - not in the least !In the end, I appreciate the choice of having chosen former president Nixon as a subject, but that would have required a very bigger work, at least three times as big as the size of the present book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it","review":"I wait for a month and i never got it.

However, after consulting with a doctor and being told to apply it 6-8 times a day it has made a dramatic difference in my daughter's skin.

Quicker and easier than internet purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product & very economical","review":"Until about 15 years ago when a dermatologist advised me to use Vanicream, my face was so dry in the winter, that no matter how well I moisturized at night, I'd wake up with itchy red patches all over my face. After using Vanicream for about 3 weeks, my face was completely clear and the itching was gone...forever! Per my dermatologist, I apply to my face prior to applying my makeup base, it makes my makeup go on smoothly and evenly. After washing my face before going to bed, I use Vanicream again, on my face and neck, using extra around my eyes & even rub some into my eyelashes, to keep them conditioned. I am 60 years old and am constantly told I look at least 10 years younger (I have almost no wrinkles). I thank Vanicream for this, as all the other women in my family have wrinkled badly and pretty early. Also, compare the price of this with other moisturizers, Vanicream is a real bargain. Without a doubt, this is the best \\"cosmetic\\" product I have ever used!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Lifesaver","review":"I thought I had previously reviewed the products thanking the maker for saving my life.

Thank heavens a good dermatologist, thank you Sarah, suggested Vani products to me and my whole life has changed. I can actually put on some eye makeup now! And if you are old like me, you want to add a little frill every once in a while. The cream is a bit heavy for my kids (twenty somethings) but if you massage it in a bit, it is gone and you don't feel it. These pots will last and last and the price is amazing.

One of the stories, \\"Lowell's Class,\\" is well worth reading, but the others, while they show promise on the part of the authors, are pretty uninspiring. One wonders whether these writers are tailoring their prose to please strict workshop teacher, or whether workshops simply encourage denatured, Raymond Carver-esque prose. There's a definite bias toward the misery of the young in these selections, and a couple of them are simply poor (\\"Amreeki\\" is incomprehensible, and \\"Judas Kiss\\" just plain awful.) I hope these writers discover their natural voices--I don't see much of that here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for a tween","review":"This book is great--informative yet written in a way to interest a 9-10 year old.

So we got him this book as reference material that he could use on his own. When we gave it to him on a Sunday afternoon, his face lit up. \\"Thanks!\\" And he disappeared into it for the next several hours. We couldn't have hoped for a better response.

I was very pleased with the way it explained things. I read the book to him and answered any questions that he had as we went along. He did not have very many, because it was explained very well. However, there is a part in the book I did not read to him, which is the reason why I did not let him read the book by himself. The part touches on sex, which I don't have a problem with except for the fact that it explained oral and anal sex, and I don't feel like a 10 year old should know about things like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information about a confusing time:","review":"I bought this book for my son. I have read the entire thing cover to cover and have decided that he is only ready for some of the material at this point. He will be allowed to read the whole thing in a year or two. This book gives great info on health and hygiene as well as changes in the body during puberty. There are comments about becoming sexually active that I am not comfortable with at this point but I think that may just be because I don't think my son is old enough for the details.I do recommend this book but encourage parents to read it and decide for themselves if their son(s) should read the whole thing or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Guide With Good Messages","review":"I bought this for a gift for a boy about to turn 13. I looked it over before actually giving it and was impressed. It was a good mix of information presented -- not just the biology of what is happening but also emotional and social changes. There were even sections about dealing with bullies and how your friendships may change as you grow. The wording was matter of fact, but casual enough to appeal to a tween. I liked the message that waiting to have sex was the best choice, and the book substantiated this message with the reasons why. I think when the time comes for my own children to start reading up on these topics I'd like to supplement this with something that goes into more detail about the biology -- but this is a great overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touchy subject dealt with well","review":"I am a mom of an 11 year old and after he came home telling me some of the stuff he \\"heard\\" at school, we had the talk.

It covers ALOT of stuff and I woudl definitely have parents read it FIRST before they just hand it over to their son because it talks about lots of subjects so you dont want to be unaware. It is very helpful though to let your son read it at his own pace and if HE becomes uncomfortabel HE can stop but then he also knows if he's confused he can coem to you and you cna discuss it very matter of factly because the book does an excellent job of covering things in a way they will understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I previewed this book before giving it to my son, and I'm glad I did.

The crisp clear voice we know and love was noticeably weaker, couldn't hold the notes for nearly as long and just wasn't the recording (or CD) I was hoping for. The thought behind this CD was good, but I'd recommend a different album if you want to hear Andy Williams as you remember him, not old, fading Andy."},{"rating":"1","title":"on the cheapish side of the street","review":"thin, too much cloth for my liking and way too little adhesive capability. i think it is ineffective for what one wants duct tape to do,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution","review":"Very interesting book. If you've read From Hell, and you want to know a bit more about where Moore got his ideas, this is the book to read. There are a few leaps, I think, as far as Knight's conclusions, but for the most part, he does a very good job of investigation. It's the only non-fiction book I've read on the Ripper murders, and I can't say I know anything of developments since From Hell was written, but it has peaked my interest and I plan on continuing to learn about the subject. The most amazing part of this book is the final chapter, which, while it answered the biggest question on my mind while reading the book, I still didn't really see it coming. It's a major detail that Moore left out of From Hell, though I'm not sure why. A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"connecting the dots","review":"I was impressed by Knight's making connections that I hadn't seen in other books on the Ripper. Fascinating how he makes a case for the victims being known to one another, insights into royal misbehavior, the societal forces brought to bear on the case, and the implication of the Freemasons. He makes a convincing case for a cover-up and for the involvement of high-level government officials as well as the artist Sickert whose paintings show an obsession and overfamiliarity with the Ripper's work. Good read whether you agree with all its conclusions or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor","review":"It's a theory that's certainly fun to think about, with royals and mad doctors and famous artists cluttering the landscape, and the fascinating question \\"What did Victoria know and when did she know it?\\" But Knight's book, while it does contain some genuine good research, has been thoroughly debunked by a number of genuine scholars. There's more creativity than logic in there, based in part on wishful thinking and in part on willful and selective disregard of the facts. I'm not being a wet blanket, here--it's a fun fantasy but it is NOT the solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything But \\"Final\\"","review":"This book is quite readable, but its theories have long since been de-bunked. If nothing else, those with power in Victorian Britain were powerful enough to kill or hide anyone -- let alone a handful of unknown prostitutes. Why would they resort to the disruptive and sensational methods used in the Whitechapel killings? It all sounds so deliciously sensational and scandalous that one can almost want it to be true, but applying a little common sense makes the whole thing sound as ludicrous as it really is. While it is entirely possible that some kind of conspiracy took place to protect Jack the Ripper's real identity, this book's specualtions just do not hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a good reason it's \\"too weird to be true\\"...","review":"It isn't. Knight's \\"theory\\" is a complete mishmash, and his alleged \\"research\\" evidently didn't extend to the royal calendar (which shows that the Duke of Clarence was nowhere near London when the murders were committed - for instance, during the double event killing, he was hunting grouse in Scotland along with several dozen other people!), Masonic records (there *are* no \\"Jewes\\" in Freemasonry), or workhouse records (see Donald Rumbelow's \\"Complete Jack the Ripper\\" for the true history of the Crooks family).A tasteless, witless hoax that has produced a ridiculous Sherlock Holmes movie and has forever tarred the posthumous reputations of Sir William Gull, the Duke of Clarence, Walter Sickert, John Netley (who may not have even existed!), Queen Victoria, Annie Crooks, and what seems like about half the population of London. Its sole value is as something to laugh at (and drop) in the bathtub."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book immensly. I'm pretty sure that we will never know the truth but reading about peoples theories is fun! This theory is based on Jack the Ripper being 3 people involved in Freemasonry. The author has done a very good research job with lots of interesting points to think about. He talks about certain Jack the Ripper candidates like M J Druitt, James Maybrick, and discusses why they were not the Ripper, but like I said, we will never know the real truth! A very enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother - Waste of your time and money!","review":"This is not only a silly theory, but it is downright boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"It fills a space on my bookshelf.","review":"I own Knight's book for the simple reason that I like to read anything that is published on the Whitechapel Murders. I have a bookcase for all my Ripper books and Knight is there. Besides filling the space between J and L, it is a gripping read. However, it is totally fictional. Knight writes in a way that sounds like meticulous research, but it isn't. His theories have been proven completely false, but the damage is done. The conspiracy theory involving people in the highest levels of power and esoteric Masonic rituals is something that has taken hold in the general public. When I tell someone that I read information on the Jack the Ripper murders, I can count on the reply, \\"Wasn't that something to do with the Royal Family?\\". Knight is well-known for his anti-Masonic writings, and that, for me, discounts everything he writes about Freemasonry as well. Those who want to know about the ripper murders are advised to start elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely False Information","review":"Stephen Knight's research was not thorough. For sample, read Donald Rumbelow's \\"Complete Jack the Ripper\\" and you will see he has documented proof that much of what Stephen Knight alleges could not have happened, even down to proving that buildings Stephen Knight refers to as addresses for his \\"key\\" players didn't even exist at the time he said they did. Additionally, Sickert (Knight's informant) has recanted everything he told him as a \\"lie\\" since Knight wrote this book. With the fact that Rumbelow PROVES that Knight's theories can't be true and that Knight's informant recanted should be enough to incline the reader to move on to other titles when interested in Jack the Ripper. This one is an interesting read, and he has interesting theories, but they are completely untrue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor work based upon religious bigotry","review":"It's a shame that Knight let his bigotry against the Masons influence his thinking so much. It's even more of a shame that he then tried to blame the Jack the Ripper killings on a conspiracy of Masons. Worst of all, some people actually take the book seriously.Any other reference on the subject (try books by Sugden or Evans, or the Jack the Ripper casebook at www.casebook.org) will point out the numerous factual errors in this book. For one, \\"Juwes\\" was never a term in Masonry and the grafitti that contained the term not only obviously referred to Jews (who lived in the building) but also may not have had anything to do with the murder. For two, Knight's supposed Ripper was an old man who could barely walk, not someone with the strength necessary to do the murders. And for errors number three through three hundred, just see any other ripperology reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about no stars","review":"Be careful with this product.

A must have at deer camp if your a hunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUNNY FUNNY MOVIE!!!!!","review":"at first, i was sekptical of ESCANABA IN DA MOONLIGHT, but after i saw it for the first time, i immedietly fell in love with it. that day, i went out and bought the DVD. If you like the movie \\"Monty Python & The Holy Grail\\" or \\"Saving Silverman\\", you'll deffinitly love ESCANABA IN DA MOONLIGHT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Unusual Movie","review":"I saw this movie during the spring of last year, during its theatrical run. This show had its hilarious moments, but was one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. The characters are believable, but I live among a lot of deerhunters and the deer season is a like a religious experience for many of them. People really do talk like that in the UP and you will either love the movie or hate it. I heard people leaving the theater saying \\"That was the most disgusting movie I have seen\\", as well as \\"That was pretty good.\\" The characters were amazing in their portrayal of deerhunters. It is not for the squeamish of stomach, but portrays a culture that does exist. This movie is targeted to a limited group of people, so it is surprising they actually are releasing it on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit weird, but good!","review":"This movie is very funny, but it also has a serious side. It's not for everyone, some people don't appreciate the humor in it. I, however, laughed so hard that I cried!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, bizarre comedy","review":"Probaby a 4.5 star movie. While it is not \\"the best movie ever\\", it is true entertainment. As a Michiagn resident in the lower peninsula (city folk), I have always been suspicious yet enamoured by the U.P. folk (a.k.a. \\"Da Yoopers\\"). If you have never been to Michigan, I can recommend the upper peninsula as a place to visit.This is an excellent cast of stange and funny characters. As a female, I am not typically fond of \\"toilet humor\\" however, I must point out that this movie contains THE FUNNIEST FART JOKE ON FILM TO DATE. That one scene alone makes the film worthwhile.Overall, the movie is a good story - something that might be told on a cool night in front of a campfire - with all the embellishments.Watch the movie, don't think too much, enjoy, and \\"swing low, sweet chariot...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"In a work, \\"YUK\\"","review":"I am from Michigan and also a \\"troll\\" being that I'm from the lower Penninsula. (Under the bridge) I couldn't make it through the first hour watching this mess. I like Jeff Danials and have met him, but this movie is not worth watching or buying. I rented it first, and glad to be able to send it back to \\"Netflix\\" It was not at all as expected knowing \\"Yooper\\" humor.I thought it would be like the \\"Airplane\\" type movies, but I was wrong. Oh well, maybe I'm wrong about Yoopers humor. Anyway, I gave it 1 star and no more. Save your money, eh? Ya Bet'cha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so much?","review":"I love this movie! I thought it was great! The only problem is the price. Almost [$$$] for a VHS and less than [$$$]for a DVD? What is going on here? I understand that independent films are not so easy to fund but why is there such a huge difference between DVD and VHS? I hope everyone who really wants to own this realizes that they can take the money they save buying a DVD rather than a VHS, spend a couple more bucks, and buy a DVD player. They aren't that expensive anymore and the quality is better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I'm from the Escanaba area which is the only reason I bought this DVD. Even that wasn't enough of a reason to like this movie. It is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escanaba in da Moonlight","review":"As a lifetime resident of Michigan I had high hopes for this movie. I did enjoy the first half, but then the movie got too deep into mystical imagery. The acting was good, but the story went from earthy backwoods humor to mystical fantasy toward the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Liked This Movie, You're Freaking Nuts","review":"I love Jeff Daniels, but this was the most God-awful movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. We rented this movie one night thinking it was about hunting and maybe a little funny. We were dead wrong. This was the stupidest and most un-funny movie ever made, and...I'm sorry, I just can't do it justice. Sometimes when you watch a stupid movie, you can think about it later and laugh. Not with this one. I think about it and shudder. I'm a southern boy who likes the woods and likes to hunt and fish, so don't tell me I just didn't get it. There was nothing to get. What REALLY made me want to puke was when I got on here and read the reviews. PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKED IT!!!! I'm sorry but the world is coming to a close folks, if anybody on God's green earth enjoyed that movie. Now I feel better since I got all that out of me. It's been building up and eating away at me for three weeks now. Ya'll have a nice day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Escanaba in da moonlight","review":"Started out good but then got weird and hard to understand. You definitly have to speak northern to understand what these guys are saying the acciencts are hardcore. I got this thinking it was going to be a funny movie but to us it wasnt so funny as much as confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny movie","review":"If you are a hunter or fisherman and have a group that you regularly hunt with or fish you will definately enjoy the humor in this movie. Great acting by Daniels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escanaba in da Moonlight","review":"I've been to the UP before and it was great. I've also been to deer camp in Oregon and it's just as crazy there. Its great that someone finally made a flick about it. But there are alot of great stories that will never be told. This flick only scratches the surface of the humor in deer camp, where, Men can let loose for a short time and only dream about next year. I would rate it with 10+ stars if I could. It is a side splitting comedy from the start to the end. If you don't get it find someone to go to deer camp with. You'll never be the same afterwards. And for the woman from KS all I have to say to you is get a life and enjoy it. Maybe you should go to deer camp oh on second thought DON't you'll ruin it for all the men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah hey pretty juvenile.","review":"But I wasn't expecting epic film-making. It is a laugh out loud little movie. If your from the UP, & you're offended, sorry. It is funny. It is a bit of an insider though. People from LA or New York probably won't get it. The further you get from the UP the less relevant it becomes. If you live in Minnesota, Wisconsin or Michigan you know someone like the Soadys."},{"rating":"2","title":"I watch it every Nov. 15","review":"I used to think this movie made fun of people in the u.p., that is until I moved up here. Its an accurate portrayal of \\"yoopers\\",I think the bar dance could have been any of the bars in Munising. Anyhow, very funny movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Turdy Point Buck","review":"Anyone who has spent time in deer camp (aka ATF - Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) knows this is based on real experiences. It doesn't matter if you're from the U.P. or someplace where the whitetails are bigger than dogs, this movie to deer season what Blazing Saddles is to westerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being drunk MIGHT help this movie... but maybe NOT!","review":"Started out pretty good and went down hill from there! Being drunk may have helped this movie to be more funny, but I think maybe not! This movie was recommended to me by a friend... but I'm thinking now that I need to check my friends a little more closely!?! Don't waste your money renting our especially buying this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever","review":"We decided to watch the movie on the opening day of Buck season in Michigan. Horrible! Bizarre. I want that hour and a half of my life back. I am from Northern Michigan originally and grew up around hunting, but literally did not laugh once."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Escanaba by ANY moonlight","review":"I live in Escanaba and remember when this was filmed and even was on location at times. This movie is a complete insult to Yoopers. The story line itself was completely ridiculous and could maybe have been a good story if not for the ridiculous alien scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"shipping","review":"paid for the fastest shipping and it took 10 days to arrive. why did I bother paying extra?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Is An Insult","review":"...to the intelligence of the viewer. As a former UP resident I was excited to check out this movie. Unfortunately it is nothing more than one long inside joke. Think of it as a very long Da Yoopers video, and we know how tiresome their schtick quickly becomes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks - Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"As a former resident of Escanaba I was awaiting the movie-what a disappointment-it really can be summed up in a few words-it literally stinks. The people of Esky should be ready to run Jeff Daniels out of town.To me when one is called a Yooper it is the same as being a red-neck and an insult to one's intelligence and culture. We are not as he portrays and I feel sorry for anyone who even thinks this is funny. Maybe they are the true Yoopers- and they deserve the name. I for one will not recommend this to anyone-not even as a joke. We DO NOT drink porcupine pee and fart on eachother's heads. Maybe they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE DESERVE BETTER","review":"This movie was gross, wierd, and pure nonsense. Don't waste your time and money. Yoopers are some of the greatest people in the USA and this movie does them a disservice. The one and only good thing in the whole movie was the very last statement, \\"Heaven is North of the Bridge\\". How true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel exploited......","review":"I wanted to like this movie so bad. As someone who grew up in Wisconsin hunting and now lives in Houghton Michigan (in the UP), I really thought that this movie would appeal to me. I love the UP, and I love deer hunting. But this movie, well, it just went from making some lame caricatures of deer hunters and people of the UP in general, to being flat out bizarre and weird (and not in a funny way). I'm sorry, I understand how people want to like this movie, simply based on it's premise, but when a movie supposedly about deer hunting starts bringing in UFOs and hallucinations--it just makes things strange. Yet, the wackiness could be tolerable if the movie was actually funny; but sadly it is not. I feel like my love of deer hunting and the UP in general was exploited by this film. Save your time and money and don't bother with this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"started well","review":"As a person with 50 years of relation with the UP of Mich, I liked the first part, but in the later parts of the movie it became a bit to gross for me, and a bit unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michiganders will love this...","review":"Having been the child of a deer hunter and widow growing up and watching my father spend year after year NOT bagging a buck, I found this movie absolutely hilarious. Sadly, if you don't live in Michigan, half the jokes will go right over your head. The friendly rivalry between the upper and lower pennisulas of Michigan is part of the humor involved as well as the importance Michigan men place on bagging that all important buck. I thought this movie was so funny that I saw it twice in the theatre after being convinced by a friend (who used to live in Escanaba, where the film was actually shot) to see it. I highly recommend it for anyone who lives in Michigan and even in the Midwest, though the jokes are almost entirely contextual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed myself silly","review":"This is one of those films that you probably will either love or hate. But, if you give it a chance, and not expect something for the AFI top 100 you'll have a good time.This is a very entertaining film, and it has some the best fart jokes every put on film. The ending was worth waiting for, and as for bagging a buck from a two-holer------you'll have to see that.Thank you Jeff for reminding me of some of the things I like best about deer camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie about wonderful people and places.","review":"This is one gut-bustin funny movie. I had lived up in the UP for some time and can say that there really are people like this up there. Not all of them or even the majority of them to be sure, but if you get into some of the real back-woods communities you will see them. I know that some youpers don't like the way that youpers are protrayed in the movie and am sorry for that. Many of the people in the UP have never ventured out of the towns that they grew up in to the point that they themselves don't know that people like these in the movie actually live up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bible Study Guide","review":"We have used these guides in past years.

It told lot's of good detail that helpp to get a clear picture. It was clear were I could under stand it all.The best part of the book I thought was when the giant bat came down from the sky and grabed one of the workers. The giant bat ripped the workers neck open blood went all over. The canupe spelit off in to the river.The auther had a good plot. Like when the auther gave all the details Like when the giant bat kiiled the guy and the crabs were eating him. He also did good on the setting on how they were in the jungle.

It also makes the victim look as though she was a saintly, resourcefull heroine. This si supposed to be a true crime book. The author spends too much time on the lifestyle and personal habits of the victim, and that is totaly irrelevant to this book. The author puts too much emphasis on how the victim's father copes with her death. While the author tries to paint a positive image of the victim, she's realy just a spoiled rich girl who liked hanging out (and sheltering) drug dealers, a pimp who prostitutes little boys, and other assorted low lives."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function O(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(E,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-07d7191f"]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/38.md","filePath":"quotesmag/38.md"}'),P={name:"quotesmag/38.md"},R=Object.assign(P,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{z as __pageData,R as default};
