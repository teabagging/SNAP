Incompatible with Windows or Ubuntu.","review":"I tried this card with Ubuntu and Windows XP SP3. Both have the same issue. The system will begin cycling, attempting to connect to your wireless network over and over, even after it has been connected awhile. This will cause your system to lock up and freeze for 2-10 seconds periodically. Eventually your system will hard freeze completely or just reboot itself.Unfortunately this behavior is well known online. This card will definitely not work on Windows XP SP2 or newer (XP SP3, Vista, Windows 7).

Every cellphone or laptop i've seen or heard of does a better job.

It dropped the connection all the time and then wouldn't pick it back up, so that I had to reboot the computer to get back online. The software that comes with it disables the standard Windows XP login, so instead you have to type in your username and cannot have two users logged in at the same time.

Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a good start; a tangled finish","review":"This Neil Simon comedy has fun with the hard-boiled Humphry Bogart character. Peter Falk does a respectable job, even avoiding characteristics which would lead viewers constantly to remember him as Columbo. Some of the other characters overplay the role, even as comic parodies.There is virtually no plot except a series of parodies of *Casablanca,* *The Maltese Falcon,* and other classics. At first, these parodies are fun, but after about the first 45 minutes, the fun fades. For the latter half of the movie, Neil Simon seems to have forgotten about any semblance of coherent plot and spent all his jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cheap Detective","review":"This movie is a very old one. I had it on video tape and wanted it on DVD. As usual, Amazon found it for me and I got within a few days. I love Amazon and go to Amazon before I check anywhere else for movies or books. Amazon is wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sporadically Funny Spoof","review":"Writer Neil Simon employs the same approach to humor here that he did in \\"Murder by Death\\" by peppering the film with non-stop jokes. The problem is that there are more duds per legitimate laughs here in this send-up of Bogart films. Peter Falk's prescence here redeems the proceedings;he'd be funny reading the phone book. That said, with the material he's given here he may as well have been. Many character actors appear here and are virtually wasted. You could whittle this film down to a fifteen minute sketch for, say, the old \\"Carol Burnett Show\\" and you may have a passable enterprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan and Scan...and too much Falk","review":"Ho-hum. I give it two stars. There are some funny lines (as what Neil Simon script DOESN'T have funny lines), but it doesn't hold together like MURDER BY DEATH. One thing about that earlier film is that Peter Falk is only one of many, many detectives. When he's the star of the show, his Humphrey Bogart impression grows tired real fast. (Actually, it sounds like an impressionist doing an impression of Peter Falk doing an impression of Humphrey Bogart.) A lot of good supporting players, if perhaps too many of them. I did get annoyed at the \\"pan and scan\\" framing, but I certainly am not going to spend money buying a widescreen version should one ever become available."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cheap shot","review":"slapstick at its worst. sophmorish at best. disapointed in Faulk making such a picture if you could call it that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cheap Detective","review":"Nothing akin to the intrigue of Peter Falk's Columbo series.

The laughs are rather scant in Simon's lackluster satire of Humphrey Bogart classics (primarily \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"Casablanca\\"). Falk's Bogart parody is less successful this time around, with the all-star supporting cast mostly wasted. Robert Luthardt's stylish production design remains among the few virtues. A weak effort, \\"The Cheap Detective\\" pales next to Steve Martin's \\"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\\" (1982) yet surpasses George Segal's disastrous spoof \\"The Black Bird\\" (1975)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cheap Detective","review":"Watched it last night and laughed our butts off.

There are terrific close-up photos of the guns from different angles which are the next best thing to actually holding them.

To be fair, this isn't an unusual occurence for mail order millet; I just wish there hadn't been several holes in the bag upon arrival.The millet itself is inconsistent in length and fullness, some sprays robustly round and some anemically skinny. On average though, I'm not disappointed with the product. Jazz and Buddy like this brand of millet as much as they like the other brands they're experienced.Pricewise this millet isn't the best bargain out there, but one must consider that to the door delivery is included in the price.

It's heartfelt and practical and I can't put it down. I have it in my nightstand droor because I am always going through it and re-reading sections for a refresher in my parenting skills. I love how it talks about how you can't just assume that if your kids are going to church that they are automatically going to love God and serve Him with all of their hearts and not walk in the ways of the world. You have to cultivate a love for God in the way we live our lives at home as parents. We've got to be the real deal!

His second Book, the Magnum Opus \\"Secrets\\" cannot be read. Only naturopaths should buy this book (for the wonderful bibliography).The book is full of meaningless banter between childlike Liver Elves. This book is a farce (* for bibliography only).

It is a book that was given to my brother when he was born, and I have read it every year at Christmas. It is a story about an angel that feels that he has made no contribution at all to heaven. His little efforts he feels go un-noticed. He only goes around polishing the stars. See how his small unassuming job in heaven becomes his greatest contribution. I wish that it was still for sale, I would get it in an instant.

True, the material feels great and looks great when closed, but I want a case that will protect my device and not have me worrying over it. Good thing I didn't even get to be concerned over the belt clip/screw that everyone else has complained about.Basically, I put the case on my Palm, took a look at it and decided it was not what I expected, and not worth the $17 to give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case for Your Palm","review":"Great case.

They all have had their quirks, and this one is no exception. Overall, I find it a very good value. The large color screen looks great indoors, but is easily washed out when outside on a bright day. The performance is good, but not excellent. The built-in memory gives lots of space to add plenty of applications. The SD card expansion allows you to carry lots of extra data, including MP3 music files. I use a 4Gb SD card for this and it works great. The WiFi performance has been good, but not as good as a laptop's WiFi. I haven't used the Bluetooth yet. The \\"Blazer\\" web browser is fair. It is slow to start up, and often hangs, requiring a soft re-boot of the device. It won't display very large web pages that include lots of photos very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhino Skin for Palm T5","review":"Very snug fit, slightly cumbersone case. The worst part is the cheap plastic clip that broke a month after purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break! A screw head for a swivel belt clip?!?","review":"I've seen some cheap, tacky and poorly designed similar items but this one gets the all time \\"Most sorriest excuse for a swivel belt clip design\\". Seriously, that's all it is, a metal screw head that sticks out the back of the case about 1/4\\" and used to slide in and out of a flimsy plastic belt clip. The friction of the case swinging back and forth against the screw could actually loosen the screw (which doesn't have much of a bite into the threads to begin with) and next thing you know you're crossing the street and yout PDA falls off without you even noticing. Something that's very easy to lose and easy to scratch any smooth surface if you were to set it down on say a nice wood finished desk. A regular, padded, stationary clip as is typical on eyeglass cases and older cell phone cases would have been more preferable and practical.On the positive side, the rest of the case is well made and fits my Palm TX nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because of this case I lost my PDA","review":"Like the other reviewer said this case is held by a small flat head screw from the plastic belt clip, if it rocks back and forth a lot it will fall off which it unfortunately did easily and now my 300 dollar Palm TX/T5 is gone and probably I will never see it again. Which is highly unfortunate and I will need to buy a new PDA since I need one. On the bright side the case itself is made from high quality leather and looks attractive but what's the point if the case can fall off easily from your belt clip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic clip-on broke after one week","review":"The case has a plastic clip-on for your belt. Mine broke after only one week, and I could not find a replacement for it. It seems like I would have to buy the whole case again. It is really a bad design. Not clear why they did not make the clip-on out of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin's Hotter Than Ever!!","review":"I had my doubts about Justin going solo but he quickly put those to rest! \\"Like I Love You\\" is an awesome single!

Like the other reviewer, I've been looking for years for the right lip product. I've finally found it! This is very moisturizing and smooth, and has enough tint to accent your lips without making them look phony. And it's mica-free! I find mica to be very drying and abrasive in lip products, and I don't like the unnatural way it makes my lips look, either. This is the first natural tinted lip balm I've found that doesn't contain it.

I don't think \\"God\\" is telling me to accept the fact that most of my objects of value are going to be destroyed by these rambunctious (oh, aren't they just wonderfully spirited) boys of mine. Yes, a lot of what is in the book is what I fully expect is going to happen because I gave birth to creatures with XY chromosomes. However, unlike in the book, I don't feel I have to accept and be all sentimental about their high activity levels, inability to sit still, short attention spans, fascination with guns, rough play, and all the other things that seem to go along with the presence of testosterone. There are more choices in role models for today's boys than I read about in this book. And I shall continue to disapprove of the stereotypical and negative male behaviors I see them display, not embrace those behaviors as evidence that I have \\"spirited young boys.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited About Learning","review":"This is one of the best classes I have ever taken.

It really was a long 90 minutes. I suppose if I had liked or even known the actors I might have found some enjoyment in it, but I only knew the one and she is not one of my favorites. The music was very nice, with old hymns used in the score and played on period instruments. This movie really put me to sleep. I found the script dull and lifeless. I do love period pieces, but this one was sorely lacking compared to the BBC productions. I would recommend that you borrow this from your library before buying it (try an inter-library loan if your library doesn't have it).

The rules were confusing, and did not explain a lot of scenarios that we encountered during play. We had to make up some rules to get by. There is no way to win the game as the terrorist. Completely unbalanced and too long -- there is no way to actually play all 24 rounds. You have to shuffle SO MUCH. Annoying. There were typos in the game instructions and box. This cannot be played with 2 players. Not worth it. I cannot believe that anyone actually played this game to test out the kinks.

There are PLENTY of organizations, enemies and story ideas within the book, but I just have too many of my own to use it. The book is wonderful, encouraging \\"multi-class\\" characters, leaving creations limit only being ones imagination. And of course, used in conjunction with the Urban Arcana source books, makes for a great sci-fi fantasy mix we all know and love. I've used D20 Modern to create a Mafia campaign, as well as currently working on a Spec Ops Campaign using a familiar group of G.I.s *hint hint* I love the book, and think it's a great addition to anyone's gaming shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame adaption of a great concept","review":"I waited for weeks with anticipation for d20 modern and I have to say I was pretty disappointed.

Really pretty pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move along, nothing to see here!","review":"I just don't understand the continued fascination with abstract concepts such as levels and hit dice. If you really want to play a balanced system that can provide you interesting, challenging, and detailed combat, choose another system. If you want interesting characters that aren't bound by d20's restrictions upon feats and skills, go elsewhere. This fails to provide any guidance for good role-playing and is simply an extension of the boring \\"hack at it\\" system that is 3.5 D&D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"As I scanned this book, I could only shake my head. WizardsOTC had the golden opportunity to produce the canonical product to encompass 19th, 20th, and 21st century role-playing. Instead, they gave us orcs with firearms. There are plenty of source-books and games out there that simulate these eras better than d20 Modern - for instance, Call of Cthulhu, Spycraft, even d20 Traveller.It's clear that the designers and developers are out of touch with their audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for an Action Movie RPG--Keep Looking!","review":"Classes and levels--Bah humbug! The same drawback that made D&D boring after awhile. O.K., so the class system is less limiting than D&D, but it still doesn't give players and GMs the flexibility to design the kind of heroes found in really GOOD action movies. An open-ended point-based system can do the job better. And even with the Blood & Fists martial arts supplement, it's impossible to build characters like those found in the Mortal Kombat movies and Big Trouble in Little China. All in all, I'd say it fails to capture the free-wheeling flavor of a true Hollywood action movie. Thumbs Way Down!

Whew. That was the best laugh I've had since watching the news the other day. Seriously, this book is an ultra waste of money. Wizards of the Coast (WotC) really crossed the line with this book, because it was a travesty just as much as the 3rd edition Monster Manual (I'll save that review for later).

The marble material, while a beautiful addition to my kitchen, is, unfortunately, porous. This causes the water in the bottom portion to slowly seep out and create mildew on the bottom of the container.

We threw the contaminated butter away, washed the crock with soap and water and tried again, but we continued to have mold problems.

Unfortunately the software is overly complicated and it took some experimentation before I could get it to produce a label without barcodes. In the process of figuring out how to generate a simple, basic label, the label tape jammed in the printer. I found nothing in the hardcopy manual that ships with the product that explains how to clear a jam, and precious little information in the online help--again, I was pretty much on my own when it came to clearing the printer.

It's super clear which is a good thing since I tape over shipping labels and the quality is pretty good.

This tape rolls off the holder easily and secures your packages like that stuff that tears up before you can find it on the roll.

Bigots and fascists are always looking for some sort of intellectual basis for their beliefs and have for 70 or 80 years tried attempted to find it in Rosenberg's tortured and barren prose (along with Hitler's equally crazy \\"Mein Kampf\\"). Albert Speer, an intelligent and broadly educated man who was Hitler's architect, close associate, and armaments minister, declared the book \\"unreadable\\" (see \\"Inside the Third Reich,\\" a vastly more worthwhile book).

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"I bought this based on the reviews here at Amazon. This book presents some good ideas, most of which are intuitive, and in totality makes for a decent desk reference for the cartographer. However, as someone else has pointed out, the formatting of the information on the page is unimpressive and I would add, confounding and hard to read.Most of the example maps in this book are black & white, and somewhat randomly placed in a sea of white space. After reading I'm still wondering what the author is trying to say with his stylistic choices. In either case it certainly weakens Krygier's point of view on 'a Visual Guide to map Design' imo. 'General mapping ideas presented in a pseudo-minimalist fashion' would make for a better title. Props for including a nude though.-> Buy one of Brewer's books, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited in scope","review":"This is not a bad book, but the title and description bear almost no relation to its content. The audience of the book seems to be people who have occasional use for maps, but don't need a very professional product. The text is limited to thematic map design; there's very little about how different map projections work or how geographic features would be represented. There is consideration of some design elements, but the examples used were very limited in scope and somewhat artificial. Finally, there's almost no information about GIS, other than that it exists and can be expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"I thought that I needed it for my class but it was pretty much useless.

The confusing nature of the writing, along with the lack of examples do not teach, but instead confuse. The author does a terrible job in attempting to teach through this writing.

I'm an experienced programmer who knows PHP, ASP, Java, VBA, and some C and C++, and I must say, this book is very confusing to follow. It offers very little examples and explinations; the accompanied cd-rom doesn't make it easier at all. You won't be able to understand half the slides presented on it without him physically explanining it in front of you; even if you were in his presence, you'll still have a big ? mark on the top of your forehead.

Like sneezeing and creating a wind to make all the girls skirts blow up, flying, enchanting the girls shower supplies to wash them automaticly, or making your room mates boobs explode. The one rule about being able to use all this magic is your not aloud to be found out. Nobody can know your a magician, or you will be turned into a hampster. But a girl found out shortly after he blew all of her clothes off. Now she is threatning to tell everybody that he is a wizard unless he helps make the teacher she secretly has a crush on fall in love with her.It's not easy being a secret wizard either when the whole bording school has a crush on him.This book is a nosebleed(Naughty but not pornographic) manga.

Take a 10 year old boy, surround him by girls, then spend 200 pages recycling the same dumb stuff to show off undies and boobs galore.Now, it's not that I am anti-fanservice. It's usually just a side note to some plot, and that's okay. But when it's taking the /place/ of the plot, it gets problematic. It seems like every five pages, one of the teenage girls is tripping over something so they can sprawl over Negi.Several times, I contemplated just giving up reading it entirely, but I'd already invested time in it so I stubbornly persevered.

As a huge fan of Love Hina, I was worried that Akamatsu's new series would be a big flop. But it wasn't. It is true that there are a lot of the same elements in Negima that there were in Love Hina, such as the 'boy in the girl's bath', etc. theme, but unlike Love Hina, Negima's focus isn't on that sort of thing.I saw a lot of promise not only in the developing plot but also in the amazing 31 unique characters. It is also exciting to see how far Akamatsu has come in developing the style of his beautiful artwork. If you enjoyed Love Hina, the you will definitely like Negima: Magister Negi Magi.

I was completely stifled in her class. And the moment you question her, she freaks out and accuses you of being \\"uncommited\\". Kind of like a cult. Don't waste your money or your time reading this nonsense.

The facts regarding these individuals, and the crimes they are supposed to have committed, have been very exaggerated. In several cases the facts are not true at all. For instance; there has been no swedish \\"vampire killer\\", dr. Haerm - who in this book is accused of several murders - was acquitted by the court of appeals in Sweden and he is not legally a suspect in his ex. wife's death. It's not hard to understand that getting facts about crimes on the other side of earth is hard and getting the facts right is probably even harder.

Having previously seen Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Gundam movies, I didn't quite know what to expect with this new film. Boy was I surprised. Unlike the other Gundam movies like Char's Counterattack, I was able to enjoy F91 without having any predisposition on the background or the world. It was a nice self-contained story with albeit 1990's animation, the action sequences of the mobile suits are top notch. Gundam F91 follows a young man caught up in a conflict between his home colony and a group known as the Crossbone Vanguard. With several twists and turns, relationships are key to a very fun movie. I hear that Bandai will be releasing this film as a Special Edition with remixed audio and a commentary track, its not out yet, but just based on the movie itself, I highly recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"arrived in time, but in a very bad condition. the book was desecribed as \\"used-good\\" but in fact it was not acceptable, the cover is damaged and marked by a chewing-gum. really disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case for the price","review":"Considering the low cost, this is a good case and is much better than not protecting your bodhran at all.

Use half inch thick foam to line each side separately and your drum will be safe. I attached the foam with double sided duct tape though hot glue or anything else permanent would suffice as I was experimenting on the fit and will do the more long lasting application if the tape gives up ;DThe case is well made enough but the pocket will not hold the drum beater so just make a bubble wrap sleeve for it and insert it inside the open side of the drum - tucks in nicely. Can't beat the price on this case so you can PAD it for smaller uses.

This line of observation ( mentioned in the preface) \\" One can not learn to write large programs effectively until one has learned to write small ones effectively\\" captures the motivation of the book. There are three parts; part I introduces predicate logic; it includes natural deduction system; Part II builds the mathematical treatment of the programming constructs like assignment, alternative, iterative command and procedure call. Part III shows how programs are developed and proved correct using the mathematical principles discussed earlier. Given the nature of the area, the book is written with a lot of attention to instructional impact. The best recommendation for the book is by Dijkstra: The topic deserves no less author... To get the message across requires a scientist that combines his scientific involvement in the subject with the precious gifts of a devoted teacher\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Good product I like the way my pick up isuzu 87 with angel eyesAmazon always buy good products"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unrealistic review for the NAPLEX","review":"I cannot, in all honesty, recommend this book as a review for the NAPLEX. Having recently (7/04) passed the NAPLEX myself, I found this book to completely off base with the subject material and level of difficulty of the exam itself. Case studies within Pharm Prep place undue emphasis on clinical decision-making, relying heavily on treatment guidelines and evidence-based medicine. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, however, much of this material (guidelines etc) is NOT tested on the NAPLEX because 1) the material can become easily dated and 2) it is beyond the scope of practice of most practicing pharmacists.

If you are looking for a good Sandra Bullock film, this isn't the one.The plot is thin and the violence is extreme. Very few characters survived this movie.

I'm sure this one would end up there if it weren't for all of the violence. The acting is downright horrible (never made it to the part with Sandra in it... I was about to throw up after 30 minutes and couldn't take any more). The cinematography is even worse... some of the worst angles, light/dark problems, etc. I've ever seen. I'm convinced games like Doom took their idea from this movie... there are shots where you are following guns around and watching them shoot people.Another reviewer mentioned that High Schoolers could make better movies...

However, she was on the cover just to sell this awful DVD! Her picture as shown on the cover must have been taken elsewhere, because this movie was made in '87, and in the movie she has 80s clothes and hair, not the hip look she has on the cover. Also, she appears for only about 5 minutes as the main character's ditzy girlfriend. The sound quality stank, the \\"plot\\" was plotless, and the movie overall was boring and stupid. I definitely would only recommend this movie as a coaster or frisbee, not for its entertainment value as a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of money and time","review":"Yeah, so I bought this movie thinking it would be fun to watch and it had one of my favorite actresses, Sandra Bullock, include in the cast. Little did I know that so wasn't in much of the movie and the movie was very badly made with little plot and unrealistic action scenes. There was no way this movie has any glimpse of reality strewn within it and that just makes this a collosel was of time to view and a waste of money. Also, this version of the dvd I bought, had a recent photo of Bullock on the cover, leading you to think that this is a more recent project that she may have done before she was noticed in Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"They called this a movie?","review":"Ok, there's only one negative review for this movie - and that doesn't do justice to explaining how terrible this movie was. I am a die-hard Sandra Bullock fan, and I thought I would enjoy watching any movie in which she acted, but this was by far the biggest waste of two hours I have ever committed. It was so painful to watch I had to fast forward through most of the cheese.

Tragically, I purchased it. (I cannot think of the reputation, condition, or location of a video store that would rent this. The store would have been torched by the returning customer.) In one scene, Sandra Bullock goes into the library and proceeds to cry and whine to her friends there. You never find out what is wrong. Maybe because she has just had the script translated for her. She had not read it when she signed on to do the film and just found out that her future in film is now in severe jeopardy. Thank God she survived and that most of the copies of this movie are forever lost.

I love movies and have quite a collection. I can usually find at least one redeeming quality in any movie and will frequently watch a not-so-good movie in it's entirety just to find that quality.Poor directing & acting, embarrassing editing, pathetic special effects (like the 'gun cam' shots) and an anticlimactic ending make this movie actually painful to watch.

I'm sure she doesn't include this turkey on her resume. There's not one redeeming quality to this so-called thriller.

I don't know if this is the worst movie ever made, but it's the worst I've ever seen. It was like end-to-end junk. No plot, no acting, no direction, no point. A scrap yard, a wrecker dump. A gun collection. These people (they weren't actors) were given lines to say 2 minutes before filming, and they said them. Some of them made faces. A lot of triggers were pulled, and men ran around shooting. The body-count was innumerable. Jaw-dropping, mind-numbing, belief-begging. Ugh-gh-gh. I'll just add something to that. If someone had deliberately set out to make the worst movie ever made they could not have made one worse than Hangmen.

In fact, it is more of a bad documentary that tries to glorify the Merry Pranksters. The film was made by OB Babbs whose real interest is exploiting Leary's fame to make a few bucks and talking about his parents (he goes on and on about growing up with the Merry Pranksters and yet seems to understand them poorly). If you are interested in a childish view of the Merry Pranksters, buy this film, if you are actually interested in Timothy Leary, whatever you do, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!To conclude, it is just a documentary (that barely deserves the title) compossed of footage of the M.P. lumped together in a manner that suggests that Babbs edited it himself and spend about 10$ in the process.

Still, this was a poorly-done \\"urban drama.\\" The fighters' moves were sped up because they were not that spectacular.

But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle. These work really well when placed just in front of the tires. We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side. Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all. Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fixed the bounce","review":"Used these under a crawl/pad where a floor bounced probably 1/8-1/4\\" without any obvious separation or problems. We only noticed it with a new dresser with ringed handles that now clanged when we'd walk by it. Worked perfectly to use two of these and a 4x6. They threaded up perfectly against the weight and the legs are very stable. Easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"H9 vs F707","review":"My Sony F707 Cybershot(5meg pixal) failed after 5 years (the ccd went out) so I purchased the Sony DSC-H9 to replace it. This H9 is no comparison to the F707. 90% of the shots are blurry. The only way to use it I find is with a tripod. Clarity is terrible along with a poor flash. I was expecting equal or better when I purchased this camera since the F707 is no longer produced. I can only say if you are looking for a camera that takes quality pictures with clarity do not purchase the Sony H9. What bothers me most is the H9 is 8MP vs the F707 of 5MP yet the quality is not even close to the quality of the F707. Sony has produced a very poor replacement in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pictures","review":"I bought this camera in August.

When we had the first pics developed, we noticed yellowing in the shots but attributed it to the store who developed them. My husband decscribes it as pixilated yellowing and I say vein like. Hard to describe unless you see it. After this happened with an additional batch of photos, I contacted Sony who had me send it to one of their repair centers. We had to pay shipping costs. The camera came back over a week later and the problem was still there. I called Sony and they refused to replace the camera and want me to send it to ANOTHER repair center.We have lost out on precious moments that we won't get back. We currently are disputing this with our credit card company.They do not stand by their products and I will not buy Sony again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overspecified, with too many compromises","review":"This camera has a great zoom range but, on the other side, the lens' quality seems to be below average, with a lot of distortion, chromatic aberrations, noticeable corner softness.Also, the sensor/processor combo seems to be a step backwards from previous models, in terms of image quality. The pics look soft and there are a lot of visible compression artifacts, due to the lack of fine quality mode.All of this translates in poor images, which may look good resized at 5 megapixels, or in small prints, but then, why would you want an eight megapixel camera that only delivers pictures with quality on par with 5 mp cameras, from 2 or 3 years ago. A Huge step backwards for sony, if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but major design flaw","review":"Have had the DSC H9 for 3 months. A good day camera for small hands. Large hands(thumb pad)bump control button. Light, easy to use, short day shutter lag. Long list of features. Major design flaw: 72mm funnel shaped filter adaptor ring sits in front of flash. 50 out of 50 pictures have half moon shadow due to flash blockage. Without adaptor ring, pictures are fine, no shadow, but no lens protection. Night shutter/flash lag very poor. SLOW. If the object/subject moves, you will not get it. Sony not responsive to flaw issue. Cylindrical adaptor not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Grump","review":"I had the opportunity to get my hands on a copy of this book and I must say that the story is wonderful.

From the lighting to the boring and overly long interviews this is a documentary in need of some good editing and a director who knows something about making an interesting film. It appears the director has no idea how to shoot an interesting and decent looking documentary. Just pointing a camera at poorly lit people and letting them ramble on with no editing does not make for an interesting film. It is said that a great teacher can bring alive even the most boring subject matter and vice versa. This film takes an interesting man and a fascinating time and make it into a complete snoozefest."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

After reading all the books about Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady and reading all the books written by Jack, Jan Kerouac, Carolyn Cassady, and Ann Charters I finally discover this little gem of a documentry. It's the first time that I've ever seen Jan Kerouac, Neal Cassady, Carolyn Cassady or William Burroughs on film. What a treat. If you don't know these people you'll probably be bored to death. But if you're a beat generation nut like myself, this is a real gem. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Me Think Who Cares!","review":"I turned this documentary off half way through.

About halfway through the story, suddenly, the heroine thinks, Oh, my gosh, I'm in love with him --(although their acquaintance is approximately one month, if that, and they've spent all their time fighting). She feels that her chances with the hero are hopeless (!) so she passively runs away, instead of breaking off her engagement to him face-to-face.The story was completely unbelievable, and unbelievably annoying.

Yoga requires a surprising amount of strength and is not for sissies! Those who have practiced it for a long time sometimes forget that. However, there were some comments about the voice of the instructor being grating - and it is - especially at the start of the routine. It's very high-pitched and her phrasing is odd; but you get used to it and she also goes into a more natural mode later in the routine.

All of the impacts of the planes have been removed so that the victims and the american people are blinded by what really hit those towers.Although they show 1 to 2 impacts of planes, this stripped down version of the real events hides the truth.In this dvd no reports of the hundreds of eye witness accounts that reveal many explosions going on at the twin towers before and after the \\"planes\\" hit.There is so much left out of the dvd that i decided to compare it to the first dvd.The differences clearly show that a lot more needed to be edited before the public figures out, what really happened that day.This dvd is a one sided slap in the face to victims and Americans in general.Everyone that reads this should call or write cnn and tell them we want the original dvd.

The downside is that she can't be an expert in every subject she tries to cover. I was delighted that rabbit care had a place in the book -- though a little disappointed that timothy hay as a staple of the diet & for chewing wasn't mentioned, only raw greens. And also related to rabbits, she got cecotropes mixed up: it's the moist ones that are destined for re-digestion, not the hard dry ones.Other than that, she has good information for dogs, cats.

Please use these books carefully and under the supervision of your veterinarian. There is a reason why we are required to attend four years of post-undergraduate medical school in order to prescribe drugs and make medical decisions. All animals are complex organisms who vary widely among species and individuals. Drugs and herbal remedies that may be safe and effective in humans can kill cats and dogs. These species variations are not well understood, especially with regards to herbal medications. For example, onions can be deadly to cats, as can Tylenol (a drug that we feel is safe even for human children). Please don't leave your common sense at the (e)bookstore door.

The folding handle was nice and the retractable cord retracted most of the way. This made it easier to pack and for the size it didn't weigh that much. I bought this to travel in Europe and it worked great. It only had one speed with the dual voltage but it dried very fast. I bought a universal diffuser from folica to go with it and it fit just fine! I have naturally curly hair so was worried about the one speed, but I dried frizz free, of course I use a gel & silk product.

Its attributes include: Well organized, easy to read, extremely useful reference section, and a score of brief introductions to the valuable tools and techniques it could take years to discover on your own.

And she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her. Updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor.He does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist Georgia O'Keefe, but no actual artwork created by O'Keeffe. That should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like.Disturbing, too, are Updike's dismissive comments about Edward Hopper; he claims that Edward Hopper can't paint faces very well.So even though I purchased this book, I don't recommend it to others. Give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak time novel","review":"I typically enjoy SF books, but this is one is quite weak.

An amazing visual and aural explosion, the performance was an absolute masterpiece. Just when you think the video walls and flying Trabants are going to overwhelm the whole thing, off go Bono and the boys to a stage in the middle of the crowd to perform an intimate set with nothing but the music to hold them up. It doesn't get any better than this. I dare you to not get a chill when Bono as MacPhisto hits those beautiful falsetto notes at the very end.

I am very disappointed. Instead of a tribute, I feel that this was more of a promotional scheme by October records to get their weak roster some air play. All of the songs are played by techno bands belonging to October records. It is easy to tell good techno from bad techno, and these groups are all examples of bad techno. They are musically weak and simple. They have taken the technically beautiful songs of Robert Smith and reduced them to their most simple form.

Its about hollywood life and how one couple try to act and deceive the public in order for their movie to be a hit at the box office. Frankly I found Catherine Zeta-Jones annoying as the whining, self absorbing and shallow little starlet. Julia Roberts who plays Kiki, is the sister of the whining star. She lets herself be belittled by her sister and I didn't really like that. Stand up for yourself!Eddie played by John Cusack, is so scatterbrained that he belongs in therapy. He's very clueless about himself and his life. I know its just a movie, but I don't like to see anyone being manipulated and I actually like strong characters in a movie. Its amazing that this movie opened huge, considering that its plot stinks. This movie clearly shows and confirms that people in hollywood are shallow, and egoistic maniacs that will do anything to get ahead in their career. There's nothing to be admired about this silly movie or hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"I love Billy Crystal - so I couldn't wait to see this movie.

The cast is what made this movie wonderful. Catherine Zeta-Jones played the prima dona over the top, and it really worked. Billy Crystal is as always delightful.

It's hardly funny and certainly not very romantic. The plot is a foray into Hollywood's self-loathing that is not light-hearted enough to work. The characters are not very likable, which is an essential part of any romance. The attempts at humor are rarely funny.

Why bother making it?\\" Another pointless, predictable, un-funny film is not what the entertainment world needs.

With the high powered cast I was hoping for more. Julia Roberts shines, once again, and saves this movie from a one star rating. As the overlooked sweet little sister to the popular self-centered older sister she brings her role to believability.

I mean they all have basically decent track records and none of them notices that the movie is bombing?Annoying characters, less than entrancing chemistry, and a diligent focus on the dreadful nature behind a Hollywood \\"star\\" who is so annoying that I began hoping that a plot twist would kill her off.Seth Green has some good moments, but if you want to see an all around brillant \\"inside Hollywood\\" movie I'd recommend \\"The Player\\" from 1992 - which also happens to feature Julia Roberts and John Cusack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Below It's Cast","review":"Shallow.

To say it was a waste of fine acting talent is certainly true, but doesn't capture awfulness and pointlessness of the film.The film was awful because the writing was awful, and great actors (although slightly miscast) and good directing could not make up for something that just wasn't there.Console yourself in watching classics for the actors in these movies instead: for Cusack, watch \\"The Sure Thing\\"; for Roberts, \\"Notting Hill\\"; for Walken, \\"The King of New York\\"; for Zeta-Jones, \\"Traffic\\" and for Crystal, \\"When Harry Met Sally.\\" Now *those* are some movies worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Witty, Fun Movie","review":"This movie has it all.....It's witty, funny, charming and for the most part has an all star cast. I'm sorry fans, but I do not like Billy Crystal at all and feel like it was a waste having him in the movie. However, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack, and Hank Azaria have such a wonderful on screen chemistry together, making this movie a must see and a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting!","review":"It is no surprise why Billy Crystal is one of America's Sweethearts, because we in America just love him. I really wish that this movie could have had a little less of Julia Roberts and John Cusack, and a little more of Billy's shenanigans like he does so delightfully during the Oscars. Maybe he could have sung a few songs about Catherine Zeta Jones (and even made silly references to how old her husband--Michael Douglas--is), and done a snappy little dance. That would have made this movie slightly more enjoyable.But even though they didn't do that, I would pay money to see Julia Roberts fall in love with anything--even a plate of yams--because she is just so down-to-earth. In real life I just know she's like any other normal person, because that's what she says to the paparazzi all the time. This is clearly the role that everyone will remember her for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of Talent","review":"This movie proves my statement that Hollywood is running out of ideas. The one star is for the effort, but otherwise there was no plot, no great effects and definitely NO originality.I was surprised with this considering the actors' talent in other films, maybe they didn't work well together, or there was just a lack of enthusiasm, but either way this film was surprisingly boring and very predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Gross!","review":"A sister going after her sister's husband?!

Rent it if you must but you'll want your $3.75 rental fee back when it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of John Cussack","review":"This movie was such a disappointment. Although the female actors had an opportunity to capitalize on their relationship with one another (despite the ridiculous plot-which is so forgettable, thank God), Julia Roberts plays like she's taking a break from her busy acting career and Catherine Zeta Jones makes no effort to add MUCH-needed charisma or sympathy to her character. As for John Cussack...well, he just seems to be caught in the middle. The token male.American Sweethearts could have passed for believable, or funny, or not so stupid. There were no redeemable qualities. The director wasn't able to get anything out of his actors and to be honest I don't think the actors even tried, or cared.The one star is for Billy Crystal's line: \\"That's a whole Backstreet Boy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I bought this movie a few days ago.

Everyone seems to be able to cut their 5 minutes conversation into 20 seconds to mean what they mean. I love slow Chinese movies that use subtle dialogs to hint at the unseen plots (like In the Mood of Love),because it is an efficient and artful way to present the story while focusing on the characters, but the dialogs here only amplify the blankness of the characters. This is a big disappointment especially because the stories can be potentially interesting and the cast is good!

I don't mind very slow movies and some of the other Chinese movies I have liked, such as \\"Yellow Earth\\" are also slow paced.\\"Flowers of Shanghai\\" takes place in a brothel visited by very well to do Qing officials during the 1880's in Shanghai, a city notorious for its brothels between the late 19th century to the 1930's. While this historical context provides for a potentially interesting storyline, I did not find the scenes of drinking, games and conversations among the Qing officials and their expensive ladies interesting.I am sorry to say I do not recommend \\"Flowers of Shanghai\\" unless you are a fan of Hsiao-hsien Hou, the director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Restrained? Muted? Boring!","review":"This movie was tedious. Absolutely nothing happens. Blocking, which is supposed to reflect the tension between the actors, is nonexistent. In fact, the characters hardly move. The cinematographer's only trick is a slow pan; there are no cutaway shots or close ups. It's almost as if the director sought to evoke in the viewer the opium-induced stupor many of his characters reside in. I am no stranger to Chinese cinema; I own a few dozen titles. Nor am I unsympathetic to movies with serious themes; in fact, that is precisely what I find entrancing about Chinese cinema.

Moen always sends the parts, but since I'm paying a plumber to work on it, this has become a very expensive faucet. Now Moen has replaced it with a new (identical) faucet, but I'm not willing to pay for another installation and am currently researching for a more reliable faucet. The 2 ongoing problems I have had are the chrome on the body stains due to constant \\"oozing\\" around the seams and the sprayer will not stay securely in the faucet after just a few months of normal household use (no kids playing with it, just myself cooking for 2 people). The Moen service is courteous and fast, but unless you are willing/abel to replace the parts and faucets yourself this is not a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the quality go?","review":"I have to admit, I didn't buy this product from Amazon. I received it as a free replacement from Moen because of the lifetime guarantee on another faulty faucet. Wow, that's all I can say. Where did the quality go? It's ALL Plastic! And they say it's chrome, what is chrome? It's chrome colored plastic, not metal. I'm extremely disappointed with the quality, however, I must say it works flawlessly. It swivels smoothly and the pull-out hand works well. Although, the handle sits in the base kind of loose. Just make sure you keep your expectations low before purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product","review":"I purchased this faucet to go with a new stainless steel sink. I was looking for something with a pull out spout and a sleek design. I came across this moen product and liked the way it looked. It was really what i was looking for. What a mistake! The quality of it is not the greatest. The pull out part is made of plastic! Because of that it not only looks cheap but also feels cheap! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Looks really nice on the photograph but in reality is nothing like it. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic faucet, with basic results!","review":"I don't think I will ever buy Moen again. I have had this faucet and it finally started dripping. I replaced two parts with MOEN replacement parts (which are plastic), and the thing still drips.

Do yourself a favor and buy a different, more well made item, maybe a Kohler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking but cheap feeling","review":"Product looks good, but the pull out handle is cheap feeling plastic.

The handle attaches to the faucet much better and it is about $10.00 cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy a Moen","review":"I bought a Moen (kitchen faucet) on the advice of our plumber (he said Moen or Delta) and other plumbers online at the time. I thought we were getting a good brand-name product. Wrong. If the cheap plastic was the only issue, I could live with that. No. We have had it six months and it has a slow drip. It is slow enough that we didn't notice it at first and when we did, thought one of us has not turned it off properly. But we are two adults and always careful about stuff like that. Finally I thought to put a bowl under it and, yes, it has a slow leak. There are times when if you align it just right it might not drip. But 95% of the time it does even when we are careful. Then I go online and find others have had the same problem. The irony is I paid more thinking I was getting a faucet that was better than the cheaper brands. I would not recommend any model of Moen to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faucet broke in one week","review":"I agree with everyone else. The quality of this faucet is horrible.

First off, it was a slightly tricky install with just one bolt tightening and holding in place the entire faucet. Then, I pulled out he extended hand faucet and it's made of PLASTIC! This is when my doubts set in about how long this thing would last. I was surprised to discover that the cheap, lightweight plastic handle actually held up well over 6 months, it was the faucet itself which started to drip..drip...drip. But because of the lousy design there is only one screw that tightens the whole thing. I tried to tighten the screw but to no avail, it continued to drip just like the other reviewers here stated.

I usually love an anything with a combo of creepy houses and mysterious characters, sex and violence don't offend me, but I found nothing in this book that worked. I didn't like the mother, the daughter, or even the \\"hero\\" of this book. Seriously, NO real mother would leave her daughter's side for one moment when faced with the situation that these people were in much have a sexual relationship with a stranger. Trust me, I rarely get shocked or offended, but this story pissed me off. And the lame and stupid name fo the \\"monster\\"....\\"Xanadu\\"....stupid,stupid,stupid. What really got me was the detail Laymon went to in the graphic detail about the rape and early compliance that the young girl had with her captor. Personally I think Laymon wrote a few of his own fantasies and tried to pass it off as creative writing. I did something with this book is something I have never ever done in my life. I THREW IT AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book at all. The characters were undeveloped and unbelievable to the point of ridiculousness. A mother who would trust strange men instantly not only with her own safety but with that of her daughter's, with everything that happened to them? That was the only horror of this book. The \\"hero\\" was 1 dimensional and forgettable. The \\"monsters\\" were laughable. Save the \\"$5 and change\\", and your time and pass it by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A yarn of questionable judgement","review":"Richard Laymon's purpose, so it appears, is to give the reader a suspenseful horrific ride, upon a vehicle of poor judgment. His characters just do not use good common sense. Hence, they find themselves in situations which they deserve. I kept saying to myself throughout this book, why the devil would he / she use such poor judgment ? You don't pick up hitchhikers at 2 AM. You don't forsake going to the hospital after a car accident. And you certainly do not go into a place called \\"Beast House\\" when you are running for your life. Yet this is the type of judgment used throughout, so I found myself having very little sympathy for the victims. However, when you take a look at the purpose of his book from a different perspective, it's all about the carnal vicarious ride. The characters are supposed to put themselves in harms way. The killer is supposed to have opportunities abounding. It is a slasher B movie in print. Decent yarn for this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Poorly done character work provides no insight into this weakly timed and tasteless rendition of a low caliber shot in the dark at a horror \\"novel\\". No scene work, outside of the \\"Beast house\\", implies that this author is grinding out a novel with the intent to write a second or third in a series of books about cheap sex, gore, beasitality and pediphilia intent on making the reader retch. This book would banned from some web sites, and the nanny guards would block it from most computers.Three hundred and nine pages could have been shrunk to about one hundred considering the large print, oversized margins and full blank pages between chapters. Publishers at Leisure Fiction should have reconsidered printing this one.Save your money and buy a book that is properly labeled as adult porn.

Richard Laymon was nothing but a pervert, and a sick sadistic one at that. When 1 of the characters rapes a 10 year old girl thats pretty much where I stopped reading. And from what I've heard it only gets worse after that so I have no intentions of ever continuing with this horrific excuse for a book. Blood and Gore I have no problem with. I love horror, and I love monsters. Thats why I was drawn towards this book. But theres no need to go on about the rape and torture of a 10 year old girl. Its sick, and I'll never read another Laymon book ever again. Laymon fans will try and defend this book and say that he was just trying to give you a strong feeling of hate towards his villain, but in reality its just an excuse to write about something disgusting.

After reading a rough outline and some minor details involving the plot, i ordered it online. Well after reading it, i have to admit i'm torn. On one hand it is filled with suspense, and is definitely not lacking in the \\"shocking\\" department. On the other hand pedaphillic rape, and sadomasochistic beastiality seem more disgusting than disturbing to me. After reading a chapter or two i found myself needing a shower, using a brand new bar of soap each time.Apparently there is a whole series of these books.

However, when I bought it, I thought it was going to be scary by the other user's reviews. It was about a beast in a house, and among other things, about a man who rapes little girls. I found that the man was the scariest part of this book because you know that happens all the time. People are sick.

I liked the characters in the story and was a quick read--I finished it in one day. The Cellar was interesting and kept my attention. Some parts of the book were predictable and maybe even a bit clique. What I really, I must stress REALLY, didn't like was the character Roy's obsession for little girls. Those parts made me nauseous and very uncomfortable. I was definitely cheering when Roy got what was coming to him.

So absolutely unbelieveable that it made me want to throw the book away (which I did a day after I finished - couldn't even bear to have it in my house).But I should mention that as I love horror books and movies - I do not like the new genre of horror/torture porn that has come late in recent years - but if you like this sort of thing - then you might like this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding reading","review":"Mr. Laymon's book has haunted me for many years.

The extent of pedophilia wasn't even germane to the story. Which leads me to believe that the author is one sick puppy. The plot was weak, the characters were thin, the dialogue was stupid, and I wasn't scared at all. Oh, but there was lots of sex with children and lots of sex with...beasts.

I like the groove on the surface which prevents pictures from sliding forward. The texture of the ledge is nice too. It's not completely smooth like a lot of the laminate ledges you see for sale. Those look like fake wood in my opinion.Bad: Anchoring system is a bit flawed. You basically have to insert two screws at a near perfect amount of penetration thru trial and error (about 80%). Then you slide the ledge over the screw head. If the screws aren't just right, the ledges will not be extremely flush. I noticed a bit of an outward tilt with my ledges, but I have an older home with imperfect and slightly uneven plaster walls. I don't recommend these ledges at all for this type of wall. If you have newer construction or drywall, they should work much better though.Quality is good, but they are overpriced for what you get.

The liner notes to the cd contain a tale of New Year's from each of the six memebers (Andrew on keyboards is new) and while they are all very good, Geoffs, the singers is the saddest. If you are a fan, pick this disc up, i am confident that you will not be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stories Falling","review":"I've seen Thursday live twice, and they are an awesome live band.

The humor in this cartoon can be viewed by adults and kids alike, and still be enjoyed. It's a show that doesn't take itself seriously and is all the more fun for this! I hope this lasts a few more seasons before it gets taken off the air. If that happens I hope Marvel has the sense to make this direct to DVD; instead of network fare.

Their songs are beautiful and sound much better than concert video clips taken by fans. These girls serve as excellent role models of how youth could and should act. Their attire is conservative; their lyrics meaningful and clean; their performance simple. Each song has a positive message. Although they are very personable, talking to the audience and touching many of the fans' outreaching hands, the audience seemed not quite with it. One of the more impressive songs consisted of just the two sitting, singing, and playing their guitars. As a parent, I would recommend this DVD for any girl between 9 and 15. Younger children will not appreciate the lyrics and older kids will want harder rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not something I would suggest .","review":"Though I take to risk of coming off pompous, Aly & A.J.'s premier concert CD suffers a dire lack of substance. To start, the DVD menus are poorly animated and uninspiring. The concert film quality is flat and dull - suffering from what I suspect to be the grain compression of sub 53X grade film. The concert itself also did not impress me, the girls show a very poor displace of stage presence, contrasting specifically with the spirit of stage contrast. The song choice holds very little flow as the concert progresses, and the girl's wardrobe was typical and ordinary, especially AJ's.Overall I would say this DVD is not worth the list price. For a more spectacular, well rounded concert performance I would suggest Bob Marley - Live at the Rainbow Room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absoulty Awesome!

Rather, Galloway's primary focus is in doing the least amount of training to prevent injury at all costs. Training techniques include frequent walk breaks, running long only once every three weeks, doing long runs at a pace 2 mins/mile slower than what one would ordinarily run.

I initially purchased this dvd because I had always loved the Starvengers segment of Force Five and was immediately drawn by the nostaligia factor. However, what I found was that there were only trace similarites between the old Force Five Five series and ADV's current release. The new Getter Robo series is extremely dark and disturbing and the story-line, at this point, is somewhat schizophrenic and difficult to follow. The action sequences are extremely intense, and if you are a mecha fan, it is really interesting to see the different generations of Getter mecha. The animation is not as sophisticated as Evangelion or Macross Plus, but it seems to work well. If you are looking for a simple anime with all questions answered, then Getter Robo is not for you. However, if you are willing to relinquish control and let the story unfold, then sit back, buckle-up, and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 70 Anime is Back","review":"This DVD is an interesting change of what we are seeing now in the world of anime many of you maybe don't know what is Getter Robot.

I wouldn't accept this fluff from an undergraduate. Has Lucas, like Bennett, Will, Roche, and the other conservative junta abandoned critical thinking? They have certainly abandoned fact, evidence, and rational thought. Too bad it's the old white guys who've killed education in this country.The only saving grace is his critique of college sports; yet, it is so poorly developed that readers might be left without the thorough analysis of UNPAID PROFESSIONALS.

Find a demo unit and try it using what you think would be your natural seating position (for me, I use it at my desk at home). That's because it is easily four inches too narrow. To use it properly you need to squeeze your legs together, which is very unnatural. Even then, I find that my feet can't naturally rest flat on the massage pads (I have to consciously force them to rest flat). Also, the angle of the unit is slightly too flat; five or so degrees of incline would be useful.This unit replaces a Conair foot massager that served me well but died recently. It is lighter than the Conair and MUCH smaller (see above). The Conair offered features not found on the Homedics: variable-speed massaging and independent heat; the Homedics combines heat with massage, it can't be turned on by itself.The Homedics does look cool with its blue and red lighting, but the size (actually, the lack thereof) marks it down"},{"rating":"2","title":"HoMedica Luxury Foot Massager","review":"Homedics FM100H Foot Revitalizer Luxury Foot MassagerI bought it to use with the hope that it would help to reduce the swelling in mine & my 83yr. old wife's leg,ankles & feet.

Willy has tracked down the earliest references to basilisks, dragons, plants that spawn mammals, etc. and tried to divine the truth. Modern science has solved many of these old mysteries (where do eels come from?), but others elude us still (kraken).What sets this apart from other \\"I saw Big Foot\\" type books is that Willy really knows his stuff and has no axe to grind. He relates the evidence as-is and gives you enough information to make your own judgement.Willy also writes about rocket science.

Being a total fan of the Lord of The Rings triology I was hoping that this movie would be of similar quality however it is not. Christopher Lloyd does his best to portray his character with believablity however the supporting cast just can't help him out.

It was filmed as though I should know all about what had happened previously. Was there a part 1 to this series? So I checked around... nope. This is all there is (two parts on one DVD). What an editing nightmare. It \\"looked\\" pretty good for a TV/movie... I just couldn't finish it and gave up disinterested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"Someone had a bit of courage producing this movie and keeping it at almost 3 hours.The acting is bad, the effects are bad, the writing is bad and I'm happy because I rented this.Save your money of better yet, if you need a nap rent this because you're likely to get a really good nap.Not sure what's wrong with others who have compared this to TLOTR.

You can not really compare this to LoTR because LoTR was made on a nine figure budget were KofB may have been made on a couple million, if that. I think it was nicely made on the budget it was given, and it is also nice to see a fantasy adventure in a television world ruled by reality television and CSI clones."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"B\\" budget, BUT great movie","review":"If u love this style of movie, this one is for u. Great plot, good acting, just a very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not remotely helpful","review":"This book lacks focus, has very few recipes, and is not geared for kids. I had hoped for tips on streamlining my kitchen routine and finding recipes for my picky pre-schooler, but this book is a hodgepodge of NON-timesaving tips (e.g. make your own bread; freeze guava for slushies), and recipes any kid would hate (pasta with BEETS?). \\"One Bite Won't Kill You\\" by Ann Hodgman has the tips and recipes I needed, and was very funny and reassuring to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"This book has a fair amount of helpful nutrition information for parents who aren't aware of the nutrients that are important for growing children. It focuses more on how to \\"be lazy\\" and less on what to actually feed your children. The author recommends that to \\"save time\\" you do things like prepare your ingredients in advance and cut up veggies for snacks when you first get home from the grocery store. Obviously, these methods don't actually save any time - they just alter when you expend your time. There are also strange little charts at the end of each chapter that supposedly demonstrate how you can now save time - but they are difficult to understand and seem like wasted space. Many of the time-saving hints are also money-wasting ones. There are not a lot of recipes in this book. Some of them do not sound appealing. Many of the recipes contain dairy products in some form - cheese, cream, cottage cheese, etc. I was not impressed by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude looks like a lady","review":"The writing is good and the plot is funny, but I have one major problem:The little brother looks like a GIRL. His facial structure, his hair and the way he speaks. I watched several episodes before someone told me that kid was a BOY. Every time I look at that kid I just think girl, girl, girl. The drawing of that kid is a MAJOR mistake.When a major character looks like the wrong gender, that's a huge flaw.I'm not just talking about the long hair. Everything about this kid says girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, pure garbage","review":"The comic isnt even funny, or witty, its attempt at being political is so one sided. I cant stand reading the funny papers if I even see The Boondocks in them, the name alone sounds like it took no thought, my kids could have thought of a better title. \\"The Unfunny Afro Kids, Where There Is No Punchline At The End of The Strip\\". The creator has no clue of politics and is sitting in his mansion pretending to be a pissed off minority.Screw The Boondocks, I want to puke huge gobs of rubber all over the creator, it sucks the wax out of a dead mans ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny !!!","review":"At first I did not think I would like this dvd because of the use of the \\"N\\" word - but the stories are well written and the characters have depth and compassion.

For years, I have read the comic strip and it was nice to see the characters come to life and the storylines extended. This is great adult humor.

I can watch it and appreciate Aaron Mcgruder for his views on Black culture and laugh at the jokes and see the truth in his work, while others think it is degrading or disrespectful to black people. I had a person ask me what i was watching and told him, andhe watched the show and looked at me like i was crazy...very narrow mined if you ask me.

I think it is a great show and am looking forward to the next season when it comes out...whenever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closed Captioning in French Only","review":"The description of this product says closed captioning in English.

This was not.It was a mind-numbing, boring, pathetic attempt at film making. Violent? Ummm.. no. Shocking? Please. Horrifying? My God, Pocahontas was more horrifying. Yes, a porn clip in the middle of the film is the only thing that made me sit up and take notice. Awful, awful junk.Forget all the rave reviews here and skip it, unless you need some sleep.

I was looking for a 'roller-coaster' ride - but wound up with a slow trolley on a tour. Firstly, it has ABSOLUTELY nothing of what it claims - the only violent scene is when the butcher (butcher, as in had once owned a meat store) beats some broad he knocked up. . . and as for the graphic sex, well, the butcher treats himself to a movie, and that movie is porn. All the while the butcher just drones on and on about his mediocre existence and how hard life is.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is Love?","review":"If you believe in Love beyond good and bad at all, this movie is for you.What is morality? This question is the starter of the movie. In a way, it is too philosophical to go through a movie with that kind of question. But therefs no preacher, therefs just human beings living their lives quietly and emotionally like us.The story goes with empty and bleak atmosphere from start to end. But strangely enough, I ended up to sense some sort of feeling of Love. The sound of gunshots in between scenes has been haunting me. That makes me nervous, and at the same time, sensitive.See this one, you can feel something influential."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I Stand Alone is a great movie that seems to vent a lot of anger people may keep inside.

Do I have a censored copy? I don't remember a part with a warning sign saying not for people with weak stomachs to watch so what was wrong with my DVD? There was the XXX scene but whipped d dooo! I don't really care about that. Maybe I stopped the movie too soon at the end because I was bored out of my mind that I missed a good part!!

This book drags on and goes absolutely nowhere for the first half, then the \\"message\\" comes in the form of sound bites and one line rules of thumb that don't really inspire any feelings or inspiration. It seems as though it is written by an amateur writer who writes in a way that in no way represents how people, families, and friends actually interact or talk to each other.

I didn't knew they sent me the wrong size until it was in my hands here, in my country.Nevertheless, the thing works perfectly. I already bought a 1 1/2'' and it is amazing, I love it!!Those 2 stars are because now I have to wait for another chance that some acquaintance goes to the US, so as I will buy another curling iron (hoping they send me the right one this time...) and this person will bring it to me when they are back in the country... but only God knows when will that be... Damn you, Hot Tools people and thank you, by the way!SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH!! :S"},{"rating":"2","title":"beutiful results","review":"i got this curling iron 2 years ago and its still working STRONG. its works perfectly with my hair from small to large curls, you can style this however you like! i had no problem with it burning my hair off!

They dont exaggerate the word jumbo that IT IS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"smart shopper","review":"I have owned this curling iron for close to 10yrs. now and it is simply the best curling iron I have ever owned/used. It heats fast. It creates wonderful curls. My hair is straight and I tried many different brand names but this curling iron has always produced the best results for me, and I have had my hair at various lenghts over the years. You won't regret spending the extra money to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melted my hair","review":"I never write reviews but in this case I had to.I will start with bad stuff... In general the Extra Hot heat mode should NOT exist on this curling iron.... I doubt that there is a person whose hair wont melt when it is subjected to such heat... I accidentally turned the nob to the wrong side (towards extra hot). Guess what, it dried my hair to the point that it didn't curl anymore...and then when I touched, it it fell right off....2 inch long piece of a thick curl just fell right off...... I understand that I had to realize that extra hot is EXTRA hot...But seriously, such setting should not even exist..... Oh, and I did not hold it for too long b/c I didn't want crazy spiral shapes...just a little waviness.When I was trying to check the rest of my hair for melted/dried pieces my heart was racing and hands shaking.... So, Girls be careful...Overall, it curls nice, wide curls and does its job... as long as its not on Extra hot setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT really burn my hair bad.","review":"Length:: 0:24 MinsI received this hair iron yesterday and use in the yesterday evening, guess what..it burn my hair right off.I feel so upset about it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176GSAM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great value","review":"My sister had this curling iron after her hairstylist friend recommended it. When she moved out, I loved it so much I bought my own. I have very heavy, long, straight hair. This iron heats up very quickly (less than 1 minute), stays hot, and creates waves (or curls, depending on how I want it) that last and last. I get that celebrity wavy look that everyone's wearing now. This is the same price as regular curling irons you find at the drugstores, but is far superior in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well so far","review":"I haven't owned a curling iron since 1995, so I purchased this after a hair stylist recommended it to me.Works well so far. The 1.25\\" size makes more waves and end curling on my hair, which is naturally stick-straight, thin, but I have a lot of it. I can curl relatively larger sections to achieve the wave look, but if I do too aide a section, the hair gets caught in clip area near the springs and also makes it hard to turn the curling iron. I will keep it and continue practicing and I ordered the 1\\" to see if I can achieve tighter curls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice curling iron","review":"This iron does a good job for the price.

Love my new hairstyle :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Curling Iron Rocks!","review":"I have never been able to put a curl in my hair right after it's shampooed. My hair just slips off the iron & won't take a curl. My hair stylist never seemed to have a problem so I asked her about it. She recommended this iron. Right after my hair was washed & dried yesterday I used some spray gel & this iron. I was amazed! It did a beautiful job and took no time at all. I still have some curl & body in my hair today even after it's been slept on. I couldn't be happier with this curling iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"works","review":"works great i still have it 2 years later. that's all i have to say about the curling iron that is listed here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great curling iron!","review":"This curling iron heats up quickly and gives me great curls that last all day!

It only took a minute to heat up and it gets super hot! I've only used it once, but I have thick, wavy hair and it gave me exactly what I was looking for-bigger, looser curls. I'll update my review once I use it a little more, but so far the price is hard to beat and it works great. Note: They sell the same Hot Tools curler down the street from me at Sallys for $43 before tax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"Loved it. This is the second one of the same kind of curling Iron I have had. They do a great job. Just be careful not to put it too hot....I used the middle of the heat settings. I have fine and colored hair and don't want to damage it. Also be careful not to let it touch your skin. One can roll it right out of your hair without it catching and I even use it to straighten my hair as little."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"Hot Tool high Head Curling iron: Spring grip is Very cool.

I tried it and my curls were gorgeous at first, but after an hour they were barely wavy. At first I only used the TreSemme heat protectant spray, and later I tried hairspray and a curling mousse while using this curling iron at the hottest setting and holding it for 30 seconds on each curl. Even with all of that the curls wouldn't last more than an hour. This is my first curling iron so I can't say that it's worse or better than other curling irons...or maybe there's something wrong with my hair. I hope the rest of you have better luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent results!","review":"Love this curling iron. I usually use a 1\\" which works well, but I have been wanting larger curls. The 1.5 inch does just that. It makes large, loose curls. I would definitely recommend this product.

I bought this as a replacement because the one I had previously did the same thing in same amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing curler","review":"This curler is amazing for getting any look from beachy casual to spirals. It has an adjustable temperature, and it gets to the desired heat quickly. For the price, you really can't get a better curler, and it does the same job as one 5x the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest setting is too hott for my hair","review":"Good curling irons as far as quality. I bought these because I wanted to add little more body and bounce to my hair that flat irons cannot do. They don't look cheap or flimsy. I've used it maybe 3 times and am quite impressed, however, I was a little irritated by the heating preferences. The heating element goes from 280 to 430. I wish there was a lower setting than 280. For me, 280 is just too hot. I am really big on hair health and I always try to use the lowest heat setting possible to prevent breakage or damage.. Perhaps if it went down to 200, it would be better. These curling irons work very well but I am not very satisfied with the heating preferences so I will probably continue to look for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"Recently replaced a similar curling iron with this one and it is much better than the one i had before. The quality of the cord seems to be very well made and will stand up to the rigors of use. It heats up very very quickly and has dial up heat settings. Make sure you know your hair texture in order to set heat at the right temp without causing damage - temp goes from 280-430 degrees. I use 380 setting for medium thick hair. It comes with extra springs for the clamp; nice to have just in case (when) I drop it. The clamp has just the right amount of tension. I have a feeling this curling iron will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great curling iron","review":"This is a great curling iron and the price was just right on Amazon. Unfortunately, I should have gotten a smaller barrel for my hair length and plan to purchase another one at 1\\". But this is a very good tool and I bought it because it was highly recommended and I have to agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This has been approved and works well. My wife loves it and says it's amazing. What more can I ask?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I have several of these same products in different sizes. I have paid nearly double for the exact same product in local beauty supply stores. This is a great buy for the price and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 months","review":"I purchased this curling iron back in September and the power control switch broke after 3 months of use. It is a little switch that you push forward and back to turn on or off and when I try to move it to the on part it just won't activate the curling iron. I use it everyday, but hardly would consider this good enough reason for the most important part of the curling iron to stop working. I would not purchase this item again. Curling irons I have used in the past lasted way longer than 3 months THEY LASTED YEARS....they shouldn't have such a sensitive switch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I didn't get any curls from this. There were marks from the clamp left in my hair and it fried my hair into frizz. I got maybe 1 or two curls and that's after trying to curl all my hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Tools Professional 1102 Curling Iron","review":"Very nice looking and it really looks professional. Heats quickly and has several settings. The only problem I have is the stand. It tips the iron forward leaving the hot iron touching my counter. I don't want the hot iron resting on my counter thinking it might burn so I leave the wire at the end of the iron hang off the counter and it seems to balance the iron properly. It also comes with several extra springs. I've never had to replace springs on any iron and I use irons for years so I question this. There's also an order form to order more springs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to curl hair stays curled all day!","review":"I've been using this curling iron every day for the last month and I'm loving it. I have very straight hair that has a tendency not to curl easily or stay curled for very long without the assistance of copious product. The adjustable temperature makes it possible for me to set it to a higher heat that curls my hair easily and quickly -- and it stays curled all day long! I also usually have a problem with frizz, but this iron takes care of that as well. I wish I would've had this curling iron ten years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unsatisfied","review":"I bought this curler for homecoming because everyone was saying how amazing it was but I was very dissapointed.My hair didn't curl beautifully and i had to spray it with tons of hairspray for the curls to stay by the time I got to the dance my hair looked wavy, and then half way through the dance my hair was pin straight again . So Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not reach temperature","review":"After several tries, I could not figure out why this iron will not curl my hair. So I exchanged it for a new one. New one will not curl my hair. Makes curls, curls go straight. My hair is not difficult to curl, and I can make it curly just by twisting it around my finger and waiting for it to dry (takes a long time to dry, though). My old, broken curling iron that burns my fingers when I use it will set a curl into my hair that does not come out. Supposedly this one gets hotter. On a whim, I tested it with my Raytek Infrared Thermometer. The hottest part of this iron was 325F at the very center. Which should still be hot enough to make a curl that holds. Most of the rest of the wand was 285F. Since I've had it too long now to return it, I may just take it apart and see if I can't \\"fix\\" it myself. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent hot tools curling iron","review":"This is the best curling iron I have ever used. I enjoy how quickly it heats up, and the release is awesome, heating is very uniform. The cord doesn't tangle up and is the perfect length to allow for easy handling, but not get caught up or tripped on. It's a very pretty sleek looking product also, pretty and functional with the gold color. It cleans up easily, I love this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"I purchased this curling iron at a salon. Almost from the first use, I became aware of an obvious--horrible--design flaw: the handle for opening the curling iron is mostly made of flexible metal, so that with repeated use, the handle bends down until you can no longer open the iron. Each time this happens, the handle must be bent back up, which is extremely frustrating. Obviously, after many repetitions, the handle finally breaks off. I just duct-taped my broken handle so I don't burn myself, and I am now looking for another brand. Verdict: truly awful design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted Only 3 Months","review":"Bought this curling iron about 3 months ago and the spring has alreadybroken. To use it, I have to manually push it closed. The spring, which looksvery cheap, actually shifted out of place. I tried to force it back to realigncorrectly, this worked for 1 day, and then it shifted back. This is the firsttime I have bought this brand and will never purchase from them again. All the othercurling irons I have had have lasted for years and years. Can't believe this onelasted only 3 months. What a waste of money! Other posters here have also hadthe spring fail, so this is not an isolated problem. Do NOT buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST curling iron","review":"My beautician told me about this curling iron, and I am soooo glad I got it.

In the past, I have purchased the 1/2\\" because that is typically the smallest barrel carried in stock at cosmetic/beauty supply stores. I wanted to try the smaller barrel as I have very straight, short hair and wanted to see if that would give me a longer lasting lift. For some reason, this unit does not seem to get as hot as my previous Hot Tools curling irons, but other than that, I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets super hot!","review":"This curling iron gets extremely hot, which is great for curling hair fast and for hair that resists curling. Just be careful not to allow it anywhere near skin. This 1 1/4\\" size is good for making spiral curls for long hair. Hot tools products are high quality, and now come with a replacement spring (because the springs often wears out before the iron wears out)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw - lever springs wear out quickly","review":"My wife has had several of these and loves them - until the lever spring (that gives it the clamping action) fails. The spring has a little metal roller on it that - after repeated use - wears out and slides down to the base of the spring. When that happens the clamping action of the lever is gone. They maker obviously knows about the design flaw because they include one extra spring in the box. That's great if you didn't throw it out with the box and are handy enough (and have a screwdriver) to replace it when needed. Unfortunately, the spring seems to wear out after ~6 months of daily use.Like many others I'm getting tired of throwing things out prematurely so at my urging my wife is looking for another brand this time around. Problem is they all seem to be made in China - which is where the quality seems to be the most questionable. Any brand suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"I usually never do this, write reviews, but I hate this curling iron i've owned it for a week now. I curl my hair everyday and this curling iron doesn't hold the curl.

I had the exact one and was extremely happy with it for several years. The spring broke on my first one and it would no long hold my hair when I used it.

This was not a good purchase!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was excited to start curling when I read all the fantastic reviews, but my curling iron simply stopped working two weeks after I bought it. Really poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Tools curling Iron","review":"I was very disappointed with this curling iron. I've used Hot Tools before and liked them because they get VERY hot, VERY quickly. This particular unit fell apart 3 days after I received it. The spring mechanism is not designed well. Whenever there's an issue, (and I've owned at least 5 of these curling irons in different sizes) it usually has to do with the spring or the sliding ball under the thumb grip. I plan to return this unit to Amazon and get another, hoping this was just an isolated case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Tools Curling iron spring","review":"I have used this curling iron for about a year now. I love the curling iron but I am on the last of the two \\"extra\\" springs it comes with. The curling iron still works like new. I hate throwing a good product in the trash if it can be avoided. Does anyone know if/where the extra springs can be purchased? Thanks!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swivel base is awesome","review":"I absolutely love that this curling iron has adjustable heat. Also, the swivel base is great and works very well. The cord does not get tangled like my previous iron. One thing that does annoy me about this iron is the power switch. It is not a standard on/off switch. It seems like it could accidentally be turned off during use. The power switch is a sliding button on the side of the handle area. Otherwise, this unit works great and I will probably order another one should the need arise. (Maybe even the larger size!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Hot Tools by far makes the best curling irons on the market. I have used the 3/4 in and just purchased the jumbo 1\\".

Unfortunately, the thing works maybe 15% of the time. When I plug it in, I pray that the light will come on and I can do my hair. Most of the time it doesn't.

I liked it so much I bought a smaller size too and was considering buying a medium sized one. Then one day while I was curling my hair, it popped and began to smoke. It no longer works. I expect a product like this to have a longer life that the one year I got out of it. It was MADE IN CHINA and so maybe I should have expected that it was not a quality product.

It has a nice in-hand feel, the cord moves effectively to adjust to various parts of the head, and the clamp has just the right spring to it. In a direct comparison, this produces more perfect and lasting curls than a similar ceramic iron, though the cermaic may be better for your hair. I use both depending on exactly what I am trying to accomplish.Some complain it is too hot - it is adjustable heat so if it is too hot for your hair, that likely a user error. Start at a low setting and see how it does - no reason to use more heat than your hair needs!LOVE this iron!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfectiron","review":"I ordered this iron because my old one just like this wore out after several years of use.

I watched a ton of YouTube videos before using it.Anyway, it curls in minutes and my hair looks great. I would like to suggest that you start with the lowest setting and move it up if needed.

Even though I didn't expect the curl to last long, even with a ton of hairspray and all the other tricks I've tried over the years, my hair was completely flat in less than 30 minutes.

No curl, no wave. Two hours later my hair was FLAT.Maybe I'm doing something wrong? But I think this iron is just too big. I returned it and purchased the 1-14\\" iron.

I've used other curling irons for nearly twenty years for spirals, waves, etc., and have always gotten good hold until this one. I'm completely perplexed by this because I've never had issues in the past. It's definitely getting hot, but my hair comes off the rod nearly straight, and what little curl there is (when there is any at all) falls right out within a minute or two. I wanted this for body, not curls, but it doesn't even do that. And yes, I've tried adding my styling products both before and after; it makes absolutely no difference.

I LOVED this iron.... Then one day, after approximately 2 1/2 months it just stopped getting hot. I made sure it was plugged in to a working outlet and was turned ON - but nothing....wouldnt even get warm. The orange \\"ON\\" indicator light was illuminated and i even tried different temperature setings....still nothing. Debating on whether or not to buy the exact same or switch to a different brand :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"great tool!","review":"This was a gift for my daughter who loves mine (i have the same one)... it makes amazing curls in just the right size and i have even learned to do them without leaving a \\"clip\\" mark. Just make sure the stand is flipped down and away so you don't burn part of your face with it (yes, i did manage to get a mark on my forehead)...i use the hottest setting and it works like a charm...just add some beach spray if your hair is fine, so the curls stay better. Then separate and you have some awesome waves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"This iron is a bit on the heavy side and snagged and pulled my hair and left it dry dull and lifeless, i actually had parts that looked burnt and crumbled to the touch and i was not even to the extremely hot setting , this is just a metal barrel the gold blah blah is non sense, i have a paul mitchell straightner which is soo smooth and adds shine to my hair probably i ll try the curling iron from same brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"The problem with this hair curler is in the cord to the curler connection method. This is the second one that has had the same problem, intermittent power when the cord is wiggled. It may be useful for the cord to swivel around, but it is a problematic design. The end of the cord is connected to the iron using two coiled wires that tranmit power. If a break occurs in the cord inside this end then the power is intermittent. Hot Tools refuses to sell a replacement cord which would easily fix the problem since the iron is fine otherwise. Just want you to buy a new one with the same flaw. Look for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a weak and imitative pseudo-thriller.","review":"I predict that this book will sink quickly without a trace. \\"Mortal Judgments\\" (how's that for an original title) is a forgettable entry into the already overcrowded legal-medical thriller genre. It has an overly complicated and not too coherent plot with characters so forgettable that as soon as I closed the book, I had to strain to remember what I had read. No cliche is left unused in this tired plot: the mysterious and unexplained death in the operating room, the spunky heroine (who is both a doctor and a lawyer), the corpses that pile up because they are getting TOO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH. The ending is anticlimactic and rather dull, as our heroine finds herself chased by her assailants. Will she survive? This is a yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice picture, very expensive to maintain","review":"Have had PT-40LC12 for two years now and have experienced the same problems other reviewers have mentioned -- 2 lamps in 2 years at $330 each.

After a week or so, I noticed that on certain cable channels (analog, not digital) the audio was out of sync with the video. This was usually in the range of 0.1 - 0.5 second lead in the audio. Confused, I watched some movies and it did the same thing. Thinking it was a problem with the TV, I had the only person I knew with a truck drive 2 hours to my house to bring it back, we brought it back no problem, got the new TV, that person left, and the TV then wouldn't turn on. Extremely aggrevated, I called the place where I purcahsed it and they agreed to deliver a new one for no charge. I got the new one and it has the same audio out of sync problem as the original, except sometimes it seems worse. This happens on the both the HDMI, and component outputs of the DVD player (and yes I did try a different DVD player). So either the store gave me back the original, or panasonic needs to review their schematics."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!!!!","review":"Have a PT-45LC that is two years old. Have had to replace the lamp 5 times, at $300 a lamp, and now the ballast or something else is blown and the TV needs servicing. Nearly $2,000 just to run the TV for two years! We follow all the suggestions and are nuts about cleaning the filter, but the set just eats up bulbs. They last about 1,000 hours, not the 4,000-5,000 hours Panasonic claims, just long enough to be OFF of the 6 month warrantee. One lamp blew while under warrantee and it took 4 weeks for them to replace it. NICE! Unless you have money to burn, don't buy a Panasonic Projection TV. The company doesn't care about your satisfaction, and the product stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake","review":"My husband and I bought this t.v. for my parents as a gift to them for helping us remodel our kitchen. We bought it in December 2005.We are now the proud owners of the television after they received notice that the bulb needed to be replaced. Again. The first replacement bulb (7/07) set them back $450! On a $1200 t.v.! Acc to Panasonic, the bulb is now *only* $250.Bottom line: instead of forking out another $250, and spending good money chasing a crappy product, they went out and bought a new Sony plasma t.v.I'm embarrassed that I bought such a pile of junk for my parents. I stuck to a brand name because I thought the quality would be better. Boy was I wrong. Panasonic should be ashamed of themselves for soaking people hundreds of dollars for a part that probably costs them $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice tv","review":"I have to agree with the review Kiril wrote. I'm quite happy with the Panasonic PT-43LC14...I've had it now for 10 months and have had no problems. TV programs can look grainy at times, but I believe this is to be expected with a larger screen. I bought the tv for watching dvds and have been quite happy. The speakers have a bit of trouble with low frequencies in that the speakers will rattle, but I'll be buying a home theatre system one day. There are a multitude of connectors on the back, and you can even connect your computer to the tv. Great for games!I did purchase the 5 year warranty with the set, so if *anything* goes wrong in that time, it will be replaced for free! It was $475, but worth it IMO, when you consider one of those lamps are $300.

It's just a more sturdy, shinier paper than regular ones, but it can still crease and wrinkle easily if your not careful.

Tursi and her two helpers have on black yoga pants which don't contrast with the dark background, thus making it difficult to see their various leg positions.2. The music is too close in volume to her voice level (vs. being a lower, background complement), so that when she does explain a position in detail, you have to really listen (or re-listen) to be clear on what part should be where.So, just a warning to Beginners or maybe even Advanced Beginners (which this video says it's for), I think these are MAJOR issues to consider before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorcycle Sex: Or Freud WOuld Never Understand the Relation","review":"I found the book to be entertaining, educational and very easy to read.

They placed it on hold at another store branch for me and I drove to pick it up, only to find it- yep, you guessed it-broken in two pieces. Clearly this is not meant to be. On the bright side, I keep reading about other people's breaking after they've used it a couple of times, so I guess I was spared that disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken- 3 in a row","review":"My first stone broke after about 10 uses - at 450, the second stone broke after its second use at 500 and my third stone broke in its first use at 550."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good stone","review":"I have two pizza stones. One is this set by Bialetti and the other is from the Pampered Chef. Foods cooked on the Bialetti taste like the stone which makes the food taste and smell like feet. I have used it several times in hopes that this taste would end after the first few uses but it has not. I have even buttered it up and heated it in the oven to \\"cure\\" the stone but this did not help. I also found that the pizza would stick to the stone, leaving you with a mess and little crust.In all if you are looking for a cooking stone choose Pampered Chef or similar but not this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks at high heat","review":"I've had this stone for a few years and it has worked great at temperatures below 450 degrees. It discolores but that was no big deal to me, maybe that is normal for pizza stones. Today I made a new kindof home made pizza which required the stone to be heated to 550 degrees. My pizza turned out great but when I took the stone out of the oven it had broken in half (though the halves were still attached to each other)! Conclusion is that if you make the store bought pizza which only needs to be heated at 350 degrees, this would be fine but for anything higher than 400 degrees I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke almost immediately.

Just remember to let your oven preheat 15 minutes as the stone MUST be HOT for it to work right. I also love the wire lifing rack that comes with it. I haven't used the cutting wheel yet but it seems sturdy and of good quality. This stone is small and not for large sized pizzas so make sure you read the item description so you know what size you are getting before ordering... but this size is small and convenient to store. Bialetti also makes larger stones and if I decide to get a larger one I will order this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt even get to use it!","review":"Broke before I could even use it... :( Super fragile.It looked nice out of the box.

A bit of olive oil had dribbled onto the stone over each of the cooking sessions, so I figured perhaps I was being sloppy and bought another. This time, I was very careful to build up a high crust on the dough to contain the melted cheese, sauce, and oil, and it broke again during my first cooking session, on the fourth pie. I've heard cast iron ones work almost as well, one guy I spoke with swears by a terra cotta disc he got at a gardening store. In any case, I won't be buying another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived in four pieces!","review":"Pretty upset for some odd reason this review has been blocked multiple times...the stone arrived totally useless in 4 pieces!

Few months later I could not use GPRS to get to internet, same symptoms as using WI-FI. Although very uncomfortable to use AC power for WI-FI and GPRS, a managed to do it. The worst came later, after 16 months, I could not use the phone, it simply disconnect your signal and you have to wait half an hour to use the phone again and then after a couple of call, it happens again, so the phone is useless, I swap the SIM chip to an old phone I had in order to use a phone.I talked to friends who also have the IPAQ 6945 and they report the same problems, I was planning to get the new version HP IPAQ 910, but with the experience I encountered, I am considering Nokia E71 or Blackberry."},{"rating":"1","title":"GILLIGAN'S ISLAND IN THE WILD WEST","review":"Ummm...for this to be labled as a \\"classic TV\\" show may be a bit of a stretch. Now I'm operating on memory here as this show goes back some 30 years or so to the mid 1970's.Basically the show is Gilligan's Island in the west. Except rather than being marooned on an Island, it's the story of a carriage lost in the west journeying from town to town.Bob Denver reprises his Gilligan role, this time as Dusty one of the inept carriage drivers who constantly bungles everything. Forrest Tucker basically plays the Alan Hale Jr. role as the other driver and boss who is always yelling and blaming Gilligan...err...Dusty for everything.The passengers of the wagon match..almost exactly those found on Gilligan with the rich person, the starlet, the country girl, etc...I mean I guess for the price it's not a bad deal but you really...REALLY have to be a huge fan I would say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"For hardcore Bob Denver fans only","review":"I remember seeing a few episodes of this when I was nine years old --- I thought it was stupid even then. I would imagine that the core demographic for this type of show would be your younger set, so if a nine-year-old found it to be stupid, it is not surprising that the show quickly sank like a rock.Few shows were as totally derivative as this one. Everything was so obviously an attempt to duplicate \\"Gilligan's Island\\" --- with a little \\"F Troop\\" thrown in, perhaps --- that every viewer with any sort of memory would realize that it has all been done before. Even Gilligan fans found this to be stupid.I can't imagine that anybody but the most hardcore of Bob Denver fans would feel the need to acquire this.

I still have no idea what the difference is between the two versions, other than Target Earth being longer by a few minutes. Possibly the one marked (Full) is a full-screen version, but that was not clarified anywhere. My first thought when I saw there were two versions was that the one marked full might contain all eight episodes, but since it was shorter than the Target Earth one, I decided that couldn't be right.

That may be true but I'm sitting in a McDonald's in Carlsbad, New Mexico that is providing fairly good evidence why those stereotypes exist. Another criticism is that it makes all the Mexicans look like good, honest people who deserve our understanding for the struggles they endure. How dare they?

If you were raised in the past 30 politically correct years - probably not. But I won't hold that against you if you can be as tolerant with my opinions.

The first part of this film is the case. Tommy Lee Jones follows the steps of Clint Eastwood and becomes a thoughtful director for which Mexicans and Americans are people united by a border. This is not only one of the best films of 2006, but maybe the best western since \\"Unforgiven\\" (1991). It is to note that Mexicans seem to live in peace at their side of the imaginary border, maybe because of their poverty. Instead, the Americans depicted are violent and desperate, bored and obsessed with the little remains of commercialism (including sex) that reach the really deep South."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Three Burials Of Malquiades Estrada purchase","review":"Mr. Boyce,Thank you for the DVD.

In my personal experience, that view is extremely predjucial. One the other hand all the Mexican characters were presented as humble, helpful, saints -- which is a little closer to reality in my experience. Other reviews mention the theme of redemption. Yeah, you can find it if you look hard, but about 75% of the movie was devoted to showing just how badly the gringos need redemption.Frankly, between the distorted view of Texans & Mexicans, the ugly sex, and bad language we did not enjoy this movie. If you are interested in more balanced view of the individual, rough, tough, righteous cowboy, with a great theme of redemption, stay away from The Three Burials and watch Open Range, perhaps the best of the Western genre in the past 15 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reason that sequels are still read","review":"Unbelievable! McAllister has managed to write the third book in the trilogy with humour, tears and passion. The loveable hero, Noah, is a reckless cowboy who feels he is too young to be tied down by things like love. That is, until he meets Tess again, and realises that she is holding the key to his heart. He has a daughter! Soon sparks are sizzling between the two, encouraged by the young girl who had her prayers answerewd when her father showed up. The story will keep you guessing right up until the end! I promise that if you love romance then you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded Good; not worth it","review":"I purchased this along with \\"Fairy Tale-A True Story\\" assuming it would give a little more insight into the \\"Fairy\\" genre. The truth of it is that \\"The Fairy Faith\\" goes on-and-on with repetitous stories and anecdotes to the point where I pulled the disc at halfway point and have felt no desire to finish. If does have any redeeming value past this point, it would have been wise to give the viewer SOME hope.

This tape is a must for any lover of faerie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must see for all believers in the fae!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie! The movie is a documentary about people who actually believe in fairies. Some of the people interviewed have seen them and speak with them. It takes place mainly in Ireland, Scotland, & England.

I would have been better off transcribing the work on the CDs than buying the book.Frankly, I have to wonder what the artist was on when he drew this, then I wonder what the Editor was on when he _approved_ the art. I'm sorry, but I feel like I could do the drawings in my sleep. Had I seen sample pages, I would not have bought the book.The pictures do not complement the words - they detract from them. If I were to read this aloud to children, I would be totally lost trying to follow the words on the pages.My recommendation: But the CD, skip the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Past Is Watching You","review":"The beginning is a little sluggish, I'll admit. Honestly I found the bits with Columbus before the timejump a little slow, because I was so intent on reading about Hassan and Diko and family. His characters were believeable, though Kemal could have used a little fleshing out, and being asked to believe that Hunahpu was going to be a major character, not to mention a love interest for Diko with so little insight into his character was a little odd, especially for Card. But the story was well written, and mostly fast paced. The dialogue was believable but intelligent. The setting was well constructed. The most difficult part of this novel for Card to handle I would guess would have been the time observation and travel, and this was done very well. Very good book, but Card's usually excellent characterization, his main strength, was a tad uneven this time around. An overall excellent read, but use your imagination to fill in the gaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the most thought-provoking of Card's science fiction","review":"This is a superb novel, blending science, history, and emotion into one fabulous page-turner.

Even better than Ender's Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but deceiving.","review":"I clearly expected much better from the writer of the Ender series. Everyone here is just is just so nice and cold and impersonal...I mean, Colombus is a hero, alright, and all the scientists from the future are nice and want to better mankind but doesn't it lack some personnality, some drama? I admit there are good ideas and the writing is, as always, quite good, but the plot just lacks strength.Almost on of those read-and-forget books.I'll probably try Children of the mind anyway and hope that i'll be surprised and entertained more than in Pastwatch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of book","review":"I bought this book for my father (who loves OSC's works), and, after finishing it, he told me to read it.

What did Pastwatch see when they viewed the lives of Jesus and Muhammed? This book, whose entire premise seems to be religon and redemption fails to tell us. In Orson Cards future world, Christianiy is still around so when the Pastwatch organization viewed Jesus'life they must of seen he was God. Islam is still around, so when Muhammeds' life was viewed they must of seen that \\"Allah was god, and that Muhammed was his Prophet.\\" I could not suspend my disbelief after 200 pages, the situation and the technology seemed forced, squeezed to fit into an implausible plot. The Columbus parts of the story are tedious, and dreadful, you hate when they appear, as they are filled with cardboard charicatures. The cover was interesting but buying a book under that pretext well ...you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"It was ok... nothing special... though Card does have a wierd facination with his male characters' wangs ( see: Treason) all very odd. At any rate if you are of the opinion that western society is evil you will probably love this book up until a sort of secular christianity wins out then you'll probably hate it. I did like Kemal though... he was pretty cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up on it after 200 pages.","review":"This is my first (and probably only) Orson Scott Card novel, but I think he's bit off more than he can chew. To write about people who lived 500 years ago would take a lot of skill and knowledge--I was never convinced I was reading about Christopher Colombus (I think calling him \\"Colon\\" in the novel was Card's token effort for historical veracity) or Queen Isabella. But all of the characters, including the future scientists, are too transparently unidimensional, cardboard constructs who can be described in a sentence. This was simply too agonizing for me to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Card, keep your sexual fantasies to yourself.","review":"Why does Card always seem to have to include all his weird naked inappropriate moments in his books? Maybe to redeem himself from bad plots. I wished that I had not wasted my mind and time reading this book. I feel like my mind has been violated by this author. It's been a while since I read one of his books. Now I remember why.I listened to the whole book: Nothing works, unless you enjoy reading endless conversations that seem to stop time. While I was reading, I was banking on the idea that the final moral to the story would be something that I could use. I will just say that people do not become converted to Christianity simply by promising them gold and then wowing them with some magic tricks.Here is something that maybe I can use: Let me imagine that I have traveled from another time, and that I'm now living in the year 2009.

Pastwatch has a complexity, a sense of moral conundrum, and a richness in historical detail that are all amazing. As a time travel and alternate history buff, I was also pleased with how those issues were treated. While Ender's Game was great, there is a maturity and sophistication in the writing here that must be experienced. Read it, then tell your friends. Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing the past to change the future","review":"If you could change any moment in history, would you do it even if it meant a one way trip to the past? This is the premis for Pastwatch. A group of scientists using a machine called Trusite II can go to any moment in time to watch the period. These group of scientists decide to change the voyage of Chistopher Colombis to protect the natives of the New World from the Spaniards.Card deftly blends fact and fiction to write an engrossing story from both the scientists point of view as well as Colombis. Unlike many stories about accidental temporal time displacement, the characters intrude willfully. The only complaint I have is there aren't any unforseen consequences from the time displacement. It would have been very interesting if Card would have ended with a worse ending for the new world than he did because of unforseen problems. This is a very fast read and a nice job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"This is the kind of book that makes you want to go out and start reading history books because it gets you so excited about the time and the players, and Card has done his homework - I was thrilled to find a bibliography at the back.

It makes you think"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with Card?","review":"I adore Orson Scott Card so I could not wait to get my hands on this book. But when I had wolfed it down I felt utterly cheated. The theme is enchanting enough; a team of brilliant scientists goes back in history to stop Christopher Columbus. However, he develops this team using an entire crew of boring, flat characters. Card is usually a mastermind when it comes to creating intriguing personalities; not so this time. They are all brilliant and (after a few pages) almost without emotion. The natives think the timetravellers are gods and that's exactly how they behave. Never a moment doubt or real interaction; just being enigmatic and busy saving the world. Please, Mr. Card, you can do better than this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great weave of history and sci-fi!","review":"I see most of the reviews are positive but the couple that aren't mention the same thing - lack of antagonistic characters. Last I checked, there were more choices than man vs man in great literature. There is also man vs nature and that is what this is all about. Nature is personified as \\"the past\\" and it is up to the protagonists to conquer nature and change the future. One of Card's best, this one really left me pondering over the possible outcomes and paradoxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need more Pastwatch novels from Orson Scott Card","review":"I hope this is the beginning of a continuing series of Pastwatcvh books by OSC. As many others have commented, it starts out much slower than many of his other novels, but does pick up steam. There is some great writing here. Unlike others, I felt the characteristics of the people from the future were appropriate for them. And made the contrast with Columbus and the natives that much more pronounced.

The writing was good, as you would expect from Card, although almost unbearably preachy. I guess it's the whole suspension of disbelief thing - the problem being that I just couldn't.Not even in my wildest liberal dreams could I believe the premise of the story: That if someone had just loved Christopher Columbus - we would be living in a politically correct, environmentally friendly utopia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writer, so-so book.","review":"Orson Scott Card is certainly a great writer, but he falls way short here. The book starts off well enough letting us get to know a group of future historians who spend there time watching history on special machines that show them the actual events of the past. These historians believe that it is impossible for them to effect the past, but they learn that they are wrong. What follows is extremely contrived as Card suddenly decides that his ideal future is actually on the verge of a collapse so complete that society will never rise up again, and the people of the world VOTE to erase their very existance in hopes of creating a better world! Yikes! In spite of good writing and an excelent treatment of Columbus as a driven but basically good man, Card never manages to overcome his ridiculus set up. The scenes near the end are also very contrived as the characters transform to world of Columbus's day into a nearly perfect world with very little effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed unexpectedly.","review":"I expected to read an excellent book... but... after 300+ pages of reading, I still felt like the book hadn't started yet.

Maybe I was let down because I had expected something entirely different, but I don't know. There just seems to be something MISSING in this novel. It just doesn't capture the reader the way it ought."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriguing Alternative History of the Americas","review":"Orson Scott Card sets up a marvellous premise, but one not nearly as well written or thought out as his books on Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin. Still he manages to write a compelling tale about time travel intervention to create a more tranquil, fiercely independent Caribbean/Mexican state in the 16th Century that is a technological rival to Spain. Where Card succeeds is his admirable portrayal of Christopher Columbus as a flawed, yet basically, kind person interested in helping humanity. It's a pity he choose to tie up loose ends so neatly at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read!","review":"story captures your attention. He moves well between the future and the past.

Card appears to be most enchanted with the idea of time travel as a force of good. Perhaps because of this, the characters of this book are not quite as compelling as his others. Nevertheless, it is still Orson Scott Card's work. His writing and storytelling abilites (even when not his best) are far better than the majority of current SF"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Effort of Humanity and Technology to Provide an Ectopia!","review":"Card in his novel uses technology to find the roots of misery in humans' lives, using history and technology as to attempt to change them.

Since my problem is with the plot, I may be giving twists away.I don't usually like alternate history, since the past is immutable. But Orson Scott Card thinks deeply about all he writes, and I was interested in his take on the Europeans' arrival in the Americas.Problem is, we get multiple alternate histories in Pastwatch.

I use it for psychological testing that requires a silent stopwatch. It does the job great-- excellent timing, a nice hand-sized thing with big clear numbers, no extra functions to hamper trying to accurately time answers.My complaints would have to be that you have to push a little harder than I expected to make the time start/stop, and also that there is a plastic \\"click\\" noise when you start and stop, so technically it's not \\"silent.\\" In other words, the people can tell you're timing them, it's not absolutely quiet because you have to push hard enough to hear the click to start and stop it.Other than that, though, it's great.

I do get a nice tan with this product but I have to take a shower right after the tanning bed which is a pain if you have plans afterwards. If you are able to use self tanners regularly than you will be fine with this product and get great results. If you have sensitive skin like me be prepared to have to shower right after use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lotion","review":"I love this lotion.

The book contains two sections of essays, one prior to the recipies and one following. The first section of essays deals with the history of wine as food, wine as medicine, and wine in theology, all interspersed with biographical information about the author. The second section of essays, written by another author, deals with ordering wine in restaurants, stocking a wine cellar, and similar subjects. In between, are numerous recipies featuring wine in every course of a meal, along with appropriate recommendations.All in all, a delightful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I wish I had read everyone elses' reviews before buying this.

I wish the cable were about 1 foot longer for my use, but it's plenty long enough for your typical desktop application. Pulls the signal in great.

First of all, the entire beach on Ocracoke is undeveloped National Seashore, so there are no beach cottages as depicted in the book. There are also no cliffs or bluffs, as also depicted in the book. If you aren't going to be factual about the setting, you should just use a fictional island (and use a different state as well since there are no cliffs or bluffs on any part of the North Carolina coastline)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable...","review":"I hadn't read a Karen Robard's novel in quite a while and this looked like a good romantic mystery - well, it wasn't a good romance nor mystery novel.

Definitely not worth the money, so if you are a diehard Robards fan wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste time when there are so many good books out there?","review":"By far one of the worst books I have ever read, Beachcomber is unbelievable, laughable, and lame. Its characters are far from real, including a virtually incompetent FBI agent, a lawyer/ex-mob-girlfriend who is the poorest heroine I have read in ages, and an assortment of adjuncts, including the villain, who, once revealed, makes you want to grab the author and give her a hard shake - there's no way this could be the \\"bad guy\\", based on what she's written earlier in the book. Bad writer, bad editor, bad publisher, bad book - can anyone get published these days?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and $$","review":"I'm so disappointed with this book. It started out great, just like any other Karen Robards novel, but this one had a disappointing ending. I had to check and make sure it was really written by Ms. Karen Robards. And all I could say was, \\"What the heck was that??\\" I can't believe I stayed up til 2 a.m. just to get to the end of the book just to be disappointed. A total waste of time and money. ( and lost sleep)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break!","review":"Robards needs to stick with writing strictly romance or go to some sort of school to learn to write a murder mystery. Lesson 1: You cannot take a character who could not possibly have commited a murder (alibi FIRMLY established) and morph that character into the murderer at the end just for the sake of keeping your readers guessing! READ YOUR OWN WRITING!! This is not the only lesson Robards needs to learn (DID ANYONE EDIT THIS BOOK?!!!) but it would be a great start.Don't waste your time reading this book unless you want to see how NOT to write a murder mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set","review":"Just got this set and I love it! The wide angle lens unscrews into a macro lens as well (score!). Think of it as getting 3 lenses instead of just 2. Each one is packaged well and comes in a faux leather pouch with lens covers. There was also an included adapter obviously needed to make the lenses work. The only downside is night shots or in dark environments. I use these on my z650 and the light meter gets blocked by the edge of the lens when screwed in. This keeps the camera from getting a good reading and you end up with worthless shots. There could be a way around this, I just haven't had enough time with it yet to figure that out. Aside from that they are great and I look forward to getting a lot of excellent photos with these lenses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining experience page after page.......","review":"Trevor Meldal-Johnsen style of writing is one of the best in the industry.

I've tried many others out there but the remixes are usually horrid with weak vocals, out of tempo, or that incessant *thump* *thump* *thump* *thump* rattling your brain. The Healthy Living keeps pretty true to the originals as far as sound goes and extends them to around 5 minutes at three different fitness levels.

The interested Qabalist may learn new information and new ways of considering the ancient tradition of the Jews. The material on the Shem ha Mephorash angels alone is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectualism","review":"Papus writes brilliantly for his chosen audience: people who like to think, who like to develop very complicated mental maps, people who enjoy to expore the limits of the world while resting in their armchairs.What seems to be missing, in my opinion, is any sort of practical use for this information. He does a so-so job of summarizing the basic principles of the Qabalah (talking about the esoteric and exoteric aspects, discussing basic philosophical issues), but it seems to be a lot of gentleman lecturing without anything of true value to be gained.If one wants to learn about the Kabbalah, it is difficult to go wrong with Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan. The Kabbalah is, after all, so strongly located within the Jewish tradition that to extricate it seems to destroy much of the system.

There is no joking around here and no 15min epics on this disc either, this crew gets down to the business at hand and doesn't mess around. If you were at all disappointed with the last Norma Jean album \\"Oh God...\\" than this might help you get over that.It's pretty chaotic but no more than Norma Jean, Botch or EveryTimeIDie, so if any of those bands are up your alley and you dig the southern Christian hardcore, this album is for you!

This is probably the worst. The Chariot is trying way to hard to be pretentious and artsy. I love analog recording and think it is great but they do make the mixing and editing for a reason. In fact, analog recording is still used a lot in the music indusrty, its just transferred to digital, which keeps all of the good parts of analog.

It is just a bunch of random guitar riffs and drum banging. I am not into chaotic music and I can't see why anyone would be either. It has no rhythm and goes nowhere.

Although I followed the directions *to the letter*, the soup still tasted like watery, evaporated milk. Needless to say, we ate a lot of sandwiches that night.I don't get it.

After about 6 years of use, the teflon coating started flaking off so I replaced it with this model.I do not like not being able to control the temperature. I grill chicken, fish, and hamburgers on it and it gets way too hot for fish whereas my old one could be set on low and made excellent fish. In fact, I think it gets too hot for everything. Even the chicken breasts start to burn before they are cooked through. I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap version of the original George Foreman Grill","review":"I bought this to replace a George Foreman grill that I have used almost daily for ten or more years. This new version has gone the way of most other products in this economy....Cheaper parts and materials. This grill is very lightweight and appears to be made of a plastic type material. The lid is more flimsy and does not have the weight needed to press out fat like the original George Foreman grills could. Yes, it may do a somewhat acceptable job for now, but I doubt that it's useful life will meet the standard set by the first Foremans on the market. I'm disappointed that such a good product has resorted to lowering the quality of construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Foreman GRV120B","review":"This grill is basic.

Even though it has been at least 10 years since reading Look Homewood Angel, I knew almost immediately when I came to the new sections. They add a depth to the novel, bringing in the whole town and relatives, rather being only about Eugene Gant. My favorite Wolfe readings involve trains; the experience about time stopping for a moment when you look into the eyes of someone looking directly at you into the train, is exactly as I remember my earlier train rides.What are they doing now, that the train has passed?

No significance is given to any plot point or character, so I was not drawn into the movie.A group of female soldiers is different, but the script lets the actors down. Similarly, Dedee Pfieffer does not have much of a script to read, so her talents are wasted. Even the monsters are cliched.The commentary is revealing and honest.

I tried messing around with the heat dial, letting it heat up for an hour, nothing worked. I was very angered by this because it was such a great waver. I have another waver, but the crimps just aren't as large and flowing.

Also, I only had it for about 2 months, using it maybe every other week and it just stopped working. It turns on but doesn't get hot anymore. I would not recommend this product after using it.

I have asian hair that is about medium thickness. I like more subtle and uneven waves, which is why this product wasn't good for me. I have watched other reviews about this product, and it seems to work for a lot of people. I just did not like how the waves looked too perfect and even.

I have used other things like this on their hair before and they worked great, this barely made any waves and then after about an hour it just looks like frizz.It took forever to heat up but when it finally did get hot, it still did a horrible job. I would have assumed for the price it would work better than this.I do not recommend this. Try a different one.Just an FYI, they both have thick, soft, straight hair and I used small, thin sections each time I put the irn on their hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too shabby","review":"The Revlon waver isn't too bad of a product considering that it's only $20. The waver produces nice waves, but only when used with hair wax or a wet-effect spray so that the waves don't look too frizzy. The iron is extremely heavy, is awkward to hold, doesn't heat up very quickly and isn't very hot so it's a pain to hold the HEAVY iron in place for at least twenty seconds for each section to have the waves set. I have very fine hair and not too much hair, so if this iron takes a long time to do my hair, I imagine it will take much longer for people with coarser hair. The iron doesn't have tourmaline plates so your hair doesn't look shiny and is easily damaged.

The size of the waves would have been so perfect. The problem is that it never got hot enough. It would get warm and I would have VERY mild waves that would completely disappear no more than 90 minutes later. I would even use lots of extra time on each wave--if I used just the standard amount of time I use with any other styling device, it wouldn't hold at all. I also put hairspray on before I used it which would normally be somewhat dangerous with products that heated up to a normal temp and still it barely workedIt wasn't just theRevlon RV084C 3-Barrel Jumbo Waver with CeramicI had originally purchased that was defective.

It is clunky and large, the barrels are not traditional nonstick or chrome but made of a porous-looking material that doesn't allow your hair to slide like the nonstick, ceramic or chrome ones do. I have fine hair that isn't real thick and three teen & adult daughters who live at home. We all tried this and didn't like it or the resulting hairstyle at all and we all have varying degrees of thickness to our hair (all long though). The results were strange looking like you used the old fashioned hot curlers with the metal clips and they left lines in your hair. It says with ceramic on the title but this isn't like the ceramic curling iron I recently purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL Warning!","review":"So the first time I used this product the result was terrible! If you already have thin naturally voluminous hair this will NOT WORK. I started out dividing my hair and did the bottom back of my head and when I got to the top I did the first section. When I released there was a wave but it was so frizzy and puffy I looked like I had a Afro. I pushed it down put some hair spray and continued. I couldn't even finish my hair was so big I had to put a tone of hair spray and use a straightener to fix it. NOT good on my type of hair be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revlon Wave Iron Clunky","review":"I bought this iron to replace my Vidal Sassoon 3 barrel waver with high hopes of producing the mermaid-like waves i envisioned.This wave iron is HUGE. it is like a giant robot claw, except with heat.I have small hands and arthritis, so i found this tool almost impossible to use.

It suffers factually due to an obvious lack of research, especially surprising because of the great amount of material/photos that exists on Capote.

To be honest, coldwave and industrial metal are still my favorite styles of industrial music. However, I have grown to like EBM, and this is one of those bands that I consider to be good amongst the hords of EBM artist. I love the song \\"God Bless\\" that pays homage to serial killers, and of course the club hit \\"This Sh** Will F*** You Up\\". Combichrist are much more techno and trancey than early pioneers of EBM such as Front 242, and Leather Strip, but I still like the direction they went on this record dispite the techno heavy elements. I really can't say anything bad about this album now that I fully get the concept. If you don't like EBM I urge you to steer clear of this band...otherwise, I'm quite shure that you will love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor built quality, but dos his job","review":"Just plastic, poor built quality and difficult fit...but does his work.

Why? I'm not a 100% on this but it is and it dose collect dust and what not which I am assuming it's there for. Also to reduce light bouncing around on a shiny surface.

They get into rebalancing porfolios and I've read entire books on mutual funds that never talk about it. The assumption is that you start with 50/50 and 30 years later it won't still be 50/50, in which they put a little bit of light on their opinion of the subject.I would recommend the book, but not my favorite book and I would do your own thinking about reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read a different book?","review":"I hate to have to disagree with the other people that have submitted reviews on this book but...I was given this book as a present by someone who knows that I enjoy reading this kind of book.

But when you get into it you realize that the authors are saying that retiring confortably is all but impossible. They also suggest that you should count on living a LOT longer than insurance actuarial tables would predict. Their \\"spread sheets\\" are terrible.Their conclusions suspect.

The volume from the above-water speaker is minimal, and apart from that the sound is so distorted we cannot hear a thing.

There is no doubt that the original film versions were hilarious. However, the quality of the video in this particular release is so poor as to make the imagery almost unintelligible.

What happened?!","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the first season of \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", I eagerly proceeded to the second season. However, the second season is nowhere near as fun as the first. The first season episodes were made in the spirit of the good, old-fashioned western, with no deep issues to get in the way of the action. It was the sort of thing that the whole family could enjoy. Yet, for reasons that are entirely beyond me, in the second season, the writers decided to introduce a look of psychological issues: slavery, rape, infidelity, J.D.'s guilt after killing a man... Not to mention the fact that someone working on this series has a major axe to grind against Irish-Catholics. I am not surprised that the show was cancelled after this season. By the time I got to the end of it, I didn't want to watch any more either.This boxed set contains the 13 episodes of season two, packaged in slim-line cases. There are no special features included on the DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"This show was great, and should have been given the chance to develop further than it did.

It is an excellent book for experienced network planners, protocol designers or research engineers, for example, who want to move from 2G to 3G.

Although the younger child doesn't really get the games we play with it, the older ones do and we all have a great time. My goal was to get them to be active during the winter (less TV time), and this works for about 30 minutes. I only wish we had a bigger house so I could have gotten the bigger parachute. I can't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it!","review":"Got this for my 4 year old and 2 year old - they love it!

Fits into a tiny bag so it's convenient to take anywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great parachute for parties","review":"I purchased this parachute with the 6 foot diameter to use as a game at a 4 year olds birthday party. It was a big hit. We had 8 kids on it at one time. They bounced balls on the top and hid underneath (all 8 of them). They were not interested in the slow up and down and only wanted to shake it as fast as they could.It does require parental involvement for younger children, otherwise they will lose interest quickly, but is perfect for a group situation as described above.I was told by a friend to get the 6 foot instead of the 10 foot because it fits better in the house. The larger one is better for outdoors and older children or larger groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"6' parachute","review":"I gave this parachute to my granddaughter for her 2nd birthday.

The work itself is a towering masterpiece, but one would never know it from Rowe's performance. Rowe does the impossible: He makes the \\"battle scherzo\\" which requires 16 horns, 2 pianos, and organ boring! Worse, he makes one of the greatest composers of the 20th century sound incompetent! Having known (and loved) all of the 32 Brian symphonies for many years, I must say that the majority of the performances released on CD are distinctly underplayed. Two exceptions are the very fine Andrew Penny recording of Syms. 20 and 25 and the Bisengaliev performance of the Violin Concerto. This should be absolutely the LAST CD you buy for your Brian collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful gift for \\"Nana's\\"","review":"My nine-year-old granddaughter is just starting ballet, with the help of me, her long-ago dancer \\"Nana.\\" These Angelina Ballerina books make perfect gifts for her - thank you for making lots of t hem!

The story matched perfectly with her Ballernia party theme. It walks you through a typical ballet class and mentions all the primary ballet moves so the girls could relive what they experienced at the ballerina party when they read the book.

I took back and was told not only is this common (after doing more research I found many others with the same problem) that it was my fault, or as he put it \\"customer abuse\\". Closing my laptop is abuse?? I spoke with Sony and the technician even said they have gotten other calls about this.They refused to give me a corporate number where I could speak with someone just an address where I could write.

Overall, the fan is loud and it is poorly constructed. Luckily I had purchased a 4 year accidental protection plan that shortly ended in 3 years because of the cost to replace the screen. 2 screen repairs and a couple bad keyboard keys meant that my warranty was fulfilled and buying a 4 year warranty was a stupid idea. It seems any repair whether by defect(3 out of 4) or accidental(1 out of 4) counted towards your accidental warranty work. Because of those 3 manu. defects in workmanship this ended my warranty early which just doesn't sit right with me. Now I have a bad screen that supposedly has a crack that I do not see that and is not covered and they want $762 to fix it.

Wide ensemble shots are often appropriate; but whatever acting and subtler gestural skills the dancers may have exhibited, not to mention costuming details, are almost entirely lost on the viewer. Closeups last for a few seconds at most, as if the filming director were afraid of letting makeup show. This was highly frustrating to me, as both Dowell and Sibley seemed to be in good form. Even in the solos and pas de deux segments the camera hangs awkwardly back as if the cameraman were unfamiliar with the piece and fearful of letting the principals unexpectedly dash off screen. Ballet is a pantomimic art, and a good visual recording should not relegate the viewer to the nosebleed seats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glamarous as Always","review":"Of Course, the Royal Ballet is glamarous as always. This version of Prokofiev's Cinderella is beautiful to watch, as all of the dancers, not just Sibley and Dowell, but all dance with poise and such elegance that intrigues you to watch every tondue and plie that is made. Cinderella is not my favourite ballet out of all, however, this is one of the best version's I've seen. The music is powerful yet soothing, making the best mix, which is no surprise from Prokofiev. The choreography is mixed with the right touch to flow with the music. Enjoy Royal Ballet's Cinderella!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a director that does not use inapropriate close-ups","review":"This video is superbly directed: there are few head shots and few waist-and-head shots.As anyone who loves ballet knows there is nothing more annoying than the director that focusses on the principal dancer's face while an ensemble of 40 people dances out of the frame. Especially with a choreography such as Ashton's this would have been disastrous. Fortunately the director knows his job and keeps an ideal distance from the dancers. You can still see the principals while not missing any important action that goes on in the background. It's as close to watching the actual performance as you can get.Ashton's choreography might not be his best but it's still very good. The dancing is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn.....","review":"I've got to say that my daughter and I were both excited for this to arrive in the mail. When it did, neither of us could sit through it. The dancing is alternately made up of the uninspired, the farcical and the same-old. Even the score is insipid. Sorry Prokofiev, but you've done better! If you aren't looking for Cinderella specifically, skip it, there are more interesting ways to spend your time. If you are, pull out old Brother's Grimm--at least that one has grotesque going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"toy is great mfg. needs to be fired...toy does not work!!!!","review":"Purchased toy for grandson who loves James Brown toy worked one hour and stopped also battery slot was glued shut I payed too much money to have my grandson's christmas miserable....will never buy from this company again.....jv"},{"rating":"2","title":"he had a stroke","review":"My Godfather of Soul has had a stroke about five weeks into his first semester.

Excellent for more intermediate students, it is a great step up from other beginner videos, with more challenging postures. The first time I used this video my muscles were sore for the next two days, which is always a positive sign to me. If I combine both 20 minute segments I get a great overall workout, both upper and lower body, but it's also great if I want to concentrate on just one body part. I recommend this video to anyone interested in acheiving a truly total body workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO LAME FOR ME","review":"This movie was kind of lame. When I started to watch it I thought how silly it looked, but I still tired it. I only tried the sessions a few times before re-selling this DVD.

For intermediates, this may be a tad easy although still a good return to some basic positions and stretches - particularly for the upper body. The instructor (Jennifer) is quite good and the poses are shown from different angles which makes it ideal for confirmation that you are doing the stretch correctly. Also, the two 20-minute break-downs make it an ideal way to start your day with the choice of either an upper- or lower-body focus.

Ms. Hill draws in readers with the very first page...and doesn't let go until the conclusion. She pulls you into the lives of the three main characters...and makes you sympathize with all three. Even when the adultery takes place--it's difficult to find a villain in this tale. What you are faced with are just three ordinary people--with very human-like flaws.This is a powerfully written tale--of love, friendship, betrayal, and love lost. In addition to being beautifully written, it is very realistic in the sense that in life there are often unhappy endings.I've read three or four of Ms. Hill's novels..and thus far, this is without a doubt my favorite.Buy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ordinary Women my b...","review":"With friends like backstabbing, conniving Asha, who needs enemies?

It was beautifully written and was easily captivated by the characters. Right from the beginning I felt bad for Lisa, her life was too perfect and my experience is those who have perfect lives are usually very boring people. I thought Lisa was too persistent for any man let alone Ross, someone that was constantly living up to the perception of others wishes. And Asha, poor Asha. I loved her and felt sorry for her. I know someone just like her. I wanted to just give her a hug and tell it would be all right...guess you just can't do that to fiction characters.

Yes, it's a low-budget flick that features actors who are not big names in Hollywood, but the problem is the writing (flunk!), the special effects (errrr...), and the lack of any characters to really care about. Oh, the lead actress is hot. Not hot enough that one would care if she lives or dies; looks alone do not make a good actress.Had this big a big-budget picture, THEN it would have been a bad movie with well-known actors and cool special effects. That is, nothing could save this one from being lousy: they made the Titanic of all films, and down she went...Use your money wisely: buy SOME OTHER low budget bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roddy on prozac.....","review":"This movie has some interesting technology in it (the little Pippin is probably the coolest) but the story line is pretty weak. You will be left with more questions than answers when the credits start rolling.Instead of focusing on the virus, which is what this movie is really about, story development focuses on a sort of warped love triangle which the movie would have been much better with out.Also, the performace by Roddy is very sedated and comes across as unnatural and stiff. He's not the best actor so at least when he's animated like in They Live or Jungleground he makes things interesting and entertaining.The quality of the sound and video of this DVD is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Installation","review":"I purchased Wave 6 heater,heater cover and leg stands .Leg stands are nor drilled correctly to match up with with holes in heater base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heater legs","review":"The legs had been repackaged, they didn't fit as is.

One might generously suppose that this was a marketing scheme, beyond Mr Trent's control, if not for the general pococurantism of the work. This glaring error exemplifies the sense of overall carelessness in research and detail. If one desires a light read, this novel may be an appropriate choice; however, any reader with or desiring knowledge of this remarkable women, her genius and her environs should try Dr Michael Deakin's 'Hypatia of Alexandria.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I do not know who said that history does not repeat itself but has a tendancy to echo, nevertheless I think it could apply to the fundamental lesson contained in this historical novel. I did think I was getting a history book rather than a novel so I deducted one star. I am a star scrooge. I will be recommending this novel to people, nice one Brian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner.","review":"If I were to set out on writing an historical novel, I would certainly take great care to make sure that all the scant facts known to us about our given period were known to me. This is not hard; Robert Graves pulls this off admirably. As a student of the ancient past I find it hard to ignore Trent's common and irritating historical errors. Romans did not travel about on chariots, for example. Another irritating one is Trent's common reference to Orestes' having traveled back and forth to Egypt to campaign for his governorship; no member of elite society was permitted to travel to Egypt unless on official business, and at this time campaigning for governmental positions was futile as they were doled out by the emperor. They're a couple amongst many.Found it hard to get past the first 50 pages. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into this one","review":"I got to about page 70 before giving up on this one. I just couldn't get into the characters, partly because -- for me -- there was too much \\"romance\\" and too little history. Or perhaps it was merely a case of wrong expectations. I assumed, from the title that it was set in ancient Eqypt while in fact it takes place in 414 A.D., a period in which I have little interest. I should have realized that, but I have to admit I was unfamiliar with the history of the Great Library of Alexandria or Hypatia herself.I do applaud the author for tackling such a challenging topic and for obviously wanting to shed light on this incredible woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"I've only read half the book, and don't plan to read the rest. While the subject is certainly worthwhile, the execution is, in my opinion, poor. Mr. Trent's writing isn't particularly good. The characters are broad caricatures, to the extent that St.-to-be Cyril becomes a comic villain. I could picture him twirling a Snidley Whiplash-style moustache while scheming against the non-Christians. There also seems to be an obsession with sex on the part of many of the characters (whether for or against it). I won't speculate on whether this reflects the author's state of mind, or whether he somehow felt it was integral to the story. I would expect that a scholarly biography of Hypatia's life would be a much more satisfying read. If it's done nothing else positive, this book has at least made me curious about the history of the Library of Alexandria, and the librarians and other scholars who studied there."},{"rating":"1","title":"many discussions are not true","review":"This book contains some truth, but much of it is wrong. One \\"proof\\" of the observation that women's skirt lengths are correlated with the business cycle being wrong is given as women in the financial sector wear pants.Another doozy is the intentional misunderstanding of the maxim that you should heed advice of successful investors. The author says that skilled business students are not wealthy while in school and still may have good market observations.Other proofs involve taking time periods much longer than that for which the rule of thumb is intended for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Llike simple and short articles rather than a book","review":"Not a good work. The 85 axims seems like simple and short articles in any magazine. It is not a book in the classical meaning much more collection of simple thoughts not too interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting - makes you think","review":"I liked this book. It has a variety of scenarios that an admin might run into describing how someone might implement a cyber-attack. The interesting part is how each admin chose to \\"defend\\" their network, which is laid out in greater detail than the description of the attack.The fictional attacks were well written and interesting enough just as individual short stories. I learned about a lot of different tools. The stories may even hit close to home if you're an admin. They are explained very well and include a lot of code and/or information; easily understandable if you have a little computer background.I liked this book, while I was not surprised by the types (and apparent ease) of the fictionalized attacks, I did learn a lot about tools and methods for defending a network."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please DON\\"T waste your money or time.","review":"This book is the WORST book in this genre. I was so mad that I had creased the spine or I would have taken it back for a refund. Or better demanded Ms. Lackey send be 5 dollars for my time.Horrible. I don't understand all the 5 star reviews. What book did they read? Not this one that's for sure. The main character whines throughout the book like some awful emo song. Repeating the same complaints over and over again. And for a powerful mage he sure cries a lot. It is just a really bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like a theatric script about gay love, not a fantasy book","review":"This review covers all 3 books of the series.Overall I was bored and disappointed.To me the book has failed as fantasy - the world is too discrete on all levels - you only see the spot-lite of events and magic around main character most of the time without proper explanations or logical connections.The story is too jumpy, you loose important events in the characters life on day, month and years scale now and then.The language is unnatural, only good for acting on stage.Plot is simple and straight - main hero gets super powers and super friends (all granted) and goes to beat one evil nameless mage after another.So to sum up - you get three tomes of a gay love story and family relationships story. If you into that kind of stuff the book might be for you, otherwise stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful writing about awful characters","review":"This was my first Mercedes Lackey fantasy novel and it will definitely be my last! From the first page, I found her writing style sorely lacking and I wanted to slap the heck out of Vanyel, who came across as a self-absorbed, rich-boy brat. The \\"turning to ice\\" device was poorly executed and extremely annoying...almost as hard to take as the homosexual storyline that had the characters professing their undying love for one another within 5-seconds flat. About the time Vanyel began whining about being jealous of his lover's \\"Companion\\", I found that I just couldn't take it any more and gave up on the book altogether. If there were any genuinely LIKABLE characters in the story, I certainly didn't meet them! It usually takes a lot to make me stop reading a book in mid-stream, but in this case I couldn't wait to relegate this tripe to where it belongs... the trash bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was lame","review":"First of all, this book put such emphasis upon this homosexual character and they tried pass off his tendencies as an inborn thing when the author clearly contradicted themselves by showing that it was a result of his father trying too hard to push women on him when he just wasn't ready. Even if you got past this (which I managed to do), there was this \\"romance\\" that was so shallow and so senseless that it only merited as a plot device. After his power is all opened up, the most that he knows how to do is use these energy channels while his enemy uses lightning spells and he manages to defeat this enemy with a spell that he has never even used before. Very predictable and unrealistic (even for a fantasy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not epic at all...","review":"This series seems to be an effort to pander to limited audience. It is a one-dimensional marketing strategy probably developed by a 'fag hag' for the purpose of impersonating 'cutting edge literature'.ML should be ashamed to join the line of insincere authors who have jumped on the 'Rainbow' bandwagon.There are many who weave better tales wherein the choice of partner has a more profound effect than in these. Indeed, one wonders if there is truly any purpose to the authors development of her characters and world.This tale is sadly burdened with many astonishingly stereotypical approaches to the question of sexuality. For this reason alone, among many others I could reference, that I must give it such a poor rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning before you read this book.","review":"Beware of the other reviews for this book, I listened them and wasted my money. This book is plodding and completely uninteresting. How anyone can make it through this series with all the other great fantasy books out there is beyond me. And what finally turned me off completely from this book and series is that the main character, a teenage boy, has a lover who is also a teenage boy. So unless you don't mind reading about two teenage boy lovers and you don't like for your books actually be interesting, DO NOT waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel Good Claptrap","review":"The glorification of the homosexuality in this book was repugnant. The book quickly stopped being a book of high fantasy and became some sort of Larry Flynt meets Danielle Steel. Bad news unless you are after smut reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fantasy and intriguing on a number of levels","review":"The Valdemar series would be appealing to fantasy fans and horse lovers by itself, but Ms. Lackey takes her writing to serious heights by neatly weaving social issues such as homosexuality, religious prejudice, rape and abuse and political intrigue into her storyline.Vanyel, mentioned by Talia in \\"Arrow's Fall\\" finally gets his own trilogy. Sometimes comical, sometimes wrenchingly sad and always thrilling, it's a wild ride that Lackey's fans won't want to miss. Vanyel is all the more appealing as a hero BECAUSE of his flaws and self-doubt. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells high points and good things about the book.","review":"Magic's Pawn was a masterpiece that deserves attention. Some of the imagery in the novel was incredible. Lackey has an incredible imagination and she has some wonderful concepts of magic and also incorporates some true life aspects in this book. Read this one if you haven't already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Mercedes Lackey book","review":"A book of suspense and a love story. Vanyel and Tylendel's relationship is well written and the characters come to life. A must read for any Misty fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST of Mercedes Lackey's books I have read yet.","review":"This is the best book of the entire series, in my opinion. It grabbed me right from the beginning and I honestly could not put it down (I stayed up all night reading it). The characters were wonderful, the setting was superb, and the story was just out and out great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book.","review":"I myself am a gay teenage male, and one of my friends recommended this book to me as one with characters I could identify with. I most definately DID identify with the characters; Merecedes Lackey is an expert at finding easily identifiable (but not cliched) characters with which to populate her novels. The narrative to the book is very accessible, neither overly complex or saccharine simple. The story is AMAZING and engrossing, full of twists and turns. This book is not just a great story; because it features a same sex romance, I think it is also a nice piece of political statement. It portrays homosexual love in a dignified and sweet manner; a great book for someone who needs subtle education in acceptance. A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and moving story","review":"I at first did not really feel an overwhelming urge to read Magic's Pawn and so shoved it to the back of my shelf to start other books with female leads.When I finally did read Magic's Pawn I was shocked. The story is beautiful and vivid with just enough detail for me to \\"see\\" the main characters in my mind without so much detail that I fell asleep while reading about the glorious woodwork on the bedposts.This book even made me cry. Books do not force me into a blubbering mess easily, but some of the scenes in Magic's Pawn ripped at my heart. The characters became so real to me that I began to feel their pain. To me that shows the work of a master writer.There is so much that I could write about why I liked this or that in the story, but what makes this book so good is that I came away from the book happy. Not all books make me thrilled to have spent my money and time on them, yet Magic's Pawn did and still does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very good","review":"I was impressed initially with Misty's willingness to make the main character gay. That stood out the most. It was interesting to see things from a different view I guess. The pain and sorrow that Vanyel experiences were written real well, so alive it made me sad and angry for him just reading. Any fan of Misty's Valdemar books has to pick this and the other two in the trilogy. From here on it just gets better and more exciting. Plus you see the only herald to be repudated by his Companion which is way cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, though a tad too long","review":"Magic's Pawn is just a good story. I wanted to dislike it. Wanted to condem Vanyl's relationship with Tylendel. But I just couldn't do it. There was such passion in the writing, it brought me in.The book, however, could have ended about 100 pages before it did. The end seemed to drag on and on, and I found myself waiting to be over with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it away. I'd rather buy something well written.","review":"The basic plot is decent enough. But my god, the execution is absolutely hideous.The prose itself is rather poor.I apologize. I cannot back this up with a quote from the book, because I really did throw it away. Take my word that it's not well written, and that I don't simply throw away books for fun.A far worse sin than poor writing, the plot was not well executed. The biggest issue is character development; each character has such exaggerated personality traits as to make them one dimensional. They're simply big, walking stereotypes. And that's really a shame.Quality is at the level I'd expect from a bad, trashy romance novel. Of course, quite a few people LIKE bad, trashy romance novels. If that's your kind of thing, have fun. Myself, I couldn't stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picked it up because of the good reviews...","review":"I honestly don't know how it got so many five-star reviews.I somehow refrained from throwing it across the room until I had finished it completely. I found the writing style to be juvenile. I might have considered it a good first try for a budding novelist if they were still in junior high.The author used italics in nearly every paragraph for emphasis. This got annoying VERY quickly. The main character is raven-haired and silver-eyed... but at least he's only a Sue in appearance. He can't do anything right, or well, and the story is cover-to-cover angst (okay, so there was a chapter of fluffy twu wuv, which was almost as bad as the angst).The story had a lot of potential, and I really wanted to like it, but it just never got any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tearjerkingly Wonderful","review":"I don't think I can say anything that hasn't been said already. This book is one of my favourites of all time which is a hard distinction to get. Vanyel is also one of my altime favourite characters as well. Just Wonderful! Made me a Lackey fan in the space of a few hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential, but it didn't seem to reach it.","review":"The book's characters are as fascinating as they are endearing, and the world which the story is set in is similarly well done. Unfortunately, I didn't have much of an opportunity to appreciate the author's creativity because much of the story was rushed. Instead of taking her time to develop some anticipation, Lackey throws plot climaxes at you mere moments after they are introduced. Many of the events in the story were too abrupt for my liking, and I often found myself wondering if I had accidentally skipped a dozen or so pages in my reading. This quality makes for a decent light read, but I think it has ultimately compromised the development of the characters. If Lackey had not been so hurried and taken a bit more time in establishing the romances, plots, and intrigues, then the book would have much more depth and substance to it. The book wasn't horrible, but it wasn't inspiring either. I'm not sure if I want to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trilogy Ever!","review":"I can't recommend this trilogy enough. Lackey draws you into her story to the point where you become emotionally envolved. All three in this series are true page-turners. These are truly my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Not my cup o' Chava...","review":"I have to say this outright...this is probably my least favorite Lackey book of all time. the execution is sloppy, the plot is migraine-calibre illogical and most of the characters, especially Lackey's trademark, evil-for-the-sake-of-evil villains, have all the verisimilitude of a B-grade movie. a note to some who want to blame my displeasure on ...ahem, Other Things: I am not a homophobe. I had no problem with Vanyel and Tylendel being gay. their relationship just sort of seemed contrived...like one more burden to throw at our hero, one more thing to make Vanyel more alienated and misunderstood. or, the barely phesable logic in causing the sequence of events which leave him with a nauseatingly grand magical arsenal. The misunderstood adolescent plot is getting wearing after the \\"Arrows\\" series and (my fault, I will admit) every other SF book I've read in the past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This story is amazing! Some parts are so depressing I actually cried during them, others are very funny and others are so intense! Lackey is an excellent author that brings her characters to life with very vivid descriptions and characterizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is sooo Gay!","review":"The back of the book does not indicates that this is a gay romance novel. I don't care for romance novels and for gay ones even less. I read only about a quarter of the book and had to put it down. The target audience of this book is gay men and lesbians. If you are a young gay man go for it, you are going to love this book. If you are not gay don't bother with this one, instead get a good Sci Fi or fantasy novel from good authors such as Peter Hamilton, Richard Morgan, or Hinz. Are all female Fantasy writers lesbians? They sure like the homo topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Trilogy","review":"This is by far my favorite trilogy in the fantasy genre! The series is compelling and full or plenty of action, heartache, valor, honor...I could go on and on...I love this series so much that I'vebeen known to purchase the trilogy just to give to friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly self indulgent book","review":"The first few chapters of this book was actually quite promising, which was why I bought the book in the first place. However the book very quickly becomes exceedingly preachy and unbearably romantic. The interactions between the two lead characters seemed very illogical and unrealistic.When writing about the relationship between Vanyel and Tylendel, the author thens to over do it, and lay on the romance, or hurt or whichever emotion- too thickly.Tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my fave. book of all times now!!!!","review":"I loved this book!!! Before i started to read this i was already kind of use to the \\"gay aspect\\" (from reading some stories by very talented authers that aren't published and probably never will be) reading this book only help reinforced it. Where i live a lot of the people wouldn't even think people could be gay is all right but if they read this book i think they might change their minds (i sure HOPE so). This book made me cry from since Tylendel died till the end of the book. I wish that Mercedes Lackey would tell us what really happened to Vanyel and Stefen at the end of the Mage storms series and maybe even write a some thing more about them in a new book....Magic's Pawn is definatly my favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I have read since reading other books","review":"I like how Misty wrote the first of this series though I got so addicted to reading it, it was like I was starving. Anyway, to the point, I think that Vanyel had a lot to go through in his life and having these powers put into his hands helped wake something deep inside him, a caring that he never even knew he had. I am reading and WILLING to read the next book, book 2 of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was the best book i have ever read.","review":"Magic's pawn was a touching book, in fact I cried when I read it. It was so sad about Tylendal, and how Vanyel had to carry on without his love. I was shocked that Vanyel and Tylendal were gay. Not many authors go into that. If they do it is horrible. I think that Misty did it artfully. She did a great job on this book and its sequels. I only wish that she could have brought back Vanyel and his love Tylendal/Stefen(plus Yfandes of course)back in more books than just the Mage Winds Series. This is a great book, and i reccommend it to anyone with a tender heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book!!","review":"This is probably my favourite of Lackey's Valdermar series (and I've read the lot!) It has everything a great hero, tragedy, romance and the battle against evil. Vanyel is truly a legendary hero. If you've read the other books in the Valdermar series and haven't read this - BUY THIS BOOK!! If you haven't read any of the other books in the Valdermar series - BUY THIS BOOK!! - Its a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome series","review":"All of Misty's books are great.

As material on the tenor banjo can be hard find i got this and the only other one listed. Most Mel Bay videos are pretty simplistic, but this sets a new low. The only strum he shows is brushing your thumb, along with a few very basic chords (which you can find free off the web). There is nothing beyond that and nothing on the chord-melody technique that makes the tenor banjo style. Most of the time is filled by what looks like rest of his family thumb-strumming along on ukuleles to such hot hits as \\"long long ago\\" while he thumb-strums a guitar (yes, a guitar, which last time i checked was not a banjo). An incredibly lame excuse for a teaching video and in no way worth the price. The only other video i've found, by bud wachter on homespun, is excellent (see my other review).

I liked Emotional Skies, I liked Purgatory Time but then what happened? all the remaining tracks, in my opinion were crap.

A shock isn't a bad thing, by the way. Hot album! Unique voice..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic Rock","review":"This doesn't have the Alternative-Rock style sounds of KMFDM or Drill. It's very much a Classic Rock sound due to the melodic sophistication of her vocals. I doubt typical heavy metal fans would like it for being too poppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Musical Journey!","review":"Wow! I bought this album having only heard a few soundbytes of a few songs and figured why not give it a try. I had never heard of Lucia before but found her through a similar artists search from metal bands (KMFDM). Her music has a dark yet fragile melodic mix to it that is hard to compare. I am usually more a metal/goth/darkwave kind of guy, but this is beautiful. My favorite tracks include: So Clever, Fear, and Monkey Puzzle Tree.

I have not been so overwhelmed with a feeling of coming home since reading Bi Any Other Name ten years ago.This is, literally, the answer to my prayers!

But this ain't L.A. Confidential, folks - just an excuse for fights and gunplay to bust out all over. Likeable Aussie martial artist Richard Norton stars as Torrence, the beleaguered club owner who faces down bankruptcy, the Asian mob, obsessed cops, odd friends, and a jealous wife all in a single action-packed evening. (Best weird backstory: he's a former hockey player. You know, I went to a dojo in Melbourne and a hockey game broke out....) Under the Gun may be of interest if you are a martial arts aficionado and are familiar with the featured players -- can't call them actors, really, nor is acting really called for here. Otherwise, stick to Jackie Chan. Not rated, probably would have earned an R for pervasive violence and one totally gratuitous scene featuring a nude table dance (not by Norton)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling reading, Excellent historical detail.","review":"I teach high school USA History and have been a life long \\"student\\" of World War II. Both of my grandfathers fought in the war. Additionally, I read conflict non-fiction as a hobby. In the past 10 years, I estimate that I have read 200-300 conflict books. The Greatest War by Astor is my second favorite conflict book. The book begins each chapter by providing background information about the goals and strategy of a given campaign. Then the book provides first hand accounts of what happened in the battles. My 12-year-old son loves the book as well. I have bought three copies of the Greatest War this year.

What I especially like about this book is Salvatore's description of the battle scenes (although they were a bit lacking compared to the rest of his work). I just have no idea how he can be that descriptive in his battle scenes. Makes you wonder if he was a medival hero in a former life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Salvatore book that I've read","review":"I usually love Salvatore's books, wishing that they would never end.

I strongly feel that Wilkerson himself has never really been in a situation where he himself contemplated suicide. If he had, he might have approached the issue with more compassion and understanding. The book is very condemming and a person already feeling suicidal would probably only be convinced that they are a terrible person for feeling suicidal. It was very heavy-handed in its religious approach, even browbeating. I am religious myself, but I found the constant, hit-you-over-the-head style of Christian thought offputting. This book doesn't really provide insights into a person's condition, and I found it unhelpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious!!!","review":"Very disappointed.

The two workouts focus on gentle stretches and twists of the spine to help you work out any muscle aches and build good posture.

One instructor gives the cues and shows the modification while the other instructor demonstrates the perfect form that you can work towards. I've really noticed a difference in my posture, especially my lower back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really worth the money!","review":"This dvd was my first try at yoga.

He had an obscure life for the first 40 years and suffered from depression which he only broke when he found God. An awesome military strategist his elite Ironside Cavalry carried the day at Marston Moor even when he was wounded and pulled back. Many see him as a monster (\\"The Curse of Cromwell\\") for his horrific actions in Ireland. That said, his legacy increased the maritime power of England turning it into a world power many years later.

If the listeners will be more than 25 feet from the speakers, I had to turn the volume up to the point where it distorts. As a result I use professional speakers in a large room and these in a medium room. They stand up vertically on a table using built in fold out stands which are great. they require no power cord.

I wear an 8-8 1/2 with socks, and I'm comfortable in these boots in a 9 -without- socks. I've had them all of one day, and maybe they'll stretch out some. I can see how the elastic and/or the buttons would be a weak point - they seem a little dicey. If (for instance) you have boot cut jeans (wider at the ankle) and want to tuck them, the elastic has to stretch to go over the button which is just sewn on with regular thread. I don't feel any discomfort from seams, and the lining is luxurious. I wish there were an arch and a more rugged sole.

They are inexpensive and they seem well made. They are fairly lightweight too.On the down side, The faux fur is uncomfortable and sheds. I will need to wear socks with these. My legs were itchy from the synthetic lining and an oddly placed tag. The lining, as others have mentioned, does shed very easily. They also don't have a ton of arch support.I give these boots four stars because they are a cute, economical ugg style boot. For $45 I can deal with the rest. They will be good for a season. I got exactly what I expected for the money. If you are looking for a pair to last you longer than a season, I would say invest in one of the more expensive brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"love my boots","review":"They are durable, comfortable and cozy.

When I first bought it they fit but seemed a little snug. Within a few days of moderate use they were exactly how they should feel, no longer a little tight and perfectly comfortable.

I sprayed them with leather protectant so she can wear them on days with mild snow. They are fashion boots so she has other boots for playing in the snow. I like that they are high quality boots without the exorbitant price of UGGS. I did not give the boots a five because the first pair we ordered broke. The elastic strap came loose. We returned them and got a new pair very quickly. With this pair she is not undoing the strap to put them on but just slipping the boots on her feet. So far, so good.

My only regret is that I ordered the size up. I think the 9 would have been perfect, given they always end up with a bit more room in them after you've worn them around for a while.

I work in a very old building and had to deal with cold feet on a daily basis every winter. Not any more! I do agree that these run small, however. I usually wear a 9 or 9.5. After reading some of the reviews, I went ahead and ordered a 10. It is a good thing I did, otherwise I wouldn't have even been able to get my foot into the boot. For the first couple of days, my big toes did touch (just slightly) the end of the boot. Now, they seem to have stretched a bit and fit perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"I bought these boots after my favorite style of EMU boots were discontinued this year - rather than price up to UGGs I decided to give slightly lower priced Bearpaw a try. They are sized small - I usually wear 6 1/2 or 7 and needed an 8 - the 7 was tight in the arch across the top of my foot. The 8s are a big roomy in the toe but I would still recommend sizing up.

Your feet sink right into them because theyvare very squishy. They are made well with a very durable sole and so far i have not had problems with the buttons like other people have stated. The only problem is that the boots are not true to picture. Instead of buttons that match the boot there are really light wooden buttons.As for the size they fit well and not tight at all around the calfs. If your shoe sizes vary from different types of shoes i would order a size up. I am 10 in sneakers and got an 11 in the boots and they fit nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised....","review":"I ordered these boots because I was looking for something similar to uggs but not as pricey. I was very happy to find that they are very well made, comfortable, nice and warm. I think they are a great buy for the price.

I wear a size 8.5 and ordered the 9. They fit well with thin tights or socks- but not heavy socks. Tonight I walked 9 miles in them and my feet felt heavenly the whole time. Living in the Northeast gets cold and these boots are definitely up to the task of keeping my feet warm. The only con is that they are not of the same shearling quality as Uggs. Not terrible just a little less quality comparatively- as I do have pair of Uggs. That said, I would definitely recommend these. I paid $40 and I feel good about the price and quality. I bought the evergreen and it is a beautiful color and the toggles are very fashionable. Hope this helps:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"These boots are very comfortable and seem to be warm (It hasn't been very cold yet). I get tons of compliments when I wear them.

At times I do wish they were a little taller, but they are still great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wear These Around the House","review":"I love these boots! Tried on a pair in store and they run true to size for me. When I got them in the mail, I was anxious because my toes were hitting the tips of the boot. No worries, once you wear them around the fur is not as thick on the inside and they fit perfectly. I live in a humid, damp area so getting a pair of boots that are warm and comfy and keep my feet dry on the inside is a must! I wear them around the house too since I live in an old house with frigid floors. I'm also ecstatic that I have a pair of boots that fit my ankles and calves, seriously, why do shoe designers think we all have the same size legs?

I checked them out at Macy's because I wanted to get a pair of \\"knock around\\" sheepskin boots. Bearpaw's price fits the bill and I do like their version of the bailey button.

Shot entirely on video, the camera angles and lighting are amateurish (it actually looks like a film that a high school kid with his first video camera and a bunch of friends would make). The stories themselves are boring rehashes of urban legends that have been told a million times before and a million times better. The acting is equally bad and appears to have made full use of the local high school or junior college acting class (though the actor who plays the bum is actually kinda funny)Ignore the \\"awards\\" cited on the front of the DVD - I was sucked in by them, thinking that there must be SOMETHING good and/or scary in this movie. But, no. Save your money and your time. Do not rent, and certainly do not buy, this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"Since this movie was done for about a third of the budget of the ultra low budget Blair Witch, one can't be too harsh. Street Tales has its moments. The 1st story with the three little girls is actually pretty good, the acting, camera shot selections as well as the story.But there are other parts of the movie where the shot selections were very amateurish. Waaaaaaay too many wide angle shots in the last story. And whats with the shot of the hand carrying a cup all away across the room. This lasts for 32 seconds and was the most boring shot I've seen in my life.I've seen other reviews that blamed the script for the problems of this film but anyone with any ounce of knowledge in the industry knows that shot selection can kill a movie/scene just like poor staging can kill a play.In fairness, there were points where the shot selection was good and others where you wonder what were the director and camera man thinking.

The Man Called Noon (1972), with Richard Crenna.And I bought it thinking of Crossfire Trail, wih Tom Selleck, or The Quick and The Dead ,with Sam Elliott, with the usual expectations of a fine western.But the video is technically rather poor. You'll have to be a real he fan and pay the modest price asked if you want to enjoy it.An other DVD is available starring John Wayne as \\"Hondo\\" and is worth seeing [5 stars] and buying .The Duke is his usual self and the video is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"The movies look like a transfer from bad copies of a 8mm or 16mm home movies to DVD done by someone on their home computer. They obviously didn't have capability or access to do a quality film digitization from a good source -- shakey image, poor cropping, heavily interlaced, with some ghosting in scenes. The movies were heavily compressed to fit two titles on one DVD which makes the video quality even worse. \\"Extras\\" are on Louis L'Amour and Richard Crenna.

I had a VHS copy of this a long time ago, it was lousy, but I thought it was just \\"the nature of the beast\\", so to speak. I was hoping that because this was advertised as being remastered, it would be nearly pristine. Guess what? Just as lousy a print as the VHS was. I don't blame either AMAZON or the company that I purchased it through. I received it in good time and the packaging was quite good. It was the print itself that was worse than anyone could expect for a DVD. I returned it for a refund and received the refund in rapid \\"turn around\\" time. All in all I would recommend both AMAZON and the company that I purchased it from , HIGHLY. Can't expect any better service than what they provided. Certainly they had no way of knowing that the print of the movie was of very very low quality. I'm truly disappointed that some companies are purveyers of such junk.

First, it seriously draws from some writer's fancy and not from the original story. Certainly all film adaptions do this to some extent, but the 'new' information in this version either changes characters completely, or don't even make logical sense. Very poor job with the writing of this--strongly appears to be a 'rush job' done during an all-nighter by a few college students. Two, the animation and voices are simply awful. Many of the cartoons from the 1960s--ten years earlier than this was produced--are far superior. The voice talents are weak, the animation is sticky looking, and the film has an annoying gritty look to it that makes it difficult to watch and impossible to enjoy. Perhaps another attempt would be made as this story is currently enjoying renewed interest. This version has been on life-support for too long already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great anytime story book for girls.

How can you pass up these three absolute classics of horror in one DVD for this very low price. How? I'll tell you how, first it is like you've purchased the VHS versions of each film as they are extremely grainy and have poor sound quality. Next there are no special features so it might as well be a VHS anyway. Third and to me, biggest of them all, they have ruined Nosferatu, a class film from the silent era by adding heavy metal music to it!?!?!?!?!?!?!? What are they thinking, I'll be selling this DVD first chance I get, I suggest you avoid having to do the same by never purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressingly Terrific","review":"This is definately superior to any film trying to achieve the same level of realism - simply because the characters are well developed, and the storyline is engrossing rather than trying to gross you out for the shock benefit.

The gut hook is fantastic and will open up a Bull Elk with out clogging. The skinning blade has a large radius that works well. The clip point blade is just the right size, width and weight for completely taking apart an animal. The saw is the only weak point in that it is thinner than the other blades and therefore more flexible than I would like. The sheath holds everything well protected for carrying in your pack. (I don't carry my skinning tools on my belt for a variety of reasons including safety). This is not 5 star because the locking mechanism needs its own lock. If you don't hold your thumb over the lock, it will come open. Application of a rubber band (hair band from my daughter right now) seems to work, but I don't know if it will hold up in the cold.

This book is strongest up through the end of the Vicksburg campaign. The Army's progress from groups of naive civilians to veteran soldiers through their early experiences at Belmont, Forts Henry and Donelson, and the terrible ordeal at Shiloh is detailed and well researched. There is a good description of Sherman's little known Meridian campaign that foreshadowed the March to the Sea.

His use of primary source documentation, particularly letters, lends credit to his work. While many may be expecting a bland organizational look at the army with a lot of maps, Dr. Woodworth instead uses the writings of soldiers to paint a wonderful history of the men in the army from its formation through the war. While a reader may be expecting a lot of maps, page space is better utilized for telling the story, where maps can be found in good Civil War atlases.

They just rattle off about riding around St. Louis smokeing doobies. Every song boils down to that basic diagram, Which makes every track on this album sound like a filler song. Not to mention the fact that Nelly is featured in every freaking song. The St. Lunatics do have some skill, but they need to release a much more developed album.

What Federer and many of his colleagues do not understand is that we Indians do not have a distinct word meaning \\"religion\\", because our traditional \\"religion\\" and everyday living were integrated. Wisely omitted from this book were quotations from George Custer (who committed suicide at the Battle of Little Bighorn), James Sheridan (\\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian\\") and John Chivington (the minister-turned-soldier who led the U.S. Army in the Sand Creek Massacre).

In a world that is predominantly non-Christian and non-white, this strikes me as not only insensitive, but absurd.

The most important remarks are on the tables at the end of the book, where the information is not homogeneous: the units of measure are anglo-saxons for US and UK and metric for URSS (and the description in the tables are not correct). Besides the book does not deal with French artillery that was very important in 1939/40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nota Good Book if your looking for Spes","review":"This Book was ok if you just wanted to know what Artillery the Allies used.

I had four sets of batteries so I alwayshad the use of them.Unfortunately the battery in this new one doesn't come out and it is suggested that should I need a new battery I would have to send it back to the company where they would replace it.You can figure out the rest of the story.However for right now I am very happy with my purchase and I will continue using it.Its very handy for trims on my bushes, lawn edging etc.Love it!I received this within a few days of placing my order.I would do the same thing again.Margaret NJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"GS500 Trimmer is useless !","review":"You better have a strong thumb to keep the lock disengaged.OK for very light grass trimming.A full charge will last about 5 minutes.I have not been able to find a replacement/rechargeble battery.Don't buy it !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Toy","review":"These shears are way too feeble for any serious use. They cut the tender tips of the grass fine, but when it comes to the beefier, possibly wet, root area, they totally fail. The overload shutoff kicks in every 5 seconds, making them totally unusable for me. I tried to trim the overgrown edge of my lawn and I gave up after 6 feet.

The ones you pick up today only last like 8 yard cuttings before they get dull. They are very hard to sharpen with a file or dremel tool.

Not a female friendly product if there is a lot of clipping to do. You need strong fingers to keep the on/off switch depressed for any length of time. Keeps shutting off after the first sign of weakness in the fingers. They cut the tips of grass fine but to get to the bottom of the blade you have to make at least 3-4 passes. Not for the busy gardener. Cordless is wonderful -- recharges over night. Thot Black and Decker would have a much better product than this thing. Very disappointing.

The THIRD appliance works fine and holds a charge. This is too much trouble to buy 3 to get only 1 that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety is too hard to use","review":"While this is okay for light quick edging - it cuts through a reasonable thickness of grass & weeds - it is not easy turn on and keep on. The switch must be pushed forward and down with the thumb constantly in order to keep it on. Even in short bursts I still get a sore spot on the end of my thumb (forget about the ache in the knuckle). I have a friend with arthritus who can't even turn it on. My mom has an old one without the thumb safety switch and it is MUCH easier to use.B&D;, if you are reading this...PLEASE find a better switch. I've had mine for about 2 years and the already nasty switch is starting to go now. I have to jiggle it and adjust the pressure to get it to work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and weak","review":"I ordered the grass shears to use around some roses and other areas that a lawn mower can't touch and a weed whacker could damage. The shears are very loud for an electric tool and they will stop cutting when they encounter any sort of thicker grass. It is actually easier and quicker to use a pair of large scissors or small manual shears than use this product. Good idea, but far from perfected yet. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&D Grass Trimmer","review":"I know that some poeple think a 45 minute charge is not enough however this is a trimmer not an edger.I have used the previous one with great success.

You can only trim a 10 inch area before you finger starts cramping up. The safety lock has such a small hold you have to push, in order to pull the trigger, so its not like you can just turn it off and rest your fingers, you have to go through trying to push that little hold and then at the same time pull in this trigger that's so stiff and hard to keep in its ridiculous. Then to change the blade, another horrible design, you have to balance this blade while trying to get the top part on and aligned with these little cheap prongs made out of cheap plastic. I've even written them and the company's customer service sucked. I gave them one star only because they make you put something in , I don't think it even deserved that.

But I never have the cramp for long since the battery doesn't hold a charge worth a sou. After just a few minutes cutting the battery loses enough power that the blades won't cut through anything thicker than air. Now after just a couple of years of light use the battery is completely dead. No replacement batteries available anywhere except \\"authorized repair\\" shops. My guess is that it would cost as much to replace the batteries as it did to buy the shears in the first place. I'm sorry I bought these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Was impressed with item, seemed well made and durable.

The only way to get into the deep tissue is to have someone press down on the vibrator or prop yourself up on top of it so that your weight causes pressure.All the \\"thumper\\" does is vibrate. It makes you itch pretty quickly, but happily you can control the intensity of the vibration.If this was advertised as a vibrator, I'd say it's the best out there.

It doesn't matter now.....","review":"After 25 days of use, the tank started to leak at the seam. I initially called CS for Air O Swiss and they required me to jump through hoops to get a replacement. First I called CS and they gave me a RMA, CS then had me email the RMA to the \\"inquiries dept\\" to see if I was eligible for a return, I was told it would be around 7 days to get a response......yea right. I clicked a few times in Amazon and I had a replacement 2 days later with the shipping for the return paid for. I love Amazon! I am currently using the replacement with no troubles so far. 2 stars for HORRIBLE customer service from Air O Swiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated. Replacement filter expensive.","review":"Very complicated to use and replacement filters are expensive!!I would not have bought if I had know the high cost of replacement filters.Plus the Humidifer has another small part that I need to replace.And the water tower is so heavy when it is full ( the water tower is too big).Too expense and too hard to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"base pieces broke and leak after 2 years of purchase","review":"when we first got it, it worked fine until the base pieces started to chip off. they use cheap plastic for base. because the lips that hold the water tank is so thin, once it's chipped off, water leak is unavoidable. will need to check for warranty otherwise it's throw-away for the whole unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you sleep under an airplane engine?","review":"We bought this unit about 8 months ago, and we cannot sleep in the room with this humidifier, because of the incredibly loud noise it makes. We tried replacing the cartridge ($56 for a cartridge and new resin and UPS 2nd day mail, took them three days to ship because they couldn't compute why our billing and mailing addresses are different -- moral: buy it on Amazon). Tried cleaning it with the descaling stuff. Tried sitting it on two towels and wrapping it in another one. It still sounds like I'm sleeping in an aircraft hangar, except that this engine constantly shifts gears. I don't know if everyone else commenting here got the silent model or if we're just super sensitive, but anyway, if you're a light sleeper, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good with hard water","review":"We've gone through 2 of these expensive units at this point.

After 3 months it began working intermittently.Now it barely works. I can't open the inside to see if anything is dirty or something.Basically its junk now because I bought the unit at a local hardware store and just threw out the receipt about a week ago - after all - there is only one moving part - what could go wrong ?.I'll look for a different brand next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"fog machine","review":"Amazing!

Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrific customer service","review":"I purchased an air o swiss product a year ago, it worked well for one season then junked out. Obviously these products are not cheap, I figured if anything was to happen the large price tag would ensure exceptional service should anything happen. Well let me be the first to tell you that I was way off the mark. I have been fighting to get my over priced unit replaced. It has a three year warentee that the company ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT WANT TO HONOR. SO MY ADVICE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IF IT BREAKS YOU ARE SOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the high cost","review":"I've never written a review for a product before, but I had to warn folks about this one. I own three of these products and they work wonderfully (as advertised) for the first year. But they age very badly - the second year they litterally seem to fall apart (especially the new version with all the electronic sensors). Given the short life span, I'd say you're better off buying a cheaper version and considering it disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quiet and falling apart.","review":"This is a nice humidifier feature wise. Also, it is a very good unit while still pretty new. It has a mineral filter to prevent white dust production and it also has a warm mist that prevents moisture from settling on your carpet. Unfortunately, this model ages very fast. After only a month, mine started to make noise. This happens after the unit has been on for a few hours. Also, the metal collar around the ultrasonic transducer is blistering and the transducer itself seems to be corroding. Given these flaws, it's really no better than other much cheaper humidifiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's quiet!!!","review":"This is a great humidifier. I didn't think it was possible to find a humidifer that worked well but was also quiet, and this does just that -- it's whisper-quiet and does excellent humidification, with warm or cool mist. We use it in the bedroom and we don't even notice it's on, it's that quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I bought this unit last winter but by the end of the season, it was well on it's way to the grave. Despite low usage due to the fact that I only used it at night, the unit shows quite a bit of damage around the ultrasonic transducer. The gasket around the transducer has swelled up or become detached from its moorings on one side. Also, the paint on the metal collar around the transducer has bubbled up. I guess it can't withstand the supercavitation produced by an ultrasonic humidifier. Of course, this problem could have been avoided if Air-O-Swiss had simply not set the transducer so far beneath the plane of the surface of the unit.While it worked, it was an excellent humidifier and better than units that I had before. But considering that this model was very high cost and has been much less durable than my cheap Sunbeam humidifier, I would recommend people get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent or terrible","review":"Typing on a tablet, so short and sweet.Love it when it works. Quiet, produces nice mist. Own three. Two are replacements for others that stopped working after two seasons. Replacement filters and ionic sticks are about half the cost of a new unit.Third one has just stopped functioning. Air o Swiss says they will not do anything and do not have us on file. After two replacements? Interesting.Five years ago I would have rated a five but now, a one."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"I just received the product and have not used it, but I'm already dissatisfied. The ionic silver stick ($30 retail) which was supposed to come with the product was not there. Apparently they no longer include it, but didn't bother to say this anywhere. So the $110 item actually costs $140. I'm thinking about returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Very Effective.....","review":"Amazon shines again....! This humidifier has been in constant use for about two weeks now. Performs flawlessly and NOT A TRACE OF WHITE DUST. Two most important issues to ensure proper operation are FIRST - Follow the directions to a \\"T\\" and SECOND - Do NOT use SOFTENED water.... iALLERGY was the supplier and their customer service is AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Worked Great and then the Tank Started Leaking","review":"This was to be the third year of use. It worked great for the last two years. This year I used it a couple of weeks and then boom there was water everywhere. Of course it was sitting on a wooden nightstand that I had meant to have a glass tabletop made for but haven't gotten around to it. There wasn't any warning that the tank was starting to leak so now I have to not only buy another humidifier but also have to have a table refinished. I suppose that serves me right for procrastinating. But back to the humidifier. It works perfect for 2 plus years. The key to humidifiers if you can afford it is to use only distilled water. This will save you a lot of cleaning grief. Also, when I first bought this unit the tank was leaking -- wow was that a disappointment that was. The Amazon marketplace seller replaced it immediately, which was a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humidifier Bling","review":"I am very happy with this purchase. I can't imagine another unit outperforming this one.Pros:1)High design; the prettiest, sleekest humidifier you'll find. Everyone who sees it compliments me on it and it's become a very popular acquisition.2)High output: produces a thick, steady stream of humidity. When on highest setting, outpaces volume of other cheaper units.3)Great customer service: I had a hairline fracture in the water tank and the Air-O-Swiss folks replaced it within days; it was very fast service and completely hassle free.Cons:1)After 2 weeks, I discovered a fracture in the water tank causing water to leak out onto the table.2)No hygrometer/hygrostat display so there's no way to know for sure what degree of dryness you need to compensate for.3)Water tank is a little on the small side and needs to be refilled often - Very often if highest volume setting is used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great ... for one week","review":"I was really glad to have found this, even threw away our old humidifier that wasn't so great once I saw how wonderful it was. Then, exactly one week later, it simply quit producing mist. The customer service reps at Air-o-Swiss seemed hellbent on blaming me, making me waste a lot of time on the phone with them performing their stupid \\"fixes\\" (and, frustratingly, making me repeat the same ones every time I spoke to someone new). Now I get to mail it back to them with my own money (post office lines at holiday time - fun!) and do without until they get around to mailing one back. And no, they have not been apologetic in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemingly great, BUT a big hidden problem!!!","review":"I was very happy with this humidifier, quiet, low maintainence, and very effective. The problem started several months later. I found the CD player in the same room broken, and found lots of white dust inside it.

The music is high energy, with definite hip hop and dance rap influences . . . and it doesn't compromise. I was reminded of C+C Music Factory, and Mortal's \\"Pura\\" recording.

However, Ensler's text is spare and lacks focus. She tries and succeeds to personalize body image issues, but the only one I feel she deals with is her own. The lack of focus hurts the texts as there is nothing specific to center on as there is in her more well-known work. This text seems more self-indulgent than her other work, and the main thing to recommend the text is its brevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt receive my purchase","review":"I never received my purchase.

The repetitious cliches used to re-assure women that whatever the body form or shape, the body is good. There is nothing new to enlighten or educate the reader, and nothing one hasn't read or heard beforehand. Regardless of how compelling an argument in favor of an unaltered natural appearance the author puts forth, the bottom line is that in our global community looks and body shape DO still make a difference in a woman's life choices and success. This feminist rhetoric is no different than that which has been preached since the onslaught of \\"Feel good about yourself\\" books in the 1960's, 70's and 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste but it sure crumbles!","review":"We love the taste but hardly any cookies are whole.

I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens. usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them. I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like. I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately. My other son loves them too.

This item is no longer available from Tucker which has gone out of business. Using measurements from the original equipment (which had become brittle and started to crumble) I googled the data online and found this to be the only item with comparable specs. It is not a perfect fit; however, it is functional. Considering the alternative of replacing the whole unit at nearly 4X the cost of a single replacement basket, I opted for buying two baskets and saving half the total replacement cost. This extends the life of my unit for 20 years and hedges against the good possibility that even this replacement wont be around when I need the next one.

Satir and Brown present in this book the features of C++ that are absolutely essential to know if one is to understand the language: classes, encapsulation, composition, inheritence, constructors/destructors, references, and polymorphism. The information in this book is organized very well. The code snippits are short, to-the-point, and easy to understand. Also, like all O'Reilly books, the typography is beautiful and clean.

There is not sufficient weight in the base to keep the product from falling over from the weight of the handle.2. The wheels are hollow molded so they are easier to break and hence designed to fail.3. The height adjustor/edge guide is in very close proximity to the blade and not especially secure. If this ever loosened more it would be struck by the blade with might damage the motor.4. The motor is a sealed unit and there is no way to lubricated the motor bearings.5. The advertisement of use for relief cutting aroung base of trees is not exactly a genuine feature.

The handle is cheap molded plastic that is held on to the metal (amazing there is a metal part on this) shaft by a screw. Not a bolt, not a sturdier arrangement that can be tightened. The handle, powerhead, and shaft all wobble in relation to each other. The housing is cheap plastic.

See review on trimmer I posted if interested in seeing that review. Anyway, I am very pleased with the overall tool. The only part I find lacking is the edge guide. The blade sticks out further then the guide is and the blade is always hitting the walk way or drive way. Even when you adjust the setting to the least amount of cut.

Usually I do it every other time. The first time out after a long winter, edging usually takes a little longer. After that, edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"This item is a tremendous value compared to it's manual and gas powered counterparts.

Hitting the trigger 5-6 times would turn it back on. At one point I realized the machine was heating so much that it melted the cable and the negative pin was stuck and it wouldn't unplug. I forced it and the pin broke. I had to go through so much hassle to call amazon and black and decker and finally drove the machine to black and decker service center 27 miles away from my house.

I like electric as it is cleaner and quieter than gas. It is also lighter and does not need the engine work that all gas powered products need on occasion.When I tried to use it to do the heavily overgrown front sidewalk, I found I had a lot of trouble. It was powerful, and did cut, but was akward and hard to push through the heavy growth. I finally switched back to using a spade, and it went much faster than using the edger.Now I use the edger to maintain what I originally did with the shovel and it works like a charm.

I have only used this edger a few times, so I cannot speak to its long-term reliability.The Greenworks 27032 electric edger looks to be the same edger as the Black and Decker.

If I had gone to the Sears store, they were selling the edger for $109, so it's definitely worth your while to go online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for the buck","review":"I have used the Edge Hog for 2 days now and here is my review. If you are edging along a sidewalk that has never been edged before, this device will NOT work until you make a rough edge first. I used a heavy, flat edged shovel to find the edge of the sidewalk and it took a LONG time to chop away all the overgrowth and bag it (the entire length of the sidewalk). After all, the overgrowth can be up to an inch thick, preventing the edger's guide arm from finding the sidewalk's edge. After establishing the first proper edge, this device will breeze through follow-up edgings. The guide arm doesn't seem to extend deep enough for me and the blade is always sparking along the sidewalk causing you to adjust the path to stop the sparking. I think professional gas models would be heavy enough to use with any amount of overgrowth, but they are too expensive for most home users. Expect to spend hours on your first edging project. I expected edging to be fun but it's quite a project."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only a zero were possible","review":"I used this edger for exactly 20 minutes and the motor burned out.

I had a little trouble getting precision edge-lines since I was used to a single-wheel model that has been discontinued. This three-wheel model works great on straight-away edges, but is harder to use on curves. I discovered that if you tilt the edger slightly forward onto the single front wheel, you can get much better control, and the tight curves are much easier.

I have been using it for about a year now and it still does a great job. A few notes - Only use it when it is bone dry outside. If you try and use it after watering your lawn or after a rain mud will clump inside the edger and clog it up, resulting in you having to pull out large mud clumps from inside the edger every few feet. I have also found the first edge of the season, or the first time you use it if you haven't ever edged your lawn, can be challenging for you and the edger - but after that this edger can help you maintain your clean edge with ease.In the end this is an electric edger that requires an electrical cord, so I could only recommend this for personal use on smaller residential lots. However for the average homeowner this is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"No replacement for gas!","review":"I think most of the people giving this edger a 5 star rating have not had a gas edger. Coming from a gas edger I was dissapointed in the power and cutting ability of this edger.

Even the little bitty gas edger put this one to shame in power and cutting quality. This edger only cuts about 60% of the grass and the rest it pushes away! It makes the job harder to because it barely has enough power making you the operator put forth more work to get it through the grass. It does not cut nearly as sharp an edge as a gas edger either. I took mine back to Lowes and got there 5 HP 4 cycle Model 554 Troy-Bilt for $250.00 and boy am I glad I did. Effortless power, easy to start, no cord hassel, and way a better cutting job.

It really puts a nice finishing touch on your yard if it's edged. Granted you have to drag a cord around, but there is no heavy lifting, it's lightweight, and it's awesome. I end up doing all the neighbors, just because I enjoy using it. Definitely a GREAT buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work in Florida","review":"Real easy to assemble but the grass was over the driveway about three inches in places.

Not a good purchase if you have St. Augustine grass"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use, but gas edgers are better","review":"This edger is quite light so you may have to sometimnes push down on the unit to go edge through thick turf. Mud and dirt also gets stuck easily in between the edging blade and the plastic fender. Besides these problems its very easy to use, and is not as noisy as a gas edger. There is a height adjustment for the trenching level of the blade but that's useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I was discouraged from buying this at Sears but after reading the reviews on Amazon I ordered one.

And Blind Eye is a great example of why. I am woefully behind in this series, and only recently completed Blind Eye. JMW is a beautiful writer and his portrayal of a man possessed by a legion of personal demons is realistic and remarkable. I may not want to have dinner with Benjamin Justice, but I feel such empathy for him and root for him every step of the way. The portrayal of Justice's best friend, Alexandria Templeton, is just as well drawn and she is a great character worthy of her own series. The Benjamin Justice series may be too gritty for some, but the elegant writing and the gut wrenching humanity of the characters make every page worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor print quality","review":"Okidata laser printer purchase was a mistake.

Just when I was really enjoying this fabulously detailed history of Cuban music, it cut off in the early 1950s. It's not a short book, but Sublette packs in lots of history and music in this terrific musical history. Read about the major (and very minor) figures in Cuban music, with excellent discussions of innovations that bumped music up another notch. There's way too much on the front end (Phoenician music, really?), but the book really kicks into gear when it hits the 20th century. I hope that Mr. Sublette is working on the second volume of this history. As I read, I listened to the artists he was writing about. I recommend that to anyone picking up this really fascinating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves an audio book with samples of the music","review":"I have only one complaint about this fabulous book on the history of Cuba and its music: why can't this book be made in a new format - one which we can both read and listen to, so that we can hear the rhythms and music he is talking about while reading the book.

Here are some things I learned reading this book;1)Cuban music is as much a story of the fusion of Congolese and Nigerian elements as it is a story of African and Spanish fusion.2) Why African culture forces remained predominant in Cuba while dissipating in other colonies.3) All about the Abakua, Palo, Ekue, and all that.No dry history text, this is a fascinating read, well researched and crafted as a labor of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better","review":"While this was a quick read, Elizabeth Cady Stanton's bio was much, much better and far more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off with a bucket of hot water","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend and we've found that the money could've been spent better on a bucket. The problems we have with the foot bath are that it is loud, a bassy, vibrate the joists, type loud. We've tried dampening the vibrations by using blankets and towels underneath, and that works to some extent, but then you've got a tub of water on an unstable platform. This foot bath was one of the least expensive that I looked at. I have a feeling other foot baths would give a similar experience to this. If I had to do it again, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't purchase this, or any other foot bath for that matter, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed...","review":"After thoroughly researching and reviewing foot spas, I decided on this one by Dr Scholl's. It is a good size (both my husband and I use it), not too noisy, and we like that it has the option to be used cordless. However, it does not have a heater, so the water gets cold extremely fast. I have used VERY hot water and it is cold in less than 15 minutes. We were also disappointed that the rollers are so small, they are manual and you can barely feel them. If you use the gel pads, it is hard to keep them just right over the holes for the bubbles to come through. So it is an ok spa, but we're going to keep looking for a better one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"We were disappointed with this product.

That will work better than this product, and probably cost you less. The foot spa is so shallow that the water cools off QUICKLY (and you are not supposed to put too-warm of water in) and a good chunk of your feet are exposed. Add to that that the vibration is loud and doesn't really feel good, and there is nothing to recommend this product. I would much rather have a deeper foot bath so the water could cover my whole foot that I didn't have to worry about damaging (making it easier to fill and carry into position)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and no cord!","review":"I received the shrubber from ..., plugged it in for the required 16 hour initial charge....nothing - DOA.

I thought about taking it to the local Black & Decker store for repair, but the store is no longer around.

It does do a good job of keeping the humidity at a comfortable level (especially on the high setting). However, I have 3 main issues:-The unit is randomly noisy when the water is released from the tank into the unit's base. It sounds just like the office water cooler (GLUB GLUB GLUB). Because this happens randomly throughout the night, it often disturbs our sleep. You can get used to it a bit, but we couldn't get by without having another fan on making white noise to cover it up. Your milage may vary...-It says it's easy to clean, but I find it a pain.

Her heroine, Jazz, is a special effects artist (what a cool profession!) who possesses an endearing mixture of sass and vulnerability, and easily negotiates the churning waters of being both daughter and mother to her charming but unreliable art-thief father. Tony, her hero, is a macho cop with just enough of marshmallow beneath his sometimes crunchy exterior. He's tough and tender by turns, and straddles the line between the alpha and the beta male, possessing the best qualities of both. Ms. Kendall's writing style is clean, clear, and unpretentious, and FUNNY!!! I giggled, I sighed, and, at least once, I nearly cried.

And the 'saint meets sinner' theme was wonderfully original.The romance was as usual very good, the chemistry between the main characters was crackling. However towards the middle the pace just dropped a few degrees, and that could be largely due to the secondary romance which I am sorry to say just didn't work for me. Even then it is still a very good book. I loved the ending and what set this book apart was that I think empathised more with the hero than the heroine.

The ending was so over-the-top and seemed to be just stuck in the book where it didn't belong. In real life, there would be no way these two people would have truly fallen in love. I just didn't buy their deep love for a minute. I listened to this book on tape, but if I had actually read it, I know I would have skimmed over a lot of the extra fluff (and there was a lot of it).

She wasn't! She just dressed a different way and had worked hard to make herself appear professional.The best thing about this book, other than the tour of Tuscany, is the banter and sizzle between Ren and Isabel. She doesn't take his guff and he is caught by that. He's bored by women throwing themselves at him. They are a perfect match.I thought the hunt for the fertility statue could have been left out, but it did serve to introduce some delightful characters.

I was so disappointed. In my opinion, her best are \\"Kiss an Angel,\\" \\"Lady Be Good,\\" \\"Natural Born Charmer,\\" and \\"Just Imagine.\\" The sex is hot, the stories are so great and the characters are just people to root for.

Once you download this you have ruined your Sims that you have worked so hard to create. After all the frustration I have had with this game I have quit Sims for good. I would rather live a real life then be sucked into a game that wastes your money and your time. At first I thought it was great but I soon learned what a bad game The Sims is. What makes me mad is the company still makes Sims games even though they know that they cannot hold all that data. Please take it from me if you haven't bought this game don't.

The new music is also enjoyable....What I don't like is that more than one family (from your neighborhood) cannot vacation in the same place at the same time....also I don't like that your vacationing family is the only one that stays in the resort after hours, no other families stay except the employees...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Great game to pass time I have other sim games so it is fun when there is new things when you add a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not as great as the other patches. could live witout","review":"It is okay but it is not a good as the other patches.

However, with Sims Hot Date, there are too many bugs, and even though Maxis did a recent patch for such problems as Sims not being able to get off a couch after cuddling, some purchase items not being transferred, etc., (I tried downloading the most recent patch for HD, and can't due to problems with their winzip)I hope that most bugs are worked out for this program prior to release date. I think that Maxis is coming out with these additions much too fast and are not really testing enough prior to releasing-- hence, the many problems with the Hot Date program.

The Vacation pack allowes a new venue for entertainment, but, it can get boring. If you need friends for a promotion, hey, go on vacation, make all the friends you need, go home and land that promotion. As in real life you have to work to excel and gain promotions, and you must save your money to go on vacation. You can't earn money while on vaction, but you may stay on vacation as long as your money lasts. You have several choices for your vacation, but you soon find out, your family has more fun if they are comfortable and warm, so I usually start at the beach, go to the mountains and finish the vacation at the beach. Change all of your vacation sites to add espresso machines and the best beds for comfort ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game.","review":"I just got the game last night and have played it for about 4 hours. I sent my family to a hotel in the beach. It costs 500 simoleons to get the cab and around 200 to go in the hotel. Just a waring: It doesn't cost a lot of money to go on holiday. For one day in the best hotel in the beach I only spent 300 when before in my house I had saved 2,000 to go on holiday. You don't need too much money unless you spend a lot on items. you can build your own resort but you need to destory one before. I think that the game should have had another island just so you can create your own hotels and resorts. There are rather good 125 new items. There are tents, reception desks, shops, items etc. It is a good expansion and I recommend that you buy it but it is not the best Sims game existant. I am looking forward for the Sims Online which should be a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"My true opinion","review":"I see that a lot of other people have left reviews that tell of the features of the game, not what they actually think. This is an ok expansion pack, but really doesn't add anything particularly special to the game. Sure you can go on vacation, but there isn't that much to do while on vacation, I think it gets rather boring. You can even bring a friend on vacation, but can't control them so the friend just gets cranky.If you are choosing between this and another expansion pack, don't pick this one!!

I enjoy the first four very much - but this one is pointless to me.Yes, there are some new objects - and if that makes the price worth it for you, thats great. But the vacation area is a dud.I don't use it at all - it is too expensive (in Simoleans) to rely on for making friends (use hot date's downtown for 1/10th the cost). You have to have the entire family prepared to go on vacation at the same time, which is not always easy to accomplish. They move kind of sluggishly - which in one respect is a good thing. The vacation areas are too large to easily see the entire area at once, and the sims have total free will to spend money at random. I spend half my time trying to keep them from eating from the buffet at 25 simoleans a pop.I am really dissapointed in this expansion pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is really a blast. I don't own any other expansion packs for The Sims, so I can't say if this game is the best out of the other \\"packs\\", but I'm guessing it would be. In the game, your Sims go to Vacation Island and get a choice of a camp site, a beach resort or a winter wonderland. Each site has objects you can't buy in buy mode, like bathroom stalls, cash registers and half pipes. I had heard that you can't play the original The Sims when you have an expansion and I was worried I would lose all my houses and families. But, when you install The Sims Vacation it copies your houses and families onto the game. I definitely recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"the sims on the worst vacation/worst expansion pack ever.","review":"this is a bore fest the parents fight with the kids and there is just no rest for theives in the sim world. they come in many different forms, like burgulars and pickpockets. why taint a vacation with them?

That game worked ok for awhile, but then the game no longer worked, and neither do my others. I've tried numerous times to uninstall, and reinstall them, but they still do not work. What happens, is, they either load all the way and shut down, or, in the middle of the game, they shut down, and you haven't saved it yet.

But still its really cool. I heard thats theres gonna be snowboarding,fishing,camping,carnivals,suvaniers,about 150 new items,of course the beach,hotels,snowman,sandcatles,an arcade and much more! But it depends on the amount of money you have,how long your sims can stay.And Maxis still hasn't figured out if the buget money will be the same as it is at the Sims home or not.

However, this one leaves me disappointed. Perhaps I am just too accustomed to \\"the comforts of sim-home\\", and the vacation island does not fulfill my sim's needs all that well. It only took playing it twice to master it and get the special vacation award, which my sims didn't even seem to care about anyway! It takes up an awful lot of additional computer memory, and really taxes my video card's abilities as well; and frankly just isn't worth the trade off....as opposed to all the other expansion packs, which I would sacrifice even my Word program to play, thank goodness I don't need to! For a gamer that can afford to do so, get a mega computer with 512 RAM memory and sim all you want... or get a second computer, and dedicate it for your Sims!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacation","review":"Vacation is an awesome game. In my opion though, it does have some flaws. Your Sims activities are limited,So they can't swim in the ocean at the beach or go skiing in the mountains. The hotels you get to build don't look like real hotels. You can still only make two floors and their is no such thing as elevators.(Not that that really matters much)But the Sims relationships are different too. It is harder to make them like each other and it is not hard to make them suddenly hate someone.Besides that though, the Sims Vacation is really fun-you build your own resorts with like 100 new items and there's new interactions-parents can yell at their kids and you can pick how people greet, hug, or kiss each other which kind of makes it more realistic. I say that depending on how much patience you have, the Sims Vacation ( if you have at least some patience) is worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"I realy am going to be honest, this is the worst sims expansion pack.

Noticed arcing around the brushes of the motor! Took it into the garage, turning it on would not even spin any more.I was on the fence about paying the $25 for a replacement motor for this $65 blower/vac. Then I read the reviews on here. I'm looking at the Toro now! Black & Decker always seems to get me with a low price and nice packaging. With the Leafhog and Grasshog dying on me this season, I've finally learned my lesson. Stay away!Pros-The garbage can attachment is niceCons-Blade is weak, needs replaced each season.-Frequent clogs.-Motor seizure!-Black & Decker durability!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Not Buy Again","review":"Bought the leaf hog last season and it worked very well for both blowing and vacuuming. I liked the speed of it for vacuuming up piles of leaves. Also the mulching of the leaves saved us a lot of money in leaf bags. The only problem was noise - you must wear ear plugs for sure. Last year, due to the great performance, I would have given this unit a 4 or 5. This year after its second use the motor started smoking. On inspection I found, as others have, that the rear motor bearing had fallen out. A very poor design and a safety hazard! I see on the B&D site that some of thier cordless power drills are being recalled due to a switch causing a fire hazard - it seems to me that this problem is at least as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bag broke after one hour's use","review":"I just bought one of these and was using it to clean up leaves. It did a nice job blowing and the vacuum function was fine. However, after using it for just under an hour (total--that is, since taking it out of the box), I shook the vac a little bit and the bag tore at one of the strap attachment points, leaving a one inch square hole. This was disappointing because it seemed like an otherwise excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last but 1 season","review":"Thought this was a good buy for $$$- But during use the Leaf hog started having a burning odor from the motor.

It blew out this spring. I live in a townhouse and even though there are a few trees around my home, it's not exactly what you call a blower-intensive area. The little doohickey to hold the electrical cord extension was not good enough, and everytime I moved, the plug would come out, and start smoking. I guess you could argue that I could have tied the cord in a knot, etc., to secure it to the blower, but I would argue that a feature like this is one of the main features in a blower, and the manufacturer should do it right. It also didn't do a good job vacuuming damp leaves. Everything kept getting stuck. I also forgot it was variable speed because of the way the thing was contructed. By the time that I realized that I could change the speed on the blower, it blew out. Pros are that it's lightweight and easy to handle and it was easy to change from blower to vacuum/mulcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwieldy/Heavy/Jam Prone and broken","review":"I got two falls out of this leaf-vac before the little male-plastic bar that holds the fan/hand unit into the blowers female part broke as I cleared the 20th jam of the day today and tried to hook the unit back together.Before it broke...it was heavy even empty and bulky to maneuver. It jammed very easy at the narrow hole from the machine to the bag.The bag was always flying off my shoulder no matter how I adjusted the strap.I give it a positive review for the blowing action. It blows grass off the driveway and walkway good. When it wasn't jamming it sucked very dryloose leaves up. It jams on bunches and god forbid there is a little moisture on them.Won't buy a B&D; replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away !!!","review":"I had an older version of the Leaf Hog and had nothing but trouble with it. I had to rebuild the switch mechanism two times (plastic parts kept breaking) and then the motor died (bushings shot) and there were NO replacement parts available. B&D does not seem to put the quality into their products that they used to and are much more interested in selling new versions than in keeping older version in service. I am all for electric yard equipment (that's all I own), but recommend that you buy some other brand name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Powerful & Lower Quality","review":"I got it to replace the exact B & D model that died after 4 yrs. The new one isn't the same quality as the old- it lacks power although the ratings are the same as the prior purchase. Maybe B & D changed to a cheaper mfg in China or something. I'd NOT buy again, and probably won't buy anymore B & D outdoor equip as a result. Works ok, but I don't expect it to last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"This seemed a pretty economical way to deal with leaves, however we discovered that on the high setting, the motor drew so much power that its electrical socket melted down.

After opening it up I found that 1 of the motor brushes disintegrated and B&D don't sell those separately from the motor. I guess if you need a disposable leaf blower get a Black & Decker one.

Easy to switch between the two BUT the fifth time I used it the plug started smoking and had burned up! This also destroyed my fairly expensive 16 gauge extension cord. The whole experience scared the bejesus out of me. I will not replace this with another B&D product. I did have an easy time returning this to Lowe's. They gave me store credit since I did not have a receipt. Bonus...they replaced my extension cord as well. This is a dangerous product in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"BV4000 Worst Product I ever bought","review":"I'm not sure about this BV2500 but last fall I purchased Black & Deckers BV4000which is a 14amp version. From the moment I turned it on, the electric motor got hot, was making excessive sparks and was smoking. I just assumed the 14 amp motor was just getting broke in. I only used it twice last fall and put it away for next years leaves.Well this fall, during its second usage, the electric motor completely burned up and became unusable. When I purchase the BV4000, I read thru all its poor reviews and purchased it anyways.... BIG Mistake! Searching this web site, I did't see the BV4000listed, big surprise.

The Vacuum is not very strong neither and has problems, on my model the bag kept falling off by itself and the plastic tubes weren't sealed correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Design Flaw","review":"This product has several design flaws that will render it useless in a short period of time. I used the Leaf Hog less than a year before it was no longer operational. The first flaw is the cheap plastic impeller that wears away quickly when the Leaf Hog is used in vacuum mode. The more significant flaw is the inadequate means the Leaf Hog uses to secure the brass bushing that supports the motor spindle. During use of the Leaf Hog the rear brass bushing that supports the motor spindle falls out, causing the motor to seize. There is no mechanism to hold the brass bushing in place besides a tight fit into the plastic hole of the motor frame. After reinstalling the bushing, it fell out after a short period of use. I recommend against the purchase this product until Black & Decker resolves these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Burned Up","review":"I had this product for about 15 months and the motor burned up. I didn't use it a great deal either. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durability is not what this unit is famous for","review":"To the extent that this piece of molded plastic can be a durable leaf vacuum/blower, it is not. The cheap brass bearing on the motor housing eventually works its way off and with the brushes kitty wumpus on the commutator the unit starts to vibrate and growl like crazy, the sparks fly, and the smell of hot metal permeates the air. After a dozen or so uses, the twist on bag looses its friction fit and falls off the unit. The really cheap zipper on the bag....and the light weight impeller...and so on. The best part of this unit is the 12 inch extension cord.When it works it works really good but it doesn't work very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commutator end frame bushing failure","review":"I'm not that \\"enthusiastic\\" about picking up leaves from the 6 oaks on my property but I like this product overall. I've received one replacement under warranty already (a complete new one in the box)because BD won't spend an extra dollar to put a roller or ball bearing in the commutator end frame! They use a cheap, unlubricated brass(?)bushing that has worn out AGAIN on the replacement. The tool gets noisey, starts vibrating and exhibits sparks in the casing. I can replace the motor for about $22 but I find this most annoying. I've got other garden equipment that I've used for years without ANY repairs. C'mon B&D, upgrade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Money","review":"Very poor internal design of the motor.Afre two years of moverate use a brass bushing on the back of the motor worked itself loose. There is NOTHING other than friction keeping the bearing in place.I replaced the bearing on two different occasions and now it wont stay on at all. A VERY poor design...which shows that B&D; dosent care about the product. This wasnt just a simple malfunction or damage. It is a desighn flaw.As others have mentioned the impellers get chewed up quickly if you vacume up anything more dense than a twig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Bushing Design Flaw","review":"I should have read the reviews before purchasing this unit last fall. It worked well for vacuuming the leaves the one time I used it last fall, and blowing the grass off the sidewalk in the summer. However, when it came to this fall, and the leaves, this unit became useless very quickly. The rear bushing on the motor fell out causing the motor to seize. This forced me to go back to the old rake, which ended up being much faster. My belief is that it should have lasted longer than a year (actually, a year and 10 days). I do plan on replacing the unit, but I'll buy from another manufacturer that doesn't do the \\"planned obsolescence\\" thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"price is good but quality is not the greatest","review":"I bought this and spent the weekend with it. I almost returned it after I opened the box and looked at the overall manufacturing quality. I almost returned it after using it for an hour or 2. The blower function works good (that's why I gave 2 stars); the vacuum function does not work so well. The thing is quite loud too. I would be surprised if this lasts a year with occasional use. Heads Up B&D and other American manufacturers - consumers would be willing to pay a bit more for better product quality and durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw confirmation","review":"I must attest to the customer who experienced the brass bushing design flaw. Once this bushing fell out, the motor seized and even re-installing could not wake this hog up. I did not use my blower for more than 8 hours total of just blowing. I had the unit for over a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down for the count - in the first round.","review":"Burning...Burning...Took the motor apart, and I'm no electrician. My bearing looks fine, but both brushes were actually fractured. I AM a metallurgical engineer, and am not suprised at the fractures originating from the notches where the springs set in the brush...the heat, vibration, and notch all make for a perfect crack initiation site. I'll probably spend the $25 for a replacement motor, and hope for another season. Wish I would have checked out the reviews before buying it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget This One","review":"Well, the thing worked OK for one season, and then the motor started to wheeze and shreik, the smell of burning wire permeated the air, and the Leaf Hog went to Hog Heaven. Look elsewhere and save yourself some money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Desert Yards","review":"We bought this product right after moving to Arizona, before we knew how tough desert landscaping is. Out here, landscaping is rocks and colored gravel in lieu of grass, so a yard blower needs infinite power variation for strong airflow to get yard debris off boulders and stones, but light airflow not to spray gravel all over. Though this product has plenty of blower power, its blower speed variation is not enough to accomplish this. A bigger problem is the plastic impeller, which is too soft to withstand the universally sharp and sere plant debris from bougainvillea, citrus, palms, pines, pods, oleanders, etc., that are vacuumed; and pea gravel, which is everywhere and unavoidably gets into the vacuum, tears the blades even worse. The result is that after the second year the product would barely mulch or have suction because the blades were so chewed. Back home this product would probably be OK, but desert landscaping requires metal blades and an infinitely variable blower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker BV2500 Blower/Vacuum/Mulcher","review":"I've recently purchased the Black & Decker BV2500 Blower/Vac, but have only used it twice. Therefore, it's too early for me to determine whether this product will satisfy my needs long-term. Thus far, however, I can truthfully say the product met my expectations and does all the manufacturer claimed it would do. I found it easy to use and simple to switch between blower and vacuum functions. The unit is light weight enough and not cumbersome. I'd recommend this product to anyone needing it for residential use and would also recommend-as did a previous reviewer-purchasing with this product the BV006 Leaf Collection System, also by B&D, in order to appreciably speed up one's leaf collecting chores."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISLIKE","review":"Purchased this last week and used it for the first time yesterday. Seems very underpowered to me. Tried adjusting the air speed to the max and still had to almost push a small stone with the tip of the blower to get it to move. Seems like you have to be on top of the leaves to get them to move. Maybe I will try it again and have better results. I really miss my old Toro that was over 10 years old before it died. That thing was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"Very good machine after my old one this is so easy to run and to change applications. Rate it 5 starsand at a great price at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth","review":"Not worth the money or effort, it constantly clogs up, so you need to constantly unclog it. I rather rake and pick the leaves up myself, it's quicker...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blower, decent vacuumer","review":"This product works great as a blower. It saves me a lot of time because I no longer sweep up grass clippings, and it does a much better job than a sweeper. I've also used it to clean out dirt that's blown into my garage. It's very easy to switch from blower to vacuum mode. The vacuum works decently, but you have to put the nozzle directly above what you want to pick up. I was hoping it would pull grass clippings and leaves from a larger area around the nozzle. I haven't tried picking up a large amount of leaves, so I'm not sure how well the mulcher works. Overall a great product though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Parts Easily Broken","review":"I would not recommend this item. After a single use as a vacuum, the plastic housing and impellor will be damaged.Seems like a strong blower (until you break the housing or wear down the impellor with a pebble, as I did on the very first usage).B&D sent a replacement housing (begrudgingly), but refused to replace the impellor.With shipping, a new impellor is about $15. You'd be better off spending the extra money on a better blower / vac from the get-go."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blower sucks","review":"I had mine for 2 years - probably a total of 18 hours of operation - and the thing burnt itself to a crisp. The motor caught on fire last week, about 2 hours shy of finishing the fall yard clean-up. For the past ~ 8 hours of operation, the motor was getting louder & shaking more & more. Finally sparks and flames came out the side, signaling the end. I unplugged it and watched it smoke.Even when it was new it would jam up w/ mulched leaves every 5 - 10 minutes in vacuum mode, and when you switched it from suck to blow, it didn't have enough oomph to push a large pile of leaves.Although it was cheap (I think I paid $85 @ Lowes), I'm not going to buy another one. I'd rather spend a little more on something that will hopefully last longer, and won't leave a black scar on my sidewalk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Blower, but died in less than a year","review":"I bought the Leaf Hog in May 03 and used it for one season of moderate use. The blower worked well but the vacuum had problems. It only worked well with dry leaves, and then only until the bag was about half full. The impeller also wears away very quickly. In April 04, during a Spring cleanup the engine emitted a burning smell and the unit died. I took it to a service center and after a couple of weeks they replaced the unit with a new one (which now includes the attachment that connects to a garbage can). I suspect that the new unit will not last much longer than the first. I cannot recommend a product with a life span of one year of moderate use."},{"rating":"1","title":"3-in-1? Two out of three functions work poorly","review":"Overall - poor vacuum/mulcher design. If you want to use it as a blower only, then give it 5 stars. I only used this unit for half an hour before I realized that I made a mistake for buying it. On the box it specifically says that it can handle small twigs and pine cones. Well, a small twig smaller than the size of a drinking straw got caught in the nozzle, while rubbing against the *plastic* chopping blade. The friction caused the plastic blade to melt, and the twig started smoking. When I stopped the unit and opened it up, I found a groove cut into the chopping blade. Let's say that the little twig won this battle. The unit's performance was significantly reduced at this point. They should have used a more durable metallic chopper. Also the pine cones were not getting chopped, but were simply bouncing off the chopper blade endlessly, further wearing it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"This is the second B&D blower vac that I have owned. The first was used both as a blower and vac. The motor burned up after 4 seasons. I bought replacement brushes and a switch that failed(B&D refused to replace the motor). I foolishly bought another B&D blower vac (on impulse,since I needed one right away and it was the only one available at the time at my local home center) that has lasted short of two seasons only as a blower. The bearings seized. Poor quality throughout. Poor balance for holding the tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper on bag is useless","review":"This is a great product, except that the zipper on the bag continually breaks.

I complained to B&D and they sent me a new bag. Right away the new bag blew off. They sent me a new improved bag,(it has a black latch instead of orange.) It lasted a little while then poof! it went too. I resorted to modifying the bag with two bolted on \\"c\\" clamps screwed on and it works fairly well except it is no longer easy to empty. Also the high speed part of the switch is tempermental and only works 50% of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Product","review":"I have a puny yard and only use the vacuum/mulcher to suck up leaves and grass clippings which seem to get everywhere. After about half a dozen uses, it got a hole in the bag. B&D; documentation includes this whole pitch about how they care about quality and to contact them. They don't. I got the run-around. The replacement bags cost almost half as much as the Leaf Hog. That's where they make the money. I never even got a chance to wear out the plastic impeller that others complain about. Very dissatisfied.Update: Foolish me now on my 2nd Leaf Hog. I would now give this product 0 stars if possible. After less than probably 1 or 2 trash cans of leaves, the motor began to vibrate wildly, and subsequently come apart. I now have various motor parts loose inside the body.I've had similar bad experiences with other B&D; products. I'm beginning to think that they are just not intended to be used.

I now control on/off with the plug. Also, the wire attachment doesn't work for me - I tie the cords together to secure the connection.The ugly: A big piece of duct tape holding the tube extension of the blower after it loosened and fell off.I understand B&D; is coming out with a \\"new and improved\\" product."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD and SLOW","review":"Have a lawn with several 40yr old Maples, 130yr old Pecans, 150yr old Post Oaks.

Which doesn't mean that the flowers, Tucan, wedding and other designs are not equally beautiful.I was very impressed by this book and highly recommend it for the cookie-decorator looking for new ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BIg Book Of Secret Places","review":"This book tells you many ways of concealing including hiding places in house, in vehicle, and on the person. However, tools and technics of carpentry and vehicle engineering are primarily required in some advance methods of hiding because this is not a how-to-construct text.

You will get whatever flavor they decide to put in the box. I assume whichever they can't sell. The picture states lemon sublime which I thought, meh I like lemon flavoring and I wait the week it took to get the product to me and bam! banana. Yuck! I hate banana. Going to email BikeNashbar to see if they will refund, but wanted to write this review to warn others about this play of words. In my opinion this is almost false advertising. Don't put one picture on there and not give options to pick your flavor. If you want to sell the stuff you can't sell in the store at least tell people which flavor it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap didn't even work!!!","review":"omg!!! a total waste of money!!! i received d game and it didn't even work in my PS2,damn disc was FAKE!!!

I already owned the modernized edition edited by the late Nevill Coghill, but I figured: Hey, I'm in Canterbury--I have to buy a copy. So I bought this one.For starters, this is the complete text of the Tales, and it is in the original Middle English. While the language may take a while to get used to (for beginners, especially) it's a blast to read. Another plus for this edition is the heavy, heavy glossing and a really extensive notes section which helped even an experienced reader of Chaucer like myself.If you're new to Chaucer, or even if you're not, this is the edition to have. It's a paperback, so it's portable, and it's complete. You won't be left wanting an odd tale or two with this book.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"The book was in okay condition.

With a great band like this I would hope to see the band play together, the interaction between players is part of what makes a classic band so fascinating. The camera never gets past the head shot and mostly focuses on teeth. The filming is so inconsistent with the music that it is an agony to watch. Wouldn't you like to watch Eric Clapton play his guitar? So would I. Don't expect to on this one. The only solo shot of him is filmed from behind. Like to watch Ginger Baker play a set of drums? Don't expect to see more than him grimace with an occasional corner of a cymbal vibrate by. Jack Bruce is a great singer but his profile is the major visual. Save your money, buy the CDs,listen to the music, this DVD can drive you crazy it is so badly filmed. Hopefully there is some archived film out there, that will allow us to watch Cream perform as a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprising Excellent Video","review":"I was surprised to see this video in a record store last year because it's rare to find Cream videos anywhere.

The thing that struck me about her the moment I heard her was that the songs have the sound of a live night club performance, with only guitar and sometimes only base accompanying her. Without a lot of back up you can't have a weak voice. She doesn't. You get the feeling she could deliver a song well with no back up music at all. The songs are lovely old ballads with a nice light jazz feeling to them, similar to July London's style but with much sronger vocals. Great guitar and bass playing on it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent broken item","review":"After a long struggle to get the item I ordered it arrived and broke when i put it in reverse.

Love is blind, and many parents chose to believe their offspring are capable, wise-beyond-their-years, little darlings.In this book, Doris and Natalie's mission is to destroy the notion of the \\"perfect kid\\" and annoy those who have been content in their denial. What is pleasurable, however, is the author's willingness to provide this service in a candid, unpretentious, humorous fashion. There is excellent advice on how to take the blinder's off and become active in your child's life. For any and all parents of pre-adult children, it is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book about modern teens I've ever read","review":"This book is terrific. Fascinating, provocative, funny, entertaining, wise.I couldn't put it down. The alternating voices of mother and daughter give it a liveliness and an energy that captivated me utterly. This is stuff for which all moms (in particular) should have an inexhaustible appetite.The authors do a sensitive and compelling job of communicating the drawbacks of many of the questionable behaviors that are discussed.

At school, my teacher had given the topic that we must discuss: what's the most important, money or happiness? I know money is very important, but we can't lose our priciples for it. Now I have a boyfriend ,he isn't very rich ,and you can say he's poor, but I love him ,I'll be with him forever wherever he is. I think it's happiest time when you have love. I'm not very great, I'm only an ordinary chinese woman, and I know my life only have once. I'll treat the life with my soul and my heart like Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit in the Sky by Norman Greenbaum","review":"Many pronouncements have been made as to the 'Christian' theme of this song as penned by a non-Christian writer. But right from the beginning, the lyric \\"...never been a sinner, I never sinned...\\" -- is not a Christian theme. That would be the opposite of a Christian theme. Based on explanations offered by the author, it seems more a case of unfamiliarity with Christian dogma than an outright spoof. Regardless, it's one of rock music's greatest classics, with a guitar line that's right up there with 'Satisfaction' and 'Money For Nothing' as some of the best I've ever heard. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit in the Sky","review":"I liked especially the background music in the song \\"Spirit in the Sky\\". Interesting lyrics to most of the songs.

I really enjoyed playing it, although I never made it past 8,000! And as far as people saying that after playing so much you start getting repeat cards, well sorry but that is with any game. There are only so many cards that come with the game, so pace yourself, or buy lots of games and alternate, that is what I do. That way even if we would get repeats, we wouldn't remember the answer because it was so long ago. I cannot stress this point strongly enough...no matter what game you buy that has cards, eventually you will get repeats. I don't think that is a reason to dislike a game, but okay. Anyhow, good game, worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Board Game is fabulous in all aspects. The great price, the endless amount of questions, the quality of the gameplay, and the overall family fun. The only complaint is some questions are out of place, for example, several $500 dollars questions were hard enough to be around $4000 or $8000, while there were several $2000 to $8000 questions that should have been lower. But this is only minor considering how many questions there are and most of them are excellent questions. The game is great to play everyone on their own all at once, or everyone together teaming up to get the million bucks. Fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute simulation of the game show","review":"If you have never seen the show, don't get this.

Nevertheless, a great game for passing time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Answers","review":"I was looking forward to playing this game when I received it for Christmas.

I won't play it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This game was REALLY disappointing. We will use the cards to ask trivia questions, but it is really not fun. Your lifelines are limited to the people you are playing with/against. The kids did not have fun. Neither did the parents.

Again. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for.","review":"I got this game to use in play therapy with older kids (12-14), but found too many of the questions were too outdated. Also, there simply aren't enough questions. If you were to play this just a few times, you'd have learned all the answers. The money is flimsy (what else!)and a pain to manage in a short time. This might be fun for adults, but didn't hit what I was aiming for with the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the TV show","review":"I bought this game for my mother who lives in a long term care facility. The senior citizens play this game at least once a week, if not more frequenty. They love it. There are a ton of question cards which is nice if you plan to play a game a lot. The only thing I personally don't like about it is that unlike Trivial Pursuit (which lasts forever) this trivia game doesn't last long enough for my tastes. Still, the question cards are even good for long car rides. This is a good buy for fans of the show and trivia buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother stick to the TV Show","review":"I tried to play this game with friends after a dinner party.

The book follows the CPLR generally, pulls in appropriate court-made rules and references important procedural provisions of the Court Acts. It is written in a practical and conversational style infrequently encountered in legal writing. The authoritativeness of the book, despite its readability, is reflected in the numerous cites to the text in the opinions of the courts of New York, and beyond. As a law clerk, I refer to the book often."},{"rating":"2","title":"NYS practice primer.","review":"Very useful as fundamental overview or refresher of NYS practice protocols with due emphasis on the prevalence and application of the CPLR in civil litigation, as well as how that omnibus statute is adjusted by or supersedes case law. Siegel is clear for the most part (though the syntax can be eccentric at times - his publications have their own style as readers of the NYS Law Digest know) and focuses on actual case prosecution in the court system, particularly in NYS's four leading judicial departments (1-4, of course). Consider carefully whether the sections omitted from the student handbook make the practitioner's volume a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"The audiobook was labeled \\"very good\\"condition.

I get confused when there are too many characters. I was able to keep track, but just barely, and I must say that the story is brilliant, as I've decided Stout's stories consistently are. Stout pulls in the news of the time, and I loved that because I'm an old gal who grew up in the '60s and '70s. All those radicals and precursors to today's terrorist make good fodder for mysteries. So, enjoy, but expect to have to keep track of who is who a little more than you might like to."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cannot believe I am about to say that","review":"But as far as Nero Wolfe mysteries go, this one was not the most enjoyable for me. Oh Archie is still in top form and their banter is as enjoyable as ever. It is also interesting to watch how historical setting changes around them in the later books, but the conclusion of this one was dissappointing to me in a sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"One-seventh of a ton of intrigue and fun","review":"If you've not yet met Nero Wolfe, you are in for a treat as this crusty, corpulent detective takes on yet another murder case. Rex Stout is a master of prose and the English language, and Michael Prichard adds just the right touch of accents and inflection to enrich without distraction.The only downside? When reading a Rex Stout book, it's easy to flip back and reread the truly great lines.

It seemed to work fine at first but, the only issue I have with it is the string. When the last of the string is gone, you have to take a spool of string purchased and pull enough string for this edger and wrap around the spool. The problem is that when you place the cap back on to keep the spool in place, it sometimes pops off when you press the trigger. Once or twice the spool cap popped off and struck me in the face. It was a good thing I was wearing eye and face protection. Don't ever operate one of these edgers without face protection. When the strong hits rocks they go flying.

Not that they are ordinary, but they're *real.*But like others of her books, there is just one note in the core relationship: Drew and Sean are drawn to each other immediately and only one thing separates them. It takes 250 pages to work through the one issue. It's realistically handled but if it weren't for a side plot with Sean's sister, this novel would have been 100 pages. In many ways, the side plot drove the action, not the main plot. Also, while Drew and Sean seem very real, there are a few characters who are just too wise, too calm, too good to be true.It's a small quibble because basically this is an enjoyable solid romance easily worth the time and money. The sex scenes are warming, the dialogue engaging.

I found Drew to be another one of Rad's tortured dark heroines with post-traumatic stress syndrome (and she's done that before, in nearly every book) while Sean was cloyingly sweet and -- for a therapist -- annoyingly angst-ridden about the slightest little things. For someone who should know better, playing the sad stoic was her only way to deal with her problems.I totally agree that Rad's writing just gets better, and there is a lot of sexual heat in the book that was good. It's just I've read this general story before from Rad.

They have never really been given their due - mainly because of their looks and the fact that most critics are horribly bitter musician-wannabes that don't have what it takes to make it in the music business.You will not be disappointed by any of these tracks. This is the first rock act to produce 12-inch single versions of songs on a regular basis. Everyone else followed them! And they did it the hard way - by actually re-recording a different version in most cases - e.g. Union of the Snake (Monkey Mix), they merely didn't get some remix engineer to cut it up and re-arrange it. The b-sides are also classics. They don't produce fillers for the b-sides like 90% of other acts out there. Secret Oktober is my personal favourite!Buy it and rejoice Duran Duran!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Singles as they should be","review":"I absolutely love this collection!

I have this box since septembre 2003(9 months), and it is starting to lose its colour. That's a shame because this box is cool. The other thing is the price.

These songs provide a great example of the vocal ability that Meredith Edwards has, and also gives a sense of what type of music is on the album. It is real life topics- happy, sad, and everything in between. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MEREDITH EDWARD'S CD \\"REACH.\\" Give this incredibly talented new comer a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are you?????","review":"With a debut album like this, you would expect something else from such a wonderful talent. Is this the album of the year? No, but it has such great tunes and lyrics that it could have been a contender fro best new artist atleast.I like buying albums that I can listen to all the way through... This was one of them that pleased me! \\"This is the Heartache\\" is a wonderful song! Also, \\"Places in the Heart\\" is great along with \\"Ready to Fall\\". \\"Reach\\" standsout but the whole album is just great.

Unfortunately, such anger tends to detract from objective works. While Reimann provides good biographical data on Goebbels, he too often leaves objective study for opinionating which some readers may not find of great interest. As a consequence, this is not a sufficient biography on Goebbels, forcing readers to consult other books. While the work provides some info on Goebbels personal life, it tends to concentrate on his professional career. For example, while Goebbels diary constantly mentions one Ursel Quandt, the name does not appear in Reimann's book. Worth reading, but understand that the book is quite often a platform for Reimann to attack those who persecuted him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vicious Pink","review":"Worth three or four times the price for \\"Take Me Now\\" alone.

The original Gumby show created by Clokey in 1950s featured a beautiful orchestral soundtrack matching its classic clay medium and video presentation. When re-adapted in the 1980s, the awesome soundtrack was replaced by a crappy Casio keyboard. It breaks my heart to watch these dubbed over episodes. I wish I knew why the people who re-released Gumby PAID to have the AUDIO DOWN-GRADED FROM ORCHESTRAL TO SYNTHESIZER.

The dimwits inside leave and wind up in a little shack belonging to a crazy old farmer.Next thing you know, giant spiders start popping up every few minutes.The stopmotion used for the spiders looks to have been done by a four-year-old. The script appears to have been written by a six-year-old. The actors have the talent of a deaf chimp, and put about as much energy into their roles as a sloth.This film also rips-off many other better movies such as EVIL DEAD and ALIENS.

The plot is tired and cliche, the characters are the same and the special effects are low budget. It's so badly made, it looks like a student film or something. It's hard to believe that people still make movies this horrible. The only reason I gave it an extra star is because it's so cheesy that parts of it are funny. Unless you are a big fan of bad b-horror movies this is not worth watching. Even the lesbian scene between the two hot girls is not enough to save the movie and they can't even play believable bimbos! This is good for a laugh or a 'bad movie' party but other than that I doubt I could find a reason to watch it again. It's not bad enough to be a 'so bad it's good' movie and not good enough to become a cult classic.

Also one of the two should have been in greater jeopardy at the end. This threat mixed with romance would have made the movie better. I would actually give the movie a 2.75 score. The two dimwits got on my nerves. One of the many comical moments was the prfessor turning around in digust and telling them to shut up. It would not have taken much to have made this a better movie, but apparently someone ran out of money.This is a movie that should be viewed just for fun.

In particular, the character of Miss Kitty was almost unrecognizable. I doubt that Mr. West ever watched the later years of \\"Gunsmoke\\" or else he would have written Kitty as a more mature, fully developed character. The Kitty in this novel is too soft and girlish--as if a 21 year old Kitty exists in the last years of the show. Where's the tough-as-nails Kitty I know? Yes, the relationship between Matt and Kitty was implied, particulary in later years, and it was definitely implied as a sexual as well as emotional relationship. The relationship between Matt and Kitty in West's book is overly sentimental and lacking sexual chemistry. As grateful as I am that someone is still writing \\"Gunsmoke\\" stories, I wish they would get the character of Kitty right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood, Bullets, & Buckskin","review":"This is a good book based on the tv series Gunsmoke.

What a handsome tool and it worked tirelessly. The Grass Hog takes the place of any man(smile, smile).

This is a useless claim. Is that a 1/2 acre with no trees, fences, curbs, or sidewalks?They should instead tell you how many linear feet it can cut on one battery charge on average. But I suppose if they did this no one would buy it.I feel we have an average size lawn but this string trimmer could not do but half of it before it ran out of juice. To make matters worse it has so little power that it at times did not even have enough power to cut the grass. It would instead just \\"whip\\" the grass repeatedly until it fell limp against the ground. The Automatic Feed Spool has a blade that cuts the line if it gets to long. It rarely had enough power to cut it's own line.We attempted to use this string trimmer 3 times before we got frustrated and took it back. We now have the corded version of this same product.

It went in the trash can and we wrote the 80 bucks off as a learning expereience.We learned not to buy Black and Decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for 1/2 acre..as advertised","review":"I have less than a 1/3 acre lot, so I figured this should be adequate since the box says for up to 1/2 acre. The goods: well built, string feed seems to work well. No need for power cord, gas. No battery memory (claimed) Quiet, no exhaust. The bad: I'm 6 feet tall and find the handling real ackward. The battery last less than 15 min on a full charge. I do light trimming and edging and I find that I can only do 1/3 of my 9000 square feet lawn with each charge. A two hour recharge bought me another 5-7 minutes. The narrow 12\\" cutting path exacerbates the problem since sometimes I have to make 2 passes to finish the job. There is not enough power to cut tall (6\\" or more) grass. I returned mine and bought a gas powered, which I'm much happier with. If you live in an arid area where grass never gets real tall, and your lot is very small, this may be perfect. The reason for 1 star is that it is not appropriate for lot size anywhere near 1/2 acre as stated right on the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"I owned this Grass Hog for about 6 months. I had nothing but problems with it. The battery was so hard to remove from the shaft of the Grass Hog. It almost took me the same amount of time trying to remove the rechargable battery then it did to trim the lawn. After 6 months the battery would no longer charge. What a piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great-workmanship sucks, keep your receipt!","review":"Unfortunately, I was one of the buyers that did not keep my receipt or I would have returned it after one use. I have no complaints about the cutting ability. The shaft cracked after the first use when trying to remove the battery for recharge. The battery was very difficult to remove, the top was very top heavy. I love using battery power for convenience, noise and pollution friendliness. My lawn mover is battery and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one fly in the ointment","review":"This is a wonderful tool. Its predecessor was an earlier (B&D) model of the same trimmer. It received heavy use and never gave anything but satisfaction. The reason this current model only gets four stars (instead of five) from me is because of the difficulty I had attaching the guard. It took two days of intermittent fiddling before I figured out the right combination of angle and pressure, etc., and I work in a hardware store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems great...for a while","review":"At first, I loved this trimmer. The auto feed worked and the battery lasted long enough to do the yard. First the auto feed started sticking so that I would have to open the spool and pull the line out manually. The parts are made of cheap plastic so that they wear out and break easily. Then the battery started wearing out so that I would have to recharge after going 1/2 way around the driveway. Finally the spool started just spilling out line with nothing to hold it in place. A huge disappointment. B&D makes parts out of very cheap plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great-workmanship not so great, keep your receipt!","review":"Unfortunately, I was one of the buyers that did not keep my receipt or I would have returned it after one use.

It's alittle heavy, but the auto feed spool and twisting head offset theweight issue. Another nice feature is the fact that the motor is relatively quiet and you can actually hear when you are done using it. Anyone who's used a gas trimmer knows what this means! END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cut, not enough battery!","review":"The Black and Decker CST 2000 Grass Hog is easy to use, is light, and cuts great. However, the maximum amount of cutting time per use was only about 20 minutes. The company advertises up to 40 minutes, but after 20 minutes the power decreased to about half, and the trimmer could not cut a blade of grass. For a small yard, where 20 minutes is all you need, this would be an ideal product."},{"rating":"2","title":"After One Year--Still Love It!","review":"I don't know how long the battery charge lasts because it lasts longer than I do at 61. I am still on my first reel of string, too, though that should change since I'll be using it more this year than I did last year.I love not having to do anything for the string to stay at the right length.The weight of the thing is actually good for me--might help with these \\"blackboard arms\\"(you know, the swinging triceps that you saw when your old grade school teacher wrote on the chalkboard) and maybe even provide a little aerobic benefit.Someone else mentioned that it is easy to put away and get out again, which makes more work get done and that was a good observation and true.All in all, if you have an average body and average home and yard, you will be very happy with this deal--and no shipping charge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 2 years","review":"I got my cordless Grass Hog three years ago. The first two summers were great, not having to deal with messy gasoline or electric cords. Unfortunately, when I got the unit out this spring, the battery would not charge up properly. While at first I could do my entire yard and fenceline on one charge, now I can only go about 50 feet. I am still considering buying another one, however, because it did work pretty well for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't make it through the summer","review":"I was initially very pleased with this edger/trimmer combo. My gasoline powered trimmer was a bit too heavy for me, and I HATE rolling up extention cords for electric trimmers.The grass hog worked just as well as any other trimmer I've used...while it worked. After a few months, it got stuck in edger mode and won't twist back. Did I save the receipt? Of course not. So it looks like I'll be dragging out the extention cords again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice if you have a real yard","review":"We bought this trimmer at a home improvement store (Home Depot/Lowes/etc) because of high praise from the Black&Decker rep who was working there. I'm sad to say that it failed in practically every aspect -- the charge ran out much too quickly, it didn't have enough power to do a decent job when it was charged up, the auto-feed didn't work well for us at all... I guess the only good thing about it was that it was light-weight and quiet. We returned it after several attempts to get accustomed to it and bought a real product."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL HAPPY-HEAVEN SENT","review":"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT'S GREAT!!

I purchased this trimmer and was so disappointed! The power was POOR and didn't last very long even with a freshly charged battery. It was like when I just touched grass with it, the speed slowed and it really didn't cut the grass. I'm sorry I threw out the box because I'd love to take it back!!!! Boo Black and Decker! You can do so much better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Waste of Money","review":"I purchased this product because I was under the impression that Black and Decker was synonymous with quality. I was mistaken. The AFS system does not work... at all. Okay, that isn't true. I think that the line has been automatically fed after snapping on one or two occasions, but I have gone through two spools now, and I have had to pop the spool cap off and manually refeed the line about 100 times now. I haven't had the patience to actually edge my yard during the course of a single day since I purchased this piece of junk, because I spend the majority of the time manually refeeding the line.

Keep your receipt, however, so you can be sure your warranty is valid. The last Black & Decker trimmer I had, the cylinder holding the timming line broke off the drive and could not be repaired. I didn't have a slip, and even though it was still under warranty, I had to trash it and buy a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short but sweet","review":"The biggest drawback is the charge only lasts 25 to 30 minutes! The auto line feeder is great, it is nice not to have a cord or have to mix gas and oil, it is balanced well and lightweight, works well at cutting back weeds but the charge doesn't last very long. I wouldn't recommend it if you have a large area to cut weeds in. For small yards it is fine. It takes a long time to recharge also, at least 6 hours and they recommend 12 hours. I have used it about 6 times and each time I charged it overnight and it still only lasted 25 to 30 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tool","review":"My 2nd review! After using this trimmer 6 times, I bought anextra battery for it, $...-and now have more than enough batterypower for my yard, plus!

The battery wouldn't recharge. I found out where to order another one in another post (Dewalt Factory Service, online). That battery wouldn't recharge either, so I returned it to my local Service Center and they exchanged it, after asking if I had brought along the charger, too. The new battery wouldn't recharge, so I took it back to the Service Center along with the charger. The problem was my charger, not my battery. The gentlemen there gave me other tips which will probably keep my Grass Hog going for another 5 years. Store it inside in the winter. Inside does not mean in the garage, because that can still be cold enough to freeze the battery. I was lucky because I have an attached garage (slightly warmer) and I kept my Grass Hog on the charger all winter even though I wasn't using it. If you need to take it in for service, take the charger as well as the battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped & Underdelivers","review":"What a major disappointment this baby is. I got about half way done with my 1/2 acre yard before running out of juice. I could have put up with the fact that this guy is heavy & you have to wait 24 hours to charge it up again if it can't finish the job, but it didn't cut very well either. This could have been a great product. The automatic line feeder works great. When someone comes up with a unit that has auto line feed, works well and gives you freedom from an extension cord, I'll buy it. This unit is not it. The cheaper electric unit works much better at half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's going back to the store!","review":"I need something that last more then 15 minutes. Black & Decker, you have let me down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whap, whap, whap, ouch!","review":"I am glad to hear some people are have positive experiences with their units. As for mine, there is a serious problem with the line feed and string cutter. I have been hit three times in the leg with excessive string that was feed out and then finally broke off. The piece then flew back and hit me in the right leg. B&D sent me a new guard and cutter, but same old problem. I did a quick web search found that I was not the only one who had the feed and cutting problem, although I was the only one to mention taking a hit on the leg. This problem concerned me enought to email the Consumers Product Safety Commision.

Of course, being Italian, I know this one intimately.DiStasi traces the historic antecedents and folk traditions from which sprang this fecund myth. With roots in jealousy, envy, primal fear of the other, and the interconnectedness of all things, the Italian Evil Eye myth requires a work of scholarly research and also a life's experience. DiStasi's book embodies both.The duality of feeling combining the mistrust of compliments and the total urge to protect oneself and one's loved ones is the underpinning of the author's description of Mal Occhio.

The two DVD disk set is precious for AKUS fans and if you can only buy one DVD right now, this one is it folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistically beautiful - technically terrible","review":"This is a beautiful performance by a great artist that is ruined, for me, by two puzzling technical defects. First, as another reviewer has noted, there is no center channel sound in either Dolby or DTS. What's the point of providing multi-channel sound if the critical center channel is ignored. Second, the picture on my standard aspect ratio tv is not wide-screen as the disc advertises but some sort of \\"squished\\" full screen. It's as if the DVD was intended only for wide screen sets. Alison Krauss deserves better production than this from Rounder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Group & what a voice Alison has, huh?","review":"This is a GREAT DVD performance by Alison Krauss & Union Station. The sound is very good, and the stage location makes you feel like you're right there with them. Great close-ups and views throughout the concert!The ONLY thing I don't like about this DVD is that it's in \\"Wide Screen\\" format. I personally prefer Full Screen on all movies....Even if you only like Alison's singing a little, you'll love this concert DVD!4 Stars only because of the Wide Screen format. 5 Stars for the performance itself...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst dvd I have ever heard","review":"This dvd is such a disappointment, she is a good singer, beautiful voice, but, the sound quality of this dvd, is horrible, she talks so low you can not hear her and some of her words, you cannot understand. I would most definitley recommend no-one to buy this dvd, unless theY re-do the audio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AKUS DVD = disappointment for me","review":"Having read such good reviews of the AKUS DVD I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality. It sounds as if it has been recorded by someone sat in the audience with a cheap tape recorder. The echo and resonance is very pronounced and AK's conversation with the audience is almost inaudible. I am a great AKUS fan (the CD's are wonderful) and having waited for this DVD with a good deal of anticipation, I feel somewhat cheated. If you like to hear and enjoy quality music, don't buy this DVD. A visual feast but an aural disaster! PS Can anybody tell me why American audiences have to whoop and scream the place down the second they recognise a tune?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Hello..Few occasions have in Spain of enjoying with bands in direct as those of Allison Krauss + The Union Station, for that reason this DVD is something fantastic, of the best thing that I have listened, incredible than much in the image as in the sound.. Wonderful Allison's voice, the musicians, some virtuosos that play in a fantastic way.. Only a small problem, and it is that so much in DTS with in Dolby 5.1, anything is not heard by the central speaker, I don't know if it will be an error of my DVD or of all, for that if serious something that would make him go down some points to this wonderful DVD,Joaquín"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well played and recorded.","review":"I just got into American bluegrass and I wanted to hear and see this ensemble, to learn from the masters, you know...The *double* DVD package contains the concert, insights about life on the bus - some funny moments - photos, and interviews.The concert is very well played, and that was expected, but it is also well recorded in high definition and digital surround; the director made a terrific job being balanced between individual shots and mid-wide-field framings, the atmosphere of the theatre is totally kept in the recording.The photos and credits booklet is minimal, but plenty of footage can be found in the 2nd DVD.This is definitely one of the best DVD concerts I ever purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for beginners","review":"This DVD is very detailed.

Her people are so likeable, and yet are amazingly real, with flaws and foibles and everyday habits. And her stories, including this one, are plausible and gripping and the same time. She amazes me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cannot wait for the next one","review":"I just finished \\"Rising Tides\\" and can't wait for \\"Inner Harbor\\".

They really flow together."},{"rating":"2","title":"BROTHERS THAT NO ONE SHOULD MESS WITH","review":"AFTER READING INNER HARBOR, CHESAPEAKE BLUE, AND THEN SEA SWEPT, JUST IN THAT ORDER HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND AND ENJOY THE LAST TWO BOOKS OF THE SERIES. THEN WITH THIS BOOK IT HELPED ME TO SEE THE BOND THAT ETHAN HAD WITH SETH. SEEMED TO BE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER TWO BROTHERS. BUT ALL OF THEM ARE BECOMING VERY CLOSE EVERYDAY. THERE IS LOVE, UNDERSTANDING AND COMPASSION FOR THE LAST QUINN, SETH. ALL THE CHARACTERS INVOLVED HAVE A PASSION TO KEEP SETH WHERE HE BELONGS AND IT IS TRUELY AMAZING THE BOND THAT CAN'T AND WILL NOT BREAK.ETHAN AND GRACE ARE SUCH A SWEET COUPLE. IT WAS MORE ROMANTIC FOR THEM TO GET TOGETHER THAN ANY OTHER COUPLE IN THE SERIES FOR THEY HAVE BEEN IN LOVE FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. EVEN THOUGH NEITHER WOULD ADMIT IT. THE LOVE SCENES COME FAST PUT THEN AGAIN THEY HAVE WAITED TOO LONG TO GET TOGETHER.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE BOOKS OF THE QUINN BROTHERS. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FALL IN LOVE WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, believable story, leaves you smiling","review":"Nora Roberts does a wonderful job of making the reader a part of the small sea side town on the Eastern Shore. The characters are belivable and dynamic and you learn them very well. There are no gaps left to be filled. This is a story of two people who are dealing with their own deamons but at the same time yearning for each other. Grace and Ethan belong to the other in their hearts but have never spoken the words. Neither one knows about the other's secret love until a very insightful sister-in-law plans to get them together. This is not all story book, there are some bumps along the way. Does the single mom and the man that was once a street wise kid end up together? You have to read and find out. I read the book in 3 days. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I enjoyed reading this complete Chesapeake Bay saga. Nora Roberts does a wonderful job keeping my interest when reading her books. Very worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of the three was great!","review":"This was the best of the three books. All three story lines were the same and I was bored by the third book. Did enjoy this book and read it on an airplane all at once. I would recommend this book but not all three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rising nothing!","review":"Am I the only one who thought this story was contrived. It appeared to me that though Ethan has been in love with Grace for ten years, he decides (or she does!) to tell her about it when Nora Roberts decides to write a story? It was a forced story. Since there were three brothers, there had to be three maidens, however strange it may seem. I think Roberts needs to concentrate on writing stories and not series. The characters in this book seemed to be doing things to please the writer than themselves. I have always believed that characters come alive once you start writing, but not in this one. They stayed buried and to think I hunted for this book when I was in Europe. I was disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is every bit as good as the first in the series! Nora Roberts has a way with words that is incredible! When she describes a scene, you can almost hear the sounds of the bay and smell the flowers. The story is touching and very true to life. I can't wait until the third book comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"Wonderful sequel to Sea Swept. I couldn't put it down!. I cried for Ethan when telling his story of abuse, and how grateful he was when he was taken in by the Quinns. It is amazing how these brothers stick together"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story as long as you read the first book.","review":"Ms. Roberts furthers the mystery surrounding the death of the Quinn patriarch and the origins of the young boy he was trying to adopt. I am not sure the book would work as well for anyone who had not read Sea Swept. She has left a lot of items that will need to be tied up in the final book. Seth grows as a character and while Ethan and Grace's love story was foreshadowed in the first book of the trilogy, Ms. Roberts still manages to throw in a few suprises. Ms. Roberts does an excellent job of presenting the male viewpoint in these books and I am looking forward to the next book in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters","review":"Nora Roberts at her best. The characters are strong, descriptions great and the love is wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Nora Roberts did great job telling these brothers stories I have read this entire series several times and each time I find something new"},{"rating":"2","title":"ON THE WATER !","review":"Ethan Quinn is a thoughly rugged man with his own ideas. This book along with book one of the series continues to build up the Quinn brothers to a grand finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionial , heartbreaking and non-stop reading","review":"Once again I was not disappointed by Mrs.Roberts and her book Rising Tides . It was every bit as exciting as Seaswept was and the Quinn brothers did not disappoint me either. Waiting to see the out come of Seth and the Quinn brothers in the new book Inner Harbor . Also to see the battle that Philip puts up with whom ever it is thats lucky enough to get him. Thank you Mrs.Roberts for writing such wonderful and emotional books that have you crying one minute and laughing the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who'd've thought WATCHING people run would be so watchable!!","review":"We're runners and would usually prefer to BE running, than to WATCH running. But, this is an excellent film. It's well-done and kept our interest throughout. It was painful to watch at times as these folks suffered along trying to do 135 miles, but yet, we couldn't take our eyes off. Highly recommended if you are a runner of any distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I loved this film. And I don't think you need to be a runner to marvel at what these folks put themselves through. The Badwater event has intrigued me for a couple years now. I've hovered over the \\"BUY NOW\\" button on Amazon for a while but I'm thankful that I finally made the purchase. I consider myself an ordinary distance runner. Nothing special. I simply try to go from point A to point B. But these folks are in a class all their own. The film is very well done with a good bit of backstory on some runners including some of their training strategies (which were incredible just by themselves). It also takes the viewer through the highs and deep lows of the Badwater experience, leaving nothing out. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done documentary","review":"If you love running, you'll love these videos. These people are fanatics. It's a well-done documentary. It moves well, asks the right questions, and it shows the suffering and achievement involved in such a race. Very, very well done. It's pretty much never boring, even for non-runners, who get to sit around and marvel that anyone would do such a thing.It's about the 1999 Badwater 135, the 135 mile run through Death Valley that happens every summer. It's not real long, but it's long enough to be interesting.If moral things are an issue to you, like to me, then there's one old guy (the delivery guy who runs 20 miles plus three times a week) whose talking I always fast forward out because of cussing and crude comments. Other than that, it's pretty clean.There's also no chapters, which is pretty irritating for a DVD. You have to fast forward or rewind to get anywhere you want to go like it's a video cassette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching a second time","review":"Cool movie....ah.... I mean hot movie. I rented this movie and watched it twice over the weekend. If you are into running at all you will probably find this movie very entertaining. Why these characters abuse their bodies with running I can't figure. I thought the idea was to improve your body with running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I would recommend this movie to runners of all levels- or to anyone who just wants to be inspired. It is a firsthand account into the lives and (some would say crazy) minds of ultra-endurance runners. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It really gives insight into how much passion these runners have for the sport and what the human body can endure. I wish that they would make a sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.

It's sad how entertainers can be successful and make a lot of money, and suddenly morality goes out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a love story!","review":"No real friend would write some of the things Jerry said in this book. It left me feeling that Jerry only wanted to make himself look good and to belittle Dean with snide little remarks and things that if were true, would better have been left unsaid. As a big fan of Dean Martin I am sorry I bought the book and contributed to Jerry Lewis. I apologize to his family for having read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean and Me","review":"I read this in two days time, and Jerry Lewis has a good recallof the era and the frenzy that this new duo inspired. They were as popular as Lewis claims. Easy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No bashing, blaming or boo hooing","review":"I loved this book. I found a new insight to the Martin and Lewis team and truly understand now why they were destined to break up. No one truly gave Dean credit for his part in their act just about everyone, except Jerry, gave Jerry the credit for their success as a team. I loved how Jerry did not bash or blame Dean for how their fortunes played out. There was no boo-hooing either after the break up. Jerry shows how he always loved Dean as a \\"big brother\\" and showed respect by discretely attending Dean Paul's funeral.I never realized Jerry was the business end of this partnership. As much as I loved watching them as a team- after they had already been split for many a year- I can see how they really did come into their own as individuals.

I don't think anyone will ever be able to put a name to whatever it was that Dean and Jerry did but, in my opinion, I think Jerry did a wonderful job of explaining the whole process of the team becoming a team.I bought this book when it first came out. I didn't know much about Martin and Lewis and thought that it would be an interesting read. I think I have become a bigger fan of one of the greatest comedy teams that ever was, by reading the book. I think it's so great that I am re-reading it now, after having done some other research on the team, and watching a few episodes of the Colgate Comedy Hour.I think this book is great for the \\"beginning\\" fan and is a must read even if you are a \\"veteran\\" fan of the team."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book ever","review":"This book is hard to put down.It is one of the best books i have ever read.Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book... great for baby boomers ! :)","review":"If you ever watched any of the old Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis Movies...or saw them in person...THIS is the Book for YOU ! I could not put it down. If you asked yourself years ago..why they broke up... the answers are all here... according to Jerry Lewis... you don't get Dean Martin's side of the story.. but it is heart-warming... funny... serious at times... BUT doesn't drag on and on...and tells you just as much as you want to know about the two of them. I enjoyed it tremendously and I hope everyone that reads it will also. I bought it here (hardbound) on Amazon for 1 cent, plus shipping..you can't beat that. Happy reading. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I read this story and enjoyed it right to the end.

I could not put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic Duo","review":"For an inside look into one of the world's funniest comedy team's, Dean And Me will not disappoint. Jerry Lewis does an excellent job of describing the rise and fall of the comedy duo. From the all night shows and movies they made to the gradual decline due to Dean's insecurity and Jerry's desire to grow and change as a comedian.Along the way, some big Hollywood names cross the path of the dynamic duo---Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe to name a few. The boys even have a run-in with some mob figures to keep things interesting.Every reader should come away with the feeling that Jerry Lewis really looked up to and loved Dean Martin as a big brother and those feelings ring true still today. Whenever I want to laugh, I will put in one of my favorite Martin and Lewis DVD's-----Sailor Beware, Scared Stiff, Jumping Jacks or That's My Boy to keep the memories alive. A quick and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could","review":"PHENOMENAL book! I love reading about Sinatra, Martin, etc. Any stories about those guys from that time period are like crack to me. I love it! This book is excellent - Jerry should have been a writer long ago!

I found it amazing how Jerry used this book to promote himself even now. His obnoxious conceit turned me totally off. I got the feeling that he wrote this book to try to say he was bigger than Dean Martin -- and don't forget it. Who is he kidding? It was disgusting to read his \\"boys will be boys\\" justification for cheating on his wife and children -- I would have thrown him out without a moment's hesitation.

I purchased this movie expecting to see a remake of the classic \\"Dont Be Afraid of the Dark\\", which was made back in 1973. I was disappointed to say the least.

The back sounded interesting (then again they all do) but I was disappointed by the story's execution. He saves all of his revelations for the last 3 pages, (not nearly enough) and the rest of the book is confusing and boring. There is no character development, and what is going on with the secondary characters is never fully explained. It's too bad, especially as he had a great initial premise. If you want good apolyptic writing try The Handmaids Tale by Margaret Atwood (feminist) or Good Omens by Terry something and Neil something (humor). Horror seems like the right genre for apolyptic stories, but so far I haven't found any authors that I like or any books that competently dealt with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldnt finish it.","review":"I thought I was really going to enjoy this book, but I put it down after 150 pages.

It takes you step by step though the admissions process. It gives insight into how things work, what to look for, it explains finiancial aid packages, and points out the advantages both of small liberal arts colleges and of large universities. But what really separates this book from the others, is that in addition to expaining everything about the college selection process, it helps you to determine what you want in a school. The title sums it up best, it's about choosing the the school that is right for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I liked this book because it includes short write-ups on the colleges in addtioni to information on the admission process.

Although I didn't find this romance as steamy as the one in River Road, it still had the same qualities that make JoAnn Ross's fiction definitely riveting.I only had one eye-rolling moment during this book; I found it very implausible that when the characters are embroiled in the climax of the book (no pun intended), they still can't get over their sexual attraction to each other and they go at it. I would think a major life-changing event as had been uncovered would be enough to calm the libido for a few moments!I do, however, like JoAnn Ross's style of writing romance, and I hope to read more of her writing in the future. I'm a die-hard LaVyrle Spencer fan, and although Ross's writing is certainly more graphic than Spencer's, she still has the knack to keep the reader waiting for the big moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bayou isn't the only thing that's hot and steamy!","review":"Dani Dupree is returning to Blue Bayou.

Like others have mentioned it's a little novel to hear other bands cover Deftones songs but for some reason I thought it was a collection of bands... in actuality it's just one.The music is decent, the band did a pretty good job of replicating the songs... but the vocals are sub-par. Which is to be expected when you are trying to take on one of the most excellent voices in alternative music.Perhaps worth checking out... even though it was a dollar I probably wouldn't buy it again. It's much more entertaining watching bands cover Deftones songs on youtube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fearless-doesn't live up to Lips creative standards","review":"1st I have been a true fan since the early 90's. I have pretty much been the only person in my circle of friends who is a fan. I have had great experiences seeing them in concert and am used to a standard of quality from the Lips. However, after I purchased Fearless Freaks and watched it with hopes there would be more footage highlighting the success of the band and its music, I was disapointed. Too much of the video is about Wayne's childhood with interviews of his partents. I believe 15-20 minutes of the video is about him playing football as a child (home movie footage included). I could have passed on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't seen it, but it will be great.","review":"Everybody needs to hear ALL of the Lips albums, not just the last two. \\"Transmissions...\\" may be one of the most beautiful albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride you never knew existed","review":"I had no idea that the history of the Flaming Lips could be so cool, touching, and odd. It's a great viewing, for huge fans or people new to the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flaming Flaming Lips","review":"A wonderful tour of the development and growth of The Flaming Lips.

Never an oil or filter related problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Diary of Dreams is a project featuring Adrian Hates (what a name!), founder and owner of German goth/industrial label Accession Records. This album falls somewhere between goth and industrial, with low to midtempo beats, perfect production, and a quietly dark atmosphere. Don't expect any club stompers; this is more for goths in lowriders. In fact, the dramatic pianos and symphonic synths bring to mind hip hop, but with less crunk and more German lyrics. Ubercool creepy artwork completes this highly recommended package."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hefty EP at 41: 42 min!","review":"This is an excellent 'Diary of Dreams'(DoD) \\"taster\\" EP for those who want to hear one of the better cds that DoD has to offer.This EP is no small example of DoD's sound...its running time is 41:42 min long!It makes an excellent companion to the full prior release 'Nigredo'. Within its 7 tracks is a little bit of everything that makes Diary of Dreams so interesting, including tracks in German (don't worry if you don't know German, it has such an infectious beat it won't matter).Like all the DoD albums I own (4 others) the lyrics are included. The extended EP time is perfect with no filler and a solid, \\"complete album\\" flow. The lyrics are very dark but in a danceable way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Broccoli Power - ENERGIZE!","review":"A blistering indictment of all that is evil, phoney, and cruel in the world. But just because this comic's heart is in the right place and it's targets are well-chosen doesn't mean it's any good.I could go on and on about the plot's coherence, the high-quality artwork, and Mickey's moral complexity; but what really makes this comic good are the little touches. Here are a few of my favorites:1. Hali Bossi's Turkish \\"pants of many patterns\\",2. The exterminator's tiny wiener,3. \\"I am purified! Now I am ready to kill! Kill! Kill in Jesus name!\\"4. A Central American palindrome5. Fatima (that chick is hot!)6. The coolest cereal box cover ever!7. Zombie rehabilitation8. The proud look on the duck's face after he bites the rabbit's ass9.

I recorded. They were perfect! I'm in a Melodic Metal Band (A Beautiful Oblivion), and I don't like the flat/dull 'thud' of the toms that most metal drummers seem to migrate towards. I view each and every piece of my three-grand kit as if they were all individual voices (the drum set isn't just for keeping time, you know!). They must not only sound well together, but also full. And these drum heads met my expectations!I researched for weeks and tested out many other drum heads, before deciding these have 'that sound' I was looking for. I'm going back into the studio in two weeks to record the follow-up album, so I just bought another pack of these heads again, and will continue to use while on tour this fall.

It wouldn't be too difficult to provide some hard factual evidence, would it?

As I read this book it was hard to believe that anyone had actually lived to tell this story. Really extraordinary first-hand account of life in Berlin as the Red Army invades and the Berliners just try to survive and make sense of what's happened to their city and country. Puts a heartbreaking human face on World War II."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Your Face","review":"Despite all of my attentions paid to the history of man's cruelty to man,(and women), over the course of the past few decades, I have never experienced a more poignant accounting of same than that which \\"A Woman in Berlin\\" had to offer. The author's physical survival and psychological victory over the most tragic circumstances imaginable is a testament to the power of applied intellect in the face of mindless savagery. Truly, this literary work is a wonderful testament to the strength of the female spirit and the durability of a pure human sole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worrisome","review":"After the glowing reviews, I ordered this book. Before it arrived, a letter to the editor of the New York Times appeared, questioning the authenticity of the diary. The rapes, the hardships of life were described clinically. Perhaps that is the language of the distraught, but it could also be that of a publishing house writing a serial. One must believe that this is the authentic voice of a real, single woman for this book to have an impact and, after reading with a skeptical mind, I have doubts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping diary of post-war Berlin by a woman journalist.","review":"I have read some of the negative reviews which question the diary's authenticity, but I have to say that I found it often reads like a stream of consciousness, as we would expect from a diary. It is not a cold recitation of the events following the fall of Berlin, but incorporates her thoughts and feelings during those days. That said, critics still argue that she did not give us enough personal information about herself. However, if she was indeed a journalist, it is understandable and it seems more probable that she would focus on the details around her rather than on herself.I highly recommend this diary; it is a haunting account of survival and the endurance of the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Great!!!","review":"This is like a totally great movie, It was so funny, and it was great to watch these latina girls in this movie, because if you watch the behind the scenes, you can see that these are all real people from the BARRIO, making this movie with no money, I think it's great!!!

I've always admired his skill on guitar. How can you not??? I've got all the BLS stuff, so I'm definitely a fan. But the guy can't sing. This DVD is proof of that. I was so pumped up to buy this thing when it came out, but man was I disappointed.On the positive side, there's some cool extra stuff on the disc, including a guitar lesson in which Zakk breaks down a couple classic solos note-by-note. Pretty cool if you're a guitarist.However, one of the DVD's extras, the interview with Zakk, shows what a drunken dope the guitarist really is. Did this guy graduate high school? Mr. BLS is no PhD. Heck, he's not even a GED. It's good for a laugh, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This idiot barely walks upright","review":"the only thing you need to know about this DVD is that at the end of it he yells \\"Pray for mother f**cking war!\\" This was recorded before the US invaded Iraq. Its one thing to support the troops, but to pray for war? What a sociopath.Between his repetitive and boring songs, a drunken Zakk rants like an amphetamine addicted pre-pubescent boy with Turrette's Syndrome. Sure, he's a pretty decent guitarist, but he's a one trick pony. If you've heard 3 of his songs, you've heard his entire repertoire of pyrotechnics. Too bad there's no song writing to go with the posturing.

In any event the book lacks any hard technical information, or performance standards, that can be used for evaluating and designing a project.

He was sullen, unpleasant, a murderer (!), and, best of all, a sexual molestor of his own sister. Try as I might, I couldn't understand why I would want to protect such an individual from the legal consequences of his own chosen actions. If there had been some glimmer of doubt, some moral ambiguity as to whether or not his actions really should be punished, *that* would have created a compelling conflict. But I'm not inspired to question my moral assumptions by parents too cowardly to deal appropriately with the matter, simply aghast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetely a Page Turner!","review":"It is a compelling novel about relationships within a family and the struggle between right and wrong as the Reisers try to protect thier son.

We never hear much from him. Enjoyed the beginning, then I kept skipping pages waiting to read about what really happened. The family didn't seem bothered that their son had killed a girl, rather that he may go to jail. The mother was the only one who showed some concern for the girl's parents. The book could have gone into more detail about the trial, but most of the book was about the father's thoughts. Don't recommend it.

The songs, for the most part, are hardly noteworthy and certainly few are the best that each artist has to offer. It may be a nice bit of nostalgia for certain commercials, but an album of semi-dreadful tunes is hardly necessary to stir up pangs for an old advertisement. Cynical?

The author tries to follow a number of storylines at the same time and the result is shallow. Experiencing infidelity (as the wife or the 'other woman') is a shattering experience but this book failed miserably in conveying any of this. The only part where I really felt there was some emotion and not just words was when Beth told Jill about her marriage. I wish the author could have followed up on that part. I also liked the ending of the book but also there the author could have made a stronger impression. If you want to know how women feel, read 'Women's room' by Marilyn French.

Even Jill is a bit of a back biter, clawer and scratcher in that she was half of an extra marital affair couple when David was still married to the barracuda. David's anorexic daughter gets into the back biting, clawing and scratching by pitting the barracuda against Jill. Beth earns her stripes and her self respect by killing her abusive husband (David's partner) and learns the fine art of back biting, clawing and scratching.

It was just abmysmally awful. The acting was beyond terrible, the supposedly \\"retarded\\" villain sure doesn't walk and move like any mentally impaired person I've seen (how could someone with severe brain damage be that handy with a sickle?), and I didn't get a single good scare. The scenes just dragged pointlessly on and on. However, the \\"plot\\" was incredibly simple, so if they had made good use of their time the movie would have been about 15 minutes long. I can't think of a single redeeming feature in the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the garbage man refused to pick this one up.","review":"That's right.

Instead of this old recording, buy a \\"Phase 4\\" stereo from someone else. This is an ancient recording, and I only paid $2 for this CD on clearance - and now I know why. Ronnie is a great recording artist and his Phase 4 stereo LPs/CDs are excellent - but this is not a good investment, unless you want it for 'historical' purposes. Buy Ronnie's other music and you'll be better off.

Instead I was treated to a horrible hero who basically hurt everyone around him because he wanted a younger woman. The way he still butted in the heroine's life after breaking things off really pissed me off. The heroine was unequivocally correct in assertion that you don't dictate your spouse's life AFTER you file for divorce. The hero quickly realizes his mistake after feeling intense jealousy over the heroine's new male friend. After breaking his wife's heart, the hero then goes to shred his girlfriend's heart in order to go back to his wife. And if you thought he was bad enough, he then inserts himself in his wife's life hoping everything can go back to the way it was. The heroine taking the hero back after all the pain he caused without any retaliation really made this book a negative ten, but unfortunately one is the lowest rating I can give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"Cheating hero and one of the weakest most ridiculous heroines ever written.

But it's not a good album either. It's angry (\\"You're an idiot,\\" repeated over & over in Dear Customer; \\"East/West is the enemy,\\" likewise chanted in the song named for that line) but that's about it. The songwriting is not as strong as on Superfriends and the creativity of their first album (Sweet Water) is missing huge chunks. It's almost as if Sweet Water has decided to become a punk band and let things like playing and songwriting fall by the wayside. Had Suicide been their second album, you would have heard critics everywhere talking about the sophomore slump; unfortunately this third album from Sweet Water fulfills that prophecy, just a bit late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not palyed with very much","review":"My daughter got this because we hit a Vtech toy sale and this looked great. She hardly ever plays with it though. I thought she might grow into it and she is now 2 1/2 and still ignores it.

He loves playing with the phone WE use, so I knew I had to get him a phone that had buttons and made noise like our phone does. This definitely makes all the noises that a regular phone does, plus has many songs and teaches numbers and sayings. It has a volume control button, but even on the loudest setting it isn't loud enough to drive you crazy (my son has plenty that drive me bonkers), and that is one of the things I like about this toy. Definitely a must-have for all the babies who like the regular adult phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"This toy was given to my 10 month old son. It is loud and difficult to understand what is being said. It doesn't really look like a phone (as we know them today) so he doesn't relate the toy to our telephone. This toy is also quite heavy and the cord is too short to use as a pull toy, but rather as a weapon. My son like to whip the heavy toy around and knock me in the knees or his father in the head. The danger this toy poses and the utter annoyance of the voices, far out way any possible educational value of this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sounding","review":"Before I gave this toy to my son, I tried it out.

Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great present","review":"My daughter received this as a gift last Christmas when she was 4 months. She didn't really play with it at that point, but when she was around 6 months she started pushing all the buttons and laughing when the music played.

I wish I'd bought a different phone, because now I see other brands which are better.My child does like it, but he likes anything with buttons and that makes noise. My complaints are, first of all, the sound quality isn't as good as Fisherprice or Leapfrog. It sounds like the phone is saying the word \\"fans\\" instead of \\"friends.\\"Second of all, the dog doesn't pop very high. We barely notice it go up. I thought it would be cute, but it isn't.Last and worst of all, I can't really predict what sound it will make. I like, as a parent, to push a certain button and sing a song with my child.

She adores phones, but this one goes to the bottom of the toy pile. The cord is way too short. When she tries to put it next to her ears, the phone comes off the ground and hits her. The noise the phone makes is also very annoying. If I forget to turn off the sound, it will continue talking from the bottom of the toy box long after my daughter has discarded it.

The author assumes that the United States holds the rightful position of global superpower, but as China threatens to topple our superiority, they are blamed for doing exactly what the U.S. has been doing overseas for decades. The author even went to the extent of making up a bunch of false scenarios at the beginning of the book - yes, that Chinese woman who is in the United States to work and whose daughter attends the same school as yours must surely be an evil creature, as must be the man who got Lasik surgery in China for 600 dollars.Don't waste your money on this book.

Author Ted C. Fishman explores Shanghai shops, Shenzhen factories and markets for female companionship euphemistically known as karaoke halls, and he manages to put everything in the context of China's economic development. No doubt many readers will come away convinced that China is a threat - indeed, part of the author's purpose is to show how China challenges the world. He does that convincingly by alternating vignettes of China with vignettes of America. Critics may quibble, and not without reason, that the book is superficial, uncritical and nave. Granted.

On the other hand, the author accuses the Chinese of unfair competitiveness. When is competitiveness fair and when is it unfair ? When the U.S. has so many economic advantages, wouldn't it make sense for the Chinese to use whatever its advantages it has which they know that the Americans don't have ? Ted deplores the lowly wages paid to the average Chinese worker but he forgets to mention the obvious that is \\"Would anyone in their right mind work for low wages if they have some other economic opportunity ?\\" What he is inferring is that the Chinese worker should be paid more, reducing the competitiveness of Chinese products, save American jobs and in the longer run, the Chinese lose their jobs.

A costume store in town sold it for 135.00!(And it was all dirty and looked like it was old). I'd give it a 5 if it wasn't for the hole. Looks very shiny and eye-catching in the light.

The lesson by Watts is killin..... you see the music on paper .... OK, that's cool, but to hear him play this stuff is amazing - an apparently simple triad exercise turns into an killin jam, playing nothing but the triad exercise!... - and he plays a lot of different exercises (including one Trane used to play!)- enought to keep me working for months. What would an actual lesson with Watts cost - $60 or up - and here you get an extended lesson, on CD, for $20.00. A no brainer.

I have studied music theory on my own for the past five years and studied and reviewed countless materials that simply explain some aspect of music theory without mention of how to use the knowledge. Desi Serna's materials by far do the best job of connecting the dots that I've ever seen. I am finally able to put together the relationship of major, minor and pentatonic scales along with arpeggios and partial chords relating to the scales. I finally feel like I am making progress towards understanding how music is made versus simply playing it.

The three smaller shelves are a perfect fit for the standard spice jars from the grocery store and the fourth will fit larger items such as salt.The only negative for the product is installation. The rack comes with four small screws and four mounting brackets.

It holds my CD's and it matches my steering wheel cover. It was a good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"changiz","review":"For reading this book you have to have very good sight of eyes because of its size and the size of fonts. That is ok if you use a suitable pare of glasses. You can rarely find an example sentence for 10000 words in this book and for myself I decided to put it aside for maybe ever. After 5 days of ordering I received it in my letter box in Norway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming of Middle earth","review":"This is a scholarly, highly readable and emjoyable work examining J.R.R. Tolkien's writings in light of his known interest in dreams and in time. This work is particularly fascinating in that Flieger does not merely study Tolkien's published works but also analyzes his unpublished but still intriguing writings like The Lost Road. I enjoyed the scholarly analysis, and I found particularly interesting the chapter on some of Tolkien's influences in this area, including some hitherto unsuspected works like the writings of George Du Maurier, J.W. Dunne's theories, and the famous Trianon Ghosts case.If you are just discovering the world of Tolkien criticism you should probably begin with T.A. Shippey's works instead of this one, but Flieger's work will eventually add to your understanding and appreciation of Tolkien immeasurably."},{"rating":"1","title":"impressive but incomprehensible","review":"This book was given to me as a gift and I was pleased to get it because I know Prof. Flieger's reputation is high among academics. I'm a Tolkien fan and have read a number of other scholarly books about Tolkien. I don't think I'm a particularly dense person, I graduated from college, but just could not follow any of the arguments in this book. I've tried twice to read it but finally had to give up. I guess if you're breathing rarified air of Tolkien academia it might make some sense, but mostly it just struck me as words piled on words. I ddidn't come away with any new insights - just a sense of... HUH? I give this book two stars for effort - she obviously knows a lot about her subject, but this reads like an obscure doctoral dissertation. I just couldn't stick it out.
