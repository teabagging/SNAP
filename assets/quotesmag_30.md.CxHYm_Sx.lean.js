This stroller is obviously not meant for infants, it's an umbrella stroller! It also doesn't have the biggest basket. However, you should know these things prior to buying it.

The recline is just enough for my little one, although it does not \\"fully\\" recline. Although they say the stroller is good from 3 months, I would say that 4-5 months would be the best time to purchase it... unless you have a really big baby.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because the sun shade is too small!

However since I have starting using this my graco has not seen the light of day. It is so easy to manuver through small areas when shopping and my daughter is very comfortable in it. This particular model reclines enough that she has fallen asleep in it. I just can't express how much nicer this stroller \\"drives\\" than my original travel system. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that I have a very difficult time collapsing it. Forget the one hand fold they claim, I even have to use both hands to get it to open.

It doesn't really break any new ground in any way shape or form. Of the three discs this really should've been the focus and it really is lackluster.Interesting to see after Piper was very vocal in his book and on television how he backpeddles and basically apologizes for going against Vince and the WWE.The matches on disc two are actually pretty cool. The third disc is nothing but Piper's Pit segments. I remember these as a kid but what I did not remember is the amount of racial \\"humor\\" Piper uses in spots which I find kinda sketchy.

As other reviewers have said, the light sensors are sensitive to the point where just waving your hand over the number without placing a piece causes the puzzle to say the number. Also, when you place the wrong piece in the puzzle, it still says the number. It's going to be difficult for a child to learn anything when no matter what number he places, it is considered correct.Apart from the sound aspect of the puzzle, it is a great, durable puzzle. So, it could be used like a traditional puzzle with the sound off. However, it seems a little expensive for a simple wooden puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa & Doug Numbers Sound Puzzle","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter to help her with number recognition. She enjoys it very much and can play with it daily. I, however, was very disappointed when I put the 2AAA batteries in it and heard the voice for the first time. It is very hard to understand due to the low quality of the voice recording. The sound quality is that of a toy that might have been bought at a dollar store. The puzzle will only work properly in a well lit environment as there are light sensors under each puzzle piece. I didn't know this the first time we played with it and I got upset, thinking that it was damaged as half of the numbers did not read aloud. There is no indication on the packaging that you need good lighting in order for it to work correctly. As a parent I would give this toy one or two stars due to its poor sound quality but my daughter does enjoy it greatly. I do not think its is worth more than the eight dollars I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good learning tool","review":"I really liked this puzzle to teach my daughter her numbers.

While I was with her, no amount of battery changes or other parental work would make the sound work. However, a few days later, the puzzle did begin to sound out the number that was placed into the puzzle. The next night, however, my daughter and her husband were awakened by the puzzle repeating the number \\"19\\" over and over. Clearly this product is defective. I have bought two other Melissa and Doug sound puzzles (alphabets and shapes) and would return them but for the trouble of it all. However, the baby's parents will not be inserting any batteries, and so the sound feature which I paid for will be for naught. I do not therefore recommend this product, cute as it appears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I bought both numbers and letters, the idea it is great the problem for me was that when you put for example the number 18 said 19 or if you put the number 8 said 7, I do not want my daughter get confused when she hears one thing for another so I returned them both, need improvement with the sensors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I brought three of the melissa & doug sound puzzles.

He expressed these emotions on the raw Ghetto D. 5 years later, with an estimated worth of 200 million dollars, the artist formerly known as Master P has become spoiled by the riches and fast cars- and sadly, this is evident in his music.Constant bragging of his wealth will bring the food up in the listener's stomach. What strikes me as curious is that his own brother-C-Murder- never left the street, so his music remained faithful to his violent roots.Master P does not give hip-hop heads a reason for them to continue to purchase his music. The cliches he brings up can easily be found in more creative forms of Cash Money's music, and his montonous ughhh's are no longer in fashion.The time is ripe for P to throw in the towel.

Earlier, I had a gray one that was a cotton/poly mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible tank top","review":"The product description says it somehow wicks moisture with its \\"moisture management fabric,\\" when it feels just like a regular cotton tank top. Save some money and just buy the Russell \\"basic cotton tank,\\" which I prefer over this one. Also, the \\"full athletic cut\\" is very awkward. The chest area is very constricting, while the side (love handles) area is overly roomy. Russell is probably marketing this tank top towards the obese."},{"rating":"2","title":"A straighforward telling of the tale","review":"This book passed the toughest test our household has to offer---my two sons asked for it to be read several times in one day. The pictures are vivid and clear and the story is told without fancy added details---just the facts of the fairy tale! I must admit I didn't find it that overly gripping, but I think that's because this isn't the most fascinating of fairy tales---but something about it appeals to kids---the bears? The 3 sizes of everything? Who knows? Whatever it is, it's a hit with my boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the family?","review":"I am appalled that PC lingo has now taken over fairy tales to such an extent that we cannot even have a BEAR family. I don't begrudge Mr. Galdone his right to re-write fairy tales, but I think a warning (in the form of a subtitle, perhaps?) would at least be appropriate. Something like, \\"A new take on an old favorite\\" or another similar phrase. I had one friend who bought this book thinking that it would be the traditional tale, but when he got home and opened it to read to his child, realized that he had instead picked up a PC version of the beloved story. This version simply has three differently-sized bears living together rather than a bear family. So parents, I would encourage you to save your money on this one and buy a nice re-telling of the story as it has been passed down through generations instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a Friend","review":"What a movie marathon.............. put it in a basket with popcorn and let the party begin............"},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Problems","review":"I watched both East of Eden and Reble Without a Cause.

The quality is great and exponentially better than the video version. I only wanted EOE and RWAC but when I saw that it was only a few extra dollars for the whole collection I couldn't resist buying all three. Giant, unlike the other two movies, can at best be called a good movie with a lot of flaws, but being a James Dean fan I can overlook most of its short comings. The first half of the movie actually border on greatness but the final half almost bring the movie down to mediocrity.

In this collection of his starring role films he was surrounded by other actors who were almost as talented. Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Julie Harris, Raymond Massey and Burl Ives. There are two scenes in Giant that may be the greatest of all time. First, when Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor drive from the railroad station to the ranch and perhaps the most notable scene by any actor in any film....when the big Texas Ranchers offer the poor cowhand, played by James Dean, 1200 dollars for his little piece of land. The poor cowhand becomes the richest man in the world. What a story!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great acting and great scripts","review":"These three movies go well together.

What a joy to see these films come to life again with such clarity and quality. The original elements for Rebel Without A Cause were destroyed or lost at the studio at some point so all the Rebel films are from a print, but my oh my what they have done with it just working from that 35MM print.

Magellan Maestro does not have that route. So when you have your GPS 4050 in your hand at point A, you can not make a map direction from point B to point C like you can make through Yahoo map or Google map.

My baby took to it immediately and loves to walk with his new assistance. His older brother likes to play with it as well. It is an added bonus that it comes with a seat in the front. Kids can cart their toys or even each other around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"I looked at a million push toys before buying, mostly because so many of them are godawful ugly and light as a feather. I wanted our son to have more stability when he was learning to walk, and this was the only one I could find that was 1) solid and 2) allowed you to tighten and loosen the wheels. It has proved to be worth every penny. A friend gave us one of the more typical plastic push toys and he couldn't even pull himself up on it at first. But with this one, we tightened the wheels and allowed him to start slowly, and he was up and going right away. Over time, we have loosened the wheels as he gets more proficient and wants to go faster. The plastic one is around and sometimes he uses it, but if he has a choice he always goes with this one. It doesn't make my house look like a daycare threw up if I stick it in the corner. Plus, we can put his other toys and stuffed animals in it and he pushes them around the house, much to the chagrin of the dog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haba walker","review":"My grandson in Alaska loved this walker. It is safe and well made like a piece of furniture. I was especially thrilled that it could be shipped to Alaska."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Toy","review":"I have twins and they received these walkers for their first Christmas. We were very excited about these walkers and like the idea they could use them together. We soon discovered these toys have a bad design and are potentially extremely dangerous. Both of my girls had the same thing happen, they would be trying to walk behind the toy pushing the handle and their pants would get caught under a wheel. This causes them to trip and their necks would get stuck on the handle bar. Since their feet were stuck, they wouldn't move their head started to choke. These are a neat idea, but major design error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We splashed out on this as it looked fantastic in the pictures. However, the instructions were useless and once put together, both screws stuck out from the sides in a dangerous way. It would have been very easy for my baby to have injured himself badly. My husband was horrified at the design. The picture on the box also did not match up with the actual product. Highly misleading and very diasppointing. We returned it straight away. I bought a simple V tech walker and he loved pushing that around easily by himself, and now he can walk, he still loves playing with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"The price of this item seemed a bit high, but I decided to buy it anyway as I assumed the quality would match the price. This was not the case. It looked like something you might buy at Ikea, and the quality was not impressive. To top things off, the screws provided for assembly didn't fit. I could have solved this with a drill or a trip to the hardware store, but at this price, that simply isn't acceptable. I ended up returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for most original crap","review":"I can NOT believe someone actually put this together and believed they would make money.

It begins with a few short passages on the founding of the dynasty in the 13th Century, but the most intriguing stories begin after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the Ottoman takeover of the city.John Freely writes in a clear and concise manner that makes what could be complex material simpler to read. And the characters, from the royal courtiers to the concubines to the sultans themselves are all portrayed with fascinating insight. The text is illustrated throughout by some beautiful prints and sketches as well.This is a great book about the inner workings of the court life of the Ottoman dynasty, and will likely whet the reader's appetite to do delve more deeply into the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, colorful look into the lives of Ottoman Sultans","review":"John Freely's Inside the Seraglio is an enjoyable, engaging book. This look into the lives of the sultans during the Ottoman's period of decline is insightful and thought provoking. I especially like the dialogue that is exchanged during the scenes in which the sultans spend time in The House of Felicity. The mixture of erotica and historical fiction is a literary delight in this book. I recommend Inside the Seraglio to those who love the combination of the aforementioned genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Is Pure Fun","review":"This quirky romantic comedy is lighthearted fun.It's not meant to be a Dr. Zhivago and doesn't pretend to be.

Lucy Liu and Cillian Murphy are great together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Cillian?????","review":"I love Cillian in most of his movies but this one is a big bore. I think the reviewer above stated it well, this is a vehicle to display Murphys comedic talents. He has them too bad this film wasted them.The story is silly and too dumb to be real. Lucy Liu is sadley miscast and is not funny at all.The film it self is only mildly entertaining, actually it boarders on boredom. If you are a Cillian fan and you just want to see him then buy the movie. If you are a Cillian fan you will definitly enjoy his performance but be ready to be completely bored with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Don't waste your money. Liu is completely miscast and ridiculously dressed. Femme fatale she is not. Murphy apparently was put into this film as a tester for his comedic ability/kooky romantic leading man ability. Both are sadly tested in a strange script/plot which could've been quite interesting. It took me three tries (and I am an avid Murphy fan) to watch the whole film. Much of the dialogue is awkward and the situations more bizarre than \\"zany\\", although the supporting cast seemed comfortable and more realistic. One scene in particular made me chuckle involving the film \\"geeks\\" knowing just when a movie is returned by how much tape has been wound and not rewound. I felt the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"a superb documentation of Takemitsu's music","review":"This CD is a must-have for those interested in Takemitsu, or in unique and imaginative 20thC music. Two seminal works (along with \\"Spirit Garden\\")are represented here by both superbly polished playing and spectacularly clear and dynamic recorded sound. \\"Gemeaux\\" is a wonderful, strange and very large work which shares similarities perhaps with Debussy's \\"La Mer\\"; I have visited saiho-ji and I must say that \\"Dream/Window\\" perfectly evokes the garden's elusive qualities and architectural proportions.

But it will never print. You will waste an entire evening and then be forced to return this horrible product. The customer service is unbelievably bad. You will be on hold for at least an hour. And then they will be unable to help you. The product was designed in 2005 and has not been updated. If you are a computer wiz you may be able to do this by manually changing intricate settings. That is what the customer service person attempted, but even he could not help. Ultimately he said that I needed support from HP too. But it should be plug and play. This is 2010.

After more than an hour talking to tech support with Buffalo, it didn't print. It recognized my printer and supported it but no dice. They said it may be faulty and to send it back. Amazon was flawless in the transaction. One issue was that during the setup, it erased my HP driver and I had to reinstall through the website. Too bad it was a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad documentation, ok product.","review":"Let me first point out that [...], whom I bought this from, is a great company.

I highly recommend[...]; excellent support, very quick turnaround.Now the print server itself appeared to be ready to work out of the box. However, it just failed to recognize my HP LaserJet 1020. Also, the software packaged with the device was flat out broken. It was impossible to assign a static IP to the device, and I had to search Buffalo's website to find a \\"new\\" package. The package finally allowed me to assign a static IP. However, the printer was still offline. The Buffalo tech support was fairly quick to respond to my issue (within 24 hours), but they weren't terribly helpful.

With one exception the Technicians I talked to were respectful and attempted to be helpful but they were not familiar with this piece of equipment and my connection was cut off after a few minutes. I was attempting to install the device on a Canon multifunction printer using an MacBook running Leopard. It is possible that there is a more recent version of the server software that will work, I was able to download a newer manual from the Buffalo website (not an easy site to navigate) but I could not download the newer firmware and the techs were not helpful with this.

However, I found this one to be getting some great reviews so I took the plunge.WHAT A TREAT! Outta the box, clear easy instructions and within 10 minutes I had it up and running with absolutely no problem at all.

The Buffalo gadgets works as advertised as long as you don't have brain-dead drivers from Canon that prevent you from networking! Apparently if you use it on a PC only network, Canon allowes you to share, but not with a Mac!So, as long as you don't have a config like mine, I'd recommend it.

I downloaded the gimp-print open source drivers to get the printer to work via the LAN rather than the direct-connect USB it had been using. Information about the printer is not transmitted across the network connection as it is in the USB but the printing and quality is the same. We were willing to give up a bit of functionality for the convenience of not having to share the printer from a workstation (and constantly keeping that workstation powered-on)."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't work with multifunction printers","review":"It does not indicate anywhere that this print server can not work with a multifunction printer. In fact, even the manufacturer's own tech support didn't know. I spent over 20 hours trying to get this thing working until finally the tech support figured out the problem. It may be an excellent print server for regular printers, but buyer beware: if you have a multifunction printer - this will not work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited compatability","review":"I bought this for my Lexmark inkjet printer. Even though Lexmark is possibly the most common printer around, the Buffalo server wouldn't work with it. That's life. However, the real problem is that I called their tech support. Listed as being open 24/7. After holding for an HOUR, the phone was picked up, I heard someone talking to someone about the YANKEES, and then they hung up. I was steamed. I called back, and hung for another 20 minutes. I then processed my Amazon return while on hold with them. Bottom line, as you can see from other reviewers, this unit has limited compatability, and no tech support. If your time is valuable, skip over this and find something that is known to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but incompatible with multifunction printers","review":"Excellent quality, easy to setup.

It worked fine for about a year and a half and about 6 months ago it stopped working. I put some effort into getting it to work again. I reinstalled it several times. Reinstalled the printer on several different computers. Nothing worked. Either the device itself failed or the software has become incompatible with OS updates. I cannot recommend this product anymore. I went out and bought a new Network ready printer HP Photosmart premium to eliminate the need for a separate print server device. The printer cost $119 here in Amazon. It is really not worth the money to spend it on this device.

This catechism is very well written and very clear and rather than the often dense and sometimes ambiguous way that the new John Paul II catechism is written Father Hardon shoots straight and from the heart in this. It reads more like a history of the Catholic Faith than a catechism and while this might turn some people off it is something I enjoy. Outside the Catechism of the Council of Trent and the trusty Baltimore Catechism this is the next best thing. I still read through my copy regularly. In all this is a great catechism from probably the very last true Jesuit and as such there is no funny business, no heresy and no neo modernism apparent in it.

This book was recommended by a friend and I had no idea how good it would be. The characters are extrememly relatable and the author has great use of intelligent wit. This book I would say definitely has it all. It takes you on a vivid journey that gives the feeling of experiencing a real life story. The story made me laugh out loud and made me feel real compassion for the characters. This book definitely gives a great new perspective on life and death.

While Southard captures classical literature within his plots and characterizations, and the \\"author\\" claims to want nothing to do with postmodernism, the eccentricity of postmodernism shines through. Of course, postmodernism itself is just the collection of all that is classical and modern into one big melting pot. But I digress.This book captures the spirit of youth, filled with hope and optimism that is so easily crushed by the weight of our world. The multitude of different characters present cornerstones for the reader, guiding him through a maze of plot and theme too broad to touch in this limited space. The paths down which this book leads both the mind and spirit are well worth exploring.Touching and compelling in places, and in others, laugh out loud funny, one can only hope that 3 Days in Rome marks the beginning of a long and fulfilling career for this budding great American novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy tool","review":"You'd be surprised how many little things you can use this for.

With 25 different tracks I don't remember any particular song as being a favorite but there's something for everyone. I believe #2 Queen Clarisse was used in the menu portion of the DVD, it's not bad but I think I like #12 Scooter talk better. I guess it's common for movies to have a lot of background music that we never really hear, so much of this album is unfamiliar to me.

Amidst, all the talk about 'framing', poll driven hand-wringing about progressives lacking vision, needing new ideas, etc., etc, this book cuts right to the chase and lays out a straitforward political vision (and by an economist, to boot!). It's well-written (with trademark Bernstein wit), simple and should be read by lots and lots of people. And this is the kind of book you can organize with.

I watch him on Kudlow and company debate Steve Moore and lose time and time again, but he seemed like a smart guy. In order to make an argument you must know the other side. I was very upset because although i disagree with everything in this book, there were no statistics to back up any of his points. Very few charts; very few analytical arguments; just a bunch of pandering to the liberal left that wants everything given to them. According to bernstein the government should play an integral part in your life. Privitized social security --- no way --- the gov't can get you a better return --- Universal health care is a must in his eyes---- i was shocked time and time again as i read this ---- I would not buy this if you actually think the money you earn would be better in your pocket instead being blown by our government on useless entitlement programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the screws","review":"Missing the screws.

For the book's second part, he writes about the left's reactions to these moves and how the various radical groups took certain aspects and focused their discontent upon them.

Either way they managed to steal 43 minutes from me.This is not an all night show. He doesn't have the time to wind up to the big grand slam. He needs to come out with both guns loaded and blazing. He does pretty much the opposite. He takes some not very funny material and tries to milk it which does little more than underline how unfunny the material is. The slow pacing and laconic delivery urged me to start looking at my watch which is not the right response to stand up comedy.In all fairness he did have a couple of good bits about his young son's fascination for his \\"ting ting\\" and another about female genitalia but it simply wasn't enough to pull this out of the doldrums. I understand he's supposed to be a funny guy but there is no way you could tell so from this performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS!","review":"Amazingly disappointing. He's so funny on Chelsea Lately so what gives?Started off very unfunny and then began ranting about the French. The Bush/Chaney people must have been thrilled. If he's trying to impress that Hasselback lady on The View, he'll need to clean up his language first.43 minutes was way too long for this piece of trash (we barely made 10).

THAT is something I might pay full price for, but 42? No.If this DVD goes on sale sometime for 6.99 or something, it would be a bargain. The material is quite funny and not bad for his first time out. Remember, he's only started to make it big just recently. He's opened for a lot of great comedians, he's been on Chelsea Lately... he even did commentary for I Love the 80's. But this is his first big special, so the length is forgivable... Here's hoping he will have more material for his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly short but lots of hilarity!","review":"I was startled by how short this was without the commercials!

Pat's last few cds have left me wanting something more--his \\"all blues\\" albums just didn't satisfy my musical taste. Pt Power Trio more than makes up for it. If you're looking for some hard-driven tunes, this cd will satisfy you all the way through from track 1 to track 10. My only complaint is that there are only 10 tracks--12 or 13 tracks seem to be the standard nowadays (thus my reason for rating 4 stars instead of 5).

COuldn't wait to hear his take on \\"White Room\\", \\"Day of The Eagle\\" and \\"Inside Looking Out\\" but they are substandard for his abilities.

They just posted this fundamental limitation on their product support page today or yesterday.

To appreciate how slow this is, consider backing up 200GB of data to a hard drive connected to the DNS-120: At 10.5 Mbps, it will take 43 hours to finish.Also, the DNS-120 is not compatible with the NTFS disk format, so you'll have to format your disks as FAT32.

His run-on sentences can make you dizzy, and he'll go off on tangents in footnotes about the most irrelevant things. For example, there was a foot note that took up *half a page* about one detective marginally involved in the investigation: who his father was, how he'd joined the force, and a story about some big time gangster he'd busted---none of which had anything to do with the story of Starr Faithfull.

The characters and plot are as colorful as the city itself. We see Georgia blossom not only as a blues singer but also as a woman in love. The subplots are interesting, and though the ending is somewhat predictable, the action and dialogue will keep you reading and wanting more. I found this to be a nice change from the NYC set, girls in publishing routine. Orloff's writing, style, and characters definitely have an edge and make for fun summer reading, as well as a fabulous addition to the RDI series.

Where most \\"Chick Lit\\" books have the same formula (suddenly single girl in NY or LA, works for publishing house or magazine or is currently unemployed, has colorful friends, hilarity ensues), this book strayed away from many of these conventions, much to my delight.The main character, Georgia Ray, is a wedding singer with dreams of becoming a blues goddess. The supporting characters are fantastic, and you can't help but root for Georgia. A few plot points were somewhat cheesy (I don't want to give anything away), but overall, it's a thoroughly enjoyable book, and perfect brain candy for the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisko: The Lost Years","review":"While Star Trek: Deep Space Nine undoubtedly had the best characterization of any of the Star Trek series, Sisko's past was never really mentioned. Although we saw him on the Saratoga in \\"Emissary\\" and he was mentioned as serving on the USS Livingston in \\"Invasive Procedures\\" and the USS Okinawa during the Tzenkethi War (wasn't there supposed to be a novel about that?), this novel was the first to mention in detail events from Sisko's time on the Saratoga and the people he served with. The novel moves along well and has a good \\"B\\" plot with Odo posing as Quark to save a Bajoran city. Some of the new characters are quite interesting, especially Barnes and Lopez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Again the books were trying to find themselves. Though the Defiant gave the characters more mobility in a plot sense, this revisiting of Sisko's past didn't necessarily suggest perfection. It takes time to develop a new concept for characters that are being fixed in the public consciousness. This book tried to bring in some of Sisko's past, the past being an area thatthe book writer's can explore without fear of destroying some precious future episode. And though theres a heavy feeling of mourning, it's also nice to see how Sisko interacts with another crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great by Michael Jan Friedman","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read in the Star Trek line. I am a big fan of Deep Space Nine and Captain Sisko, so this was very interesting to read. But, I do have two complaints. One is that the Odo/Nog/power coils story was far out of synch with the rest of the novel. It would have been nice to focus on the Defiant's problems without always going back and forth. My second is that the reason that ***** betrayed them is because he was in debt to the Retizians? I was hoping for something far more substantial than that. But, despite that, it's one of the best. And I'm not kidding."},{"rating":"1","title":"No entertainment value","review":"This book can be summed up in one word: boring. The plot is that some of the Saratoga survivors and the DS9 crew are on the Defiant on their way to the commissioning of a new Saratoga. They are trapped in a spatial anomaly by a saboteur aboard. It should have been an interesting story, but it is quite obvious that the DS9 crew have the situation completely under control and are pretending otherwise to reveal the traitor. There is no tension to the wait. The characterisations of the Saratoga survivors are all right but not memorable, except for their ship's counsellor. She's nuts, and you can see the plot \`twist' in her story from a mile away. The twist is also just stupid in its own right. This book had no entertainment value for me.

He opens up the whole album with the fictional \\"Spencer Wyatt Big Band\\" (the name of the band in the movie) and proceeds to give a clinic on three more songs, solo-piano style. Jim Cox is pretty much a studio regular in LA, but you'll never really hear him like this anywhere else. I've looked.

These tapes can really take the edge off of the stress brought on by Pharmcas, the PCAT, and your grades. I just simply listen to them in my car, while jogging, or while trying to fall asleep, and I feel as though I studied. The only draw back, as far as I can tell, is that they do not tell you how to take the PCAT. What I mean is that they don't offer any problem solving advice. The tapes are strictly an informational review, and I still would study with other materials as well. It may take a couple sessions with each tape to grab up all of the information, but they are worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best PCAT Prep.

The cover promises a book about women's ordination as Catholic deacons, and the book delivers on that promise. But it's not written in the usual prophetic tone of books like this. At first I found the highly logical tone a little heavy. Then I became fascinated by the argument. Zagano has really uncovered a *lot* of interesting information about the rules for ordination, the history of ordination, and other details that most books don't provide. For anyone wanting a full range of discussion about the place of women in the Church, I'd recommend reading this book alongside a more prophetic book like Elizabeth Johnson's She Who Is. They form sort of bookends for highly intelligent and informed discussions about the future of the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb considerations","review":"The ordination of women to the priesthood is a hotly debated issue within the Catholic Church and is currently banned according to church teaching. Ms. Zagano limits the presentation of her information to argumentation concerning the ordination of women to the diaconate, and has developed some compelling issues for serious consideration by the Catholic faithful, Catholic church hierarchy and non-Catholics struggling with the acceptance of female ministers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good early songs","review":"Good remastered standout really early recordings here like I Travel, Celebrate and Thirty Frames from Empires and Dance, but the later Sons and Fascination, Sister Feelings Call and New Gold Dream albums, from which many tracks are derived, should really be heard in their entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standells - 'The Live Ones' (Sundazed)","review":"An excellent quality six-song performance of the Standells that someone had 'apparently' dug up several years ago.

It's one thing for bars exposed to air to get moldy, but for all 18 bars to reek of mold as soon as you open the sealed individual packaging indicates a serious problem at the factory.

Its as if the manufacturer never actually fully tested their design. I contacted the manufacturer and asked them to recommend a VGA cable for use. The responded with the following:\\"Thank you for contacting Peerless Industries. I contacted our engineering team and after testing with the cables, it has been found that the VGA cable will not work with this. The tubing is not large enough to accommodate the plug.\\"So I would only recommend this product if you plan on having your vga cable exposed."},{"rating":"1","title":"CNS not a good vendor","review":"First off sent the wrong product.

It does not have much space in the basket but for an umbrella stroller it is large. My son fit well in it other than the straps do not tighten up enough to really support him. He is 11 1/2 months old and 24 pounds, so I know he is not a little peanut.

It came with a rain cover - which has come in handy several times. The basket isn't too roomy, but this is a compact stroller.Fast forward to Fall of 2008 - its still going strong.

I was really debating on buying another one, since she's three, but we were going to Disneyland and I needed quality. I love that my daughter, who is tall, can easily fit in this, can take naps with the seat reclined, and that it easily goes over rocks and bumps. If you're debating on just getting something cheap, let me suggest to make the investment in quality. If you're a new mom and you are like me- thinking heavy is better quality- let me just say that this is way better quality than my stroller that weighs 3 times as much.

I can feel the terror that Dr. John VanDuyne experiences in the choice between his kidnapped daughter and his old friend, the President of the US. The story is flying along well until it peaks with a major disagreement between the kidnappers. It quickly runs downhill after that with the adding of a crazy ex-wife and hillbilly relatives.

It's not a horror book, it's a straight up thriller. Basically the President of the United States decides to push through a bill to legalize drugs and the South American Cocaine cartels decide they can't allow this to happen, so they kidnap the daughter of the President's oldest and best friend. Who is also his personal doctor. They tell the doctor he has to give the President a shot of some nasty stuff or they kill the daughter.You can pretty much guess the rest of the plot.

I didn't really notice at first, because I was pretty young when I bought it, but after listening a few times, I noticed a big difference in the songs, especially Lesley Gore's \\"It's My Party\\".

Although no band'll ever be like Sublime, and i'll admit i bought this cd and compared it right off the bat with sublime, you just can't do that. It's unfair. This album is hip in it's own way, with some groovy tracks like Rosarito and Trailer Ras. Very mood-oriented music. it's definitely a fresh re-birth of the SoCal music style.

I was surprised and pleased that they didn't decide to go mainstream in either the pop (What I got) or punk direction. They got ballsy by choosing reggae as their foundation. That's admirable. Whether they'll keep the formula when the rest of the world catches on, is a question that will be answered when their video for Trailer RAS hits MTV. A hint of hypocrisy here, for in Fugazi: \\"We don't need no video to make up for our song\\" is sung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Right Back is a good cd that mixes raggae, dub, punk, and a little ska. At first I didn't really like it that much but that was because I made the mistake of comparing it to Sublime. You can't do that though. Sublime is incomparible, no one will ever even come close to them. So I began to appreciate the LBDA for their own ability. The music is fun, the lyrics are good, and the singer has a solid voice (although he's no Brad Nowell, but again that's something you just can't compete with). I think the LBDA are a talented band and I recommend buying the cd (and also get their new CD when it is released next month) ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album. Don't compare to Sublime! LBDA!","review":"First of all great album. Now that I said that I must warn you that you should not compare this to Sublime. It does have that Skunk Records style to it but they slowly expand on that stylee with guest vocalists like HR(Bad Brains), Half-Pint(The One and ONLY), and Barington Levy. The fusion of hip-hop,reggae, dub, dancehall, ska, and punk is beautiful and far from todays normal generic cheese. Take a lesson from bands like LBDA,Skinnerbox, Filibuster, etc..... These bands are the future. My only gripe with this album is the fact that it is tooo short, and the songs all sound the same. Best songs by far have to be: My Own Life, Righteous Dub, and Sensi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime 2","review":"This is a great CD. It sounds just like Sublime. A lot of the people who helped with the Sublime CDs are on this CD. The singer, Opie Ortiz, drew the artwork on the \\"Robin' the Hood\\" CD.

The consulting doctor also gives a recommendation for women to only gain 20 - 25 pounds during pregnancy so they can go back to prepregnancy weight \\"at delivery\\". Not only does this go against the recommendations given by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (average weight gain of 25-35 pounds) but going back to prepregnancy weight is unhealthy and impractical for women, especially if they plan to breastfeed, in which case they NEED fat stores so that their milk is healthy.

The article goes on to state that Dr. Berk has been sued twelve times for malpractice. (Some of these cases have settled.) I am not writing this for any other reason than that I think others should be aware of these facts.

Samsung's support was almost non-existant -- I found out there was a firmware upgrade for the player, but not through their website (where I couldn't find any help whatsoever), but through a friend with the same problem. HOWEVER, the firmware upgrade did not resolve the problem, and the last I heard, there was a class action suit filed here in Pennsylvania (which I received an invitiation to be a part of, but could not participate in, I think because I no longer had the receipt). Considering their lackluster customer support, I would advise anyone against buying any DVD player from this company. Players are much cheaper nowadays anyway, and you can get an excellent Sony or Toshiba for a modest price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty the Invisible Embrace CDs","review":"John O'Donohue's beautiful voice brings alive the poetry of his words to open, soften, delight, inspire listeners to a deeper sence of the Mystery, God which is all around us expressed in everyday life through the infinate sources of Beauty. His book is equally wonderful, hearing his Irish voice is like adding music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of Ache'","review":"I found this to be a wonderfully crafted book about something difficult to hold on to, but in its evanescence, filled with all sorts of shimmering and delightful aspects. Hard to describe, this beauty thing. But O'Donohue explicates and renders a portrait of its throat-hold-taking that captivates and enthralls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like A Painting","review":"I loved this poetic, heart-warming book! The parts that spoke directly to my life were about finding beauty within, about viewing wounds in a new way, and the author's personal encounters with nature in Ireland. I especially loved the excerpt from a poem that begins with a rose blooms without why. His expressions about God and life after death are encouraging and comforting. It reminds me of an intricate museum painting that deserves to be admired for awhile. This book would most likely appeal to those who love poetry, who enjoy heart-felt philosophical conversations, imagination, nature, and God. Containing a multitude of artistic expressions about beauty, it is a book to be read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and cryingly beautiful","review":"I cannot say enough good about the depth and power of John O'Donohue's philosophical and poetical view of life and, more to the point, how it has a profoundly elevating effect on every person who listens to it. It reminds us that we have souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is the type of book one reads again and again over time.

This author was a gift to our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time or price!","review":"I spent 2 hours trying to get a sense of premise from this book and was sadly disappointed. After hearing an interview with the author I expected to to read something on par with Anthony De Mello's thoughtful books but the substance never arrived. The author is clearly thoughtful and perhaps mystical but in this book the scattered thoughts are never united. Perhaps the book can serve as Koan. This recommendation from NPR was one of the rare disappointments from that resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"F. Paul knows it all!","review":"I really enoy F. Paul Wilson books. He seems to have a knack for shows us good characters and plots. I've read just about all his books and not one is bad. This one is no exception. The plot keeps moving and you can't seem to put it down. My only question is: Where is Hollywood? Are they reading any good books to turn into movies instead of some of that ... they turn out? Read this, skip a movie! Boycot!! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fitting sequel to THE TOMB","review":"I never thought Wilson could equal THE TOMB, but LEGACIES comes awfully close. In some ways it's even better. The prose is leaner and meaner, and the tone is lighter. Some parts even gave me grins. Jack has lightened up some, but he's still a dude full of contradictions. He can be such a softie with Gia and Vicky, then go out and cold-bloodedly kill somebody, and I believe him both ways.The plot in LEGACIES is more along the lines of a mystery than THE TOMB, and it kept me guessing all the way. The heroine, Alicia, is a real tough cookie, but you eventually come to know why, and you really feel for her. (As a bonus, I think I found a link to SIBS, one of Wilson's other novels.)If I have a quibble, I'd say I would have preferred a supernatural element in the story, but that's just a personal thing. All in all, I haven't enjoyed a novel this much in a long time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"JACK DELIVERS!","review":"This enthralling tale of Repairman Jack was a long time coming, but worth the wait. Part mystery/part thriller, this action-packed tale moves along at a break-neck pace taunting the reader to just try and put this one down. Even if you do not know who he is, pick this novel up and get to know Jack. You will be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomb was entertaining, this one's not","review":"I read this book a month ago - and I cannot remember if I finished it or not. I enjoyed THE TOMB, but here Wilson tries too much to make another Burke (see Vachss) out of Jack and fails. After reading Legacies, I cancelled all my other orders for Wilson's books. Maybe I'll give him another try (still got Implant - unread) later this year, but I doubt it. Not for people that want to read something with substance during the few free hours of their lifes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repairman Jack Is Back in a big way!!!!!","review":"LEGACIES brings back one of my favorite characters, Repairman Jack. Jack \\"fixes\\" problems for people. He does not exist. A vigillante for hire. In this novel, Jack runs up against an Arab Nation looking to get it's hands on something in Alicia's fathers' house. Trouble is, Alicia's father dies in a plane wreck and she has no intention of ever going back into the house due to some past torment...enter Repairman Jack. After he helps Alicia out on a smaller job, she confides in him that people all around her are dying. There are at least 3 subplots working at all times here and all 3, when connected, make for a supreme read. F.

I look for books with plot intrigue, sharp dialogue and characters that I will either love or possibly hate, with passion. This author fails on all. His writing is immature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks super slick, but works just ok","review":"I got this opener as a gift and I really love the way it looks. Its smooth, sleek and feels great in the hand. However, the gap in the middle means very little contact is made with the bottle cap. The first few times I used it, it slipped. With a little focus, and not too many bottles under the belt, it can work every time. But I am worried about scratching it with slipping, so i am hesitant to use it everyday, because I want it to be nice when guests come over. I give it 4 stars instead 3 because when people come over, this will be the opener I put out. It looks that good.On second thought, I also give it a 4 because it's made in Germany, and I don't drink German beer, so the bottle cap fit might just be a nationality thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well with domestic bottle caps","review":"Works well with only German bottle caps (perhaps all Europe and UK sized caps too).

The puppets are fine, cute and cuddly but the CG animation looks like a high school student did it on the weekend and the stories are just boring and mind numbing. It would have better to just stick to the original Seuss stories with the puppets and real sets, but between the CG and the stories I found it painful to even make it through the whole DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply superb!","review":"I chuckle over the two fake single-star reviews (Messrs Baily and Wallen were people in Grant's life), but it's a shame to see their input calculated in what is clearly a wonderful book. Simpson's going to be on C-SPAN's BOOKNOTES on July 16; catch him there. People like James McPherson and Robert Remini can't be wrong about this masterly biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting, refreshing narrative of a great life","review":"I guess some people did not pick up the same book I picked up (but then people from Waynesboro tend to be a bit odd). Perhaps people who disagree with James McPherson, Robert Remini, Joan Waugh and other professional scholars may not like this book, but I think it a fast-paced story of the life of a facinating American, and I can't wait for the second volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Grant, but this bored me","review":"I have long admired Grant and was hoping this would be a definitive examination of his life. I was disappointed. There was nothing new in the book and it didn't focus its energy on examining Grant's personality or relationships with signaificant others in his life.The sections on the civil war were good and the battles were described well. But I kept asking, \\"Where is Grant?\\" I never got a good sense of what he looked like, how he felt or how he ticked. This was a major stumbling block.The worst area was the author's excuse-making for Grant's drinking. He never simply said, \\"Yes, he got drunk.\\" It was a long laundry list of excuses or casting doubts on many eyewitnesses. This got irritating.It was not an uplifting experience to enjoy the subject of US Grant and be completely bored by a book on his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have all the great narative historians gone?","review":"This uneven account misses the textures to be found in Bruce Catton's 2 volume biography, regretably now out of print. Although Catton's account at times borders on hagiography, his prose vividly recreates the time and Grant's life is lent a richer context than the feeble broth doled out by Simpson. I found it amusing that Simpson's introduction fails to pay homage to Catton's effort and even suggests that Catton half-heartedly wrapped up a project begun by another historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fawning book","review":"This book is just another fawning apology for an overrated general. It also contains some strange inaccuracies, such as the one on page 239: \\"Before long there was bad news, Sherman sent word that in fact he had not taken Tunnel Hill - a deep ravine just north of that location, which had escaped Union observation [italics mine], served to give the Confederates an ideal defensive position.\\" In fact, as is obvious from available records, the entire Chattanooga area was completely mapped by Union topographers. The statement that the ravine served to give an \\"ideal defensive position\\" can only be the result of lack of careful reading about Cleburne's conduct of the defense and ignorance about the terrain in question. Cleburne in fact set up his defensive line at least 500 yards south of the ravine and near the top of a gentle slope almost at the far end of Tunnel Hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced and Thoughtful","review":"This volume, the first of a planned two-volume biography of Grant, covers Grant's life from birth to the end of the Civil War. It is meticulously researched and well balanced. Prof. Simpson doesn't shirk from examining charges of Grant's drinking and he doesn't hesitate to show where such charges cannot be sustained and where they can be sustained. He also doesn't hesitate to criticize Grant's performance on the battlefield where necessary. This is a necessary antidote to the biased, though beautifully written, biography of Grant by William S. McFeely. Unlike McFeely, Simpson displays an understanding of the military aspects of Grant's life and dispells the myths surrounding Grant--some of them, notably Grant's views toward blacks and slavery, perpetuated by McFeely. Anyone seeking to understand Ulysses S. Grant the man and the general will find this book to be essential. One can only hope the second volume is as good as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wide of the mark","review":"I was disappointed by this first volume of Grant's life. The sections on the war were accurate, fair and well-written. But the concentration on the professional areas of Grant's life came at the expense of the private side. A previous reviewer said said this book concentrates on Grant's marriage and family relationships. I found almost none of that in this book.I hope that in volume two, the author puts his concentration on Grant first as a man of the nineteenth century and not as a cog in the wheel of the military or politics. Bruce Catton wrote about Grant in a well-rounded manner, this book is simply too dry for enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRANT: Portrayed as he should be.","review":"I just finished reading this book. I could not put it down. The books was such a smooth read that it drew me in just as a novel might do. I found it to be extremely accurate and informative. It cast a very positive light on the war hero; however, it did so in as no biased a way as possible. The author mentioned evidence contray to his claims and then went on to prove why those contentions were incorrect, rather than simply ignoring evidence contray to his thesis as many authors these days are prone to do. The only problem i found with the book was its lack of maps and that the few maps provided were lacking in much of the details that I would have wished to be present."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE !! For all Civil War buffs!","review":"A Must Have for Grant-a-holics!!! Like Me. Since I have over 30 books on Lincoln, I thought I would do some reading about Gen. Grant. I now have over 10 books about this marvelous military genius. The title is appropriate, he went through a lot of bad stuff before rejoining the Union Army eventually leading to the surrender at Appomatox. Grant has become a hero too me. Check out FIND A GRAVE and you will see my tributes to him. I grew up in Nashville and I am a diehard scalawag. Thank God for Lincoln, GRANT, Sherman et.all. Great read a must have for any \\"Grant fan\\" like me!!! My name is Marilyn not the one above."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This is not a terrible book, but it is a highly irrelevant one. Simpson has nothing new or interesting to say about his subject--he merely recycles material found in earlier, more interesting Grant books, such as the works of Lloyd Lewis, Bruce Catton, and Horace Porter, and his writing style is strangely tedious, as if he occasionally lost interest in what he himself was writing. Simpson sometimes actually manages to make Grant's life look dull--something I had thought was a near-impossibility. Perhaps Simpson's next volume will be more original and involving, but I'm not holding my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little new here","review":"The text appears to be highly derivative of the works which preceded it and the author provides little that is new beyond a spectacularly one-sided view of General Ulysses S. Grant.All Grant's errors are minimized or omitted completely from the story. Praise of the general, sometimes merited sometimes not, goes on and on. Some evenhandedness, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN PLAYSET KIDS WILL LOVE","review":"I love the way Matchbox is designing more products with young kids in mind.

I first got the Haunted House one for my sone and now this Pirates Buried Treasure playset.Kids will love the spooky atmosphere with chilling sounds and lights as the cars pass through the skull island trees and lagoon. Great even for your little imaginext figures even. And for Collectors, I personally think these make wonderfull frightful dioramas for display.

The book has to many characters, and often makes the reader distinguish what's the role of each charter.

But during this period, McDermot stuck with his funky soul theater styleCotton Comes To Harlem was a 1970 film about two cops looking for eighty thousand stolen bucks in a bail of cotton. Ossie Davis directed.This =being a film score gives McDermot opportunities he would not have composing for stage. His soundtrack contains more instrumentals and wonderful funky interludes. These don't deviate from the composer you know--those wha wha guitars and bass spitting out syncopations are in tact. The vocal tracks are also charming and work as soul tracks. Music in 1970 was more funky than when Hair was composed in 1967, and you'll notice this sounds slightly more like an out and out funk album than Hair's theater moves.By the way, if you are an aspiring bass player and want to learn how to play from when musicians knew how, check out the four string work on this--or Hair for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Orb all right","review":"The Orb have certainly slid since the heights of Plateau and Valley.

I hope that the second volume does a better job at \\"getting to the point.\\" If I had to speculate, this book is nothing but a rather large introductory message for volume 2, or at least I hope so.

By that I mean the book does a great job in covering the history of the Siberian Breed as well as the prominent Husky breeders. As an owner of Huskies who is just getting to begin the breeding process, I was looking for an informative book for the do's and don'ts, how to know for sure when your bitch is is season, the average number of puppies in a litter, etc. In short, a book on practical matters. This book devotes a very small portion of its 500+ pages to things of that nature. I must say though, I have not found a Husky book that covers that focuses on this subject. The author does a thorough job of what she does cover, and does it in a way that makes me feel proud to be a Husky owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawed but important book","review":"It took me two attempts to finish this book and I am glad I did.The book is somewhat disorganized and muddled. I gave up on it the first time because it was a little too preachy and the initial description of the author's suffering and frequent crying was a little surpising since he just told us Vietnam finally gave his life a purpose.But then I gave it a second try. After learning later in the book more of his experience in vietnam, I had a better understanding of his pain. I realized what I'd been reading was a vivid account of his post traumatic stress disorder. This book is important and powerful because it shows a way the author found after 20 years of pure misery to alleviate his pain and suffering .

The author's odyssey from an abusive childhood, through bloody combat in the Viet Nam War and his subsequent struggles with addiction, followed by his discovery of a path to inner peace is extremely fascinating. I was touched by Mr. Thomas' candor in addressing the damage that had been done to him, as well as the damage that he had inflicted upon others as a soldier. If you have ever wondered if a path of non-violence was possible, this book offers a practical example that a person can hope to emulate on a personal level.

Even the recordings that are spotty ('Stars' & 'Everything I Touch Runs Wild') have some stellar moments. 'Finest Thing' does not favorably compare to the iffy disks, let alone to her first two. This is not even as good as the bogged down 'House in the Weeds'.Some of the songs here are way too ethereal or just down right new-agey (mostly instrumentals \\"Long Walk\\", \\"She Can't Dance\\" \\"Grey World & 'Glimmer'). Too Julee Cruise/Twin Peaks-ish, but w/out the cool vocals.When Carson does use her vocals they are still interesting, but too few and far between on this disk. I still love when she harmonizes w/herself.I applaud the fact she writes, plays and produces just about everything she does. However, I think she benefited from Anton Fier's production on earlier works (and w/the Golden Palominos)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful!","review":"This is a much different CD from Lori Carson's other CDs.

This album, apparently representing deep meditations can be simply compared to the pretentiousness that is ridiculed in past SNL's \\"deep thoughts by jack handey\\"Perhaps she would do well to collaborate with some evolved musician who can distance the music a bit from their deep thoughts or painful self-reflections. Snore........!I would say this album is typically the self-indulgent, self-referential style that that seems to be part of her recent artistic make-up.There is little to nothing to take away from her music, nor anything that enhancies your experience of music.

There are some general definitions and principles, and the principles are illustrated by these ancedotes. But I'm left without really understanding how it applies to me when I have, or am, a guest. And perhaps it doesn't mean it, the title really is quite accurate.To be honest, I couldn't really follow the story of the duchess, who refused to sit down in order to make a point for complicated status reasons; given the long list of rules at Versailles about who could sit in what kind of chair under what circumstances, this was making a statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit 2002 camry LE","review":"This product does not fit the 2002 Camry LE edition correctly.

I found the book to be very user-unfriendly in its layout, and the index is quite bad (and incorrect in a few cases.) The examples are usually either too short or not explained at all - just a printout of some code, figure it out yourself.Several chapters aren't in the book at all - they're only available on the CD-ROM. If I wanted to read a book on my computer, I wouldn't have bought a real-world book. Finally, chapters 43-57 aren't in the book at all - they're only in the 'gold' version of the book. Three guesses as to where they put the information you'll most want to know about...Possibly this book would make a useful reference to an experienced Javascript programmer, but for someone trying to learn the language, stay far away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal Opinion","review":"I have to say I detest this book !

Mr Bailey covers pretty standard ground in this little book, and in doing so he does do a better job than many other How-To-Write guides. Of course, once you've read a few of these kinds of books, you realise the competition isn't too tough.Unfortunately, Bailey has made his book by endlessly quoting others. Almost all of this book is made up of what other people have said about writing. Flannery O'Connor is quoted again, and again... the same quotes... over and over. Sure, he drives the point home, but Bailey's part is mostly glue and fluff. He seems to have little to say about writing himself.To his credit Bailey has included a pretty good story of his own, and it's the reason he gets two stars from me instead of one. I wanted the author to explain the writing of a short story in his own words, but it seems he didn't feel up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Brown Art Book","review":"A beautiful and thought provoking collection of pictures!

Get Skintight is jammed packed with songs about breaking curfew, dumping dumb boys, trying to find better boys,illegal substances, and of course, rock and roll. The first song \\"get skintight\\" starts the album out on a high energy note, and it just keeps going. The girls also do a great cover of Motley Crue's \\"too fast for love\\". Get Skintight is the perfect pre-party cd to get you ready for some \\"party action\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy effort, but not that great","review":"I bought this CD with high hopes, but instead was let down.

Although often considered a punk band, I think the Donnas are much better described as simply a rock band, and this music is, to me, rock in its purest form. The songs are short, fast, and exciting, with great and very clever lyrics about partying and having fun. Isn't that what rock is about? The world could use more bands like this. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Change","review":"I only listened to a sample, but what I heard, I liked. You wouldn't know it to look at me, but I'm really into classic rock from the sixties and early seventies. I read about the Donnas and saw them in Drive Me Crazy, and decided to try them out.

I read somewhere that The Donnas were the new Ramones and the was exciting. To be expecting the new Ramones and getting this garabage was an extraordinary letdown. Where they especially fail is the lyrical content (or lack thereof). There is nothing clever, rebellious, witty, or angry anywhere.

So the question in my mind is WHY? If the answer is WHY NOT? then so be it- it's a free country. Enjoy yourselves, live and let live. I'm just writing to say that its not the most thrilling thing I've heard. It's not that cute, maybe a little if you like seeing a kid dress up for Halloween. It just seems like they try too hard to live up to that stereotype and should spend more time being real. They're like Kiss but with invisible masks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donnas - 'Get Skintight' (Lookout)","review":"Review no.59. Truly outstanding, WAY above average full-throttled all girl rock 'n roll.

Their playing is decent, but the singing is uninspired. The songs are catchy, but really simplistic; the melodies aren't as interesting as maybe something like the Muffs, a much superior \\"girl band\\".

However, I was shocked and disappointed by this video. I am not a conservative person, but I do monitor what my young child watches.

There were several racially derogatory scenes and Donald and the Chipmunks get into a military style battle over popcorn. Some parents don't mind animated violece, and I will tolerate a scuffle or two, but for me, this was too much.

I turned it off after that. Talked to several other friends to see if I was overreacting & they recall seeing that kind of stuff when we were little but all agreed they don't want their toddlers seeing it anytime soon.

They got a few friends together like Svenonius and Rockwell to help sing the lead. Some songs like \\"Many Rivers To Cross\\" seem like a perfect song for the Walkmen. \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" sounds a little too loose.

Unfortunately, my gamble didn't pay off. This book is alright - has a basic overview of the test format and what to expect as well as 20 sample cases. However, I recently took a peek at a copy of First Aid for CS, and found it to be much more complete. It has several very simple and high-yield test taking tips that Blueprints lacks, and has much more thorough explanations of the sample cases. So I sucked it up and forked over some money for a used copy of First Aid, and feel like I will be better prepared.

As a child of the '70's and '80's who grew up watching tons of t.v. eating sugary cereals and chef boyardee I could see the difference in the health of these children and my own childhood that was riddled with ear aches and other illnesses.I think that if you are interested in the raw food lifestyle this is a must-see, however, split the cost with friends or loan it to others.

The descriptions are short and a bit weak, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon & Schuster Guide to Cactus and Succulents","review":"If I had looked through this book before buying it online I never would have wasted the money on it. Nomenclature is totally out-of-date, temperature guides are just plain wrong, pictures are okay for close up but useless as to identifying overall form and structure. Since so many cactus are mis-identified or misnamed the pics don't help in identification without a more accurate book to cross-reference the plant name with. In terms of coverage of the cactus family this book is woefully inadequate. Entire genuses are omitted and/or only have one plant covered when there are actually dozens of species."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly technical","review":"While this book contains a huge amount of information on cacti, the information on individual cacti is so technically oriented that the book is unsuitable for almost everyone except trained biologists and gardeners (and I have a PhD in astronomy, so I am very familiar with reading scientific literature). The cacti are organized by their latin names, with common names rarely given. Much of the information on the individual cacti is only relevant to identifying or cultivating the cacti. In contrast, such things as the Audobon field guides on birds and mammals present at least small amounts of information on the physiology and behavior of the species listed. The photos are of mediocre quality, and close-up photos of some cacti do not aid in identification. The one saving grace of this book is its introduction, which is written in a lighter style and which presents thorough background information on cacti. Nonetheless, I would recommend other books before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon & Schuster's Guide to Catci & Succulents","review":"I know that Cacti are succulents, but what about the other succulents??

Towards the last tracks, the album loses some of its fire in \\"End of the World,\\" \\"Pimps, Hustlas,\\" and \\"Fallin' Rain.\\" I was also somewhat disappointed in \\"Roll On\\" featuring Afroman. There was not much rap on the track, but that could have been 40's intention to end his song wit just tha music playing.

I have to agree with this, but for different reasons. This book contains some of the best examples of ad hominum arguments, straw man arguments, appeals to authority, false and selective citations and other classic tools for liars that I've seen in a long time. If I were still teaching high school, I would definitely use it in my classes.

For scholarship, look to the great jurists - not to a committed lobbyist.

I was forced to buy this book, and feel that the content and the overall ineptitude of the quality, only re-inforced a few of the book's points, which were not so informative. It reminded me that I wasted so much time and money on something that served no useful purpose. I guess it would be like ordering a multitude of food products that would never have any use in a specific operation. For this reason, it taught very valuable lessons. I believe, however, they could have been learned by spending this money on something more useful. Very poorly written, and often inaccurate.

This book is a quick and dirty version of several other author's materials, rehashed and reworded, with some quotes from people who aren't high on the list of those one would want to emulate. Plus, anyone that quotes Nancy Langdon Jones on the first page as an \\"expert\\" on how to build a successful practice cannot be taken seriously. Dick Koreto has never been a financial planner, nor has he been a successful business owner.

As much as I enjoy some of McPartland's later live dates, including the sets from Yoshi's (1995), the \\"Reprise\\" of the Hickory House Trio (1999) and the Shanghai Jazz club (2001), they don't have the same edge as this evening captured at the Carlyle. As marvelous as McPartland's pianism continued to be well into her 80's, she sounds far more energetic and imaginative in 1979.The recorded sound is excellent; and there's no flaw present in my copy of this cd as referenced by another amazon reviewer, nor does the applause fade away detracting from the sense of a club date as also mentioned in a review.Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dynatrap Company is problematic","review":"The company that makes Dynatrap appears to be going out of business, which we didn't find out until after we purchased the replacement bulbs.

At The Disco, The Housh Sound continues to explore a more unique sound in their sophmore effort Like Vines. The result is a more polished work in comparison with their earlier album So Sudden. The band continues to use a pletohora of instruments to create a sound that obviously stands out among their peers. Like Vines, which now features Greta Salpeter in several tracks, utilizes classical instruments such as the piano with an indie rock sound that is both catchy and easy on the ears; Wine Red is a solid example of the band's revamped sound.

At The Disco in the House of Blues in South Carolina.While they did not put on an overly energetic set, they have a very nice pop sound. While the song, We Intertwined is the 'Hit', the song Lighthouse stood out in concert. Moody and atmospheric is was really great. Each song is generally up tempo and very poppy without being over commercial.The whole album in general has a workman like compatent air and is the kind of music that you can listen to on a regular basis.Talking with them after their set and buying this CD to have them sign was nice.

The only answer is that blood-thirsty hunters would not find it as much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what this nut case is doing in the United States","review":"I did not read this book.

I suspect Treach and his mom wrote some of the reviews. The storyline was bad, the acting was bad, the dialogue was bad and even the fight scenes were bad. Come on now, there was one scene where Treach was breakdance shooting with his gun. And that's not even the worst part of the movie. Don't waste your time unless you could use a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"You really don't expect muchfrom movies where rappers receivetop billing, but this moviemanages to stand apart from the genre.Not only is this a fantastic action film,but it also successfully combineselements of comedy, social satire,and blatant stereotype.The absolute best thing about this movieis the script. Eloquent, funny, intelligent,and full of surprises.Since I'm a person with an overactive mindand short attention span, I'm always quickto note which movies are able to maintain myinterest throughout the entire film. This filmdoes that and never disappoints.I highly recommend this movie for purchase or rental.Above all, I'm glad at least ONE rapper has turned outto be a good actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Violent but very funny.","review":"This movie stars Treach from Naughty By Nature fame as a hit man that is the best there is. The movie tells of his father killing his mother then himself so he is no stranger to violence. This brings him into contact with a white mob type guy who brings him in and teaches him the ropes along with others like him- but he is the best there is. Then the boss hires him to kill his girlfriend but is told if he hears from him by a certain time then to spare her. But when he does so anyway all hell breaks loose in one of the funniest fights sequences I've seen in a long time. There is also a love interest with a Goverment agent and what most people seem to be talking about--Treach's full frontal nude scene that highlight this movie. Violent but funny. The best part is the cooking cornbread while having to go out and do a hit while trying to contact the meat/pick up guys. Very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item Shipped","review":"I dont know how good this product is because the company sent me the wrong part.

Lynn's vocals are sultry, breathy, beautiful, sexy and piercing at times. Lynn uses wonderful vocal range to express her emotions in this 11 song CD. The overall sound of this CD is sombre, yet uplifting in a subtle way. Lynn is in a class by herself when it comes to singing sad love/fullfilment songs in the most beautiful of ways. Unravel has a very organic intimate feel, with eerie guitars swirling in the distance with the vocals in your face, crisp & clear. This Cd would get a 5 star rating (hands down) if it wasn't for a few areas with spotty mixing.This Cd is simply brilliant. Lynn Miles has stepped out of the shadows with possibly one the best CD's of the year...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hole In My Head/The Music of Losers","review":"Lukewarm at best, sounding like satire at worst, this is bloodless, clammy music. I regret buying this CD-- there's one worthwhile track on the album, which is \\"Over You.\\" I heard it in a Starbucks in Chicago.Some songs on this disc actually make me cringe: with lyrics like \\"Here's a toast to the underdogs/the little boats lost in the fog/the ones who don't quite fit the mould/who never do what they are told,\\" Brave Parade tops that list. Other tracks tend towards similar schlock, with an attempt to mine the same shaft that a Coal Miner's Daughter could in \\"Black Flowers.\\" However, Miles is incredibly unbelievable with her brand of painful Americana, her lyricism being thin and her old guitar tiresome.If I could keep it from having a star at all, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arghhhhh","review":"Isn't there any thing out there with some energy?

Amazon wasn't offering it, but one online store based in France had it priced around $40. I kept visiting Amazon and eventually they had it in stock, but for a similar price. Fortunately, the price of it went down significantly for one seller on Amazon, so I purchased it immediately and listened to it over and over. That was about six months ago now and somehow the price has gone down even more! I don't understand how, because supposedly it's an import that is difficult to find. In either case, I can't say I'm too upset for having spent so much money. This music is amazing and I'll never get bored of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag, minimal mess!","review":"As opposed to the standard 12 and 14 inch bags I can find locally, these are big enough to hold a substantial amount of frosting, and are also long enough that I can twist the end cleanly without frosting gooping out.

I found out that you can't declare bankruptcy to be released from student loans (unlike mortgage or business loans etc). I couldn't pay so the banks wrote my loans off at a loss and then sold them as low quality paper to slimier guys down the collection chain. The lowest are loan-sharks and ex-cons coming after me and bothering my family and loved ones (because I listed them as people that know me for over 5 years on the student loan application).

She gets a few satifying 'comeuppances'.The overriding fascination of the book remains its illumination of the social mores and ways of life that seem fantastic to us now.Banffy's daughter and his translator have given readers of English a beautiful jewel.Of course, one must read the final volume 'They Were Divided'to bring closure on this epic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget History","review":"DVD came in an envelope with no case - only a paper sleeve.

I loved \\"Looking For Kitty\\" and about the only thing that this movie has in common with that one is the music (which is very, very good). Everything else is rather boring and Debra Messing looked like a thoroughbred that was being tethered to a bad script. There was hardly any room for her great comedic timing and Selma Blair was like watching paint dry. So wrong for the part. I couldnt believe that she read a book let alone could possibly write one. Patrick Wilson was also not served well by the script and Donal Logue did the best he could with a minimal part. Loved the British accent and was quite surpised at how well he executed it given that he always plays burly, \\"New Yawk\\" city toughs. All in all, for me, it's an okay movie to catch on cable (like I did) but I wouldn't really advise buying it unless you absolutely just have to have another Ed Burns film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing but watcheable","review":"If you like films in which some of the main characters seem depressed and on the edge of falling apart most of the time, you will probably like this movie. it's very watcheable and the characters are interesting in some ways, but for me, the whole thing lacked a bit of zip. It seems to dwell terribly heavily on things like the inability of people to forgive and move on, the inability of the writers to get back to what works for them, and the inability of people to be happy. Things sort of work out in the end, but it's a bit heavy and depressing getting there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Fluff: Lint!","review":"I was rooting for this but I can't get behind it. The characters are just cardboard cutouts and their is no point to the story.

I think Ed Burns needs to come down out of his penthouse and remind himself how real people live and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film Tries Too Hard To Just Be Itself, And Is Somewhat Shallow","review":"The acting was stellar, and the casting is what enticed me to buy it. The male actors are HOT, HOT, HOT mofo's! I think the film visually had an attraction for me also. BUT. I wanted more depth and meaning in the characters and story. The character dialogue was shallow, and the story just kinda moved along without really letting you in on any real revelation. This movie had potential though. I think that if the director had spent a longer time on the actors' expressions and improvised acting, perhaps he could have done something different with the film. To tell you the truth, the film felt kinda empty. And, well, I like feeling empty sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"I love director Edward Burns movies. They touch the heart and open your mind to situations you never thought of before. Some make you laugh, some make you stop and go yea, I get it, and some make you do both.

Brenda Blue was a huge focus as well, as most of the talking was done between Brenda and the planes. (Why they can't just let Brenda wear her hair down is beyond me, she's prettier than they're making her look - she looked strange in the backwards baseball cap.)Tracy made an appearance for a few seconds, but that was it. It's apparent that they're trying to copy Dora the Explorer with the Spanish speaking character - but they went over the top with it.

I detest episodes that show you something and then say, \\"10 days earlier\\" and bring you back to where you were. But this! Oh, please! It kept jumping the timeline back and forth, at least 5 or 6 times before I gave up. And predictable. And not good writing. And the same scene over and over from different points of view.

There would have been half a dozen Apache's, and the game would have been over in seconds.... I can't believe anyone writing this would seriously believe that's the way it works, lol!!!!! If you are going to use the military as part of your show, you need to hire a military adviser. This is a cartoon.

I found myself wanting to skip through conversation after conversation.

Considering I almost didn't bother, it was a welcome surprise. The plot got me hooked, though the flashbacks were a bit annoying until I figured out the pattern.The hook was enticing to me. Others might not care, but I found it at least worth getting the season pass for it. Good call amazon for making the pilot episodes free. You got a buyer out of it.I hope this doesn't get weird like Lost or some other shows do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing return with some unintended laugh lines","review":"Having gotten hooked on this show last fall and waited months for it to return, I find the two new episodes disappointing. They show is beginning to move at a standard Hollywood-TV (i.e., glacial) pace and to utter standard Hollywood liberal cliches. At least for a conservative viewer, some of the lines are howlers. In this episode, our black, Obama-like (but better looking and more forceful) President lectures a new Senator who has become suspicious about the Inostranka facility (where aliens are secretly detained) on the sorry state of affairs in her home state of Alaska: \\"You have the highest unemployment rate in the country! And the highest rate of childhood obesity!\\" Maybe they're planning a nutritionally instructive cameo by Michelle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one lousy show","review":"Come on NBC spend a few bucks and hire some writers who can write and some actors who can act.

Thank god for HBO and Showtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"The previews/lead up to \\"The Event\\" were interesting and I was looking forward to a riveting, well thought out and well acted new series. Not so. This series is boring, the dialog is boring and the acting is double boring. The writers are trying to create an edge of your seat build up moment, but it falls completely flat and left me with not even a warmed over feeling.So not worth it.

He sees something he shouldn't have seen...This is another nice Goosebumps book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The (Exceedingly) Well-Built Story","review":"I really dug this book. It's told in a style so sparse that the story has a strong mythic feel. Ford has created a book that should please both fans of spec fic and those who don't often read genre books. The protagonist reminds me a bit of Ignatius J. Reilly from Confederacy of Dunces; he starts off as a real anti-hero and he made for such captivating reading that I was a little sad to see his redemption arc begin. There are too many elements here that I loved, but the clockwork twins and melancholy monkey bits were especially great. I don't think I've read a book that does dreams this well before. Ever. This book should appeal to those who enjoy Murakami or Kafka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent style, but the message is heavy and trite","review":"This is a charming allegory, only mildly irritating in its vague dream-like quality, until you realize that the thing being allegorized is the Oldest Cliche' of All: You Shall Not Seek Knowledge, Because It Is Evil. It's not very clear whether its main objective is science or technology: perhaps it does not distinguish between the two. Or perhaps it considers both the epitome of sinful wickedness, not even graced by some evil greatness. In the end, the City is destroyed and everybody lives happily in bucolic bliss, renouncing all those gadgets that only make life miserable. I was intensely irritated by the Message this book clearly tries to deliver. The resemblance to Gene Wolfe is, ultimately, superficial and misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I've read better stories on the wall of a truck stop men's room. I was compelled to finish this steaming pile because it was short and I desperately hoped the ending would hang all the disjointed flimflam together into some sort of unified whole. Instead all I got was a dissatisfying conclusion to a couple situations I cared nothing about and a short screed about science and technology being the root of all evil. Really the only thing that was positive about this book was that it was extremely short."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well-written unpleasant novel to read","review":"While well-written, the main character is such an obnoxious person that to read the book was, to me, most unpleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"The morals of this book are that Beauty Is Only Skin Deep and People Should Forgive Each Others' Failings--simplistic enough to be potentially sickening. The imagery of the Fruit of Eternal Life/Knowledge of Good and Evil and the Earthly Paradise likewise could be overly familiar. Nonetheless this book is a masterpiece, largely due to a hallucinatory atmosphere, strange settings, and a sardonic sense of humor. Frankly, I preferred Cley while he was still wicked and the Well-Built City to the Earthly Paradise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"This is the kind of book that might get discussed in a college class on literary interpretation, but which isn't worth reading as a novel. The author seems to aim for an Orwellian kind of social relevance, and ends up with less plot, less character development, and indeed less relevance than Orwell.Science fiction or fantasy readers will be attracted to the premise of a culture driven by physiognomy, but will be disappointed : the idea is never developed at all, as the book turns into an uninterestingly-written fight against totalinarianism in which physiognomy plays no role whatsoever.Nor are any of the other potentially good ideas developed, such as the creature from Paradise or the abilities of the Master.Summary: If you want some mysticism to discuss in your literary club, or if you want to write a term paper for your literature class, go for it. If you want an interesting novel, keep away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpowering Cinnamon","review":"At first sip, this tea was pleasantly sweet and abruptly becomes overwhelming with the sharp, dry taste of cinnamon. Holding the tea in your mouth for a few seconds and allowing the aromas to circulate through the mouth reduced the nasty aftertaste.

I was expecting something that was heavily spiced, but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominent.I didn't want it to go to waste, so I experimented, trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied. I tried steeping it for a short period of time, making iced tea, adding a splash of milk, adding more cinnamon, etc. Nothing seemed to do it for me. I really wanted to like this tea, because it smells so great, but I guess I'll be on the look-out for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy this tea.","review":"They really need to go back to the drawing board on this one.

While the walkthrough is decent the quests are not well organized. A lot of the game is real time dependent and no warning is give. For one quest you need an item that take fifteen real hours to develop yet the book gives you no warning. The worst part is the short cut description of enemy weaknesses. A warning that an enemy is -50% towards light will either mean it is 50% weak toward that element or that elament is only worth fifty percent damage on that enemy. The text description of strengths and weaknesses is much more accurate, but by no means perfect. For one boss one area said it was 100% weak towards dark while just below it said 100% weak towards light. That information is kind of important.

But you can get these in numerous other recordings -- some of them performed better than Ian Sadler here. The real interest comes in the four Canadian works that close out this recital program, composed by Ruth Watson Henderson, Healey Willan, Thomas Crawford and Gerald Bales. All are interesting works from the early-to-mid 20th Century that should be better known. I particularly like the Petite Suite by Gerald Bales, a Canadian organist/composer who was a student of Healey Willan, and who also spent many years at the helm of several large church parishes in the United States. The St. James Cathedral Organ in Toronto is a fine instrument that's well-suited to these later works, and the CBC recording is vibrant with good depth of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"for all the year - summer and winter","review":"this is great ....

The audience here expected the most exciting Mahler Symphony no. 3 performance from everybody who was involved and they got it. I think this recording is even more exciting than Pierre Boulez, Leonard Bernstein, Lorin Maazel, or Maurice Abravanel. Leonard Bernstein's Mahler recording is not what I thought it would be, Abravanel is totally weak, Lorin Maazel is way too slow, Michael Tilson Thomas is too not-Mahler-like, and Pierre Boulez is self-involved but this recording sounds the most similar to the way Mahler himself might've conducted it.

Very inconvenient if you're trying to catch the moment! I have also had the issue of the cover slipping off of the camera and having the pegs break off during storage in the camera case. Delkin was very good about covering that issue under warranty. If I could return the shade and get my money back - I'd do just that. At any rate, I'm in the market for a camera with a view finder. Anyone want a slightly used Olympus?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pay more than $5 for it","review":"Pros:-The concept of an LCD shade is a great idea.-This product does help a bit when shooting in bright sunlight.Cons:-It's so flimsy that I doubt it will last longer than a few weeks. So at $15, it's ridiculously overpriced.-The supposedly \\"clear\\" plastic LCD cover that came with mine isn't very clear, and it scratched easily when I tried to clean it.Conclusion:You might want to give it a try if you can get one for $5 or less. If not, I'd wait for one of the higher-quality versions that are sure to come on the market eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"This did not even last a week. My original one lasted five years.

Didn't get much use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop-up Shade for LCD Screens","review":"I had purchased this prior when in Yellowstone National Park at a Camera Shop. For some reason it fell off on one of my husbands trips to see the grandchildren. Had been on the camera for 4 years and many trips, so had been well used. Love the item as it makes the view finder screen so much easlier to see on a bright sunny day. Bought two. One to put on the camera now, and one as a spare just in case it should get knocked off again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost better than nothing","review":"I have a GE A830 digital camera. It has a 2.5 inch LCD as a viewfinder. In any kind of light, the display provides only reflection of the camera operator. Delkin's website sells this viewfinder shade for considerably more than Amazon, so I bought it at Amazon. The shade slightly reduces glare and reflection, but not enough to be worth the cost (little as it is). I consider this item to be more or less a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This shade was worthless for me.","review":"I have always had a problem using the digital screen on my Canon Powershot A540, except indoors. So I was excited to find out about this product. Unfortunately, it actually makes the situation worse. It includes a clear plastic window that covers the screen on the camera. This turns the digital screen into a mirror, so that when I look into the camera to take a picture I see myself. Worse than useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product for protecting the screen","review":"I love this product, not necessarily for taking photos on a sunny day, but it protects the screen on my digital point and shoot camera. It is protected from breaking and from ugly fingerprints or dirt. My first was broken by two people who dropped my camera and I was unable to find the product at a camera store so I purchased it online. I'm am constantly getting comments from people who think it is an item that came with the camera so I am constantly explaining to people that that can and should purchase it for their cameras. I have no idea if anyone has ever followed up with my suggestion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glare is reduced","review":"Does make a difference with the glare. I like that you can remove the pop-up part if you don't need it, but the screen is still protected. It fits on with adhesive so make VERY sure that you have it on the camera exactly where you want it before applying pressure. Mine is covering the left edge of the screen by a smidgen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I was suspicious about sticking the pop-up shade on my camera, but it isn't bulky at all and pops up quickly when needed. It definitely solves the sun glare problem when taking photos in bright sunlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The Nikon S10 is my first digital that does not have a view finder. I ordered the shade right after getting the camera. I tried shooting pics at an air show, impossible. Since getting the shade all is much better.As a bonus, the shade protects the screen. Get one, you will NOT regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good screen protector and shade","review":"I bought this for the screen on my Nikon Coolpix S10. I bought it mainly to protect the screen when I put this camera in my pocket to protect the screen from other things that might be in my pocket. For that, it does the job perfectly without making the camera significantly larger.It also helps with sun and glare. Those problems are not eliminated with this little device. But they are noticeably improved. And there is no way to eliminate the problem of camera screens being difficult to see in bright sunlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master teacher","review":"This is a first rate instructional video by a man who really knows his stuff and is able to teach it.

I was hoping that it would share the day to day experiences of real modern day pilgrims as they actually walked the Camino along with pertinent historical and cultural side-notes (a non-fictional version of \\"The Way\\" if you will).I was disappointed (to put it mildly). What you get is a lightweight and rather boring historical travelogue that spends most of the time cataloguing the churches and monasteries along the way interspersed the occasional long-shot of walkers plus some staged superficial interviews with half a dozen or so people that had completed the journey.I don't often do reviews, preferring to let people make their own minds up, but I brought this DVD based on reviews and don't want others to make the same mistake that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I watched the move \\"The Way\\" with Martin Sheen.

The Rock and Techno beats are kickin', but I couldn't give it five stars due to the fairly annoying Rap and Austin Powers-style music that adorn Knuckles's and Rouge's (respectively) tunes.

The sound on this cd Is very much in the same vain as early Savatage as well as Doctor Butcher's full length production. The only reason this work did'nt recieve 5 stars was because the very talented former drummer of Darklin Reach, John Osborne, had not yet joined the band and is only featured on the bonus live cuts on this cd.

That's not a bad thing, but I would like to know the reason for this order.

The RSV is one of the most accurate translations and does not use inclusive language like the New Revised Standard Version. It incorporates the Deuterocanonical Books nicely. MDCB also quotes a Saint every day, noting particular Saints' Days. Though MDCB does not follow the Lectionary readings of the Liturgical Year, it provides an additional way for the faithful to familiarize themselves with Sacred Scripture every day. Our Sunday Visitor claims that the readings are twenty minutes long. In average, this is more or less true depending on how fast you read. I have found occasional typos, perhaps one or two since I began reading MDCB around May 18, 2008. And, I wish Our Sunday Visitor provided MDCB in a hard cover edition. Nevertheless, I'm delighted with MDCB and look forward to reading it every day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I really love the format of this Bible.

It has been three months and I have not had one cigarette, since reading the book. The book offers an alternative to other quit smoking books--Going inward to help you end your addiction. I was shock about the horrid stuff found in cigarette smoke and the research quoted in the book about second-hand smoke was enough to make me want to quit. I realized the desire to quit is often not good enough. This book helped me with my spirit, so I could be strong enough to bear the withdrawal symptoms and the weight gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique thriller with one hell of a twist.","review":"Once again Clifford D. Simak shows us the depth of his imagination. Drawing you in to a very familiar world, with superbly crafted charters and Simak's cosy style. Then when he has you where he wants, you suddenly, along with his charters, realize that things are not as they seem. Then you get to see why Simak is one of the most unique and imaginative authors ever. He is able to open the limits of human possibility in ways that few others explore. This story is the story of one very ordinary man and his role in events that change the world. This is a common Simak theme. Simak's heroes are heroes in the way that any of us could be heroes in the right circumstances, not supermen. Like many Simak books this will leave you thinking and enriched."},{"rating":"2","title":"True essence of corrido music.","review":"Sergio Vega is an artist, whom to my good fortune, I recently stumbled upon. His work identifies with those whom have not lost their cultural roots. Each song is packed with vivid sentiments. Track number ten, \\"El Gallo de Sinaloa,\\" expresses how perseverance leads to a sense of pride. Track number nine, \\"Las Parcelas de Mendoza,\\" expresses a profound sense of love and affection. Sergio's work overall expresses characteristics that distinguish the true essence of Hispanic culture.

What I got by buying this DVD was scammed -- it bears little, if any, resemblence to the real McHale's Navy either in plot or, most importantly, in overall film quality. The only -- yes, only -- redeeming value this DVD has is that there are a few decent scenes with Ernest Borgnine. Everything else is in it's corny, weak-minded, far-fetched, light-years-from-reality plot is played by two-bit grade B actors. If you really like McHale's Navy, avoid this DVD like the plague.

There are a few(very few) times, I've liked Tom Arnold. He is not a comedic actor. He's tried many times, why does he keep trying? If you like McHale's Navy, watch the original McHale's Navy.

It supports multi-burning so I can even burn several ones at once.There are also times when I need to put photos and videos on the PSP portable. It has a good sized screen so it's better than iPod for quick media viewing. The steps are straight forward. Plug in the Player to the PC, select the files, then your almost done. There is a selection of compression types too.As long as I have the program I've also set the back up utility to a dvd-rw everyday. That way I won't lose important files that I'm working on."},{"rating":"1","title":"ECM v9","review":"This is the worst Roxio product to date! The company apparently feels that its time to rip off their customers. The program hogs system resources and despite removing some of the more demanding apps I have yet been able to get this program to run smoothly despite having an up to date and capable HP computer. I would ask for my money back but who would you ask? I cant even find support for this piece of @#%* Nice try Roxio!

So far, this has included two reinstalls, plus my first attempt at messing around with my computer registry, to get Cineplayer to work. I still have not located the still-capture function on Cineplayer.I have also had to do extensive reading on how to burn gapless CDs, since the Disc-at-Once function no longer does this. (The answer is that you must use the Music Disc Creator function.)In short, if you already have Version 8, there is no need to upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"I'm terribly disappointed with this product. As other reviewers have noted, it causes system crashes. Also, it takes over the disc formatting feature and RW discs formatted with this product are seen as read-only discs by other formatting systems. And I'm not talking about competitor's formatting systems, I'm talking about Easy CD Creator (a forerunner of this product) and Sonic Record Now which is also currently a Roxio product.It's also not all that good at its own utilities, I found the DVD burning options not as good as the Sonic Record Now that came pre-loaded on my computer. Unfortunately I had to do an F11 system restore to get the formatting function of Sonic Record Now back, and after the F11 it took me 4 days to restore all my data and system updates.Don't even think about buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peez ov sheet","review":"Geez, I also wish I had looked at the reviews before buying this crappy software package.

This software claims to be cool with Vista, it is not. Not even a little. It installed for me fine (hint, right click on the installer and run as an administrator - it helps). I wanted this software to do three things: 1) burn audio CDs 2) burn DVDs and 3) import video from MiniDV tapes. It can't do any of those things without crashing! How, oh how, is that at all vista compatible. Uhh, yeah, it's not.

I called tech support and they made me aware of the issue.

Unfortunately, release 9 has all the polish and usability of something created by a couple of guys in their garage over a weekend. To start, Roxio forced me to uninstall my previous version (8) but in my case left behind 400 plus megs of no longer needed or usable files. After installation and on first use, the program choked and froze. Three tries later, it was still freezing at different points. The solution, according to Roxio's help desk after three calls, was a fresh \\"clean\\" install. This requires you go to the Microsoft web site, download a hidden programs control panel and remove all the Roxio files manually, edit the register (dangerous) and on and on. There's more but I won't take up your time. After a fresh clean install, it still crashes. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME. Wait 6 months for a cleaned up version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalously Poor Program !!!","review":"Three weeks into trying to de-bug this dreadful software, and three weeks into NO tech support (\\"Roxio Support\\" is an oxymoron), I filed a complaint with Staples, from whom I had purchased it. Staples took my complaint seriously and used its influence to get a Roxio rep to call me. Finally the Roxio rep conceded that do to, er, \\"issues\\" with the software, it is not capable of doing the rather pedestrian tasks I needed, tasks by the way which version 7 did with no problem.

For the umteenth time, I pull it up to work on something today and it fails to let the part I want to run open. The main screen comes up and some of the features work fine. However, features that worked fine last week do not now. You can click on them and they just fail to start up. I run an extremely well maintained and fast computer and don't have problems like this with any other software. I will now have to reinstall the program YET AGAIN. Maybe you are supposed to just reinstall it every time you want to use a feature? Maybe that's the plan.I'd give this a 5 for the value if it didn't keep failing and requiring installation or some fix.

In the morning the status was stuck on 16% complete, and wouldn't budge for the rest of the day. Roxio needs to do more beta testing on this product so that it can detect wmv videos it cannot encode.

If you have a problem, you must pay $35 to speak to someone about your troubles. Alternatively, you can send them an email, and then wait 24 hours for a response, write back, wait again, etc. They do have some techs available via chat, and if you are really patient you might get help.

It is typical of much of the software coming out lately - rushed to market before being fully tested, trying to do too much and ending up doing nothing well. Roxio has no answers, just wants to blame hardware even if the same hardware works fine with similar programs. Every problem I had with this suite with errors, hangups, and overall performance do not exist with other programs I use on the same equipment. I really suggest that whatever your needs, find a program that does one thing well and doesn't require special resources that are not delineated in the products specified requirements.

When I tried to copy an auido cd this time it said 25 hours estimated time remaining. Then it kept going up to 33hours then 60 hours. After 1/2 hour of waiting I canceled and started over. Everytime I did this the same thing happened. I tried communicating with Roxanne but there wasn't anything close to my problem. So i gave up, and I was gonna call them today.

For almost 2 weeks, we set the traps altering between peanut butter & cheese. Each morning, we'd wake up to find the peanut butter gone, but the trap still set. We tried setting it both ways (firm & sensitive), but it didn't matter.Before long, we saw a baby mouse running across the floor. Ughh!

It takes too much force for it to snap probably because there is 1/8\\" - 1/4\\" of play in the lever before it snaps. To prove that these absolutely don't work, I very carefully eliminated the play in the trap and placed the bait in the hardest to reach part of the paddle.

The only time I caught a mouse with these traps was when it accidentally walked into it. I could tell because its head was nowhere near the bait.

I guess since it takes a lot of pressure, I'm safe, but it still makes me nervous.These might catch very stupid or clumsy mice, but evolution and adaptation have favored intelligent mice who know how to help themselves to the bait before happily scurrying away.

Having said that, I believe that you should still hire yourself a professional patent attorney to file and prosecute your application before the Patent Office. There are just too many intricacies in patent law and in the patent process to think that you can know them all by reading a book. If securing a meaningful patent were that easy patent attorneys would be out of work. In short, be an educated consumer. Read the book, ask your attorney questions and be interactive in the process.

This one is little different from the others, except that it includes a DVD, which is just a gimmick really, as the written instructions are more than clear.

It seemed like a bargain. In fact, I liked the DVD better than the book itself. Now, I am new to Texas Hold 'Em Poker, so the book shold be perfect, as it presents itself as an introduction. The problem for me is that the book is still too jargon-heavy for my taste. I got the book over a week ago and played my first live games this past weekend, with rather poor results.

I may well check out the other books on the subject, some of which are highly recommended.Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I have never read such and incredible book before. Not only did Sister Secrets offer drama, it offered mystery, and comedy. This book was so good, it's in a class of it's own. I was on the edge of my seat from the second page.

I was a little confused in the begining but once I got into it was great. Even though I had to flip back and forth to remember the numerous characters it was still a good book.

I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Sorority Members","review":"Being a member of a Greek Lettered Organization, I found the book to be quite interesting because it touched on the bonds of friendship and Sisterhood despite the difference in the Organizations mentioned.

There were a few gramitical errors that I thought should have been taken care of before the release, but who I am to judge. If you are using this book to learn about sororities, then it is not a good resource and it shouldn't be. Look at the sororities history that you are interested in. Being in a sorority I was able to relate to the characters in the book. I suggest that you make a chart so that you can follow the book. I had to do a lot of going back and forth during the book, someone suggested that I make a chart after I had almost finished, but it will help. The characters get confusing.

Anyone that is interested in pledging a sorority or even a fraternity should read Breggie James \\"Sister Secrets.\\" I was captured by the books essence. A particular character \\"Jennifer Stevens\\" captured my heart. Jennifer reminded me so much of myself. Jennifer was so shy, quiet, innocent, and pretty. After joining the sorority of her interest she quickly changed. She became a leader, outspoken, and most of all she blossomed into a women. Something I hope I will get out of joining the sorority of my interest. Like I said before, if your interested in joining a sorority. This is the book for you. Why? Because, it will truly intrigue you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story with fascinating characters","review":"Once I figured out the characters and who belonged to what sorority or fratnerity, I found the book intriguing and hated for the story to end. This book reminded me of my pledge days in college; it gave great detail to Black Greek life on a college campus. The sorority life had a positive influence on its member, especially in developing their character and grooming them to become productive and successful women. Amazing how the author had the character's lives to become entwined! I am looking forward to reading the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hard To Follow","review":"I think that this book was very hard to follow though it provided a lot of insight to the greek life on college campuses i think that it sometimes focused on the little things that did not matter or things that really did not tie into the story too well. Also the one major thing that drove me absolutely crazy about this book was how it went from one sorority to the next basically telling the same story over again which became really frustrating. Like the previous critic said I was just happy that I got through the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Me Breathless and Hungry for More","review":"I enjoyed the book as well. I received it as a Christmas present from a soror. This book represents the trials and tribulations of sisterhood and mother/daughterhood. I love how the characters were interwoven.

The book unfortunately has a very male-sexist undertone which ruined my experience of reading the book. I feel that forgiveness needs to be an aspect when dealing with abuse situations and reading a healing book that bashes males was not getting me close to forgiveness. (I happened to find a great husband and I did not want my view of my husband to be tainted by a man hater.)The book is geared more towards women who have been raped and solely focuses female rape victims, with males being the offenders. This isn't always the case in reality and it was hard for me to not feel as though the writer was a rape victim herself and maybe didn't fully recover from her situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential, but didn't make it.","review":"I loved this scooper when I first got it. I chose it for it's ability to be cleaned in the dishwasher, and the great reviews on its scooping capability. However, now after three months of use, the handle is starting to separate a slight bit from the scooper. This causes a slight wobble in scooping, but it also causes water to seep into the opening while in the dishwasher. When I remove from dishwasher, water comes dripping out. I'm afraid over time this situation will deteriorate, and perhaps cause rust or mildewing in the interior of the scoop.Addendum: I contacted Cuisinart, whose reply was that they contract out their small kitchen gadgets and therefore cannot send a replacement. They said they would refund me it if I send it back, which is pointless since the shipping cost would come close to the product cost.

I know sampling portions of other songs isn't unheard of in this or many other music genres, but it just seemed odd that a dance song would sample from an obscure kid's movie.

This black cherry herbal tea does very well for this -- at about one bag of black cherry herbal tea per three bags of regular black tea. It is not as tart as a \\"zinger\\" type tea -- rather just spot-on to back the black cherry blend.

A lot of the action that turns out to be relevant happens off stage and you don't know about it until the very end. But that's fine it doesn't really detract from the humdrum story. The story (when it finally get around to it) is about wrapping up major international drug dealers protected by all kinds of corrupt Wash DC cops. That sounds real enough. That sounds interesting but the reality is in this book it is at best diverting. The orginal receipt was in the book as a bookmark. Someone paid $2.98 for it in the Crown Books (RIP) bargain bin in 1993. My wife got it as part of a box of books for $5 from our local library. At that price it was fine.

As far as the backing singers, they're mixed a little \\"hot\\" sometimes, but they sing GREAT! (See \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\"). The guitar does get a little lost here and there, but the band is solid and tasteful- mostly.

Lewis' The Wizard of Gore based solely on the casting of Crispin Glover as Montag the Magnificent. Unfortunately this opportunity for a fun revamping turned out to be horribly directed and acted garbage that has none of the energy found in the original. The biggest problem is Kip Pardue, an actor who delivers his lines like he's reading the ingredients off a cereal box. Since he's the main character the film spends 90% of its time on him, and it makes for a very dull viewing experience. Lewis fans looking for the \\"gore\\" of the title will also be left sorely disappointed. Even Glover is disappointing, approaching the Montag character as more of an evangelist than a magician. The best parts of the movie belonged to Brad Dourif and Jeffrey Combs, two actors that could teach the kids in it a thing or two about how to properly go over-the-top. Coming on the heels of 2001 Maniacs, The Wizard of Gore just doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"I totally love the original Wizard of Gore.

The random full nudity was neither tastefull or needed really at all, and frankly when it kept cutting to the flashback of the lead character at a strip club i simply just turned it off because they had lost all credibility of even trying to do a remake.if your under age and are tired of the \\"amazing\\" plot of the american pie movies then rent thisits just plain terrible but theres nudity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was excited to see Crispin Glover in a remake of the HGL classic The Wizard of Gore.

Wide Awake (aka The Return) is not a cheap slasher as the cover depicts.On the contrary, it's a very entertaining thriller with a lead antagonist who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder after experiencing anesthetic awareness during a childhood surgury. This is chock-full of originality because the killer uses exotic medical tactics to dispatch his victims. The orchestration behind one particular murder is magnificent, going down as an instant classic in cinema. However, the final half hour drops the ball a bit with an unoriginal, cliched climax and a few too many twists that take the already stretched realism and throw it out the window. A better ending would have made this film critic-proof, but in its current state it still packs quite a punch.Do yourself a favor and see this.

Vol XV included a very early - perhaps the first season - episode with a dark-haired kid as Doctor Forrester's assistant instead of TV's Frank. In general our family prefers the Mike episodes for the better writing and funnier skits.

None of the four movies in this collection reach the transcendant awfulness of, say, \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate\\", but there are many fine lousy moments here. My personal favorite is \\"The Girl in Lovers Lane\\". where our heroes get to riff on a really stupid \\"troubled youth\\" story.

If this is what you expect, then dont buy this product. But for an 8.4\\" LCD, I think it is very good, especially for a kitchen TV which, lets face it, if your in the kitchen, your probably doing something else other than staring at a TV. All the channels over cable come in quite good. Over the air doesn't work all that great, but if you plan on running cable, you'll be fine. I receive every FM station in my area just fine and the audio crystal clear - no static, and the DVD player works great. The picture on the LCD TV looks very nice with the DVD.

Charles Faudree manages to create the classic look of country French with classy, gorgeous antiques, home-y, warm accessories (lots of dogs, books, French toile, objects from nature) and gorgeous fabrics and wallpaper. This is the way houses should be decorated. I have all his books and readily rate this as his best; \\"Country French Living\\" comes in as a close second, and if you really love decorating with antique dogs, I would highly recommend his latest book, \\"Details\\". I will be enjoying this book for years to come, thank you Charles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy and Wonderful","review":"I love Charles Faudree's style and the book is just what I expected. If you love Charles Faudree you will love this book. The rooms have warmth and character and very french country."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive disappointment!","review":"I've admired Mr.Faudree's work in Traditional Home magazine and just knew I would love the book. Unfortunately, most of it was a rehash of photos and text I'd seen before. The rest was dull and tired. If you are looking for something fresh and authentic, this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stroll through the 1980s","review":"The pictures in the book are a stroll through the 1980s. The interiors look as if they've been around that long. I found the book a real bore, even though I like current country French and Italian styles. This book just doesn't look current.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks dated","review":"I received this book as a gift (because I am always decorating and my friends know it), but this book left me cold. The rooms look very old and dated to me. Like something my mother would have liked 20 years ago. The rooms are too fussy and showy and busy for today's tastes. I can see, though, how this book might appeal to the nouveau riche in suburbia, but the rooms don't leave much space for personal style or creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is phony French","review":"Maybe I'm a snob because I'm from Missouri which has such deep French roots. Maybe it's because my family is French and we've travelled to France many times. But the rooms in this book are phony French. I suppose Charles Faudre, whoever he is, doesn't know any better, but he should have called this book Nouveau (riche) French or French for Dummies. The rooms are pretty enough but they're too \\"done,\\" too planned, too busy, and too precious to be anything like the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just got my copy, and I am very displeased with it","review":"I am displeased with this book because it doesn't seem to be \\"au courant\\" in how it portrays French Country style. French Fussy would be more like it or Suburban French. The rooms are too full, formal, sweet, and busy to convey the relaxing ease of true Country French style. This is like old Country English which someone has tried to say is French. I also agree with the reader who said it looks like the 1980s. Yuppie French? Oui."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love French but I don't love this","review":"I love French style but I don't love this book. I think Mr. Faudri has his French and English mixed up. I think the rooms look like an odd mix of breeds. I also don't care for the fact that the rooms pictured in the book have a terrible amount off furniture and accessories in them. It's too much and the result doesn't look authentic but self-conscious, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to join this discussion.I think this book is boring.","review":"Thanks to the other reviewers who had the guts to say that they didn't like this book. I bought it and was very disappointed in the rooms it pictures. Fuddy-duddy, frumpy, phony, and \\"too studied\\" come to mind when I look at these rooms. I think the rooms look rather old and drab too. They certainly are nothing like the bright and lively country French and northern Italian country style that I adore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't grab my soul","review":"I adore all things French so I am puzzling over my response to this book. I don't like it. It doesn't grab my soul the way real French style does. This book misses the mark by a mile. Of course, isn't this designer from Tulsa? (Oh, sure! That's where I go for decorating ideas.) Come on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"A very modern pretty set at a very reasonable price. I tend to break them on a regular basis however but at this price... just order more every year or two - My only dissappointment with this set was... they use to have a very heavy, thick glass bottom (very nice) now they look a little cheaper with a much thinner glass bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glasses crack VERY easily","review":"I really thought I was getting a good deal on these glasses especially since I've always thought Anchor Hocking products were good. However, 4 of these glasses have chipped or have a \\"hairline\\" fracture already. None have been hit against anything else. I can only imagine they lightly touched each other in the process of washing. Amazon really should remove these from their lineup. Someone else had made a similar comment about these glasses, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. My mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"looks great","review":"Just what we were looking for cocktails and beverages. they are easy to hold and look great. hope they last"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition","review":"We wanted to expand this collection for my son since he loves his round house station. We travel alot so it is nice to have this set. I do not believe this set is intended to make a complete track, it is intended to expand the sets you already have. It does what it is supposed to- allow you to expand the track and make different track designs for the kids. My two year old is figuring it out, but for now I help him with it. It is pretty durable and he is happy with it. I don't have much trouble but no, you aren't going to make a complete track with no loose ends. Just use your creativity. that's what this toy is supposed to do- give kids the opportunity to be creative in developing their own tracks.I think it's great and I will probably buy my son the switch and change track pack too. He prefers this set to his wooden set and the trackmaster set is just too advanced for him... just an FYI..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Handle and Use","review":"My 4 year old son took an interest in the take-along Thomas trains and wanted some track to go with them. The track is easily put together by him. It is lighter than the wooden track so he can handle a large box of pieces without a problem. The \\"rails\\" are wide enough so that the trains pass easily on them. (They are also wide enough for Hot Wheels/Matchbox cars). He loves this track and I think it's a great item."},{"rating":"2","title":"take along thomas straight and curved tracks","review":"The straight and curved track pack is just what my grandson wanted. The Thomas take along sets do not have enough tracks to make different track layouts. This was perfect. It is too bad that the sets do not come with enough straight and curved tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival","review":"Must be something wrong with the battery pack, charger puts out but the battery will not charge. Black and Decker states I will have to send it to a repair service center."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery problems","review":"I bought this light a year ago for use during black-outs or when I was working on the car. The light was never used for more then five hours total and the battery is already dead (it will only hold a charge for about five minutes). The light is good and I do recommend this light if you have the option to leave it plugged in; but if you're looking for a good cordless light look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad battery design","review":"This is the perfect gift for the garage nut. This makes working on your car a lot better. I would recommend this to anyone. Battery ended up dying. You can't leave it plugged in. Company said to unplug when charged. How do I keep track of its charged status if I don't use all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes dim too fast!!!","review":"A co-worker of mine owns an older version of this light. I really liked it so I decided a year later to buy one for myself. Obviously, there were many changes in manufacturing between the times he purchased his and when I purchased mine. When I start using the light, it starts out bright (although not as bright as my co-worker's) and after only a few minutes of use, the light gets real dim. After 15 to 20 minutes I am unable to use it at all. At first I thought it was the battery running low, but now I believe it's the L.E.D. bulbs themselves over heating and dimming out. The plug connector on the charger is different between the two versions of this light, which may or may not have anything to do with it. It may be an isolated incident with my light, but by the time I figured out what the problem might be, I am way past the warranty timeline. Do yourself a favor....save your money and DO NOT purchase this light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad!","review":"This product is just bad. I was fixing an A/C in a 4x4x5 air box and it would not even provide workable light. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dim","review":"Wonderful product BUT it's not very bright. I have a corded fluorescent version that is a workhorse - quite possibly the best $20 I've ever spent on a tool. Unfortunately it has a heavy cord and therefore not as agile a device. The black and decker device, on the other hand, is ineffectual as a lighting apparatus. I can't imagine using it to change a tire in the middle of the night. I'm disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor product","review":"Others have it dead on. This light will not hold a charge for anything -- so short in fact I consider it useless on battery. It is highly directional and a very dumb design since it was obviously supposed to be an area light, NOT a flashlight. B&D should recall this piece of junk and issue either a redesigned, i.e., functional area light, OR issue credit. Very disappointing B&D product that should have never left the test area."},{"rating":"1","title":"It;s not the best","review":"I think the album was okay its not the type of spanish reggae i was looking for but other people may like it. It had some good beats and i just hop you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am still in the dark about sub files","review":"The book starts off with a sample subfile program with sample RPG coding. It then goes on to adding Windows. How do you do it? There is no sample coding to go along with it. This book was not written for someone \\"learning\\" subfiles. You would be better off getting out an IBM manual and saving the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive primer on domestic policy","review":"While this candidate briefing book is aimed at would-be state legislators, it is equally useful to grassroots activists. It provides 2-page summaries of the progressive/liberal arguments on 90 different domestic issues, and refers the reader to both in-depth research and model legislation. Progressives need more practical, easy-to-use political tools like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money! Low cost way to convert that old ten speed to a single speed.","review":"You always get what you pay for, but I am very happy with this crank set. The chainring face looks a little more solid than shown in the photo, but for $20 I can't complain. Also, the chainring is one piece (it doesn't attach to the crank arm with five little bolts like you normally see). I think the machining on the left crank arm socket is a little out of whack because it won't go as far on to the left square taper bolt on the bottom bracket as the my previous crank set. If you get the nut tight, then you shouldn't have any problems.You're not getting a Campy crank set, but for the money this is a great way to make that old ten speed into a single speed or fixed gear. I also bought a 16t freewheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frivolous","review":"I got this book as a gift from a friend of mine. Unfortunately it was trite and tiresome. Nothing of real substance, but a riot for dilletantes or those with time to read but without the mind to know what to read. It barely skims the surface of the things rambles about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Believe What Lennox Says?","review":"Very early in the book in his discussion of the origin of the use of \\"Dixieland\\" to describe the Southern US States,\\" Lennox indicates that the purported author of the famous song, \\"Dixie,\\" Daniel Emmett, was a Black man. In fact, Emmett was a Caucasian member of a then-popular minstrel troupe known for derogatory Blackfaced impersonations. Published photograps of Emmett leave little doubt as to his heritage. As a matter of fact, the authorship of \\"Dixie\\" remains in question since it was copyrighted well after the song became popular. Perhaps this is the only factual error in the book, but one must wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lightweight book - some factual errors.","review":"This book has some interesting tidbits, but overall it is a very light read. Anyone who is looking for deep research or expanded explanations will end up disappointed by the author's breezy examinations.The book also has a few flat out errors. One example is in the section explaining the phrase \\"the die is cast\\". While the author does correctly attribute the saying to Julius Caesar, he incorrectly ties the words to the act of throwing dice. Actually, the \\"die\\" refers to a molded metal piece used to make other metal pieces (such as the template for stamping coins). Once the die is \\"cast\\" in the metallurgic sense (same as \\"cast iron\\"), it cannot be changed or modified. Hence its use by Casar when crossing the Rubicon. Games of chance had nothing to do with it.\\"Now You Know\\" will take an hour or so to get through, and won't substantially add anything to your life except a few (somewhat accurate) vignettes on word and phrase origin. My verdict is: skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enrobe yourself in the path of peace.","review":"After reading a couple of pema chodrons books, i must say im becoming a fan.

I was wrong. It is an after-market Phanstiehl with a much thicker, heavier cantalever. It does work, but tracking is not nearly as good at low VTF as the original AT stylus.I would have been better off spending a few dollars more, and buying a second AT92e cartridge, which comes with a real AT stylus. Buyer beware, but the seller should have made this more clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"An adjustment that fell short","review":"At the time of this album, the band was looking for new ways of making an epic sound and, basing their assessment perhaps on black metal listeners who simultaneously chanted \\"simpler, rawer\\" and \\"more keyboards,\\" Graveland cut an album of long, repetition, loosely layered songs that seems hasty in both vision and product. It is an admirable attempt, and there is good stuff on here, but the density is not there, and thus intensity is sparse enough to fail to keep the interest of an alert listener. Please, do not ruin yourself as a Graveland fan, buy this one last; in the meantime, \\"The Celtic Winter\\" is probably the experience you seek."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars?????please,give me a break...","review":"With this album, Graveland showed everything...first of all, they suck as black,gothic,doom,whatever kind of metal they wanted to play...guitars look more like punk,with very basic metrics and chords.

In this case the flavor of rose hips and hibiscus does not overpower the other flavors (unless you brew longer than 4 minutes). The aroma of this ruby potion is deliciously citrus and full bodied. The flavor of the tea is sweet red grapefruit and orange. Very tasty! I imagine this would make an excellent ice tea. Also, it is caffeine free and has added vitamin C--45 mg.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

Put 10 bags (half a box) in the crock. Pour the hot water in and let the bags steep an hour or overnight. Take the bags out, fill the rest of the crock up with water, and put in the fridge to cool.This is such a great alternative to sodas and black tea.

This and several other CD-ROM titles by Mercer Mayer can be played in several languages including German, perfect for our bilingual family! My two-year-old listened to it about 4 times in his first session. The story is straightforward and leaves nice pauses between sentences so mom or dad can repeat or explain if necessary.

I came out of seeing what must be done to get that cherished badge with a BIG mix of emotions. But it did make me want this career more than I did before seeing the film. It also helped that there was a mix of ages in the Fire Academy class that they follow, since I'm 34 just starting to go at this.Bottom line--the film is engaging and fantastic to watch, whether you just want to know a little more about firefighting, or you are someone entertaining it as a career.

What divides both universe and human being is conflict twisted into hardcore riffing in majestic songs of rising melody in the midst of chaotic harmonizations toward the sweeter side of darkly dissonant.

No Rest For The Dead is unlike anything I've heard before... in a good way. At times they can sound like Brutal Truth, but then they break into some funk-ish bit (albiet distorted funk) and somehow they can do this in a way that doesn't make me feel like throwing the CD away. The last track on the album, which has a strong Planet Of The Apes theme to it, is very impressive and goes on for over fifty minutes (though a fair portion of the time is actually dead space). The only noticable flaw with this album is that the mix is somewhat rough, but it never comes close to making the music hard to listen to. I nearly saw these guys live before I bought their album, and now I'm kicking myself for skipping the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nazi book reader.","review":"I am amazed at how much is written about Hitler & the Nazi rise to power.

The introduction of worldwide species of mockingbirds is well done, as are the sections on U.S. distribution and range extension. The sections on life history include great pictures such as feeding young in the nest, and a fledgling flapping to try to get off the ground. My favorite section was on the mockingbird in American Culture, and early mentions to the mockingbird include William Bartam's trip through the south east, James Fennimore Cooper, and John Burroughs. Artistically Audubon's (unrealistic) depiction of the mockingbird fending off a rattlesnake is included.

I was advised to feed my new dog in her crate for a variety of reasons (teaches her to associate good things, like food, with the crate, she'd need to eat in her crate when she's shown, etc.)This is a new practice for us so I had to consider how I was going to do this in the cleanest, simplest manner. I ordered the larger, 26 oz. sized bowls for our German Shorthaired Pointer. Easily holds her 2 cups of food. She doesn't really spill a lot of water either. Occasionally she'll knock them off the wall--the hooks don't secure tightly--but it's actually rare--and she's still a puppy. One thing that probably helps with that is that her crate is big--bought for her eventual size. These are relatively inexpensive, sturdy enough, and easy to clean. A slight annoyance is that when I pull them out usually the ringed holder comes out too--but it's no big deal. The bowls work.

This would be perfect for any dog eating 2 cups or less at meal time. The bowl itself is sturdy but I did have to zip tie the hanger to the kennel to keep it in place, but that was not a make or break it issue for me.

Another example...\\"Said the mother mouse to her child, I love you as much as the grain in the mill.\\" I think what she means to say is \\"I love you as much as there's grain in the mill.\\" I think we all love our children more than a large stockpile of food.

As long as you don't turn them up too loud you will be ok. Although the sound quality in general leaves a lot to be desired.Annoying Volume Control - whenever you switch the radio on it preset the volume to 17 (wich is pretty loud) so you have to get your ears blasted every time.So if you are on a budget, or don't like music too loud, it is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted about a month","review":"I bought it 4 months ago, but didn't install it until about a month ago. I listen to audiobooks, which means leaving the unit on \\"pause\\" for hours at a time sometimes (maybe not a great idea, electricity-wise, but it's never caused a problem for a CD player before). The unit simply turned off and doesn't turn back on now, and there's a CD trapped inside. I called customer service, who told me that a transformer might have blown and that it's out of warranty (which was fine with me, it would not be worth the hassle and cost of shipping it just to get another one of these lemons). They had no ideas as to how to get the CD out, other than \\"call a repairman\\" (no thanks, I've got a hammer.) They did say if I send them the unit plus $30, they'll send me a new one.

The Plus being a great book for intermediate reading crowd of 7-11 year olds. A whimsical story that relates to something all kids have seen on the street, a hydrant. I highly recommend the book because I myself as a Mom with 2 kids have enjoyed it from beginning to end. The only things I see that the book needed are more drawings within the book, because children love visuals. Another would be, the cover could have been a more attractive one. The cover doesn't invite the reader to delve in the pages because it is not that eye-catching. The story is great, but to have kids excited to read it, the front cover should be changed to something more inviting. Great job though MR. Baltazar, more thinking caps to you and your next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"The book is full of vivid imagination. I believe it really does speak to children ages 9 to 12. It takes time, imagination and the thinking of a child to write children's books and I believe Ray Baltazar was succesful in his endeavor.

Nevertheless, some might find it a useful guide to what is possible when you persevere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, self-serving and badly written.","review":"This book is shallow, self-serving and badly written. The writing style is reminiscent of high school journalism and the author offers very little in the way of analysis. Her descriptions of post-Communist Russia are often accurate, but melodramatic and lacking in depth or introspection. Her description of Zhirinovsky is painfully long:... Finally, though Gould claims to be fluent in Russian (contrary to the testimony of her Moscow Times colleagues), her book contains numerous transliteration errors, a sloppy oversight for which St. Martin's Press must share the blame. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy and superficial","review":"Author spoke bad to no Russian and hung around gleaning her 'wisdom' about the country from the likes of english-speaking cab drivers. the worst and most tiresome crutch of a linguistic naif in a foreign country is to look for local color from a cab driver. Plenty of fluent Russianists wrote during this era; seek them out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extended tabloib column","review":"This is not a profound book. Though at times comical and endearing it reads a bit like an extended tabloid column. There is a tendency at trivializing the events in the former soyuz (the union) with the aim of offering us a pastiche of civil society there, but there is little effort to go beyond the events. The post-modern title is very telling in that sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's not a MUTT !","review":"Finally, a \\"White Hat\\" who gets it...they are a rare breed.

In terms of literary value \\"Roots Schoots\\" lacks intellectual depth. Mr. Jacobson is full of hate, prejudice, and uses irony, skepticism, and in many instances disrespect for the values imbedded in Jewish culture.

Only then will he be able to judge \\"jewishness!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal!","review":"Wow.

This is a COMEDY, it is NOT a horror film by any stretch of the imagination. Sure people do sick things to each other but most of the time they constantly say such goofy things that NOBODY would ever say in real life (or even in a half-way decent movie) that it becomes one big ugly wink at the audience. The majority of the running time is just this guy getting humiliated like it's some kind of feminist fetish video. Also most people will probably HATE the ending. Save your money and keep looking. This is a really goofy stinker with a misleading trailer geared to rip-off horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Generic","review":"I'm really surprised by all of the high praise in these other reviews. I didn't find anything at all unique about this movie. I've already seen Texas Chainsaw, Frotiere(s), Hostel, and any other movie where someone is tied to a chair and tortured for someone's amusement until the end when they escape. This one just incorporated a prom theme. They could have at least hinted at explaining why she was so crazy and murderous and why her dad would help facilitate her psycho desires. What happened to the mother? What happened to create this couple? They'd been doing it for a long time. And what was with the sub-plot with the dorky kid and the goth chick? I think their purpose was just to make this movie longer. If you like torture porn, this is another great one.

That said, this movie didn't make any sense. It has no plot to speak of, and the few subplots it had didn't go anywhere.The basic premise of the movie is that a long-running live radio show is going off the air because the theatre they use is being turned into a parking lot.

All of the actors are playing caricatures but Kevin Klein takes home the ham for over-acting. On top of that, the performances were so loose that at times I thought Altman turned on the camera, threw out the script, and just let the actors goof off.

The best things about it were the comic deftness of Kevin Kline (funny almost no matter how trivial his material) the singing of Streep and Tomlin, and also Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly. Only Kline elicited any laughter at our showing. The audience seemed almost put to sleep... never a good thing.

Metaphors abound, and I have no doubt that if I sat down to watch the movie again I would find things that I missed the first time around. The most interesting character was the theater itself - and by extension the theater's ghost. Often when an all-star cast such as the one in this movie is assembled, the resulting production often feels like a mess of egos.

Pretty accurate.I suppose this movie speaks to a specific demo within a specific generation and it's not mine. I didn't know anything about the real radio show or Garrison Keilor so this movie was completely wasted on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it...","review":"Well, I listen to the radio show almost every week, but 2 out of 4 people left the room at about one hour & 8 minutes into the thing. One of the 2 left fell asleep, leaving me waiting for something to watch.For me, the best 3 or 4 minutes was the \\"Bad Jokes\\" scene. I had everyone come & watch that part with me.So...we just didn't get whatever was trying to be portrayed by the movie. Glad I didn't have to pay to rent it!--Debbie in GA"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prairie Home Companion","review":"A great and fairly accurate recall of the concert series which ran for so many years and represented some of the old time, genuine images of the quality, family oriented entertainment which acknowledging community values of the day. To me, as an Australian who enjoyed the broadcast of the series for years,and has visited Minneapolis many times, this DVD is an American Icon, to be enjoyed by manyin the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Words: Hor ri ble!","review":"From the moment I saw the trailer I was looking forward to this movie, so I bought it on dvd. Fortyfive minutes into the movie I thought, what's happening, has it started? has anyone said anything I should be paying attention to? is there a plot here somewhere? And the answer is NO! I have never written a review, but this is such a stinker I wish I had been forwarned...I want my two hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!!!","review":"I thought this movie would be fantastic with its all star cast of superb movie stars like Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin etc.Instead the movie was extremely slow, boring, and drawn out!! It was so bad that 45 minutes into the movie, I couldn't stand watching another second of it. So, I stopped the movie and promptly returned it to the video store I rented it from.If the movie moved at a swifter pace and was a bit more witty, then perhaps it would have been good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, pretentious, plotless","review":"I should preface this review by stating that I have never (and now never will) listened to Garrison Keillor's radio show. This was movie was really awful. I have never walked out of a movie in my life until this one. After an hour of trying to keep myself awake, I couldn't take it anymore. The movie has absolutely no plot and you never feel a connection to any of the characters because there is no character development at all.I stayed as long as I did trying to figure out what I was missing. Were there subtle sub-plots mixed with symbolism that I hadn't been smart enough to see? The answer is no..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of good talent...boring!","review":"I love radio shows. I love good acting. I love ensemble casts. In this case, I thought I'd lucked out, because all three were present. Two of my favorite actors of all time, Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep, are stars. Even they couldn't save this boring story. The emotional points in the story aren't touching enough because we've not been given enough time to love the characters. The goofy, funny elements could be heightened if we had more moments to view them, but instead they're cut off.In short, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over, which is an insulting comment but a true one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst","review":"I can't believe that I spent a healthy chunk of my life watching this mess. I used to be a fan of the PHC, but it seems to have deteriorated to this low level. How very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The movie was a disappointment. Stellar cast improvising on the stage. And Garrison Keillor does not even tell a story! Soon after the movie the director died--must have been from boredom creating this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Better Spent Alone","review":"I've never much cared for Altman, and this film displays his fashionably nihilistic, aimlessly sappy meanderings at their worst. A grave injustice to Garrison Keillor's quirky weekly broadcast and a typically Altman-esque waste of a great cast. Surprisingly, it's Lindsay Lohan who acquits herself most admirably with understated comic performances that cannot be missed: so, both for her scene delivering a mangled rendition of \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" and for her portrayal of an adolescent's interactions with her harried show-biz mom (played well by an otherwise criminally underutilized Meryl Streep), this movie might possibly perhaps be a little worth watching ... almost - but for those scenes alone and for nothing else! Blech. Double-blech. Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun movie to watch---especially if you are a Garrison Keillor fan","review":"I found Robert Altman's last film to be delightful. The singing was quite good and the story line is easy to follow. Woody Harrelson was particularly entertaining as a singer. This movie may not be for everybody. Still, anyone who even mildly enjoys the humor of Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion should obtain a copy. Five stars? Not quite, but four and a half stars guarantees it to be worth investing a few hours of your time. And yes, these well known actors truly seem to enjoy themselves. Working on this movie set was likely a lot of fun and the laughter never-ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Keillor, but this is deadly dull","review":"Based on the ratings, I suspect kindhearted people think they SHOULD praise this film because of the likeability of its stars. But from the heavyhanded appearance of \\"Death\\" to the self-conscious acting styles to the endless songs (you deserve a medal if you don't ever hit fast forward), this simply does not even approach the charm, wit and easy musicality of the Prairie Home Companion radio show. Also, the DVD transfer seems a bit dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually Walked Out of This Movie","review":"Tried too hard to be filled with \\"characters\\" and to be \\"charming.\\" As a result, the story dragged and the humor was entirely smothered. This was just a bad film. Good idea, poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prairie Home Boredom","review":"I love the radio show. But this was not that. Instead we eavesdrop into contrived backstage personalities that I ultimately just didn't care about, and found little to do with the radio show. Was this about Prairie Home Companion, or was this some other movie with Garrison & crew performing somewhere in the distant background as a pale backdrop to stories that I just didn't believe. And Lindsey Lohan, who has broken the 4th dimension by becoming a strange personality more powerful than anything this bad actress can create, was too distracting. Seeing her I kept wondering what Paris Hilton was doing right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered down; some people are better not on film","review":"There is a reason why the radio show is magical - because you have to imagine the characters from the voices.This movie is a total failure. Garrison Keillor has a beautiful voice and probably has a live on stage charisma, but is so physically homely that he should not be in a movie. He appears stiff and self conscious. He is not meant to be a cinema actor. He is a super talented writer and singer but visual acting is not his thing. He is really unfortunate to look at. The make up looks really pasty on him. He is the kind of person who should have a shiny oily face, so he looks real rather than all powdered up and trying to look beautiful.Throwing celebrities in there does not help. Rather, it heightens the sterility and lack of chemistry among the actors who are not really singers and should be working in dramas, not musicals.Was the script bad, or the ideas bad, or execution bad. Don't know what to blame. It's just a terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless, Pointless","review":"The fact that most movies made nowadays are without a plot or point does not come as a shock to me (or, I sincerely doubt, to anyone else). However, the fact that Garrison Keillor whose weekly PHC radio sessions draw heavily on the use of narrative and dialogue would star in a film that is sorely lacking in both does come as a shock and disappointment to me. This movie has great actors (minus, of course, Lindsay Lohan - dear God, why her?) whose acting talent is all but wasted. Lohan is disasterously cast as the angst-ridden teenage daughter who wears ripped jeans and writes poems about suicide. (Couldn't there be just one movie containing a teenager that is not a stock character?) It does not contain the monologue (it's been a quiet week in my hometown of Lake Wobegon) that has made Keillor famous. Nor, does it ultimately even make much sense. I could go on, but I won't. Don't watch it unless you're light of head/wallet, or don't mind being bored or disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only negative stars were possible","review":"This movie is horrible. It's like sitting with your elderly relatives who talk of nothing but the way things used to be, except the reminiscences in the movie hold none of the value that your relatives' stories carry. Layered on top of the endless \\"remember whens?\\" is mediocre singing performances and Virginia Madsen wandering around the set like she's got amnesia. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Radio Show","review":"I don't think there is any way that this folksy, charming radio show could ever make the successful transition to film. The main part of it's charm is the fact that it's on the radio. I agree with a prior reviewer that you will be hard pressed to keep your finger off the FF on your remote. Unless you enjoy listening to actors singing some very lame folksy jingles, I would suggest avoiding this. The story involving Kevin Kline as a film noir detective and Virginia Madsen as the angel of death was nothing more than a failed attempt to make this more cinema friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had better","review":"While this brush mistly does the job, the bristles are so fine, yet hard that it is difficult to get the sauce to come off the brush and onto the food.

Was hoping it would help with high cholesterol and suspected hypo thyroid issues. Did feel a little warmer after taking it, but didn't affect body temp. A few weeks after starting it I developed shingles and decided to stop taking it. Coincidence? Maybe, but I've never had shingles before and since one of the side effects of guggul products is skin rash, was not convinced it didn't contribute to it.

The arrangements of classic EWF songs were ho-hum and boring.This was nothing but a \\"vanity project\\" for Sheldon Reynolds, a former member of Earth, Wind & Fire who joined the group after Al McKay and Johnny Graham left. The group had done their best work by then, so Sheldon never brought anything original to the table. I thought Larry Dunn (one of the original members) would have done more playing on this CD, seeing as how he contributed to the magic that once made EWF great. Sheldon limited Larry to playing on only a couple of tunes. That was a mistake. Please don't waste any money of this bulls**t.

Some other activity, perhaps? Her extreme and, in most cases, inappropriate use of rubato leaves one to wonder if she simply does not remember the duration of the notes. Surely she cannot be that bad at interpretation?

Looking at, for instance, the occupations of the fathers of Politburo members, to get a sense of the social background that these members grew up in. Likewise with Nazi leaders.The authors try to find common patterns between these elites. In an attempt to understand how such movements successfully seize power. Plus also, no doubt, how the US might have to deal with them. Remember, too, when this book was written.

Here is a book for the Christian reader who is in search of an example of total humility, charity and kindness, even in he face of belittlement from his own church and community.It is a long read, being an official account, if you want all the great stories without the comprehensive account, check out 'Gods Dorkeepers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, needed a little more though!","review":"This book was great! It combined old mysticism with amazing technology. The only thing it was missing was that the cool motorcycles and other vehicles that were pictured, but were not given stats on! It also made Japan seem less powerful than the \\"NGR\\" (technology wise). The old mystics (like the traditional ninja and samurai) are a little weak, as they had low mega-damage stats and refuse to use technology so you can't even fit them into a suit of power armor to protect them! A lot of it was rehash too, like the Japanese \\"Samas\\" operator and the Japanese \\"Glitterboy\\". Other than that, the weapons were pretty cool, the possible adventures are good, the OCCs are excellent, and if you combine this book with \\"Ninjas and superspies\\" it really brings it to life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rifts Japan: World Book Eight: The best of both worlds!","review":"The first of the Japanese World Books is a treat.

Mankind must band together lest these hordes conquer the entire island, yet there is an undercurrent of plotting between the various human shogunates and kingdoms included that could give the oni the foothold they need to conquer!Great integration of ancient and new ways: bots and monsters, dragons and dragon borgs, new mega-damage guns and ancient rune daishos of the samurai -- everything players need for a wonderful romp around Japan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all a good book","review":"The entire book was great.

Then irritation against in-your-face religious folk, where a little would have sufficed. Next obsessing against women who see themselves as fashion dolls. Yes, I appreciate quirkiness in viewpoint characters, and confess to be opinionated myself. But what should have been a sprinkling came to the point of irritation.

While Dyer has moments where he eloquently describes the agony of trying to make time stand still, these moments are few in the realm of a 300 page book. His characters Luke, Alex, Nicole, and Sahra are unique, but underdeveloped. The reader gets this vision of these four as nothing more than lost souls seeking another acid trip when there is so much more in their persona that could be explored. Overall \\"Paris Trance\\" is an interesting first attempt at a novella, yet perhaps with his next work, Dyer will explore his talent and show to his reader what he is \\"really\\" capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"two couples and their struggle for love","review":"Disappointing as a whole but with wonderful moments.

From the jacket descriptions and the subject matter I thought this would be a sure winner just to put me in the mood of Paris in the fall. But the writing was so tepid and clumsy, the characters so poorly sketched and the dialogue either so badly written or falsely pretentious that I couldn't even finish half of this book. The sex scenes are basically just snapshots of the author's own perversions and are neither necessary nor believable. To me this book is a complete failure. If you were drawn, like me, to France and the idea of intelligent romance read James Salter or James Baldwin instead. You will be glad that you did.BTW"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Start So I Ditched It","review":"The first page of this novel contains the following phrase: \\"The events recorded here concerned only a handful of people and, quite probably, are of interest only to those people. Especially since 'story' is almost certainly the wrong word. Whatever makes events into a story is entirely missing from what follows.\\" After reading the first fifth of the book, I'd have to agree.

Its minimalist postmodern style exudes poetry. This is a book about the flame of youth and the ashes it turns into when one can't let go of it.

This is the second biography of an artist I have ever read in it's entirety, and as an avid reader of 3-4 books a week, it was great to enjoy learning about someone whose work I have been fascinated with. I was pleased with the pictures of the towns and landscapes where Vincent painted.

Each chapter begins with her quoting a writer and then questioning what is said. This, including her initial response, is all in a journal she once kept. The book comments on her initial comments with new insights she has gained over the years. At first I liked the book even though it was quite negative in many cases.

It nicely documents the creation and evolution of the New Center area of downtown Detroit. Its provides insight into the forces driving urban planning in the Motor City. It chronicals the city's arrival on the scene as an industrial powerhouse, through the effects of the industry's maturation on urban development, all the way up to current efforts to continue developing the area post-the maturation of its major corporate sponsors (and without a range of other sponsors of that scale filling in the gap).Full of well researched historical photos (some, I believe, which ever never been available outside of archives).

What's especially disconcerting is that this volume was authored by \\"a member of the i-Net+ exam objectives team\\" which made it sound like an authoritative resource.

This book was written eighty years ago by a man who consistently belittles the spiritual beliefs of all non-christian peoples, and refers to the buddhist, taohist, and hindu cultures as being childish, pathetic, silly and to be pitied and ridiculed on many levels. His attitude towards dragons is nothing if not derisive. Do not be taken in by the book-jacket review and the playful cover. If you want a book tracking the rise of dragon worship throughout the world, but with little to no historical folklore, than this is your book. But if you are looking forward to reading entertaining dragon lore from around the globe, than this is NOT what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"I have this (unfortunate?) habit of having to finish anything I start. And I cannot believe i reached the end of this book. The crime was far from \\"perfect\\"...it was so convoluted and contrived, I'm not sure if the focus of the author was devising a murder or creating an obscene number of inane mental ramblings, as Roger tries to logicalize everything in his mind. His constant, obsessive strategizing gets very tiresome and is not intriguing in the least. I'm currently reading a Dean Koontz novel, and it's making my heart palpitate - that's what a great suspense book does! Peter Abrahams has not impressed me at all. And with a pathetic ending to boot...save your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Crime","review":"Got the title and author from Stephen King's list in the back of \\"On Writing\\".

Excuse me, I just insulted my cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven and, at times, predictable","review":"The first 50 pages of the book had an astounding number of coincides -- enough to make the book completely unbelievable. However, the premise was interesting -- a genius that becomes highly motivated to commit murder, and get away with it. To be fair, the last one-third of the book moved at a good pace and was quite exciting. The two main female characters were very interesting; the mastermide was intriguing; the actual killer was spooky. This could have been a very good thriller, but the first part of the book was not well-crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor plotting, coincidences as cheap gimmicks.","review":"An excellent writer wasted his gift on this poorly plotted piece that appears to be a make-it-up-as-you-go effort. Instead of devising a \\"perfect crime\\" and creating a plot to carry it out, Mr. Abrahams simply allows his \\"genius\\" villain to bumble along, bouncing from one idea to another, in simple-minded reaction to events. And the author's laziness is manifest in his reliance on so many bizarre coincidences to get characters into and out of situations. Perhaps he's just playing with us, intending the title to be a sarcastic commentary on his villain's ridiculous, inflated ego: That he could think that this is a perfect crime? What a dimwit! Either way, I felt cheated as a reader. Still, his characters are well-drawn and his writing skills obviously superior. A shame to waste so much. It's as if a great Shakespearean troupe were saddled with presenting \\"Beavis and Butthead do America\\" -- with Neal Simon to rewrite the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!

It started off great but really seemed to have lost its focus. This book is not worth the energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Thriller","review":"Peter Abrahams is a unique author with a fine body of work. \\"A Perfect Crime\\" is his best novel yet. No matter how many crime suspense thrillers you have read, nothing will prepare you for the surprises that hit you as you read this novel. Essentially a 5 character novel (however with some key supporting players), he writes about desire, revenge, and retribution in a way unlike any suspense story I've read in years. You will be unable to put this book down as you cast the movie roles to match these fascinating characters. Each one is drawn so precisely that you have a feeling you know their personality and their strengths and weaknesses in such an intimate way that you will look forward to finding out what happens to each and every one of them. So, pick it up and be ready for a long and thrilling evening.

Yeah, the concept might sound a little hokey, I guess, but believe me, this recording is anything but hokey. King is a tasteful guitarist with a solid style--he never seems to be showing off, and he seems to really enjoy spinning improvisations around these familiar tunes. This is really a solid CD, very inventive and entertaining; guitar lovers really ought to track this one down, because it is both a sleeper and a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a high quality demo and not a finished product","review":"While King's playing is excellent, I fail to see how his introductions and solos make any reference to the songs chosen on \\"Moon Magic.\\" King's musicians on Moon Magic are competent, but lack imagination.

They follow right along with this current so called President's views. When is this stuff going to end? We're fighting this war because we were attacked. During World War II a person was not released until the duration or you were severely wounded. How about making some movies showing the courage and bravery of our military. \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is a step in the right direction. Never mind the \\"good\\" acting.

However, for all its intentions, the movie misses the target and becomes a mess of disjointed portrayals of flashback induced psychological struggles for the main characters. Bad choices by two of the primary actors (Phillippe and Cornish) to attempt to Texas accents end up having them sound mentally deficient in Phillippe's case - or just plain unintelligible in the case of Cornish. Cornish's performance is flat and uninteresting - a total snoozer. Phillippe started out rather engaging and was strong in the scene where he gave an akward speeech at his home town welcome parade - however his attempts at portraying stronger emotions felt forced and over the top. Bad directing and a poor script added to the mess of the film.

Tens of thousands of servicemen and women had their service in Iraq and Afghanistan involuntarily extended because of the stop-loss fineprint in their enlistment contracts. \\"Stop-Loss\\" puts a human face on this bait-and-switch policy -- and dramatically illuminates the ongoing costs of the war that play out when the troops come home."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst post Iraq/Afghanistan war movie made to date","review":"As a former soldier and Iraq and Afghanistan wars veteran.

However, you will only be laughing at the utter stupiditiy that must have gone though the minds of the directors while making this film. With no big name stars, and basically no plot at all, this film amazingly earned 2 stars in this review because it made me laugh at it's simple, pathetic attempt at cinema. An international race through the African Safari? Wow! I do not know where the idea for this film came from, nor do I really care to find out. I am glad I watched it however, because now I have the honor of claiming that I have seen the worst movie ever produced in the history of film making. Own it. Watch it.

The joy of life is the central theme in all their songs and Tilt carries on that tradition beautifully. From instantly classic songs like \\"Life's too short\\" with one of the best production on an electronic track ever, to sublime songs such as \\"Get it right\\" and \\"If only\\" you can't help but feel better, if not good, about yourself. Although the ballads are skipable to a casual listener, they add a completeness to the album which generates a very fulfilling listening experience. On the flip side, metaphorically speaking, you will be hard pressed to find happier songs than (surprise!) \\"Happy satellite\\" and \\"Crowdpleaser.\\" Dance, Top40, RandB, Adult Contemporary listeners will equally find songs to their liking in this gem of an album.

I receive many compliments on it. I combined this with a Patron Saint Medal and felt the chain was a little thin for the added weight. So I did end up changing the chain to something more durable.

It is also useful in that the authors emphasize that treating all employees in the same way will lead to improved office morale.In particular, the authors' recommendation to document everything in personnel files is laudable.

Well I found myself just as engulfed into this book as I was in the first. It is a quick read because you find yourself not wanting to put it down.

I think it's an ingenious use of everyday reality in a book. Boy Next Door may have had a slight advantage over Boy Meets Girl because the premise is the same. I still think it was well written.The best part was the use of characters from Boy Next Door in this new book in a peripheral way. Half way through the book I thought I had gone nuts because I realized how familiar I was with the names. Until I checked Boy Next Door and realized what was going on. Typically, you only have one book to get to know characters and then it's over and you never read about them again. Meg Cabot has created a way of catching us up on old characters without writing a sequal that centers on them. And better than that, she shows just how small the world really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ","review":"This book was one of the most original and enjoyable books I have read in a long time.

Her crazy boss, nicknamed the Tyrannical Office Despot, makes our heroine fire the beloved cafeteria cookie lady. The cookie lady then sues the newspaper for wrongful termination. Our heroine winds up giving a deposition and falls in love with the newspaper's cute lawyer. The best part about this book is that it is written entirely in e-mails, letters and journal entries. Now why didn't I think of that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as The Boy Next Door.","review":"This book loosely ties in with The Boy Next Door but I didn't find it as enjoyable. The characters were fun as ever but I missed the all e-mail format. Switching back and forth between e-mails, diary entries, and recorded interviews didn't make the book feel very fluid. Don't get me wrong, I did like the book.

I have found the ones I have tried to be very helpful, and the information is presented clearly, simply, and without being a downer to read and full of sad case studies! It gets right to the point, too. The author is not presenting magic tricks, though some of what she suggests I dont have much faith in (Bach Flower Remedies) most other things (like meditation) I have found very effective. Some of her advice I have not seen anywhere else, but have discovered for myself and its nice to get the confirmation here. On the whole, this is one of the best books on depression I have read.

In this installment, Patrick Larkin crafts a story in the style of The Osterman Weekend or The Parsifal Mosaic. It is a very complex story and, I must admit, moved a little slowly for me in the first few chapters. I persevered, however, and am very glad I did. Once the pace picked up, the story just grabbed me and I had trouble setting it aside for trivialities such as sleeping and going to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliched, predictable","review":"I haven't read any of the real Robert Ludlum before, but I don't think I will be starting if this is his style.The action scenes, with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts, are perhaps better suited to a 90 minute movie instead of a 400 page book. The weapons-catalogue padding is comical at first, later frustrating.The childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places. We know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest.Perhaps most disturbing is the book's overall 1950's style racism in which the Americans are dashing, multi-skilled warriors for good and the Russians, Ukrainians, even Germans are all ugly, inhuman or quickly dead.Whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water-tight, the reader is always a step-ahead of the characters. As other reviews have said, suspense and mystery are left absent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Moscow Vector","review":"If you are a Covert-One and Dr. Jon Smith fan, then this is a must read for you.

His books are slow reading and they fail to capture the true character of Jon Smith from the previous books.

You really have to try hard to believe the chain of events in order to enjoy this book. The relationship between the deadly bio-weapon and the Russian military build-up is unnecessarily hyped. If you ask me, 3 out of 4 of the main characters should have been killed at around page 100. Fortunately, the bad guys have the insatiable urge to go into big speeches before pulling the trigger. Oh, and they are completely against killing their enemies unless they guide them to the exact 'dying spot' first. Anyway.

Morton was a well trusted product long before I was born. When I was a kid they use to really promote the anti clumping agent in the salt, so it poured when it rained. From what little I know about geology, salt has in some cases been around for millions of years. But mineral deposits in some area are more pure then in other area.

Soon after the release of this version, Corel stopped making the Mac OS X versions. A big mistake I think, Mac's are well known for their Graphics ability and CorelDRAW was the 2nd most popular vector graphics design app for the Mac. The ONLY reason I keep a Windows XP machine around is to run CorelDRAW X3.

The candy that was supposed to be chewy was hard, and some selections (Bit O' Honey, Abbazabba, Turkish Taffy, etc...) had obviously been kept in a hot, humid area because they had melted and hardened into odd unappealing shapes.

It IS very comfortable on the hand, and the extra buttons sure is a big plus. But the tracking of the mouse movement sucks!!! I had to move back to my old Dell mouse because I just cannot stand it. It is always 10 pixel away from where I think it should be and I have to adjust it. And when you move the mouse in a small distance (which is what I have to do when it doesn't move right at the first time), it just becomes sluggish and unpredicatable (meaning that it has a mind of its own regarding if it will move this time).

Clearly not R.F. though. It is most definitely correlated to the pulsing LED that powers the optical pickup - probably a step-up oscillator that powers the LED.

IT'S NOT RF!","review":"Quick note about the whine that jazzdiver heard: It's definitely not the RF. No human can hear RF (we would not need radios if we could!). My mouse is nice and quiet, as it should be since it's optical. It has no moving parts or little rollers that could make noise, right?.I do believe that your mouse made noises, and I can't tell you why, but I'd suggest you go and exchange it :)The mouse rocks! It tracks on pretty much anything, it's fast and it's accurate... plus the advantage of being wireless!. The receiver can quietly sit by my monitor (which happens to have a USB hub built in!... goody, goody...) and now I can mouse in my low coffe table by my chair.Great mouse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this mouse","review":"this mouse goes through a new set of batteries every 3 or 4 days. it starts jumping and stalling when batteries get weak. it feels extremely unresponsive - huge lag time. don't buy this mouse.. i'm looking for a new mouse right now.. i never written a review before. but i feel strongly enough about this to write one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Mouse in the History of Computing","review":"I keep seeing rave reviews, about this mouse, at various hardware sites. I simply can't believe any of these reviewers actually used the mouse. This is the worst mouse I've ever seen: I set it up on three computers at two different locations and I got the same result on every one of them - the mouse lags like crazy. If you stop moving this mouse for any length of time (like sitting and reading an article) it hibernates....then when you move it, it takes up to a second to wake up. This same problem affects the scroll wheel so, the mouse arbitrarily skips \\"clicks\\" when moving the wheel. I returned this mouse to the store within 24 hours of buying it. Do yourself a favor and buy a MS optical mouse WITH A CORD. They are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great mouse, BUT TOO MANY FLAWS","review":"Oh where to begin, i have used this thing for close to two weeks now and i dont seem to overlook the flaws. Let me start off with the pros.PROS:1. Wireless2. Responsive more than other wireless mice3. GREAT placement of thumb and back buttonCONS:1. Not as responsive as wired mice2. Not accurate, when you move your mouse, it sort of jumps rather than scroll from its original point.3. Does not move smoothly, this is because of the bottom corners sticking.4. Goes to sleep mode every so often.To sum everything up, get this mouse if its just for internet browsing. If for gaming or photoshop, this mouse would not be what youre looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ergonomics; Poor function","review":"Although this mouse feels great in your hand, it has the worst tracking I have ever seen. So bad it's frustrating even while surfing the web, much less doing something that requires precision.Logitechs \\"Cordless MouseMan Optical\\" proves that it can be done right (very precise tracking.) So until Microsoft gets it right, my advice is to go with Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless to me","review":"Bought the USB wireless Explorer for more accruracy. In slow, deliberate use as in AutoCAD it just loses the start of movement. So if you are moving it s-l-o-w-l-y as must often be done for accurate picking of intersections, etc. it is worthless. I can drag the mouse very slowly clear off the table without moving the cursor. This renders is useless for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say it with Me....rechargable batteries","review":"Love it.

But I finally did take the plunge and am happy to report that its a great device. The range on the reciever is pretty good, and the mouse is very accurate. Being optical is probably the best feature on this mouse. The batteries do tend to wear out a bit quickly, but I deal with it.

It is worthless. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice feel, terrible control.","review":"This mouse was trouble for me almost from the very start. First of all, it eats batteries like crazy. Two weeks per pair of good quality alkalines was about average. It did see a lot of usage during that time which put extra strain on the battery life, but they should have lasted much longer. Second, it was very skippy and uneven when moved. The mouse jumped during every movement, even on slow moves on a high contrasting surface. Third, it sometimes took a second or two before it would even respond to my movements. I found the combination these things intolerable and gave it away. It has been passed on at least twice since then. The unfortunate thing is that the mouse has a VERY nice feel in it's shape and buttons. I really liked that feel above any other mouse I've used. But sadly, that was nowhere near enough compensation for the huge drawbacks of it's operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerky, Hysterisis, Heavy. BAD for detail work.","review":"With both the Logitech and Microsoft side by side, I find myself switching between the two to protect my wrists. This mouse works, but NOT for detail work. Here's why:(1) It's heavy. (2) It's sticky...microsoft uses cheaper slide-pads compared to logitech (3) the stickiness makes it nearly impossible to nudge over a pixel (4) It is slow to wake up from it's snooze state (which it enters very very quickly) and typically jumps 10 pixels when it does wake up.On the good side: (*) It's bigger and fits in my large hands better than the Logitech devices. (*) The batteries appear to last a little longer.I use my computer mouse constantly (3D design work) and find it frustrating to use this mouse for fine positioning. I would never purchase it again. I only gave it 2 stars because it meets it's specs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This mouse stinks","review":"I got this mouse several months ago for Xmas. It seemed great at first but it irritates the heck out of me now. It goes through a pair of AA's every month but the most frustrating thing is the lag. To conserve power it shuts down between movements. So you have to move the mouse before it registers a move. This causes it to be jerky as it shuts down easily. It's laying useless on my desk now. I hooked up the logitech that came with my laptop and I am much happier now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Gamers","review":"Just try and play Q3 or some other FPS type game with this mouse..AHH! I have an oak desk and this thing follows the grain in the wood, [poopy] mousepads are the reason I got this thing. The wired version of this mouse was super but this one eats batteries and is too jerky for accurate mousing. If you have a very smooth desktop with no characteristics in it then you might find this product useful, otherwise look at the new Logitech version with a higher dpi, I've not tried it but I've read great reviews about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good design, bad movement","review":"This mouse is a very good looking sturdy mouse. It feels good in your hand and has button's in correct spots, the only bad point is it has VERY bad movement, the power saving light blinks when not used for 2 seconds. This is bad because if you are drawing or playing games, and move the mouse slightly it will not respond. I would have made it so it starts blinking after about 10 seconds, oh well anyway its good for surfing the web but not much else, I can't stand even using it anymore, and have returned the product. This mouse is VERY overpriced for its preformance.If you are looking for a good, smooth wireless mouse, that is a good price, I suggest the Logitech Cordless Mouseman mouse, it is not optical but has great movement, the battery's last up to about 3 months under heavy use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I love the shape of the mouse and the fact that it's wireless. BUT! the moment I started to use it, I noticed the sluggishness with this mouse. Too bad, I was going to fall in love with this mouse, but I can't stand the sluggishness as I do heavy work with computers.

I'm going to back to it right now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Whenever I don't move my mouse for a few seconds, it suddenly moves to the corner of the screen, and I didn't even move the mouse.

It isn't -- your mouse needs batteries.I have 2 Logitech wireless mice and I replace the batteries on those every three or four months. I cannot go more than 2 weeks on this mouse before the batteries give out. With the Logitech the problem is clear -- the mouse quits working. The Microsft Mouse tries to keep working but can't. Not working at all is better. The first time with the Microsoft Mouse I was rebooting my machine and trying to find out why the computer was acting flaky. Replaced the batteries and ... problem fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! When it actualy works.","review":"I bought this because I loved optical mice.

After two months of using it under normal conditions, it finally broke down. Such a shame because i was only starting to get use to the on again off again battery saving feature that made me lag in games.

This may not be the case for everyone but my hands are a little larger than most and when using this mouse it tends to drag my pinky around after it. I have both this mouse and the Cordless Mouseman Optical by Logitech, and I would say by far the Logitech mouse is better buy. It may have one less button but also has a smaller price tag. Please save your money and don't make the same mistake that I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does make noise","review":"I just set up my mouse and I hear a high pitched noise but I dont think it is the RF. I think it has something to do with the light used to detect motion. Whenever I move the mouse the light lights up and I hear the high pitched noise. I dont actually think that the noise is a big enough problem to not buy the mouse though. I think it is by far the most comfortable mouse to use and is all around awsome and high tech feeling. I like it and am going to learn to ignore the noise.

After that, you have less than 5 minutes to change batteries. After I got 2 pairs of rechargable batteries (one to charge while the other is in use) it wasn't as annoying, but still you only get about 1 week out of the batteries, which still is unacceptable if you ask me.I liked the feel of my silver (wired) Microsoft mouse with the red glow on the bottom (I think it is called Explorer mouse), but the wire on those and the Optical mouse both got shorted out <6 months of use, causing the mouse to get disconnected/connected repeatly while trying to use it-majorly annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless mouse by Microsoft","review":"Uses a set of igh end batteries in 2 days.

I do realize that I acquired a used item and expect a certain level of degradation, regardless of which I would have to assume that the seller of the said item would have at least some form of adequate product testing prior to the transaction, now I'm not saying strip it down wire by wire, but at least see if it works in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!

The lag time to get it back up and running is awful, and I found that if there was any dust whatsoever on the underside, the dang thing wouldn't work until it was completely clean! The only plus side I could even remotely give this mouse is that it is larger, so it would be accommodating for those with slightly larger hands.

This season comes in the normal plastic black dvd case that has been inserted into a (top loading) cardboard sleeve. The cover looks as it appears in the Amazon photo but what it does not show is the difference from the other seasons.

Of course, we all know this, as it's the impetus for most that buy the \\"little house\\" collection. I gave it such a low rating chiefly b/c of the VERY poor quality. It appears, to me, like they took a vhs copy and viewed it many, many times so you get the \\"multiple watching defects\\" that one would get from a vhs tape and THEN transferred it to DVD. Really, I think it would be better (quality-wise) for the consumer to return the DVD set and just tape it from re-runs on television. Or, better yet, not purchase it AT ALL and then tape it from tv re-runs.One personal opinion and/or suggestion to reviewer \\"Kim Possible Finicatata \\"Jen\\"\\".

The one where Laura buys her shoes (with heels to make her look taller and older) and the one where she is determined to learn to walk in them! This is important because not too long after that we realize that it worked! Almonzo takes notice of her and she looks down at her shoes and tucks them uderneath her.

The part of the book that resonated so well with my experience was when he spoke of teachers as being in a career of vunerability. I had never thought of that but it is so true. He has a lot of gems of wisdom in this book. Inspiring on many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"very hard to get interested in","review":"This book started off and ended extremely slow and to me, uninteresting. There were a few good points on using community to teach but not enough to worry yourself over. The cover of the book however is very pretty"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing for teachers on any level.","review":"This book was very comforting for me as a newer teacher. I look forward to revisisting it in the later years of my career to help measure growth and guide future changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asks the Right Questions","review":"Not since \\"Spitwad Sutras: Classroom Teaching as Sublime Vocation\\" have a read a book so focused on the spirituality of teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets better as it goes....?","review":"I'll preface this by saying that I'm a university teacher who cares deeply about teaching, which I guess must be why this book was recommended to me in the first place. The early chapters I found simply intolerable, heavily reliant on unexamined truistic claptrap about self-knowledge, the soul, etc, etc. The whole book is overwritten and florid, like the inside of a greetings card. It is hard to be genuinely profound in that sort of prose, and I wished that Parker, who is clearly a wonderful and thoughtful teacher, had had the courage to write in something approximating the language of normal speech.I said the book gets better as it goes: the chapter on subject-centered learning is absolutely first-rate, if you make it that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwrought, overrated","review":"Some of Palmer's points were pretty good (the subject centered classroom and critical moments in teaching), however it was overwritten to the point of sheer unreadability and most of his ideas can be had elsewhere. The book would have been far better had he dropped his grandiose writing style; it just felt like he had written the book to impress all of us with how much florid, useless prose he could manage to shove in.In all, it was okay, but there was no need for such simple ideas to be presented in such a pretentious manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insights.","review":"An excellent book on what it takes to really connect with students.Deals with unusual topics like vulnerabilities, openness, and subject oriented teaching versus student or teacher oriented teaching. Celebrates the inherent wisdom within people, even those who are callous and cynical on the surface.An important contribution to the field"},{"rating":"2","title":"The cost of caring","review":"I've been teaching 9 years and had begun to think the toll was just too great. If you invest your emotional energy into your students, you are at risk for some very personal feelings of rejection.... and it can come from parents and administrators, as well as the students. This book probably saved me from quitting or self-destructing. Because Palmer so squarely defines this risk and compassionately encourages his reader (we're all teachers in some respect) with explanation and appreciation, it allows the teacher to once again feel that he/she is making the sacrifice for a worthy and noble cause. I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Gift to Those Who Teach","review":"This is a classic work on the heart and mind of those who dedicate themselves to education. It is the best possible gift you can give to anyone who teaches on any level, including yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Courage to Teach","review":"I loved this book. Parker Palmer is addressing something that other books and inservices don't and that is the integrity that's at the heart of all teachers. He offers advice and encouragement to those who care so deeply and give so much to their students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Attempting to establish the thesis that \\"good teaching comes from good people,\\" Palmer overstates his case by downplaying the importance of expertise and technique. For example, he claims that teachers' knowledge of their subjects is \\"always flawed and partial\\" and that a command of content \\"always eludes [their] grasp.\\" His overuse of the word soul makes it sound like only a \\"good person\\" can be a good teacher. This seems to be a shaky (or even simplistic) assumption on which to base a book.Ironically, the most effective parts of the book are those in which he discusses techniques for improving teaching, especially the focus on \\"critical moments\\" and \\"subject-centered classrooms.\\" I agree with his points on \\"the grace of great things,\\" though the pious tone is bothersome, especially when he refers to teaching as \\"life-giving communion with the young.\\" The second half of the book is much better than the first half, but it still is a tough read for anyone with a postmodernist sensibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accompanying audio CD of a conversation with Parker J. Palmer and associates rounds out the inspirational guide","review":"Now in its tenth anniversary edition, The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher's Life is the testimony of veteran educator Parker J. Palmer, created to help fellow teachers take heart in the face bureaucratic systems that are sometimes outright hostile, among other obstacles. The Courage to Teach is centered upon the basic premise that truly good teaching comes not merely from technique, but rather is rooted in the identity and integrity of the instructor. Chapters tell of the critical importance of forming a connection with students, forming a positive community network, and the invaluable role of an indomitable spirit within teachers. An accompanying audio CD of a conversation with Parker J. Palmer and associates rounds out the inspirational guide by a passionate professional, for professionals seeking to revitalize their inner fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Good monitor... except, sometimes it buzzes like some sort of humming bird on crack.

It had the great \\"long book\\" look I love (which usually means wonderful depth and detail) but is completely disappointing from the start. I kept reading, thinking..surely it would get to their usual style...but, alas, no. This is a wholely disappointing novel. The characters lack depth, the plot is thin and the devlopment is vague and repetitive with one boring scenario emphasizing the same facet of character or plot over and over and over.

It was, by far, the worst book I've had to read on way to getting my education. Flawed arguments abound and the writing is stereotypical of feminist writers.

She gave up quickly as it is very difficult to control and even more difficult to understand the voice that tells you what you are supposed to do. She knows her numbers and was just using the level where all you have to do is shoot the number it tells you and then shoot the gems that come up. Even if you know the answer and are able to understand the voice, controlling the ship to shoot the answer is another story! I'm 29 and have had a bit of gaming experience in my life. I tried to play it several times and also had a lot of difficulty controlling the ship and understanding what was being asked of me. It would be educational if it were easier to play but it is just frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"educational but boring","review":"My son never really liked this game.

I am a dude and I bought these for my wife because she needed one. She said they sucked so I tried them out myself just in case she was wrong. Nope, they really do suck. I have rough feet because I am a dude and I was expecting my feet to be like a baby's butt after using the smoother. They still felt like sandpaper. This is how I did it. I went and showered, waited a few minutes for my feet to soak up the water, then I started using this smoother. Nothing. Just crap. What a let down. I was planning on playing footsies with my wife without cutting her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant product","review":"I wasn't losing sleep over the appearance of my feet, but I did have a bit of a problem with dead skin accumulating on the bottoms of my heels.

It is brilliantly simple and effective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Sexy Feet for Summer","review":"Now that summer is fast approaching I can't think of a better product to get your feet in shape for sandals and sexy heels. I am a fan of the Diamancel Diamond Foot Buffer (much more expensive) but apparently diamonds are not forever. I read the top reviewer Scott's review for this product and I was sold. Once this arrived I was not disappointed. In a matter of minutes my feet were sexy smooth. I think this foot smoother is better than anything I've used before. Yes it is a bit like a grater but all that comes off your feet is a fine dust of dead skin cells. Just use this foot smoother over a towel and clean up is a breeze.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great foot file & saves a trip to get a pedi. I think this is the best ever out on the market! Buy it you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more scratchy heels!","review":"Like another reviewer mentioned, my scratchy heels would always make snagging sounds on my silky duvet cover. Not any more! I was so excited to try this after I received it! I have used it on dry feet and slightly damp feet, and it works both ways. I just use it while I sit on the edge of the tub and then I rinse the dead skin mess down with some water when I am done. I have rubbed very aggressively, and I never have any discomfort afterwards...just smooth skin! I loved it so much that I recommended it to my sister! Definitely worth the $!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment and waste of money","review":"Given the reviews here, I thought that this was exactly what I needed. It arrived and I soaked my feet and put it to use. Almost nothing came of it. Pumice is so much better. Almost anything is better. It took a tiny bit of callous off with a great deal of effort. If one had very little callous and you wanted to polish your feet, this may be your ticket. If you want a good workout, this may be your ticket. If you want to blow $20, this is perfect. If you have real callouses, try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did nothing to my feet","review":"Did nothing to my feet. Not coarse, does not scrub at all. Waist of money.

My heals were just disgusting, deep painful cracks all over the heal and it was just embarrassing and nasty. I've tried razors and other sorts of filers but nothing seemed to do the trick. After reading all the positive reviews here I decided to give this a try. I bought it along with the \\"be natural callus eliminator\\" and I must say, my heals are now gorgeous. This filer just shaves off the dead skin so easily. If you have hideous calluses like I did, I recommend you get the callus eliminator as well, it makes the job ten times easier because the calluses and dead skin just melt off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool!","review":"Item handle has good length an grip. Proforated blade should be more sharper to remove more callus, however works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"This scrubber is very useful and works well. You can only really use the top side as the curved plastic around the blade keeps you from being able to really use the back. I use a callous softener and then scrub with this thing and I end up with great results. Holes do not clog and handle is sturdy. I would definitely buy this as it's been the best scrubber I've bought out of all the many gadgets I've tried over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"From the description, I was expecting something that actually helped smooth the rough skin on my heels.

When this product arrived last night I immediately got in the shower and was AMAZED at how effective and comfortable it was! It removed more of the callous/crack in one use than I've been able to remove so far with my recent and diligent lotion/gel socks/egg/pumice treatments. I gave my husband a home-pedicure and used this on him as well; his feet are now the softest they've ever been!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This did not work for me.

I first saw him in NY in the mid 90s interpreting Monk (Panamonk). Clearly a player to watch. The attention was rewarded as Danilo released three consecutive amazing albums: Central Avenue, Mother Land, and his latest Till Then. Central Avenue primarily draws inspiration for the music of his native Panama/Caribean. The last two albums while retaining the Latin heart, represent continued exploration and growth. Danilo says Mother Land was inspired by working with Wayne Shorter (Love Alegria, don't care for Footprints). These albums are rhythmically and melodically rich and interesting. The musical ideas are as compelling as the technique. It takes a couple of listens to understand some of the cuts, and you still find new moments after multiple listenings.Till Then is a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring jazz from a major talent","review":"Being a fan of jazz music from the hard-bop era I am always on the look out for new exciting talent. I have been following the musical progression of Danilo and although Central Ave was his latest and in my mind his best, he really has not produced a truly satisfying album throughout. This will come as Danilo develops his sound. I must say that Till Then is a major step back for Danilo. This is a very safe and fully unadventurous album. If you are a fan of the Pat Methany Group from the 80s or \\"smooth\\" jazz this will appeal. However if you are hoping to revitalize your jazz collection with some inspiring (cuban) jazz piano stick with Chucho Valdes or McCoy Tyner. Most listeners will realize that there is nothing new or interesting here by the third track. A major disappointment from a major talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Deep Research Committed by Author Shows Through","review":"It is very obvious that the author/s does not understand the subculture that is graffiti. The author often belittles those that perform it, but if they were to actually interview or talk to some of these people, they would understand there is a high form of intelligence among these kids. They know what they are doing, Susan and Edmond do not. It is easy to critique something you do not understand, just as younk kids make fun of homosexuals, Susan and Edmund denounce an established form of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great detail in equations of motion development","review":"The book does a great job deriving equations of motion. It goes step by step in explaining axis systems, through Newton's 2nd Law to come up with E.O.M. The author then describes in detail how linear perturbation works, with step by step instructions.I use this book in conjunction with Nelson's flight stability textbook for my Aerospace grad courses and thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item","review":"I bought the 563411 visors for my 2003 F150 Extended Cab because the site said they would fit.

Every page turned was a new adventure into this woman's life. This book made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me angry. From the very beginning to the final page, the author demanded my attention....and received it fully. I had no idea where she was taken me, but her words were so powerful, that I graciously followed. And in the end, I was glad that I did. The ending was, for once, unpredictable. This is coming from someone who knew the outcome to The Usual Suspects and the Sixth Sense from the first showing. So trust me on this one guys!I have been looking for more books by this author. I heard that this was the beginning of a three part series. If anyone has heard of any other books by Janya Black, please let me know. I absolutely loved this book!!! I would recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for a good suspense tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit Blusey for me.","review":"I love jazz guitar, but the problem I have is finding new artists that are as good as my favorities(Ronny Jordan, and Norman Brown)In the pursuit of new artists, I happend to be a Virgin superstore in London, where I asked a gent to reccomend some smooth jazz peeps. This CD was thrown in my direction, and after a quick listen, I duly purchased. The first cut Boom, Boom is firing, and is the best cut of the album. After this procedings are mixed, with a general blues mix set into the whole procedure. If you likea bit of blues, cool, if not, then think again. Still looking for good artists in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe a little too harsh, 2.5 stars, perhaps.","review":"The first track on this album is excellent and thrilling.

Sorry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good on the web, but is lacking in person","review":"I was quite excited about the premise of a well written guide book for tradecraft, but sadly I was dissappointed by the book in person. To me, it's more of book geared toward children and uninformed adults than any aspiring or practicing security professional. Alternatively, there are several books on the market that cover the same material in a much more indepths and professional manner. This book isn't that big, so you cant expect a full experience on all the topics. The surveillance section is only a few pages in length, while whole books have been written on the subject. Most of the book is a broad overview of several items and lack any real details that the book promises. There are several books similar to this that don't make you expect a full course in tradecraft like this one. In the end, its a good read for the inexperienced or those seeking a basic intro, but it definately is the bible of tradecraft that the description promises it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money","review":"Do not purchase this book, if you are interested in this topic, there are many other fine books out there. This book is a joke though and i cant even believe someone published it. In the book they show a picture of Air Force Security Forces personnel (Basically Air Force Cops) and because they have the \\"SF\\" armband on they claim the personnel to be Army Special Forces...with Air Force rank staring you in the face. Anyone with half a brain can see that this book is terribly written, researched and produced, it is clearly marketed towards the naive and uninformed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite","review":"We had this CD years ago and it went missing.

Douglas Warren, I will buy that for $100.00. No, no. It was a tragic mistake. While I was hoping for outrageous comedy and a laugh a minute narratives, all I got was a book about case studies and stuff legal issues. I guess I should have been tipped off by the name, but Warren is known for his subtleties, (as well as his not so subtleties), so I thought maybe it was just some joke I didn't get. NOPE!

I really like it, though I was disappointed in the style change from episode 1 to 2. Does anyone know, is this a piggy-back style story? That would explain the change in Rouge's look {and hair color *sob*}. But in any case, I adore this anime.

The plot goes like this: A priest rushes to the aide of a troubled actor friend when he finds himself in deep water with a cult of satan worshippers. They then team to battle the forces of evil. Obviously inspired by early exploitation gore pioneer Herschell Gordon Lewis and various other horror films. The acting is not that great, and the Special F/X are cheap and hokey, but if you really like independent horror films, this one is for you. The director of this film shows alot of promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have you been smoking?","review":"I believe that this movie was done as a film school project at a community college. I have a taste for gore,storyline,plot,and art direction. This film unfortunatley contained none of these, the acting shallow and uninspired, could not even be laughed at as being campy. If you see this film for sale or rent run don't walk to the nearest exit, and save yourself a few dollers to put toward a more worthy movie in the Hammer or Ramie camps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of Environmental Health","review":"When I took \\"Environmental and Occupational Health\\" (EOH) for my master's in public health, this book provided the background for learning this broad course in a matter of 3 months.

Everything is building and building and the action is twice as intense and gut wrenching as in the first volume. The town that they go to is great and the characters are fantastic. I totally love Yorick. He's just a regular guy stuck in a crapstorm of craziness! This is a great series that just keeps getting better.

Most of these sites are unknown to the general public. His photographs illustrate rapidly deteriorating pieces of America as they are overrun by nature and ravaged by time. His work, like current History Channel series does, shows what happens when \\"people disappear\\" and our structures are abandoned and left to the elements.Many of the photos are quite haunting. Infrared gives many of the sites an otherworldly look."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Ruin","review":"Very good. Saw the book on CBS Sunday Morning. Excellent book and my father-in-law truly enjoyed it. He is difficult to buy gifts but this one was a true winner. Would recommend this book to anyone interested in our past and future. Only issue was 2 day deliver by FedEx was three days- no reason was given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"It was a book I wanted. I bought it at the high price. When I got it there is so much type written words where you would expect more pictures. Also the pictures are done in Black and White. Where the ruins blend in and you cannot really see them. Also many of the pictures look the same but say different ruins. So, less type and more color pictures or a better photographer.Not worth the money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was intrigued when I first saw this book on Amazon, and was pleased to later receive it as a gift. But I was immediately disappointed when I discovered that the images are all infrared photos. The result is certainly not informative, nor would I consider it art. Rather, they are overstylized, self-consciously \\"arty,\\" and frankly hacky-tacky. Why, when one has subjects as dramatic as these, not present them as is? Why deny the reader/viewer the chance to see these buildings and places as they really look? I recommend instead any of Camilo Jose Vergara's books. His images of American ruins are probably more journalism than art, but they at least let the fascinating ruins speak for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaci Velasquez LLegar A Ti","review":"This album was great!

And, being that it was her first crossover attempt, failed in every way. It was a stumble, but Jaci's next few were awesome.I wouldn't even recommend this if it were 1999 again. The quality is subpar compared to Thalia, Noelia--heck, even Paulina. It is possible to make a clean, family friendly latin pop album without sucking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaci Velasquez ?

Everything was exactly the same except, of course, the vocals. I missed hearing this in English, but I loved the German version anyway.Anyhow, if you're a fan of Nena and had this on vinyl record back in the day, get it. It's a dream to listen to.

All of the activities listed were ones I already knew, and the large number in the title comes from the number of variations for each of 3 activities: building things out of everyday items (see how high you can build a tower with the given items), common physical challenges (get the group from one side of the room to another using various props), and improv/word games.

I've made about 150 online purchases in my life and have had to return maybe 3 items.

It is finicky with burnt CD's though... it would skip on CD's that I burned at 48x, but that was solved by turning it down to 24x. I have had no skip problems after that.

The MP3 playback works great, you really can't get it to skip. Battery life is terrific on MP3's because you can set it to spin the cd only when it needs to read more data. Most of the time it plays from its own memory, which uses nominal power, and the cd is still. Despite the reviews of other users here I can't complain about skipping on normal cd's either. You've got to shake it pretty hard to get it to skip.There seems to be a lot of refurbished versions of this player for sale. Both of mine are refurbs.

Moreover, the included instructions, online user guide and telephone tech. support are all inaccurate as to how that function is used.

The Rio Volt was sitting in the display case at Comp USA, so I bought it. I think I payed $[$$] for it (it was a 1.5 years ago), which was better than the Nomad. It was easy to use, just burn the mp3s onto a CD. It took a while to load the disk, and it felt kinda heavy. The navigation was frustrating, but it worked. The battery life is amazing on this thing! I think two AAs would last me 20+ hours, which is much better than the 8 hours I get on my 10gb iPod.If you are looking for a[n inexpensive] and easy way to get into mp3s, and have a CD burner (who doesn't these days?), look no further than the Rio Volt.p.s. if you can fork over the cash, an iPod would be a much wiser investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARRANTY IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS-BE WARNED!!!!!!","review":"This is a very decent standard player, though the earphones are chintzy and no A/C adapter.

Sadly, Dungeon Master 2 was a disaster. The game designers stupidly decided that a sequel should be a hundred times more difficult than its predecessor.

At the end of the novel, the reader realizes that Gold has failed to provide any real motivation or personality for his major characters. It's not that it's terrible, it's just neither particularly entertaining nor enlightening. Given the subject matter of magic in the early part of the 20th century, shouldn't Gold have come up with something more interesting and surprising?

Nevertheless, I remember this book as one of my favorites.Mr. Gold creates very believable characters in a time when cars and motorcycles were new and television was a mere idea. Gold also takes us deep within the world of magic--a fantastic tour for those even slightly interested.I could not stop turning pages and hesitated to put it down. This book is one of the rare books I've read that, when completed, I felt let-down--only because the ride/journey was over.THE BOOK DOES NOT DISAPPOINT--only the realization that you've turned the last page is a disappointment. It is indeed a journey you wish could go on forever. I find myself thinking back to this book occasionally with very fond memories.Five stars, without a doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous book!","review":"This book is great! You can tell the author truly researched his subject to write it, and the characters are all good. The plot twist ending is a great addition to it all, and just makes the book that much better. It does seem to start a little slow, but once the momentum goes, it flies! Money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an enjoyable, fictionalized account of a magician's life","review":"Firstly, when reading 'Carter Beats The Devil' please remember the book is a *very* fictionalized account of Charles Carter (, the magician). Much of what is written is quite over the top, but it all seems to fit nicely with the theme of magic. Although on balance a fun read, the book is overly long, at times the reading is slow, and the tumultuous ending is somewhat of a let down. However I think people interested in early 20th century San Francisco will certainly overlook these faults and relish this book for its great capture of the city (and neighboring Oakland) of yesteryear.Bottom line: a great first book by the author, but not a great book. Still, nice for those who want a little escapism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layered, magical","review":"This book was so entertaining! Fast paced (but not at all vapid) and completely unputdownable. I loved the descriptions of the 1920's; the author included so many small details and nuances that I felt like I was really there. The characters were layered like delicious onions, and each layer was more interesting than the next. I especially liked Phoebe Kyle, Griffin, Philo and, of course, Carter. The end had so many twists, some that I had anticipated and some that I hadn't, but all delightful. If you're looking for a book to take you away from reality for a spell, this is it. The minute you lift it off your bedside table and open it you will be transported to a wonderful place.

This is a truly, truly enjoyable read. Mr. Gold has a talent for being bold while at the same time inserting subtle themes in his writing.I hate reading reviews that just tell what happens in the book, so I'll just give a few opinions. This book features many colorful characters, some actual historical figures, some not. They come and go throughout the novel at perfectly measured intervals: just when you think a character has fallen by the wayside, he/she is reintroduced in a new light and with a larger role to play in the plot.\\"Carter Beats The Devil\\" is fun, engrossing, and at times even educational. It's definitely worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpraised, overlong, and ramshackle","review":"I share other reviewers disbelief that this novel was so widely praised.

It opens with a young boy learning tricks and that in itself is pure genious. Carter is destined for a life that's fascinating, but it fascinated me that he found tragedy so early on. There's romance, history, imagination, misery and bouncing back to keep a reader interested. It's a fairly long work, but it flashed by for me.There's a wonderful parallel between illusions and the apparent magic of science which had me thinking about the way our world has moved on so far in such a short period of time.This is the kind of tale that has the roller-coaster energy as such greats as The Count Of Monte Cristo.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THE PRINT VERSION - MISSING 10 PAGES","review":"It's been three copies now and Amazon keeps sending me a book that's missing 10 pages in the penultimate chapter - it ends in the middle of a sentence on page 635.

He did exist and this book is a delightful novel based on his life. It traces his development as a magician, his friendship with Harry Houdini, and his involvement in the death of one President of the US. I couldn't put it down!In a never boring style, the author provides glimpses into life in San Francisco in the late 1800's and early 1900's and into the craft of stage magic as it was practiced in its heydey."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Dare you to stop reading this book!!","review":"I bought this book from a couple of good reviews i had seen in magazines, and i must say the cover also played a part in buying it. The story itself is fantastic from beginning to end. Everytime you turn the page it gets harder and harder to close the book. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A swash-buckling page-turner!","review":"Fresh off my book club's latest exercise in plodding through mind-numbingly boring prose, (sorry, guys!) _Carter Beats the Devil_ was a true treat. This isn't a literary masterpiece, but it is a darn entertaining example of historical fiction. Parts of the plot do get a little confusing, but the overall story is engaging, and the historical details are just interesting enough to resuce this book from the pitfalls of true \\"trash fiction\\".If you are looking for a good read, this definitely qualifies. If you want to find the meaning of life, get serious: you are obviously not going to find it in a book with color illustrations! Gold's prose may not dazzle, but his story-telling skills are solid. And coming from me, this is high praise, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick Marketing, Poor Writing","review":"Hyperion's marketing department is brilliant. The same cannot be said for the actual text of the novel. Don't be fooled by the very appealing cover artwork and full color reproductions of vintage posters included at the beginning of each chapter. Despite Gold's apparently extensive research into the real Charles Carter and into the era, his novel lacks insight into either. Amazingly boring in stretches for a novel about a magician. The only real magic about this novel is that it became a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried","review":"I normally read non-fiction. Politics, science, and environmental policy are my usual fare. I mention this so you know that I am quite comfortable investing in and reading through relatively dry, boring material.Having said that, I could not bring myself to finish Carter Beats the Devil. I started reading it on a flight between San Francisco and Portland, and tried, really, really tried, to continue it once I got home.I couldn't.This book meanders aimlessly through a plot and introduces characters I couldn't bring myself to care about. I made it just beyond where Carter visits his adult brother and to the murder in...in...where was it again?Who knows? Certainly not me.I stuck it on the shelf and cracked open Al Gore's The Assault on Reason.Ah...much better.I must admit - I'm puzzled by the glowing reviews of Carter Beats the Devil. I'm surprised anyone would rate this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera","review":"This was an over-researched historical fiction soap opera.

This is a seriously entertaining story about great entertainers.I am getting this as a gift for all the adult readers on my Christmas list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and thready","review":"It seems as if Mr. Gold was uncertain just which book he wanted to write. All the espionage and intrigue surrounding the death of President Harding in the midst of the Tea Pot Dome scandal, or the story of a Houdini wannabe. This may have made two very good books, but as one book it never created a tapestry that wove the two stories together, the way The Carpetbaggers did. I found myself skipping around trying to get into it and never did. The characters were kind of one dimensional and the dialouge was too cheeky even for that era. The best aspect of this book was the colorful cover and the fantastic promotional ad campaign that launched it onto the Best Sellers list, but this 500 page epic was a job-and-a-half to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Fun","review":"I loved this book. First I should put forth the disclaimer that I am an ametuer magician, so the concept of this book appeals to me personally. However, I also love a good novel and I think G.D. Gold has put together a fine piece.It has the kind of cloak and dagger thriller action that makes your pulse race as you turn the pages as well as characters that are well developed.My favorite aspect of the book was the wonderful exploration of its time period and how technology was affecting people's lives. That and just enough magic terminology to keep a magic insider satisfied that the writer knows what he's talking about without giving away the secrets.Well done, and a beautiful book to own with its lovely reproductions of classic magic posters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spin on history and magic","review":"This book was amazing--I raced through it,then immediately wished i hadn't.

Scootie and Kip arrive in Montana for their third summer-long visit on their uncle Frank's Five Barb Ranch, only to discover that Frank and Bill plan to leave them in town while they move a newly acquired herd of bulls to the ranch. The kids are adamant against staying in town any longer than necessary, and the men finally relent to letting them tag along.But the one-night trip they had planned is interrupted by severe rain storm, during which Kip and several of bulls are separated from the main group, the creek floods, Bill is washed downstream, and the kids barely escape becoming lion chow.Much to the story's detriment, James's once again failed to rein in his pen, and the result is several pointless chapters tacked on at the end. Other than that, the book's only flaw is an inherently weak premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book.","review":"Gives a great insight into his inventive mind... must read for artists.

I think most of us are familiar with Van Gogh's colorful oils but the extent of his pen and ink work was new to me and since looking thru this book and reading thus far, three chapters, has made me appreciate his work even more. Over a ten year period, Van Gogh's work included 1100 pieces of pen & ink & mixed media, often with subpar materials. I love the fact that he was primarily a self-taught artist often referring to his how to book up until the end of his life in his continual pursuit to learn and pursue his passion, this earnest passion reveals itself in each line of his work and makes me smile. I highly recommend this book as a coffee table book or as a lovely gift for all artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vincent Van Gogh: The Drawings--beautiful to look at and a great reference!","review":"This is an excellent book. It is beautifully illustrated, making it a lovely overview of Van Gogh's drawings, visually-speaking.It is also very well-written, researched and scholarly. The interweaving of biography, history and art makes it a great resource for research.I am particularly interested in prints and drawings as art media and work in an Art Gallery, so I find the book to be a good addition to my personal art history library.It compares well with Rubens: The Drawings, a recent catalogue for a Metropolitan Museum Exhibition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I vouch that this book is a must have for anyone, not just for preparing for the CCIE (R&S) but as a great reference material as well.

So many times you bump into books written by those who go off on tangents.There is not a chapter in this book that isn't worth the read. It's excellent, but I want to point you, again, to the IP Services portion of this book that really will round you out as an engineer and as a CCIE candidate.It is as informative as Volume I, it just covered different and lesser known topics but they are still topics you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"To technical for me.","review":"I found thias book way to technical for me.

It's one of those novels that you either will love or hate. I happened to love it. The chapters and long on cynicism and short on description and detail. Ridley's writing is very compact and brief. It feels at times like you are reading a script because of all of the one word descriptions. It's no coincidence that Ridley wrote the script to the movie which is almost exactly like the book. The story is rather simple it's about a drifter whose car breaks down on the outskirts of a dustbowl town named Sierra and what happes to him in the 24 hrs after. A good read but nothing life altering. John Ridley is a good writer with a distinct voice. If you are looking for a entertaining read check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put that dog to sleep","review":"Although Stray Dogs is a quick read it only makes it slightly less painful.

The lyric themes are as those of the Verve but served messilly and with less restraint. Doubtless the emotionally dented and the immature will feel this bag-faced music speaks to them as they impose their own meanings on Ashcroft's vapid yet tortured musings. The popularity of Lucky Man, from the Verve's last outing, is thus explained. It was one of those \\"that's our song\\" songs like Wonderwall was a few years back. The title of this album reveals Ashcroft's determination to compose a discful of similarly parasitic dities. In some way this record is enjoyable but you have to have another CD playing at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it much","review":"It looks great but when I got it, the tubes were stuck together.

The software that comes with it and the ability to save to the SD card are also great... but after a few weeks of use the pan features inexplicably stopped working. The effort to get it repaired/replaced was such that we ended up not even bothering and just repositioned to get the best view from a fixed location."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Pan isnt really Pan and Support offers no Support","review":"The specs for this camera say that it has Pan/Tilt and Zoom. The tilt works good. The zoom is digital vs optical but the low quality digital zoom is expected for a camera in this price range. The Pan does not work UNLESS you are zoomed in, then it Digitally Pans the view. So I guess it could be called Pan but not really. It does make panning ultra quiet though :-) Before I figured this out I emailed Panasonic. I got a reply back several days later saying that I should be getting a reply on my question about this camera's pan function from the camera support group and was encourages to rate my satisfaction with the support that I havent received yet. When Panasonic support did email me, they simply said the camera does not have Pan and closed the trouble ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes","review":"I worked at Mary Kay Inc. when this book was published and was lucky enough to be chosen to test some of the recipes. All the recipes gathered were tested by employees to ensure that the directions were correct and easy to follow, they are. These recipes really came from Mary Kay Ash and from the National Sales Directors (the highest level of independent Beauty Consultants in Mary Kay Inc), these women cook for their Mary Kay units and their families and overall I think the food is delicious. My husband loves stuffed grape leaves and the recipe here is probably one of the easiest I've seen (including my Syrian sister-in-law's version). The white chicken chili is fabulous and has become a favorite winter meal at our house. If you like to cook and like recipes that have a history, then you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Kay book","review":"Did not expect it to be shrink-wrapped.

I guess it's okay to watch it one time, but no more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quatermass the Legendary '70's sci-fi classic","review":"This is one of the best science fiction films I've seen so far. Personally, I find it fascinating, as it is about a cult where the young generation of that day is drawn to cirtain spots on the Earth, where they are compelled to call to a transporter, which is a large beam of bright light that then comes down and takes them up to another planet somewhere far out in space. Those who are not part of the cult, but are caught up in the beam are destroyed rather than taken to this planet. It's a great science fiction adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quatermass","review":"Thoroughly disappointing Quatermass presentation. If you have enjoyed the first three Quatermass films, and I did, you will find this one lacking in many areas. So much of the plot is left unexplained and as you reach the end you have more unanswered questions then you began with. Moreover, there is not real resolution to the plot at the end of the movie. The biggest questions is why anyone would end the Quatermass collection with this film that gives no satifactory answers to anything that is occurring in the film. Even Quatermass is not the same self-driven, strong willed character from the previous films. What prompted me to purchase the film was my like of the first three films and my curiosity to see the last Quatermass film to be made. What a complete let down for a fan. Save your money and enjoy the first three offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring...","review":"I found this film a bit dull. The actors seened tired and the dialogue is stilted and stagey. It's no Dr. Who. What a disappointment, I think I'll seel mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The final and best installment","review":"For the uninitiated, this is the latest and final of a series of films featuring the character of Bernard Quatermass. This particular version is the entire, unedited one, the one that actually aired in England.That said, allow me to say that this title is a dark version of the near future, but not as gloomy as Bladerunner. In a classic Sci-Fi tradition, death once again comes from the skies and only Dr. Quatermass can save the day! It's filled with character development and a large amount of pathos, so if you're a fan of British Sci-Fi, then you will likely love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Living faith","review":"Pam Lillehei lives her faith--and shares it too. Her book provides insightful details revealing God's love and faithfulness.

Truly, we are never alone, despite our fears. Pam shares this. Her honesty is comforting, compelling us to trust the God who made us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in what I received","review":"When I received the 6 inch bungees I was very disappointed in them especially when they call them \\"heavy duty\\". I have seen bungees from canopy king and was expecting these to match the quality. The bungee cords didnt even come close. The cord on them are not very thick at all, if you have it on a potable canopy frame and you have a good wind come up I am sure it will stretch them all out so they will be no good.

Though it moves at a steady pace and has a gripping storyline, it just somehow lacks the suspense that I expect from him. The storyline does include a timely subject, objects known as UAV's-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The timely subject and the steady pace of the novel still made for a good quick read.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally failed after 2 years...","review":"This drive was easy to install and did work great when it was new, but after about 1 year having it, it wouldn't eject CDs unless I held the door on the front open for it.

It also captures the raw, realistic passion that is more apparent in the ballads on his previous 2 Spanish language albums (\\"A Medido Vivir\\" and the Grammy-winning \\"Vuelve\\").\\"Private Emotion\\" is a ballad wrought with emotion and poetic lyrics. It is one of the most adult love songs on the radio right now, which is cluttered with the teenage love troubles of Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and the lot.

C) I've been told that people couldn't hear me very well when I used the H350. I have since moved on to the Plantronics Voyager 510. It is more cumbersome, but has much louder volume.

DO NOT GET ME WRONG, Del is one of the dopest and innovative emcees of all time, but this record is wack. I baught it when it first came out and I tried SOOOO hard to like it. Everytime it never failed me and once again proved itself wack. I should have taken a hint when I baught \\"Future Development\\" at a Hiro show. Another lack-luster record and the record that dropped Del from Elektra.The best tracks on this LP were the ones produced by guests: El-P, Prince Paul, etc. Preety much everything else was handled by Del himself and in the past that would have been fine, but this time it proved otherwise.If you want to listen to Del's best ish, go buy \\"No Need For Alarm,\\" \\"I Wish My Brother George Was Here\\" or cop \\"Deltron 3030.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DEL THA WACKEST HOMOSAPIEN","review":"del is the wackest mc in the biz, even wacker than nelly or anybody on the cash money label. his rhymes are 'cat' and 'hat', nothing special. if you wanna hear real flow, check out company flow, jedi mind tricks, common, or almost anybody from the underground. these words are recycled, trash, BASURA. don't waste the eyepower it takes to look at the cover of this garbage.don't say i didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only More Rappers Used As Much of Their Brain...","review":"A much awaited release from the video-game playing emcee from Oakland. Not surprisingly this is one of the few emcees that hasn't fallen off creatively. The album on a whole features Del's ability to tell comical, yet realistic stories that DO have a point. Of course, no Del album would be complete without appropriate disses going out to the wack emcees out there who so deservingly need them. An lyrical and musical work of abstract genius that is true to form for this Hieroglyphics frontman and West Coast pioneer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative&Inventive","review":"Del takes this album to places the listener can not even start to comprehend. There are so many different topics and word plays most won't recognize or realize how deep his lyrics are. Each time I put in the CD I find new appreciation for the production and composition. The first week I had the CD I was really juiced by three particular songs, then the CD seemed to unlock and my interests spread to new songs that ultimately had me listening to the whole CD really closely. Del's choices of collaboration are noble and complement each individual song. Hip-hop fans can not go wrong with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Del is Back!","review":"I waited for months for the April 11th, and when I picked up Both Sides of the Brain, opened it, stuck it in my deck I knew it was worth the wait. Del gets straight to the point, he skips the common 5 minute intro and gets straight into throwing down some crazy lyrics. There are no boring interludes or songs used for filler, you can honestly put this cd in and just listen to the whole thing. There are a few real gems on this record like Phoney Phranchise and Proto Culture and the rest of the album is full of far above average production and of course dope lyrics. Del gets some help from fellow Hiero alumni like A-Plus and Casual and a few other emcees, but for the most part this CD is all Del, even the production.In a word this album is DOPE"},{"rating":"2","title":"da_Scribe: Sick... But Not As Good As The First Two","review":"To be honest, i have to agree with \\"onassus\\" or whatever on one point he made. Del definitely does need to venture into different, if not more mature, subject matter. It was dope when he was in his \\"I Wish My Brother George...\\" phase, because he was young, but now, listening to his newer stuff, you can tell that he can excel if he challenges himself, in terms of topics. I still gave this 4 Stars because, as many people have noted, Del has one of the illest flows, and is lyrically diverse, and of course the production on his albums is always on point, but all he really needs to do is expand his topics, and Del might have a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"activate both sides","review":"this album is delphonic. i had to listen to it a few times before i really felt it. onassus obviously isn't on his toes with that review. everybody buy the album and bump song # 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its exellent","review":"Well, If i had never heard any other stuff by DEl befor i would think this CD is hella tight and it is but not his best. This CD is half a winner and half a just ok. Some songs are kinda boring and can't listen to them more that a few times but some songs are masterful. The songs that are good are so good that it makes this album worth the money. Songs #'s 1,4,5,9,10,11,17 are Delphonic classics. So get this if you are a hiero head or never heard Del befor.

Time is too expensive for me to be sitting still, i thought. I became increasingly excited through the second and third songs. Casual's appearance made me boogie and shimmy like nothing else on through the magnificently produced Prince Paul joint, Signature Slogans and the fast and catchy, Catch All This. i was noticing a slight feeling of pain in my left jewel. I couldn't control myself and began gyrating on the ground. I released in ecstacy as A-plus finished his verse on Stay on Your Toes. A thouroughly enjoyable experience i must say. My ears are still ringing.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes your brain overload and explode","review":"Fresh and innovative, Del comes in strong with this new release. Both Sides of the Brain reflects the dynamic, futuristic, true-to-the-game sounds of underground hip-hop's lyrical wizard. The beats are steady wild, home-spun head bobbin' and Del's rhymes hit with the true theory. If you like the good stuff get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one \\"funky\\" cd","review":"This cd has been in my stereo ever since i got it (almost), and I love it. A big plus... THE BEATS! Del provides the most original beats around, and they are all dope! \\"time is too expensive\\" and \\"BM's\\" are great examples of off the wall beats. The best songs are 1,2,3,4,9,12,15,16. Check out song 16 \\"proto culture\\", its got a great background and some really layed back lyrics (about video games). the only reason that this cd doesnt get 5 stars is because of del's lack of knowledge in his rymes. His words flow fast and furious but have little to say. Other than that go out and buy this and be prepared to experiance a very different kind of hip hop.

This is the perfect genre for them and with the addition of Jim McCarty and Rusty Day it just doesn't get any better.Check out \\"Can't judge a book by its cover\\". Amazing guitar work in this one. McCarty screams at the beginning of the solo and sets the tone for the rest. Can't help getting out the air guitar when I play this one.Have only one other Cactus cd (Restrictions) and it isn't nearly as good as this one.Side note: the hooks and phrasings on this album remind me to a certain extent of early Led Zepp.Whether you're into straight ahead rock or prog this ought to satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cactus will be crushed.","review":"I hate to be the guy that posts a negitive review, but here goes...

I bought every Cactus LP when they first came out and there only seems to be a hand full of songs that I would come back to on each LP. Perhaps the anthology would be the place to start for new listeners. I've heard Cactus compared to Led Zep, no chance! Just compare LZs first LP and this LP.... Cactus will be crushed- no creativity, low quality, and no sparks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim McCarty of the Detroit Wheels, not the Yardbirds drummer","review":"The editorial review has it wrong, but then again, is that a surprise? Axeman Jim McCarty remains under-known and under-appreciated despite yeoman work with Mitch Ryder, Buddy Miles, Cactus, The Rockets and many others.THIS is the record that started it all...Vanilla Fudge rhythm section Bogert/Appice miss out on the supergroup with Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart and the world benefits greatly - Stewart creates magic with The Faces and Bogert/Appice grab Motor City monsters Jim McCarty and Rusty Day. This original version of Cactus releases three of the best hard rock records of any era, blow everyone off the stage and set the standard for incendiary boogie rock. \\"Parchman Farm\\" can flat out raise the dead.The first three Cactus albums are no-brainer must-haves for any rock collection. Play loud and often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cactus Rocked, Big Time","review":"Although they never really made the big time, they were certainly capable of doing so, had they been able to resolve their differences. Jim McCarty was one Hell of a guitar player, still is, actually!! I remember the album rear cover saying \\"play loud\\". I did, and drove everyone in my house nuts! Great drums, bass, guitar and vocals, though i could do without most of the harp playing. I have always wanted to know: what's the deal with Rusty Day's hand on the back cover?? is it a fake appenditure? Some of my all time favorite rock tunes. Parchman Farm just kicked serious butt, Let Me Swim as well. The album doesn't really have a weak cut. The best years of hard rock were 67 to 73, in my opinion, and this band was one of the best. Never saw them live, i am sad to say...Anyway, one of my all time favorite albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Cactus - Good Ol' Sweaty Blues Rock","review":"One of the best rhythm sections in rock history (Bogert & Appice). This debut 70' album from Cactus is a classic and is highly recommended. This is raw high powered blues, R&B influenced hard rock. Whether you're a Vanilla Fudge fan or not (I am), you cannot but appreciate the musicianship and there are a few solid songs on this album. This was not released on Atlantic (Atco) records domestically on CD. Thankfully for this import, we have a high quality reissue to crank up, LOUD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Record","review":"If you're looking for good blues and boogie look no further. All of that and more is found on this record. It's too bad all the band's releases aren't available. They truly are overlooked. Carmine and Tim were not the best rhythm section in rock. Probably because they both thought they were the best players around. And they were. Saw them in Omaha in the early 70's opening for Rod Stewart and Faces and the crowd was actually trying to get Cactus back out 10 minutes into the Faces set. Tim Bogart is the best Boogie Bass player I've ever heard and/or seen. Too bad he dropped off the earth. This was the start of Cactus to hear the end pick up Beck, Bogart and Appice. Listening to this album will remind you that raw power and talent in music are not mutually exclusive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this without listening first.","review":"This was worse than your average garage band and the choice of music and recording quality was unacceptable.I would never recommend this to anyone and would never listen again.The album cover was great however."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hasn't blown up in my face in 2 years of use but it was a gamble","review":"model number VSCL871Ididnt buy this through amazonPros:-no lever.

She was funny but ."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Into the Sunset ...","review":"The second , and final, season of THE PROTECTORS finds Harry Rule the target of a top assassin; a cable car being held for ransom; hauntings. Alot is said about the writing. Look at the credits and you will like the likes of Brian Clemmens and Terry Nation. At 30 minutes (with commercials) you certainly aren't going to have deep and insighful character development. It's meant as quick and wild ride at the amusement park nothing more. Take it at that and you'll be entertained. Look carefully and you will see other actors from SPACE: 1999 and, in two episodes American actor Shane Rimmer (CPT Carter of the USS Wayne in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME). This would be the second and final season. The relationship between star Vaughn and the Andersons had never been good and this was the end of it. Vaughn will always be remembered for U.N.C.L.E. but THE PROTECTORS is an interesting side note. What I find amusing is that brand new sets are selling for a tenth of what Amazon is asking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd rarely leaves my cd player...","review":"My roommate and I have really enjoyed this cd the past few weeks that we've had it. Our favorites so far have been \\"A Woman's Heart\\" by Mary McLaughlin, \\"Can You See the Border?\\" by Keri Steele and Nina Loretto, and \\"I Am Going to the West\\" by Connie Dover. We are so curious as to what some of the songs' lyrics mean, but that doesn't stop us from listening to it over and over again. I don't usually enjoy compilations because there are always a few songs that I don't enjoy and I always have to skip over them, but that's not the case with this cd. If you like Enya or Clannad, I think I could guarantee that you will like this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"I love this CD. I heard it playing in a local bookstore, and after two songs, marched right up to the clerk and asked, \\"What are you playing?\\" When she told me, I immediately went to the music racks and found it, and bought it.Every song in this compilation is beautiful in its own way. Some are contemplative (\\"I Am Going to the West\\"); some make you want to dance (\\"Hoireann O\\"). Several of them will bring tears to your eyes. There's a song here for whatever mood you're in. One of the most pleasant surprises was Sinead O'Connor's rendition of \\"He Moved Through the Fair\\"; the controversy that surrounded her almost made us forget what a haunting BeanSidhe voice she has.If you like Celtic music, or folk music, or women's music, get your hands--and ears--on this collection, ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Music","review":"OK, if you like Celtic music at all buy this CD. It is one of my all-time favorites. Each song is completely different, some being upbeat like the Hebridean Hale-Bopp while others (like my favorite) are heartfelt and moving like \\"This Piece of Earth.\\" All of the songs are high in quality and are sung by extraordinary woman singers. Although a few of the songs are not in English they manage to convey their emotions through tone and instrumentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hauntingly beautiful anthology of celtic music.","review":"Faire Celts is a collection of hauntingly beautiful music by such celebrated singers as Connie Dover, Karen Matheson, Sinead O'Connor, Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh, Kim Robertson, and others.

The selections include He Moved Through the Fair (3:44); The Voice (3:01); Hebridean Hale-Bopp (4:26); A Woman's Heart (4:03); Can You See the Border (4:11); This Piece of Earth (4:20); Molly Na gCuach Ni Chuilleandin (2:34); I Am Going to the West (5:22); Erin Grd mo Chroi (4:19); Hoireann O (4:26); Ferry Me Across the Water (3:30); Dream Lover (4:28); and Thoir Dhohm do Lamb (7:66).

The small competitor was able to use that very same campaign to revitalise its business, and achieve its most productive quarter ever.Do you want to know how?Well you'll have to buy the book to find out.Strongly recommended as a practical, ideas based book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hindsight strategy: Leveraging the Obvious to get consulting","review":"The usual garbage.

Repeat three or four times and you have a book.It is easy to tell stories, but that is all this book does.

I don't know what else could have been done, aside from making an actual movie, to have this documentary be more exciting.This box set of five DVD's also includes separate biographies of three of our Founding Fathers and the most famous traitor in our history.Although a bit pricey, it is a very well-done high quality narration of the Revolutionary War, bringing my history book to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set on the Revolutionary period!","review":"Speaking as a history teacher, this is one of the best DVD's I own.

They went back to the origins of the Republic and refashioned the Revolutionary War as well. What people seem to forget is that while the conflict began in the north, the British defeats that led to surrender occurred in the South. Yorktown was the logical consequence of wounds inflicted first by \\"partisans\\" (as they were called) along the Santee and PeeDee rivers in SC.While the VHS series is quite good (and I do recommend) this truncation which perpetuates the notion of the south as a sideshow is not corrected. The contributions of Marion, Horry, Sumter and even Greene do not depict the real turning point. In reality more battles took place in SC than any other colony.

No complaints here."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want this real story this is it","review":"I have been an elementary teacher for many years and am always looking for something to read aloud to my students. This book grabbed the students and took them along for a wonderful ride. They are captivated by the idea that someone can find a place, after not fitting in. This story has all of the imagination that one would wish for. There are no villians,it is simply a story about a family fallen on hard times with the moral fortitude to do what is right and to make it when the odds are against them. I love this story. My students love this story. It is a winner all of the way around"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and creative. You won't want to put it down!","review":"'Beauty' is truly one of my favorite books! It is the type of book that sucks you in and doesn't let go 'till the end. It isn't an action packed book or anything like that at all. It is more or less a quiet type of book that is good to read when you are inside on a stormy day sipping tea. I recomend this book highly for anyone who likes to read interesting books. And who doesn't"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, but beautiful","review":"This a simple but beautiful retelling of the classic fairy tale. The added details are lovely and the style is old fashioned and warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was a fourth grader, and it blew me away. Robin Mckinley is genius. She takes a classic (and overused) fairy tale and transforms it into something original. The heroine isn't the beauty of the family. The evil sisters are actually as beautiful on the inside as they are on the outside. Beauty decides to go to the beast and save her father's life because the adventure calls to her. She's stubborn and plain, but she's also brave and honorable.It isn't difficult to understand how Beauty can fall in love with the Beast. Beast is everything every hero should be, except that he is no longer human.I loved the magic and imagination that jumps from each page, and I can read this book over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty By: Robin McKinley","review":"Have you ever gotten locked away in a castle with a Beast and invisible maids? In Beauty by Robin McKinley, you get to see what that's like in a 15-year-old girls point of view. Beauty, the teenage girl, is my favorite character because she is honorable and hopeful. Actually she befriends the Beast who owns the castle she is locked in. I love this book because it is a love story with a twist. Can someone really fall in love with a beast? This book is a great read for eleven-year-old girls and older. Everyone should read this book because they will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"EHHHH","review":"As for the quality of writing - I'm not a fan. Very bland - back-and-fourth type writing. Nothing spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Kids Book!!!","review":"This book is not just for kids its also a great book for adults too, it is the retelling of the story of beauty and the beast. I bought this book originally when i was 12. Since then I worn out the older copy and bought a new one. I am 26 now, and I still read it over and over again. Dont let the age selection for this book fool you, yes it can be read by the young but it can be enjoyed by the old as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"an old tale?","review":"How interesting can old stories be when we already know them all? Well, very, in this case.Retelling the story while focusing on the characters' lives, like in some of McGuire's books, make the old story an entirely new one.What I like best about McKinley, is the goodness and humanity of the characters. One must not always have a villain to enjoy a story. The sisters must not be bad in order to make Beauty good. I think this is a characteristic of other McKinley books and I intend to read her further."},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY!!!","review":"I'm happy i found this book! it has easily moved to my 'favourites' section of my bookshelf. i really liked it; all the characters were believable and likeable. it basically follows the lines of the origional fairy tale, but is much better. i have a little friend who agrees with me too; i read it to a little girl i was babysitting, and she wouldn't let me put it down! it's is a great book, and you should definately read it! it also makes a good bedtime story (though it's sad and scary in parts). happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beauty and the beast","review":"this is one of my favorite books of all time, and of all of the beauty and the beast versions that i have read, it is my altime favorite. i love the way that it portrays her as a human being and not some gorgeous dame who is perfect. it gives you a side of the story that you probaby haven't heard before, and unlike some of the other beauty and the beast stories that i have read, i like the fact that they incorporate family into this one. it is just a wonderful book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasn't a WOW kinda book - 4 and 1/2 stars","review":"I thought it was alright - great writing and everything, the story was pretty good BUT The beast wasn't a very well'developed charachter, and it wasn't something new, no twists nothing.But it kept me interested I guess, so it was pretty good"},{"rating":"2","title":"A++++!","review":"I remember when I first read this fantastic book. I had borrowed it from my school Library, and in the two weeks I had it at my home I must have read it five times. This is certainly one of the best tellings of Beauty and the Beast. I particularly like the fact that Beauty was not your average self obsorbed fairytale bimbo. She was the intellectual type which I personally can relate to. This was no airhead barbie Beauty which was which I truley appreciated. Also the author truly made the whole enchantment on the Beast, castle, and grounds believable and explained things very well. Way to Go!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An old favorite retold for us imperfect people","review":"I've always loved Beauty and the Beast, perhaps because I own an illustrated version with amazing pictures to go along with the fairy tale. And now that I'm a cynical teenager, I've found a new version- a Beauty and the Beast for the imperfect people in the world (like myself). With Beauty as plain but intelligent, and her sisters kind rather than mean as so many stories portray, it is at first hard to believe that the tale will come to a satisfying end. But stay with it, for all will end well--and I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that McKinley does this fairy tale the justice it deserves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"This is a remarkable rendering of the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" tale. It's engaging, humorous, exciting, and ultimately fulfilling. McKinley's writing refreshes the timeless story, making it seem new and vivid. Magnificent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep buying this book","review":"I keep buying this book... and giving it away. I am so glad that it has finally been reprinted in paperback form. It's a wonderful realistic retelling of a favorite fairy tale but let me make a suggestion, buy two. This is one you will want to share... but you won't want to be without it. Besides, your first copy will be read to death in no time. But it, read it, share it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good retelling of Beauty and the beast","review":"Actully this is one of my favorite books, its not the best book by Mckinley, her book the Blue Sword is her best that I have read so far. This book is better then the Rose Daughter, which is good but uses the same themes as this one. If you like retellings of Fairy Tales this is a good one to start off with, its not as confusing as Yolen's retelling. If you like fantasy this is also a good book too. Beauty's ending is a good one, only a little bit confusing. I am an avid Mckinley reader, I am in the middle of reading the Outlaws of Sherwood by her another book I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely overrated","review":"I am surprised that the book got such great reviews, because I found the writing to be very weak. The story was boring, the characters were unbelievable and unlikable, and in the end I didn't see any point. !!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!! The climax was basically Beauty getting lost in the woods on her way back to the Beast! Lame.I recommend that you read The Fire Rose by Mercedes Lackey. That retelling of Beauty and the Beast surpasses this one by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book","review":"I love reeding books and I read a lot of cheesy stuff but this wasn't a good book. It was slow, didn't get to the point of the book and when it did it was boring cheesy and stupid. I felt embarrassed and couldn't get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!!","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this version of Beauty and the Beast. To be frank; I hated it. I seriously don't know why this book has such a high rating when it deserves much less. Other novels by Robin McKinley are much better like The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown. Disney's Beauty and the Beast is so good that it's hard to surpass that version. I seriously don't recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"This is a nice retelling of Beauty and the Beast where the sisters aren't wicked and Beauty isn't quite as much of a martyr. Many of the descriptions remind me of Jean Cocteau's movie. It would be a good read for a young adult interested in fairy tales or an adult looking for a quick and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it","review":"This book- i won't lie- is slightly hard to get into at first but it is most certainly one of the better tellings of this classic story. I've read six different versions and this is the one I can pick up again and again. I can promise you that, although not the best book in the world, this book will make you fall for ALL the characters and it gives the castle a much more empty feel and by the end of it you will almost wish you had gone through this adventure in real life. It has depth, imagination, and is told in a way that will make you want to keep reading. I can honestly say it's definitely worth reading AT LEAST once."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderfull retelling...","review":"...to a classic fairy tale. Robin McKinley is my favorite author of all time; and probably always will be. I can relate to almost every thing that she writes. She certainly does paint a very vivid picture w/ words. and her characters seem so real they could almost jump out of the book! Beauty is not my fav. book of hers, but anything she writes is fabulous! If you like McKinley's writeing I would definetly recommend The Hero And The Crown, or Deer Skin... two of my favs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST books I have ever read!","review":"The first time that I read Beauty I was captivated and have been rereading it ever since. It is my favorite fairy tale and I thought Beauty was the perfect character, because she was so un-average! I think that Robin McKinley is a master story-teller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful retelling of a fascinating Fairytale","review":"I loved this book, from the first time I read it. It was different and funny. When Beauty had to leave her family, they all tried to stop her. She loved her family.

Then read everything else she wrote, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favs!!!","review":"Another great McKinley book!!I am a fan of Robin McKinley (The Blue Sword,The Hero and the Crown,Rose Daughter,Deerskin,Spindle's End) and have loved everyone of her books. This one is no different.The \\"plain\\" daughter of a once rich merchant goes on to the enchanted castle ruled by a beast. This known fairy-tale is set off by Beauty's lack of self-confidence,wry humor,and much more. I also liked the two maids, they added a touch of reality into this classic story.If you like retellings, or just fantasy books, you will definately love this stor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loveliness Almost Wholly Epitomized","review":"I truly admire and love this book, it possesses a sweet, clear, strong plot and follows closely along the same lines as the animated Disney classic. Robin McKinley took the familiar, wonderful tale, placed a few twists within it and retold it in a simple, yet charming, manner. If you love fairy tales, or just enjoy a good reading experience, I adamantly reccommend this book. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly wonderful book!","review":"This book was lovely, with great descriptions and a marvelous story. I really did enjoy this book. It was a wonderful elaboration on the original fairy tale.~Sunn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"I'm 25 years old and this is one of my favorite books! Beauty & The Beast has always been a favorite fairy tale to me (thanks to Disney) but this book takes that story and expands the dimensions a hundred-fold. It's not just about Belle's life with the Beast, but the story begins quite awhile before the Beast comes into the scene. You learn to know the Belle as well as her family well in advance of the advent of the Beast's part of the sorty, and the Beast? Not the angry, roaring lion of the stories we mostly see...but a kind, generous, but despairing Beast who has grown hopeless over the past century of solitude. I wouldn't even classify this book as a Children's book. It's the perfect blend of fairy-tale and reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book of all time","review":"Robyn McKinley's retelling of Beauty and the Beast is one of the best books a girl can read. I read it the first time when I was 10; I'm 18 now, and it's still my favorite book. (In fact, I mentioned it in my college application essay.) This book shows that the world is a beautiful place full of hope and joy, even if it is not sunny every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thoroughly enjoyed this story.","review":"It was filled with lots of descriptions to help the reader visualize the settings. The author included foreshadowing in Beauty's interest in the portrait of the young prince. I did, however, get disinterested in the novel's beginning because of the long amount of time that it took to get to the point of the plot. Over all this was an entertaining book that kept me wondering what would happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolute favorite","review":"I don't remember the first time I read this book, but I do know I've reread it every year since then. The world McKinley describes is the perfect setting for the well known tale. This book is great for young adults and also a great reminder for others who wish to explore the fairytale world again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Retelling","review":"This book is so cute!!

I do not know who is who in this book.There is not an exciting ending to the book because we know whats going to happen at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start, but it's worth it.","review":"In my opinion the story started out a bit slow. But by the end of the book I was completley satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love with your heart not your eyes...","review":"I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys the Beauty and the Beast story. That includes the Jane Eyre fans and the Twilight fans, as there is the whole Beauty and the Beast thing going on in those stories as well.This is one of two of my favorite Beauty and the Beast novels... The second being Rose Daughter also by Robin McKinley. And I recommend if you read Beauty you should follow and read Rose Daughter so that the two are read back to back, as I found that I preferred some aspects of one to the other.If you liked the Disney version, or the 1947 Jean Cocteau film version, or even the 1987 film starring Rebecca De Mornay and John Savage - but wanted a more mature version of the tale - then this book is definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a GREAT read, and I was sorry to see it end.","review":"This book is great, and an awsome read. It has it's funny moments of growing up, and discusses the things that everyone tried to forget when they were little. I was really sorry to finally be on the last page because i felt that i would be perfectly content to read forever the story of iona moon. out of the other books by Thon, i thought this was the best book she has written, and was delivered perfectly to a reader. Don't pass this one by!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film terrible fuzzy pirate print","review":"What a shame--I was unfortunately hoping for something resembling the Criterion Collection issues of Ophuls' other films. This is a fascinating work but this video is painful to watch and hear, a cheap pirate version of the original, picture and sound quality basically awful. The cover includes the names Max Schreck and Annemarie Sorensen who have nothing to do with the film--some way to avoid copyright restrictions?

He finds fault with every film he has made, he seizes on every opportunity to portray and emphasise De Niro as unintellectual, inarticulate and uneducated, and he reports details of his private life with the zeal of tabloid reporting. Some of his recall about characters and scenes in De Niro's film are just wrong and I have to doubt the veracity of some other events he describes, as I have read some of the same source material he has drawn from, and can see how he has misrepresented it. I am sure there are more interesting bios about Robert De Niro. This is one is just mean spirited. Don't give this guy your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"This machine is absolutely horrible. First thing I noticed when I took it out of the box and set it up is the cheap feel and quality of the materials especially the handset which also did not work properly. I got a lot of static from the handset making it impossible to talk on the phone. Since you need the handset to record the outgoing message for the answer machine I was not able to get a clear message recorded. But that was not the only problem out of the box, I was never able to get a single fax printed because I kept getting paper jams. The print ribbon would get rolled up with the paper and jam the machine. It was a total waste of time. Definitely not worth $180. I had the machine delivered at my office and when the secretary saw it she said \\"Oh no, you got a Brother, they're nothing but trouble.\\" I only wish I would have talked to her before I ordered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst fax machine ever","review":"To be honest this fax machine doesn't even deserve 1 star. It is by far the very worst fax machine I have ever used. You have to babysit it every time you fax something because the papers get caught up and won't feed through, or when you copy something it will do the same thing. I'm not even halfway through my 2nd ribbon spool yet and I can barely read the pages from incoming faxes or from pages that have been copied. Another problem is when you try to copy something, the pages have a tendency to feed through machine crooked, so you're constantly having to yank on the pages so they feed through and don't get hung up. Absolutely horrible machine. The phone and answering machine part work fine for me, it's just that if you want to copy or fax something, well, don't hold your breath...Oh yeah, and did I mention I've only had this thing for less than 2 months???"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Singer/Songwriter of the Cape Verdean Community","review":"The cd \\"Romance\\" is a wonderful illustration of Grace Evora's ability to sing and play multiple instruments. His songs all speak of life situations whether they be about love, relationships or the trails and tribulations of the Cape Verdean community. His songs speak of true relationships: two people in love or the broken heart of one who loves but doesn't receive the same love in return. He definately shows his soft side for love on this cd. I recommend that people invest in this cd and take the time out to listen to the words in his songs.

It has a real appeal to amateur astronomy.

It felt cheaply made, and the steel used wasn't welded together quite right. I think this resulted in reduced air flow, because it really didn't seem to pull much air out of the bathroom, and if my shower went longer than 5 minutes it started dripping water out of the grill onto my bathroom floor. And I don't believe the sones advertised were accurate as it was louder than expected. Maybe this particular fan wasn't caught during quality control, but I didn't want to take another chance.I returned it for a Panasonic fan which I can't rave enough about. The Panasonic just felt solid, didn't drop water, kept the mirror clear and was incredibly quiet. And it included the hardware I needed to complete the job. Buy a Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud!","review":"We installed this fan and then returned it. It was too loud! The whole point of replacing the old fan was to get a quiet one.

However, when I purchased a second HP for myself, I thought that feature was included in the system. But, surprisingly, it did not, and I learned that HP markets this feature separately for about $80. The reason I like the duplexer is because it does save paper, great for greeting cards, easy to install, and allows card stock. However, it will not support support 8 1/2\\" x 11\\" photo paper (Big Time Jams). Its support center puts you through a number of ineffective steps, but in truth there is no way to solve that problem. The duplexer sticks out 2 1/2\\" in the back of the printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP C8955A for PSC2510 for 4 years","review":"I bought it 4 years ago for HP PSC 2510 and I have not had a single problem with it. You can open its back door without detaching it for printing through or paper jam (though never happened). It is a bit bigger and make impression of better solid quality than contemporary duplex models of thinner plastic. If you still use a compatible printer, it is highly recommended, especially as it is so really cheap now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper Saver!!!!","review":"This product has cut my paper consumption almost in half by automatically printing on two sides. The physical install is easy and is described in the manual. The only tricky thing is that to enable automatic two sided printing you need to manually enable recognition of the duplexer in two different places. The manuals do not tell you that you must do this and hence you have to try every path that allows you to set printer options and features. Once you do that it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHECK YOUR POOH BEAR!","review":"My daughter just received this as a gift for her first birthday - it was so cute we took it out right away.

Then this partner dies and she opens a bookstore for women and within days has met an abused wife, two nuns, several lesbian couples, a homosexual couple (one of whom is not monogamous and has contracted AIDS from a casual sexual partner, etc...

Very much a disapointment from Panasonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best speakerphone for the price.","review":"I have been on the market for a decent phone for a while, and this one is simply the best bargain in ages.Its styling looks outdated, but beside that, it's just what you'd want. Sound quality is ok, speaker is loud, volume easily adjusted, mute button accessible, just simple and functional.I am a remote employee, and do a lot of conference calls, and this phone is just what I needed. The speakerphone function just works, which is quite remarkable, from my past experiences.It requires batteries, however if you don't install them, the only thing you lose is the phonebook function (which I don't use). The speaker phone still works.There is a headset plug, which I haven't tried yet, but it can only work better than any Plantronics junk (what a pure waste of money).This is the type of product you just hope will stay around, and not be canned because it doesn't look good anymore... it just works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet expectations","review":"The phone has no caller ID. This was a feature that I overlooked and was disappointed but it was my problem. My focus when I ordered was overlooked caller ID in favor of the good reviews for speakerphone quality. It is just not good enough. The phone hangs on a kitchen family dining wall so that we would talk hands free in that area of the house. However, unless we stand within a 3 or 4 feet of the phone then the person on the other end of the call cannot hear/understand. Would return if not for the restocking fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Caller ID","review":"This phone was everything I wanted but when it arrived, I saw that it did not have a caller ID screen.

As a result we had to return item and assume the cost of mailing it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic phone","review":"I bought this to replace an older 2-line Panasonic phone in our office. The old phone had worked well for many years, so I already had a good opinion of the model. This one's just as easy to program and use. The one quirk we've noticed, and the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars, is that when I attached a headset (which is the way we answer the phone in the office) I could not answer the phone by just pushing the headset/speaker button as I had on the older phone. I have to pick up the handset. That makes it a little less convenient to use.Still, though, if you're looking for a good, reliable phone with large, easy to read buttons and plenty of memory for speed dialed numbers, this phone can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Office Phone","review":"I have not used speaker phone yet, but the phone is attractive, has large easy to see buttons, clarity on phone calls and volume controls work well. Nice addition to an office desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for walls","review":"I bought this phone to replace another Panasonic that I had for many years, used as a wall-mounted phone. This phone's wall connection is bad in two respects. Most wall/desk phones have an attachment for DESK. This one has the attachment for WALL use, and it holds the phone much too far from the wall. Once it is on the wall, the angle is wrong so that the receiver does not stay on the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Panasonic warranty","review":"I purchased this phone, but was disappointed with the quality of sound. I, also, was having a problem with a feature of the phone, but got that solved. However, when I contacted Panasonic, before I got the feature to operate, I was informed that my only option (if I could not get the feature to work) was to receive a refurbished model as a replacement even though I had purchased a new one. That plus having to pay any shipment charges to send it back to them seemed unreasonable. The Panasonic customer support people were extremely condescending, rude, and had a take it or leave it attitude. That was the final straw in making me return the poor quality phone. I will never purchase a Panasonic phone again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some People Like Cords","review":"I wanted a simple, corded phone, but most phones in the stores are cordless... and the ones that had cords were really expensive business models. This Panasonic model fit my needs.I use it with my cable company's telephone service, and it sounds great. There's a handy volume control, so I can crank it up if I can't hear the other party. A lot of times when I call companies, I'll get an automated answering service, but each company sets their automated system to a different volume. This phone's volume control helps solve that problem.There is a handy headphone jack, but it requires a smaller headphone input than your regular headphones. (I think it's 2.5 mm instead of 3.5 mm.) Plus you only hear sound in 1 ear... but you're already doing that with the earpiece anyway.There's no caller ID, but most callers (especially telemarketeres) show up as unlisted anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this Phone","review":"I purchased this phone for my grandmother (in her 80's) several months ago. When I went home for Christmas, I saw her phone and asked how it was working. It wasn't and she didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me. It worked fine at first but after about two weeks, the buttons stopped working. The dial tone is there but when you begin to dial a phone number, the dial tone continues and the buttons are not recognized by the phone. It still rings but that's about it. And because she didn't tell me, I've missed the return window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Phone","review":"basic phone but works well and speaker phone feature is loud and clear. storing message and auto dialer easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone, fantastic price","review":"I needed a phone for the home office that was a speaker phone. I did not need a cordless unit. This does NOT need a power cord to use the speakerphone, only to use the memory dial. So I use it only with out the power cord and it works fine. The only issues ( and the only reason it is a 4 and not a 5) is that the speaker phone will not activate by the \\"button\\" on it's own with out power. You have to lift the handset and then push \\"speaker\\", then replace the handset, then it works normally. I would buy this again in an instant especially at the very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good phone and good speakerphone!","review":"We bought this because of a friend who is a long-haul trucker wanting to listen in on a worship service at our house, and our old speakerphone didn't work very well.

These days it is impossible to find it in the common electronic stores. It is the phone that is used in emergencies when we lose power which happenes almost twice a month these days. It has the speakerphone feature which is very useful for being put on hold for long periods of time. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Solid Land-line Speaker Phone","review":"I really like this phone. It's good old-fashioned quality construction and will probably last a long time. I had an AT&T that conked out on me after 2 years, the programming got all messed up. I really like the number pad as well, very solid keys. The only thing I don't like about this phone is you cannot get a dial-tone by just pressing the Speaker key for speaker phone. You have to lift up the earpiece, then press the Speaker key, then put the earpiece back down. Not too big a problem, as overall this is a great phone! The speaker quality is good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Features Not as Advertised","review":"The main reason for purchasing the phone was to have caller ID.

I would highly recommend this phone to anyone working at home or small office setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUTE button is AWFUL and downright embarrassing","review":"As has been mentioned in other reviews, the mute button makes a very loud click on the other end. I've been told this and tested it by leaving myself a voice mail. It's just horrible, and completely unprofessional for the other party. If you NEVER plan to use Mute, then it's an otherwise good phone. But a Mute button bug like this is a thoughtless design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A low-budget MIDNIGHT COWBOY","review":"I saw this on the satellite network and wanted to buy it. A real B feature film but one that keeps you watching all the way through. The lead actor is magnificent as well as many of the other characters. This could be a cult film for collectors. I was surprised it was selling on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"real","review":"This picture was like being tarnsported back to 1974-76 when I was bottomed-out and people in the Village saved me. These characters seemed alive and beautiful and touching. It hurts not to be loved, but lovers have no real choice. Sometimes being annoyed or selfish or distracted can do real harm, but again there is no real decision to hurt involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Not a bad Movie but definetly different. Salma Hayek is Hot as usual and does a really great laundrymat scene. This Movie will not fit all tastes. The story line is hard and gritty and cuts no corners making it's point. Life in the big city is tough and in order to make it sometimes you need to sell more than your virtue.I've just one question... What about the Soundtrack? The music was great it should have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Is It Named After Gary?","review":"A good cast wasted. Poorly written, filled with every cliche of \\"life on the edge\\", the film never gives depth to the three characters whose lives are so deeply intertwined. Their feelings for each other are never illuminated, so we don't know why they are together. They yell and fight and act outageously, but they give us no reason to care about them. For this I blame not the actors, but the director who seems to have no idea how real life happens or how real people talk to each other.Salma Hayek comes off the best, though her charcter is unrelentingly irritating. Vincent D'Onofrio is good as always, a very intelligent actor. Thomas Jane is pouty and intense, but has the least well-written character to work with.And why is the movie named after him, when the center of this drama is not Gary (Thomas Jane) but Valentino (Vincent D'Onofrio)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful acting, awful story - don't waste your money","review":"The acting performances of D'Onofrio and Hayek were simply miserable. I found myself laughing numerous times because the acting was so pathetic. I still cannot figure out why a bedraggled, greasy D'Onofrio was cast as Valentino, and why he had two lovers tormenting over his illness. Neither his appearance or personality were desirable, leaving the character of Valentino completely unbelievable. The constant bickering of Hayek and \\"Gary\\" became annoying and predictable. This movie had potential, but terrible acting, terrible casting and cumbersome plot makes this movie virtually unwatchable. Easily the worst movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and Pointless","review":"I saw this film on the new release shelf. Vincent D'Onofrio, Salma Hayek. Looks quirky and fun. It's not. First of all, the most interesting character is killed off in one of the first scenes. Then, we are left with the other characters moping around and making out. I found it hard to distinguish any story at all, and by the last reel, the film made me wanting to take a shower, badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made...yes, I'm serious","review":"Where to begin? Cliched. Pretentious. Flat. Static. Maudlin. Melodramatic. Homophobic. And finally, just plain BORING. Start with an over-the-top caricature of a deaf-mute Patsy Cline young drag queen arriving the big city, pile on cardboard \\"colorful\\" characters like typical AIDS patient, porno star, and loud-mouthed Latina hot mamna, and whaddya get? An amateur film populated with some of the most UNLIKABLE, UNATTRACTIVE characters ever, all spewing some of the unbelievably BAD dialogue ever written - and to think the (formerly talented) director made THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD also with D'Onofrio? Go figure. Nice cover art, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor storytelling","review":"I love movies that make you think, but I also would appreciate it if it wasn't dragging and so damn dull! Although the actors were great in their roles,I felt that the story should have been told in a much better fashion. I didn't see any reason why Selma and Gary loved Valentino that much. All I saw was a bunch of spontaneous make-out sessions, no love at all! I was checking my watch every fifteen minutes wondering when Valentino was going to kick over! I cared nothing about the situation between those three. If only the filmakers would place in meaningful scenes that would convince the viewers that the relationships with Valentino actually ment something! I saw a better story between Gary and the deaf man in drag! At least the movie explained why the drag queen was so infatuated with Gary and I was saddened to see him die. Bottom line.. I was thoroughly disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Films Ever","review":"This has got to be one of the most boring, pointless films I have ever seen. It is impossible to build up any empathy for the characters and the plot is non-existant. All the Characters are one dimensional and listening to Salma Hayak scream for virtually the whole movie is very tiring. Watching a trio of losers live in a hovel, sit in a hospital and have sex in bathrooms does not a movie make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"Godawful film that tells the story of a bisexual former porn star (Vincent D'Onfrio) in NYC slum who's s-l-o-w-l-y dying of AIDS while his unemployed girlfriend (Salma Hayek) and boyfriend (Thomas Jane) watch. D'Onfrio and Hayek are Obnoxious, unsympathetic, and annoying. The movie as a whole is totally unlikeable and at times boring. For those interested, Ethan Hawke appears very briefly in a few scattered scenes as a tattoo artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your money","review":"This movie is dull, the characters are unengaging, the plot is trite, and the pace is glacial. Waste two hours watching this movie and you too will want to warn others.'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets.","review":"This movie missed the theaters and went straight to video, and even this fate is too good for it. The acting is terrible, the characterizations are not credible, and the plot developments--the few that there are--- are dull. Selma Hayek plays an absurdly stereotypical \\"NYC foul-mouthed Latin Chick,\\" the sort of role that used to be pushed on Rosie Perez.This picture pretends to treat homo and hetero relationships evenhandedly, but the homo component is really a bit of \\"spice\\" put in to underscore how far out of the mainstream these characters are. The hetero relationship is the only one that is explored in any depth, and that depth is minimal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelllent","review":"I just bought a bearded dragon and if you want something to help you besides a book with the care and raising one, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good for long term use","review":"parts came a little loose, I guess that is what to be expected for the price.

It's such a basic device, no moving parts. It's an adapter. There's not much to get wrong. BUT, with mine, the 1/4\\" jack is either mildly warped or a little thick, out of round, or something because it does not plug in easily to any of my amps and because you basically have to force the snug connection, the end is beginning to come loose.

Winamp has the entire album to listen to all the full tracks. I will be heading out this weekend to purchase 2-3 copies. Ricky, Ronnie, Johnny, Ralph and Michael Bivens have real and true talent!!!

They're proving that they're still in the game even though their last album was almost a decade ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Boy and NE not a good mix","review":"New Edition needs a production team that is more in tune with their smooth light hearted style. The beats, for the most part, are too powerful and punchy for their vocals. This CD is like Babyface or Maxwell singing to tracks that Biggie would rap to - not a good combination. Gill comes out of nowhere on track 12 with a deeply masculine sound that in no way compliments the group. Why isn't he solo? Why isn't Bell? I guess it's all for one and one for all. At least w/ all the hype of being linked to Diddy and their loyal following they'll make decent sales. Aren't these guys grown men? Their lyrics don't reflect it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"these cats should consider getting on the Las Vegas Gravy Train now while they are still very young. this Album sounds like a Karoke of Cuts over the past 15-18 years. nothing here really stands out.New Edition ain't made an Album that has truly Counted since 88.Rlaph was peaking then Vocally but that has been a while now.they need better material&Bobby Brown Back.

Big ups to New Edition, and congrats to Ricky and Mike on their recent marriages."},{"rating":"1","title":"first New Edition disappoitment","review":"I remember how excited I was to hear that New Edition was releasing another album. I've been an NE fan since Candy Girl and couldn't wait to buy the CD (and I don't buy that many CDs). I was a little nervous about them being on Bad Boy though.And that was for good reason. This release was the first and only time I was sorely disappointed in a New Edition album. The CD as a whole is ultimately forgettable. There was way too much effort to conform to Bad Boy's ultra-young over-the-top sex and hip hop instead of being true to what New Edition's legacy and appeal have always been. Mike and Ron's tired hip hop wannabe rap act wears thin within their first two bars of rhymes. These guys aren't 17 years old, but Bad Boy puts all their eggs in that basket.I await NE's next release and pray that they will actually sing about something the next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as any R&B group this Decade.","review":"4 Good tracks.Come Home With MeThat's Why I LiedRe-Write The MemoriesWildest Dreams *This is the standout song.

Thanks for making me feel sixteen again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avg at Best","review":"This CD starts out with Diddy saying 'Let's make History'. The only history made on this CD is the fact that is probably the worst NE CD to come out. I have every NE CD from Candy Girl on up to One Love and there is nothing on this CD that you will remember 6 months to a year from now. The best track is 'Hot 2 Night', but the song only has 1 verse. So while it's very catchy the first few times you listen to it, after the 5th time it is quite repedative and will have a very short life on the charts. The track 'All on you' is pretty good, but should have been a BBD song and not a NE song. My next favorite track is 'Newness', which is a nice slow jam. However, this song sounds very similiar to a track from their 'Home Again' CD. All other tracks are very average with no highlights.This CD is a disappointed, after the long wait for this CD to finally get released. I guess I'll put my NE: Heartbreak CD in now and remember the days when they had great producers working on their stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One love is ready and waiting","review":"We got great music all around us.

It is great to see NE stay with the style they are known for. It is a shame with all the corporate consolidation where all radio stations are either owned by Radio One or Clear Channel the programming director will not give any of the other tracks much if any airplay.It would have been nice if Bobby had joined his boyz on this (Another \\"You Don't Have to Worry\\" type jam would have set it off) project. Oh well one person doesn't stop the show.The only thing other than having Bobby back would have been to have Johnny Gill featured more on the lead of more songs.To wrap this up, This is a definite must have.

We've been waiting 8 years for an album but it was worth the wait. I can't stop listening to \\"Rewrite the Memories\\" and \\"Newness\\", hell the whole album is banging.

How is this an attempt at Emperor Tomato Ketchup? It has nothing to do with that, and not much to do with Dots and Loops either. Its Stereolab and their most relaxed and adventurous, while trying new things. Funny thing is, my fave tracks are Italian Shoes Continuum and Blue Milk, the two people seem to dislike the most. How does Blue Milk not do anything? Its amazing, especially when the motorik burst comes in about two thirds into the song. It is a beautiful cluster of sounds.

Stereolab isn't a \\"French band\\"; they're part French, part British, and wholly Eurointernational in style, incorporating a melange of styles from '60s lounge pop to beyond-'90s electronica. And they're without question one of the most aggressively experimental bands working these days. That said, as a long-time Stereolab fan (from way back in the \\"Peng\\" days), I'm a bit confused by \\"Cobra and Phases\\". On one hand there are some truly brilliant tracks, but some of the more obtuse, overlong ones (i.e., \\"Blue Milk\\") don't quite go anywhere. There's a brilliant album floating around somewhere in the 75 minutes of this disk which some more selective track editing might have bought forth. Still, it beats listening to Celine Dion. Hey Quebec, maybe you oughta stick to Britney Spears or something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy","review":"To me, this album captures all of the glamour, romance, and excitement of seventies action movies. If I close my eyes, I see myself walking around a gaudy hotel with gorgeous women in very revealing dresses and feathered blond hair while I go to meet the mysterious East European in the casino where the band wears maroon tuxedos with very frilly shirts under their jackets that have massive white carnations. Not quite James Bond...that's a little bit too classy. But this world is much more exciting, sexy, and dangerous. And I'm wearing ridiculously large aviator sunglasses, tinted a curious shade of brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stereolab: Musical Deconstructionists","review":"futuristic, yet retro. avant-garde, yet insistently catchy. complex, yet (essentially) simple.i'm not saying that stereolab is the kind of band that most cats will appreciate; i won't give the music-listening public that much credit. but there is something about their aesthetic that can really grab one who takes the time to listen. this is music that can change colors, chameleon-like, at any given moment--from the simple, innocuous vocal delivery of Laetitia Sadier to the nebulous warblings of songs like \\"velvet water\\", stereolab is difficult to pigeonhole. and if you could pigeonhole them, what would you say? that they are a tremendously talented group who are comfortable whether being \\"poppy\\" or experimental? or how about a combination of the two? this, to me, is one of stereolab's greatest virtues--that their experimental acumen mixes so well with their pop sensibilities. check out this album, along with \\"dots and loops.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction To My Earlier Review","review":"The track listings here are different from my own copy of the disc, so I may have referred to a few of the tunes by the wrong titles.

This is SUCH a good album! A great mix of slow and fast songs, infectious melodies (I ve been walking around humming since I bought it). There's so much going on in the songs that I haven't tired of listening to Cobra. There's no need to touch the remote...all the songs are great...a very cohesive album. I hope to find that their other albums are this great. I am definetly going to buy whatever I can get my hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly Title, Great Music","review":"CDStereolab's full-length follow-up to \\"Dots and Loops\\" continues to update old sounds with new techniques and increasingly strong song writing. There are some magnificent tunes on here. This is not as \\"start-to-finish\\" excellent as some of their other material but if you like the groop you shan't regret this purchase. It contains two of my favorite songs of theirs in \\"Infinity Girl\\" and \\"Blips Drips & Strips\\". \\"Strobo Acceleration\\" has beauty and atmosphere to spare and \\"Op-Hop Detonation\\" is a groovy little ditty to get your toes a-tappin'.There are one or two tracks I could do without, but that's about it. I think those songs would be good if I heard them apart from the others. I have found many Stereolab songs on other albums that suffer only by comparison to unbelievably fantastic ones. That's it. You have your recommendation. Purchase, listen, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't it great?","review":"Wow, what an album! If you though Dots and Loops was good \\"Cobra Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night\\" is spectacular. Track five really stands out to be one of the strong points in this album. To me this is the second album of Stereolab's \\"New Sound.\\" Gone are the trance rock riffs of \\"Transit and Random Noise and Burst of Sound (excellent in their own right),\\" but replaced with a retro-lounge feel (for lack of better words). I just hope none of the tracks on this album are used in another Volvo/Apple Computer add. Although Sound Dust is good even it falls by the waysided compared to the \\"Cobra Phases\\" release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a surprise","review":"I see no way of giving to this work less than 5 stars. Everything I reviewed on Amazon.com before had basically fallen into jazz/art-rock categories representing my musical preferences. But I am very keen on esoteric cocktails where every style is represented with the right proportion. Different musical palettes are intertwined with exceptional taste. I've never heard this band before and I'll certainly check out their early albums. Oddly enough, it reminds me of Frank Zappa's \\"Sleep Dirt\\". In a good sence :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still stunned . . . in a good way!","review":"This album is absolutely incredible. I bought a promo copy of this album about a month before it came out for the sum of forty dollars and it was worth every penny.

Their live versions of \\"Infinity Girl\\" and \\"Blips, Drips, n Strips\\" still make me smile when I think about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronica + Vocals = Great Disc","review":"This is the first Stereolab disc that I have owned, so I cannot approach this review as a seasoned veteran of their fairly extensive catalog of highly inventive electronica.However, I can unequivocally say that I really enjoyed this disc, and it has motivated me to become better acquainted with Sterolab's sound. On this title, the perky (and sometimes discordant) eletro/techno sounds contrasts with, while at the same time emphasizing, highly melodic -- one might even say 'pretty' -- vocals.I would not call this an \\"essential\\" disc, though it as highly recommended as any disc short of that level can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a big old breath o' fresh air!","review":"I first heard Stereolab when I was just waking up. I sat up and thought, \\"this is amazing!\\" It was so very unique. It's influence is obvious. To me it reeks of 60's bossa nova you'd find in a given Peter Sellers movie. The way it all falls together is so tasteful."},{"rating":"2","title":"stereolab v3.01","review":"This albums continues where Dots And Loops stopped - cocktail tunes, spacey lyrics. Smooth, easy, simple - but always, ALWAYS catchy and fun. A weird production touch by O'Rourke and McEntire - pianos all the way, seems a bit less electronic. This is like \\"A Thousand Leaves\\" compared to, say, \\"Dirty\\". Takes some time to get into it, and then you can hardly listen to anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but still fantastic","review":"This is truly an incredible album. Stereolab is such an asset to the world and fills a very unique void. Certainly they have their immitators and, honestly, they are immitating themselves, but the outcome is something so wonderfully there own. While they might not be my favorite band in the world, I hold them in the highest regard for what they do. Cobra, like almost all of their work, is astounding. The songs are fantastic and Jim O'Rourke's production is great as always. But, to be perfectly honest, if you have never heard them, I do not think this is the place to start. I consider Dots and Loops to be the ultimate Stereolab record. That being said, don't let me scare you away. This album will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked it","review":"I have a comment for \\"A music fan from Quebec , September 23, 1999\\".. they're not French.. grrr..

My favorites include the catchy \\"Could I Have This Dance?\\" and \\"Why I Ain't Got You,\\" a musing on the limits of political -- or perhaps romantic correctness: Yeah, I'd drink latte instead of coffee/ Bake a quiche with a recipe/Take tofu in my burger if you'd ever notice me/Wash the dishes after dinner/I'd do the laundry \`n fold \`em too/But for the life of me, it's a mystery/Why I ain't got you.\\" \\"Mi Hogar Santa Barbara\\" is in Spanish, which I don't understand, but it's sure a pretty song befitting the beautiful southern California coastal town.

Rowena is annoying, irritable and intent on making things harder for herself when she could have it easy.She is offended that Quinn may be just another man after her body, yet she is the one who wanted a no strings affair with him.She is an arrogant and highly annoying heroine and completely ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for my collection","review":"The hero is a handsome and successful plastic surgeon, so you may wonder how I can say what I'm about to say - that one of the things I liked about this book was that the characters were drawn a little differently, esp. the guy, who is adorable. He enters the book as the vulnerable (not weak) party, fighting for a relationship that appeared to have ended for no reason.There is a nice flashback about how things had started. All quite normal and believable, even if his present antics are not.The heroine is the hard one here, I wasn't able to feel much empathy there, but I had no trouble believing that the hero could fall for the beautiful, if somewhat less grounded, heroine.I like the cover on this one, too! - the guy is not effeminate, but he is looking down, and it's the girl who is kissing him - it reflects what I've attempted to share about the characters here."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate it","review":"don't wast your money on this book. this book is sooooooooooooooooooooo dume and it give me a headack because not thing made cents. sooo don't get this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Great Album.","review":"This album is stellar.

Of all denominations--say the authors--the URC (United Reformed Church) has maintained its commitment to addressing economic issues more effectively than most. In an issue of Reform dominated by news of Assembly debates on re-structuring, it is re-assuring to be told that we have avoided excessive introspection, and have continued to regard economic matters as germane to Christian ethics and discipleship. Churches, generally, are said to have been ambiguous about engaging with the economy. The authors speculate why that might be. Is it simply because economics are as contentious as politics? Or because the churches are deeply implicated in the workings of an economy which, were we to scrutinize it, might not exhibit many recognizable Christian traits?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of Early Traffic","review":"This is a complimation of Traffic's best first offering, and although it is true, Mike Reed, that Dave Mason is more dominate on the classic \\"Traffic\\" album, He is present here with four songs, beginning with \\"Hole In My Shoe\\".

'Heaven...' is most certainly a top notch piece of British psychedelia. Doubt anyone would debate that. Most of the band's classic line-up is here, Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood. Apparently Dave Mason didn't play on THIS longplayer. Could listen to this reissue quite often as I check out the CD's gems like \\"Paper Sun\\", \\"Coloured Rain\\", \\"Dear Mr.Fantasy\\" and \\"Here We Go 'Round The Mulberry Bush\\". There's been four bonus tracks added for your pure listening pleasure. If you want to see what sort of music the cool kids were listening to in 1968, hunt down a copy of this title.

It certainly is an album of its time and some may find it sounding dated but the artistry of Winwood, Capaldi, Wood, and Mason is undeniable. Better albums were to come from Traffic, but this album is certainly worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"heaven is in my speakers as well","review":"When it comes to pure excellent songwriting and top notch musicianship, \\"Heaven Is In Your Mind\\" is Traffic's finest hour. The brilliant songwriting skills were firmly swinging smoothly on this album. It's just a wonderful pop album that sadly will probably be forgotten as the years pass and people choose to remember the Beatles, Stones and Who instead.

The first time I saw Saiyuki was when I watched the demo DVD that came with one of the issues of Anime Newtype USA magazine.

I love the smooth creamy taste of this one and so do the friends I share it with. easy for children and old people like me to heat and eat :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes like dog food","review":"A relative gave this to our household. It looks and tastes like dog food. Smells like it to. Since chicken alfredo is my favorite food I have tasted many during my lifetime. And this is the worst one I have ever tasted. It's as if a shipment of animal products and human food got mixed up, and it LOOKS like our dog's meals. I ended up giving the rest to him and he lapped it up. I would not buy this for humans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"My 3 year old read this in his preschool class and couldn't get enough! It quickly became his favorite, so we got him his own book for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fast!","review":"I received my book very quickly. I was very pleased and everything was how it should have been. My class enjoys the book very much and i was very happy to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!! I love it and so does my 2 year old.","review":"this book is great. My 2 year old son had it memorized within a couple of hours and he now reads it to everyone and anyone who will listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Kid's Imagination","review":"This story is great for toddlers. I first checked it out at the library when my son was 2 and a half. He loved it and wanted me to read it over and over. I ended up buying the book since we had to check it out so much! The journey of a black cat builds on a mystery of what is going to happen at the end of the story. It's a perfect gift to give to young children. Enjoy it - we still do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Dark Tale","review":"The artwork is beautiful and detailed. My three year old loves to find the cat in each picture and to find the faces in the windows, walls, and curtains. One can always find something new in the paintings. The story uses repetitious wording, so he can virtually read it to me. We have read this book many times, yet neither of us ever gets bored with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I thought it would be..","review":"I like buying the dark children's books to add to my son's collection. So I was excited to receive this particular book.. But the story line just is not there. The entire book basically just goes through the house and says \\"in a dark dark corner there was a shelf?\\" and then the next page \\"in that dark dark corner on that shelf there was a ..\\" and mind you that is actually not from the book but it is exactly like that... and the ending took me by surprise so I kind of sat there and wanted to laugh because I have no idea how this book got published. But the illustrations are amazing ,so I gave it two stars for that. I am not sure what my son will think of it because he's to young to care right now. But it is not as great as some of the other books I have bought. I would skip this purchase."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],O={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-1fc704d3"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/30.md","filePath":"quotesmag/30.md"}'),W={name:"quotesmag/30.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
