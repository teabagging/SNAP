I began hearing some Al Green songs I hadn't heard in years and I was really enjoying them. Enough to consider purchasing a hits CD. This has all 13 of his pop top 40 singles from his 1971-1976 heyday, so it was clearly the best choice. 5 more songs round out the CD, and of them, only his take on \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\" missed the mark with me. \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\\" is wonderful.

Other little girls are just so much better. Unfortunately the camera was not focused on them.The smelly plastic mat made with cheap PVC is slippery. The bar is unsteady. It has turned into a towel rack in our household.The whole thing seems awfully and amateurly put together.The best thing is clips from various actual ballet performances.You don't want to introduce ballet to your little ones from this DVD.

If you are buying this to test your daughters interest in ballet, then get this. If you're just looking to buy something cute and fun for her, buy the Cinderella version instead. It's a better buy overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Bad","review":"Santa brought this present for my three year old daughter this past year.

The music was horrible. It's supposed to be a ballet DVD. Let's try some classical music?? Of all the beautiful young women on the planet, they had to pick this girl?? I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this was definitely the producer's daughter, as she had absolutly no other redeeming qualities. She has a horribly annoying voice, a face that hasn't launched any ships, and no talent for ballet.I have not let my daughter watch the DVD since Christmas week as I just can't stand it.

I have bought this production company's Shakespearean videos before, and every time I am disappointed. I just keep hoping one of them will be decent. This was the worst Antony and Cleopatra I have ever seen. The acting is so terrible that in places where a good actor would have you weeping, these actors make you laugh. Although Tomothy Dalton gives an okay performance, the rest of the cast stinks. This is wooden acting at its best. If these actors actually got paid for thier performances, someone should take their money back. To abuse the Shakespearean language as they did should be a crime! This is the kind of productions that make kids hate Shakespeare. Do not buy this video if you have any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dalton talent lost in terrible production","review":"I love Timothy Dalton. His performance offers what few enjoyable moments there are to be found in this version of Antony and Cleopatra, but it unfortunately cannot salvage this atrocious production. Seeing it is enough to turn someone off Shakespeare. (Should that happen, I highly recommend viewing Al Pacino's delightful LOOKING FOR RICHARD -- it is the perfect antidote to restore passion for the Bard). But I digress. I want to issue a warning to all who might assume this DVD would be superior to its VHS counterpart. In this instance, tape was simply transferred unto disk with no remastering or enhancements, and there are no extra features. The visual and audio quality is appalling. I regret buying this DVD when I already owned the VHS (..like I said, I love Timothy Dalton...) The only advantage is being able to skip the boring parts to get to the monologues. But that isn't saying much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynn Redgrave and Timothy Dalton shine.","review":"I give this a B, well worth seeing.

I did not get this CD expecting much at all, and on first listen, Stellar Kart sounded like every other pop/punk act out there. After a few spins, however, I came to appreciate Stellar Kart for it's own unique sound--\\"all gas. no brake\\" is definitely one of the best (if not the best) debut albums of the year.From start to finish, this album is packed with infectious riffs and hooks, upbeat lyrics, and an overall earnestness that makes this CD just plain fun to listen to. While their sound isn't terrifically original, Stellar Kart takes the worn out genre of pop/punk and makes it sound fresh again. I also highly enjoy the acoustic songs, which texture the album perfectly.I would highly reccommend this album to everyone. The lyrics are open, honest, and unashemedly Christian.

Good cast, top director, great critical reviews, based on a good book, etc. Even three quarters of the way through I was hoping for a real masterful change of direction. Alas, upon completion I was hit with the reality that this is one bad film. Even the great scenery can't make up for a disjointed and purposeless screenplay. I think the screenwriters took their cues from television show Seinfeld. This is the story about nothing. There is absolutely no point to this film.It concludes where it began with the protagonist no wiser for the experience of being a cowboy, a broncobuster, a love interest, a Mexican prisoner, and a character of questionable decision-making ability --all in a time span of a few months. Sure maybe he proved to be an honest and just individual but so what?

BUT, it is better than so many other films and the acting is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Authentic","review":"Given how disappointingly liberal, preachy, trite and predictable so many of Hollywood's dramas are, this film presents both tremendous moral balance and a wonderful ease of presentation, all the while offering up one surprise after another. It's as if this film was shot nearly at the time it was to have happened; so clean, real, and spare is the spiritual atmosphere surrounding the characters. Whether the lead characters' authentic, highly believable progress through the story, a simply fantastic performance by young Lucas Black, or the spot-on cameo by a very able Bruce Dern, this film exposes Western sensibilities (even in the mid 20th century) to perfection - Billy Bob Thornton deserves credit for making a beautiful sleeper of a film far too realistic, too believable, and too traditional to ever win a second glance from the Hollywood crowd. See it, and if you're like me, own it for it's simply riveting social and historical placement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of tension but I just didn't care","review":"Directed by Billy Bob Thorton, this is the story of two young Texans, played by Matt Damon and Henry Thomas, who, in 1949, cross the Mexican border on horseback in search of adventure. However, even though the plot is one of action, the film moved at a snail's pace, with too much dialogue and too many slow lingering shots of the Mexican landscape. Matt Damon's clothes were much too clean and well pressed for him to look like a real cowboy and his romance with the rancher's daughter never seemed believable. With the exception of Lucas Black, who plays a young troublemaker, the acting wasn't good enough to evoke much sympathy for the characters as they got in more and more trouble, and I found myself looking at my watch a lot just waiting for the video to end. There was plenty of tension but I just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Screenwriter To Director, Everyone Asleep At The Wheel!","review":"300 Channels on cable and nothing to watch, so I figured i'd give this one another go.

I was reading other Amazon reviews and it's difficult to believe this movie could be that bad. I've just rented it. This one is that bad. Billy Bob said he was making a film in the old style of filmmaking. I love that style.. and folks.. this isn't it! This film is just slow, snail paced story telling. Matt Damon and Henry Thomas are good in this, but their acting can't save it. The romance between Damon and Cruz is flat and not convincing. The use of slow motion and black fade outs at the end of scenes is done poorly and is annoying throughout. This is a real disappointment. A real snoozer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"\\"All the Pretty Horses...\\" First of all, the parts of this movie that are in English are hard to understand most of the time, it seems like run-together whispers. But, of course, some of it is in subtitles, so you can understand that easier, but then you miss some parts they actually say (in English) so it doesn't make very much sense.Another reason why it doesn't make sense is because the movie skips around too much, I heard it was cut up alot to fit the theatre version. The acting, though, is exceptionally good, even though it is hard to hear. And the end, well, it just doesn't seem to fit very right because they had to cut some scenes out. But, if you really would like to buy this movie, I reccomend getting it used, ($$$) instead of brand new ($$$). There is a good scene in here, though, when Matt Damon trains the horses in Mexico.

My mom and I bought it thinking it was going to be full of horses, but it isn't! We are both avid horse lovers and it was a big disapointment. They spend more time with everyone giving each other \\"loving\\" looks. To sum it up there's too much time spent gazing at each other and not enough spent with horses! Why didn't they just call it \\"All the Pretty Women\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this one's just awful...","review":"Not much I can say here that hasn't been said by others. \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" (the book) was one of the best novels to be written in the past 20 years. \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" (the movie) has been edited to a point where it makes no sense.Also, John Grady and Alejandra are supposed to be 16 and 17 years old, respectively. In a coming-of-age story, that's kind of important. Matt Damon and Penelope Cruz are WAY too old for the roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon was so right","review":"Amazon predicted I would rate this movie two and a half stars. Well, no half star is available, so I can only rate it two. I wanted to watch this because I hadn't read the book and I knew the book had garnered important awards. I gave it all the breaks I could, but I wasn't prepared for the many ways the story developed, maybe because the transitions were so sudden. What started out as a cowboy story turned into a romance and then a prison story. Probably in the book, it was not so disjointed. I cut the actors all the slack I could, and wonder if much of the best part didn't end up on the cutting room floor. However, for it to have been any longer would have bored the tears out of the small group who watched it with me. Ebert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up. I can't imagine why. Next time I am going to listen to Amazon predicting my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing...","review":"I actually rented this DVD to watch with my wife who keeps complaining about all the action films i rent that she HATES to watch. It seemed like a simple pleasant romantic drama, and i was looking forward for her thanks and appreciation about what a lovely movie i brought. To my dissapointment she grouchingly went to sleep quite near the ending. I could understand why, the movie is not a romantic drama or anything close, its not even about horses. The film starts telling the story of a teenager cowboy leaving the 1950's Texas for Mexico with his buddy. From then on its just a bunch of events with no focus or meaning. I cant remember any part of the movie I liked, although there are some dark moments in the movie that are emotionally hard to watch. Not an entertaining one, let it go."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst.","review":"I love love stories...

It left me with unanswered questions, probably because they cut out scenes. Where they filmed this movie, the scenery was beautiful but thats pretty much it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning epic western","review":"Billy Bob Thornton continues his promise of filmmaking excellence after Sling Blade with this hauntingly beautiful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's celebrated novel. Finding himself without a home after his Hollywood-bound mother sells the family's Texas ranch, Matt Damon travels down to Mexico with best friend Henry Thomas to find work and a place to stay. The vistas are gorgeous and the poetry that is created by Thornton's excellent mix of musical score, photography and subtle editing make it one of the very best films this year. Damon's performance is unforgettable, while Penelope Cruz as the love interest is unfortunately not (which is okay because she makes up for it in Woman On Top)."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's Nothing Pretty About These Horses","review":"The original cut of this movie ran 240 minutes. But when it arrived in theaters on December 25, 2000 (your annual Christmas turkey), director Billy Bob Thornton cut it to a mere 117 minutes. That's the version currently being released on VHS and DVD. Sadly, it's about as stimulating as a day-old taco. The love story - Matt Damon falls madly in love with the alluring Penelope Cruz - fizzles. Damon acts like he's never kissed a girl before. Cruz looks bored by her pretty boy co star. The remaining sub plots involving family honor, betrayal, prejudice and cowboys also don't add up to much. Throughout the film, it's obvious certain scenes are missing, which they are. In turn, it's hard to get fired up about a film that arrives with two hours of deleted footage. Damon tries hard to inject life into this directionless mess, but fails. This is one of the worst films of 2000. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually intoxicating slow burn ...","review":"Masterfully crafted adaptation of the novel. A coming of age \\"road trip\\" on horseback. This period piece set on the Texas / Mexico border of post World War II takes the viewer on a visually intoxicating slow burn of adventure, passion and danger. Fueled by the struggle between duty, loyalty and matters of the heart. Beautiful cinematography underscores warmth and charm of old Mexico as cultural and class differences play out. Powered by an enchanting Marty Stuart soundtrack. Thank you Billy Bob! (Give us MORE on the DVD release, and you'll get five stars!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"They've found a cure for insomnia...","review":"I bought this movie with high expectations, knowing that Billy Bob Thorton is an excellent director and Matt Daemon is by no means a bad actor.

First off, it has exactly ONE \\"special feature\\" (production stills, at that!). Furthermore, not only does this disc lack the extended cut (missing 3 minutes, this is just the R-rated version), it is also, most pathetically of all, full-frame only. Come on! This is a 2002 release of a **1997** film, and somehow they couldn't manage a widescreen edition. Has the distributor already been repossessed or something? It's DVDs like this that make me doubt for the future of the medium. Get with the program, Artisan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Wants To Be Quentin Tarantino?","review":"This is another movie that seemed to suffer of the \\"Pulp Fiction\\" effect, as it pretty much relies on attitude, cool badass characters, stylish cinematography and edgy music to give mood. The story, however, isn\`t that great, turning into an average betrayal plot that doesn\`t bring nothing new or too memorable, and is a bit too slow. Some good moments still occur, though, and the acting is alright, with talents like Eric Stoltz, James Spader, Mary Tyler Moore and even a then unnoticed Cameron Diaz. So, \\"Keys To Tulsa\\" is a decent indie movie that\`s neither too surprising nor too disappointing, another one to watch at a rainy night."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing is James Spader. He is really EXCELLENT!Very choppy shallow story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy at all","review":"I bought this movie because I collect movies with Cameron Diaz and I can say it was disapointing.

They are not a contrived fantasy world that teaches your children little fairies will come and save them from their troubles when something goes wrong. Disney is good for sing-a-longs. Parents, if you want to teach your children *life lessons* about growing up, about facing their fears, and about not being ashamed of who they are, read the Grimm tales to them.

For older children on up."},{"rating":"1","title":"too graphic for little people","review":"I did not think this was an appropriate book for my 5 year old son. It talked in some detail about eating the liver and lung of Snow White. It ends with a description of the demise of the Queen, \\"But they had already put iron slippers over a fire of coals, and they brought them in with tongs and set them before her. Then she had to put on the red hot slippers and dance till she dropped down dead.\\" Need I say more? This is not for small children! The pictures are beautiful giving the book a few stars, but there are only pictures on every other spread.

I had no problem with the assembly; it went rather quickly. My problem, however, is that now after three years, the plastic liner cracked in two or three places in the seam of the box.

Now my only recourse is to try and mend the plastic liner or get a new one, if that is even possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The concept is good but the material is cheap.

The book of eleven is an irreplacable travel companion for anyone interested in seeing the humor present in the journey of life. Not bad if someone just wants to grin a bit, too. I grinned so much that I may have inadvertently grinned over my limit and therefore someone else now may not be able to grin at all. But that is just how funny this book is, I get greedy with grinning."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars plus one more","review":"Amy's gift for observation is truly amazing.

Not having read any prior work by this author I was very hopeful. However, this Seinfield-esque \\"brain lint\\" just did not translate in print as well as it might have had Jerry and Elaine done an episode based on it. Maybe this type of humor is already getting old - or maybe I am - I just found it neither clever nor all that funny. I kept reading waiting for the funny parts, but feeling instead as if I'd been duped into purchasing something that hadn't required much originality or effort from the author after all. But, perhaps I expected too much having seen all those five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! There is someone out there who thinks like I do","review":"This book is absolutely hilarious! I enjoy reading humor, but rarely find anything written funny enough to laugh out loud about. This book changed that.

I have to admit that I didn't finish this movie, so maybe it gets better but I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accept the difference","review":"It is an extremely sensitive and original tale.

Thought it would be funny but was just BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting a comedy, this is not.","review":"My purchase was based on the description of this being a comedy, and having Lisa Kudrow in it. While I am a huge fan of Lisa Kudrow, this movie was not a comedy and while the subject matter is worth portraying on film, please do not try and sell it as being funny.I too am a dog lover, and have two precious canines watching every movie I see with me. If I had been in the mood for a drama, I would have picked one. Maybe if I had studied the reviews here a bit more I would have passed on this one. Great cast with serious subject matter. I too believe in unconditional love, and acceptance, but please stick to the truth when describing a film that clearly belongs in another category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a REAL Comedy","review":"This movie was advertised on the box as a romance comedy. Instead it was a black unwatchable, unfunny comedy. Even the cover is a lie. It has a pretty girl in short shorts, which has nothing to do with the film. Don't get me wrong the cast was great, most have been on Law and Order at one time or another as a star or guest. It was professionally executed. I just found it really dull and it went nowhere. I didn't get it. I can't recomend it at all. It was hard work to watch and went off in 20 minutes on my DVD player. Some reviewers liked it, I don't get why."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Barks Up The RIGHT Tree!","review":"Talk about a hidden gem? This emotional roller-coaster flick switches from comedy to tragedy...on and off like a light switch. It is a testimony of the fragility of life using the life of a dog as an example. Wouldn't you want to be a pampered dog if someone would take care of you for the rest of your life? But what if you were human...and no one understood how a human could be pushed to the brink and become a dog? This is a one-of-a-kind classic that I enjoyed from start to finish. Kudos to Lisa Kudrow, Heather Morgan, Lee Tergesen, Vincent D'Onofrio and Hank Azaria. This is a well-directed/edited profile of being on the brink of a nervous breakdown. I felt so sorry for her husband. He tried so hard to help her...and Kudrow's performance was superb. Give this one a chance. All 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Underestimate this one!","review":"I was so relieved to find this excellent movie. The actors are great, the script a little kooky but very sensitive, and this one hit me in the heart. To me, this movie is about Unconditional Love. The husband realizes that he would rather have a happy \\"crazy\\" wife than a wife on medication being used as a guinea pig and turned into a zombie. I was moved to tears because I have this kind of love and I am also obsessed with my dogs. I am buying this movie for my husband, my mother and my doctor. I am hoping they will understand and see what I see. GREAT MOVIE...STUPID COVER...EXcellent Acting...A movie that makes you think...and if you do think and see past the extraneous plot directions, you will understand about Unconditional love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"False Advertising\\"?","review":"The cover and the description say \\"sexy comedy\\". It is not. It is about a mentally-ill woman. There's nothing funny or sexy about it.

This places enormous pressure on people as young as 17 or 18 to get into gear before they even know who they are. With the average post-secondary graduating age around 22 ... that is less than a decade for women (more pressure than men) to begin having something to show for themselves. Life can be navigated but there are factors beyond one's control. No wonder the rat race is so compelling to teenagers.... you are behind before you even get started. Isn't life something to enjoy at least some of the time. Excellent analysis of why the world (at least in the West) has only gotten more unrealistic and disregarded the need for young people to just be happy some of the time that they are alive and well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight!","review":"I am 28 years old and I can speak from personal experience that everything in this book is absolutely true and incredibly enlightening. The authors have done an excellent job with their research, writing, and content. As I approach 30 just about everything in this book affected me in one way or another. I can see it in my friends, co-workers, and women I just meet. Excellent job! These women deserve our gratitude for bringing to light the new feminine mystique. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Midlife crisis is a misnomer","review":"I haven't read the book, but I saw the authors discussing it on CNN. I'm sorry, but these women have no clue what a real midlife crisis is. Yes, they have problems juggling a career and family and deciding how to prioritize. This, however, does not constitute a midlife crisis. When people approach 50, they realize that the choices they make (or don't make) will define them for the rest of their lives. This knowledge can create a huge identity crisis that goes way beyond \\"prioritizing.\\" At the same time, hormones are in flux and the entire constitution of a person is changing. A true midlife crisis encompasses attitudinal and physical changes that can only come about at a certain age. No matter how stressful your life is at 30, it ain't no midlife crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has Burgess Done?","review":"This book is written from the perspective of the stupidestwoman in the world.

Bottom line is that the videos do not prove anything. They only open your mind to see more clearly the deceptions made by the establishment. This was a low budget production.What we really need is a mega budget production, with good graphic presentations and the money required to pay top professionals for their honest opinions and conclusions irrelevant to what the academic establishments wants us to beleive as the truth.

We get to see that Naraku has something to fear from Kagome. There's also a storyline with a half-breed (demon father, human mother) named Jinenji - I thought his crush on Kagome was kind of cute.

I contacted the seller he said he would (in my case) send a return postage paid label and full refund. To date I have not received it.

I had this book for just some days and I really think it is out of date actually. The code examples are really not structured and there are methods written that do not even exist. Package imports and access modifiers do not seem to be of the authors knowledge. I know this book should learn people to think object oriented and so on; but to extend the Object class in every example is just confusing for new programmers.

It's a perfectly themed show that was run for some years. I was about the same age as the character Kevin when it was out and I love the whole throwing the apple across the cafeteria scene. I recently purchased the Dawson's Creek Season One DVD set just to catch the couple episodes I missed since at the time I was very busy with work, college and life. After watching the first season I bought the Series Finale disc I really got more into the story as a whole. Now I'm hungry for season two and three... (that I can watch on my schedule). So The Wonder Years would help bring out the Wonder on my years in the 80s. I really believe it could be even more appreciated now. Double benefit: It's a vintage 80's tv show classic about the 60's.

This summer, they finally put the first (rather short) season out, and I fear that they'll abandon the project the way they abandoned the show. Why shows like the Wonder Years and Northern Exposure aren't distributed is a COMPLETE mystery to me, though it's easy for me to chalk it up vaguely to corporate insensitivity and stupidity.

Trones is terrific","review":"The album is dated 1999 on the back, but I just found this album, and what a delight it is. John Trones has a beautiful voice, and he does a marvelous mix of standards and contemporary pop. My favorites were ''One Fine Day,'' ''My Romance'' and ''Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful'' (from Rodgers & Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''). Plus, John glows with Jim Brickman's ''Love of My Life.'' This is such a romantic album and it really reminds me of Tom Andersen's work. For instance, Tom's first CD, ''Far Away Places,'' also features a dreamy ballad from ''Cinderella,'' ''Ten Minutes Ago.'' They both know how to set a sexy mood that mesmerizes you with their music. The only misstep: Recording something as overdone as ''It Had to Be You'' (Harry Connick). Otherwise, I can't wait until I hear John's next CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Happy Fan","review":"Michael Buble has nothing on John Trones. This music soothes the soul and warms the heart.

Each of these reviewers, though, are apparently members of Barnes' silly little outfit, because each of them have praised other books published by Pathfinder, the publisher for the Socialist Workers Party.

On the first page or two, Honey Bunny receives money from a few sources, then proceeds to spend and spend and spend and spend until the very last page, in which she magically still has money left to save.

If you're curious, go ahead and check out the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Bunk","review":"After reading several books on occultism and the esoteric orders, I think it is mostly bunk. It seems that a desire to severe from the status quo, an overactive imagination, and an egotistical drive to be involved in magic pretty much sums up occultism. They seem to tenuously link together such things as the Egyptian mysteries, Hermeticism, alchemy, Greek mystery/philosophy schools, and various interpretations about the 17th Century Rosicrucian letters to get occultism and modern mystery schools. And to think it all started with the ancient, highly advanced culture of Atlantis, the lost continent, that was an allegory written of by Plato.Now, all of that said, if you are into esoteric orders and occultism, Dion Fortune was apparently one of the leading ladies of the occult in her time, and her work is still revered by those in such circles.

I started to realize the book was more about Don's experiences and the gut wrenching pain he experienced when he back to Earth, dealing with the permanency of being disabled, and his personal walk with God. Perhaps the best part of the book is how his personal story has touched so many lives in giving so many hope that there truly is a Heaven and that Jesus prepared us for it. This book is also one how Don can use his position of being disabled to bring hope to many that are about their situation and people that coming near to death. His story has brought a lot of compassion and insight into converting believers with problems and those that are faced with death head on.

I quit reading it after about page 70. I was hoping it would get better the longer I read but it only got worse.

I expected the majority of this book to be about this man's experience in heaven (hence, the title of the book) but it was two chapters of his experience in heaven and the rest of the book was his path to finding acceptance of what had happened. Supposedly he had a professional writer help him with this book but it definitely didn't show; he repeated things several times, jumped around in the timeline so it was hard to follow and over explained mundane details.On top of that, the man is an Evangelical preacher and boy does it show.

He gets in a serious car accident with a semi-truck. For 90 minutes, Don lay lifeless with his left hand hanging on only by the skin, and both his legs smashed to pieces. Basically, the whole book was about Don's recovery from the accident.The thing that I liked about this book was that it gave you a glimpse of what it would be like to be in heaven. One thing you might like is the constant descriptive details about his experience. It also tells about his life after the accident and all the things he had to do in his recovery.I did not like that the two chapters the author had on heaven had the least amount of details. Also, the book was very boring at times. The organization of what time in his life he was talking about was very difficult to follow.My overall opinion was that was not a book for my age group.

Oh, but heaven was beautiful. But that doesn't matter because I'm in pain. I'm depressed. Life sucks. I wish I'd never come back. Oh yea, I have a wife and a few kids that I barely mention. Heaven was beautiful. Life sucks. I'm in pain. I'm depressed. Oh yea, but heaven was great.\\" Very narcissistic point of view, very depressing and more about his accident, pain and injuries than about heaven.

Especially those that do not believe in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is a great, true story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaven","review":"I really didn't care for this book at all. I thought it was too self-absorbed...talked more about the author's injuries and recovery (which is fine, he went through a lot and came out the other side, so it is inspirational in that way) and not much time was spent on the 90 minutes he supposedly spent in heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no, no....","review":"Just a bunch of silly religious crap (can I say crap?). Are we really suppose to believe that heaven conveniently fits all of the Christian expectations and that only good \\"Christians\\" get in??? The part that I thought was amusing was when he described heaven's \\"gates.\\" Heaven's gates are as far as he could see in both directions and as high as he could see up. I thought, as I read, that his face was plastered against the dash and he could not move his head....so....he was most likely looking at the crushed dashboard....just a thought....Save your money or buy \\"Conversations with god\\" if you want some sort of minor religious experience..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This book is a genuine rip-off. It contains one rather small section to fulfill the title, and tells you almost nothing about heaven. The title is a great sale pitch in order to sell and get your money.

The pain and agony of this person's injuries drags on and on. Perhaps this was cathartic for the writer, but after several chapters of reading of his misery, I decided not to finish the book. I was looking for an uplifting story about the afterlife and a glimpse of heaven, which isn't really the focus of the book, despite the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 Minutes in Heaven","review":"I read in a few hours.

I was disappointed that so much of it was about his recovery and his miserable state after the accident, and so little about his actual experience in heaven. The title is sort of deceiving, as there are only a few pages about his experience in heaven. I finish all the books I start, but really struggled at the end of this one, as I couldn't wait to get on to something else. He was rather repetitive in his writing. Maybe my expectations were too high ... when something is on my list for awhile, I have very high expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"While many readers find this book to be repetitive, consider the healing process and how slow it can be. I was able to really feel Don's struggles and had a sense of how difficult things were for him. I felt sympathy for his pain and joy for the purpose God gave him for his life! We were given true insight into the process where God uses Don to answer some of those questions we have about death and dying.

I promise!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"I was so excited to listen to this book! To hear what it's like in Heaven - wow! But Mr. Piper talks of his moments in Heaven for just minutes on the first disk, then the other 4 1/2 disks (rest of the book) is all about his injuries in the accident and how he recovered. I was very disappointed. I expected more on Heaven, not so many details on his health condition each day. So if you want a story about a man that beat death with many prayers, this is it. But if you wanted a story, like me, that tells you every detail of Heaven and how wonderful it is, skip it.

The rest of the story is about his recovery and the trials he went through thereafter...its not a book which discusses throughout his \\"90 minutes in heaven.\\" I think this book would be inspirational to individuals who have gone through similar circumstances but to those of us who wanted to see a \\"glimpse of heaven\\", there wasnt much meat there.."},{"rating":"1","title":"bummed out!","review":"The beginning was very good, and then it just got plain old depressing and he repeats himself over, and over, and over!

He, mentioning his pride and stubbornness as \\"just my nature\\" at least four times in the book and many other unnecessary uninteresting details. Excessive appeal to emotion. I could feel moments when I was supposed to be \\"moved\\" but I wasn't. The description of heaven seemed to be written by a 12 year old.

It had about 3 pages of what heaven was like and that was it."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 Minutes in Heaven","review":"Don Piper had me hooked until the end when he started to disavow any other near death experiences. It was like he was making fun of other folks who had similar experiences. I have a particular mistrust of people who claim to be a Christian and judge other people, especially in a negative light. People perceive and relate their feelings, experiences and emotions to situations very differently than anyone else would when those experiences are similar. But to disavow and actually make fun of another's near death experience makes me wonder if his was an actuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Encouraging!!

It could have gotten same message across with less chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Whether it's the mind playing games on a person or reality, the facts remain that there is a life beyond death. I am not one to deny Mr. Piper's claim and I appreciate him finally coming out of the closet to reveal his experience. I think God's reason for keeping him on this earth was for just that reason, to tell the world of his experience. It now gives us a hope for our future beyond this planet. I am certain life after death will be wonderful. Why shouldn't it be. I think our current lives are in Hell right now (for some even more so) and there has to be better in store for us.I found Mr. Piper's book easy to read, kept my attention and also taught me, among other things, the after-effects a major accident can have on us to the degree I had no idea about. I can now see why he kept asking God, WHY? Why else would Jonah say what he said in 4:3 \\"O LORD, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring story","review":"Don Piper was a 38-year-old Baptist preacher with a wife and three children when he was in a terrible automobile accident. The police pronounced him dead and covered him with a tarp and Piper then spent 90 minutes at the gates of Heaven. His description of the experience is very interesting, although I wish he had written more than one chapter of the book about his memories of his time in Heaven. The majority of the book is devoted to his long and painful recovery, but he ends by giving examples of how he has been able to serve God in a special way as a result of his accident, while ministering to those who are suffering. The subject of near-death experiences has always been an interesting one to me and I choose to believe that Don Piper was actually at the gates of Paradise. As to why Piper returned to earth to go through an excruciating recovery, he and I will not know that until we go to Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it.","review":"I enjoyed this book when I finally got to read it...other family members kept swiping it...they obviously enjoyed it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inspirational book.","review":"I was very skeptical when I purchased this book. Mr. Piper does detail his accident & \\"trip to heaven\\", but the majority of the book is about all that happened to him afterwards. I am still skeptical about his experience, but believe that he wholeheartedly believes he was in heaven. I am skeptical because I do not believe it is possible for us to \\"visit\\" heaven & come back.Nevertheless, it is a very inspirational story & worth reading. Not only is it a great story of survival & hope, but it also inspires to be bolder about sharing your faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I wanted to give this book a real chance to speak it's message to me, but I just couldn't get past the fact that the author claims to have been dead, not to have had a near-death experience, but to have actually be dead, deceased, past away. Scriptually, there are only 2 people who have come back to life from the dead: Lazarus and Christ. Is the author claiming to be the third? His description of Heaven is so ridiculous and shallow that it can only speak to the fact that he was in a deep unconscious state and in that state saw what he had been taught as a child (as we all are) that Heaven has pearly gates, etc. I was actually embarrassed to be reading about all his dead acquaintances running to see him at the pearly gates.

That's about the amount of time I spent reading anything interesting in this looser of a paperback. The author provides a lackluster, even boring picture of heaven in the opening pages. He provides none of the imagery typical of even the most basic NDE account. The remainder of the book is then focused on his recuperation from the accident and all the typical Christian miracle/God's Will pandering you would expect from a fundy. I think the whole episode was a delusion.Press the Back Button and get out of this book web page as fast as possible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be a Berean","review":"It is said that discerment is greatly lacking in the body of Christ, I beg you to look up Hebrews 9:27 and 2 Corinthians 5:8 then carefully consider if Mr. Piper's experience confirmed these truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the TRUTH (the Bible) to know the TRUTH","review":"I have to agree with the previous writer who gives scripture to refer to and I would like to add \\"Ecclesiastes 9:4-6\\". \\"...The dead no nothing...\\".Jesus said: No one can go to the father except through me...\\" and in Revelations it tells us, at the Lord's coming, the dead will rise first and ascend into heaven, but not until the second coming of Christ.

In fact, I credit this book with making me an athiest. The author has done a fine job in that his vivid, flowing descriptions of near death experiences (or NDEs) are quite similar to all other NDE descriptions. The author's pacing, style, and tone are superb. There is nothing wrong aesthetically with this book . . . it's just that it will likely make you see how silly some of your beliefs are after you read it. I would recommend this book without reservation because the world needs more athiests."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Read it in 2 days","review":"The day I received the book I began reading it and couldn't put it down. Every free moment, I would read it and had to force myself to put it down. It was so great to read about what heaven will be like and being greeted by all the love ones that have passed before us. I cried at the pain and angusish that Don had to endure. The limited pictures were helpful in identifing with his situation. I do wish he would have included a picture of his wonderful wife who went through this journey by his side. Thank you Don for sharing such a personal and difficult experience. Your honesty was humbling."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 Minutes of Whining...","review":"Wow! This book was really not what I expected at all. There was only one small portion of the book that covers his visit to heaven, and the rest of it is spent telling of all his troubles and pain during recovery.Secondly, I was surprised that a Baptist Minister would have such a negative attitude after such an amazing experience, and also that he would keep such a story to himself for so long, then only reveal it when it's validity was challenged.The story could have been really interesting, but there was just something about the tone that really rubbed me the wrong way. I found it to be preachy, and self serving, and not uplifting at all. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Book","review":"This was totall missing several chapters from the orginal 90 minutes in Heaven that I orginally had. All the chapters of him in the hospital and his recovery and being angry with God, etc are missing from this reprinted book. WHY??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"This true story of Don Piper being medically dead for ninety minutes and then living again is one that probably interests both those who claim to be religious as well as those who profess to be nonreligious. The description of his heavenly visit covers only a small portion of the book; the bulk of the book deals with what follows the car crash and his 90 minute sojourn in heaven. The book is a well written narrative about Don's medical and physical trials and triumphs after the accident. The book's greatest message is one of survival and recovery through faith, hope and gritty determination. The writing of Cec Murphey and Don Piper make this a strong, interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Hopes, Big Disappointment","review":"As many others have noted here, I had high hopes that his book would give more spiritual insight into heaven and faith. However, I was left wanting. The content of the chapters were loosely strung together and the repetition of phrases and lack of cohesion was frustrating. I've yet to finish the final chapters, and I'm not even certain I'll waste my time. The most positive thing I can say about the writing--it had the potential to be a really good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet expectations","review":"I heard this book was very inspirational.

Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, enlightening story","review":"Don Piper's experience in the other side was rather short compared to several other known accounts, but it was beautiful. I think the value of this book is mainly in sharing Piper's long and excruciating ordeals after the car accident, his incredible survival and life lessons. Some parts of the book may be a little tedious when describing the details of his long recovery and challenges, but it will be worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, quick read","review":"My 15 year old brother read this book during plane ride to a mission trip.

The remaining 90 percent is about his recovery, how nice his friends and family were during his recovery, the hospital staff and so on and so on. I was not particularly inspired, motivated or moved by the way this story is presented. But, I could have been if it were written differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 Minutes in Heaven","review":"I thought that the book 90 Minutes in Heaven was extremely depressing. Although Dan writes of his pain, it did not seem to me that Dan's emotions were shown through his writing. It seemed as though he illustrated the events of his journey as any normal person would, which made it lack character and excitement for me. The way he spoke of himself going to heaven does not seems special or out of the ordinary in the slight bit. His story just seemed to get even more boring the more I read, especially, after his death and rebirth. All in all, I do believe that Dan's message came across very well, but I did not like his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on 90 Minutes in Heaven","review":"90 Minutes in Heaven is a very inspirational book that I found difficult to put down after I started reading it.

I would suggest that there was a little too much time given to his pain and suffering afterwards for me, but each to his own. I thought that would be nice had it been reduced a good bit and I just thought that went on for a little too much in the book, but it's most interesting reading and gives an insight not often found.

I'd recommend it for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be better","review":"I just finished reading The Glass Castle, a much different memoir, and this one is poorly written in comparison. Most of the problems are in editing. Sections of the story are repeated and there are some inconsistencies in timelines etc. It is an interesting story, and surely bittersweet for some who have lost a family member in a car accident.

So many of them have negative and judgemental undertones. I didn't feel like there was any of that in this one and it made the book pleasant to read. I appreciate that he just tells his story and let's you decide for yourself. I do agree with some of the people who rated this lower that there wasn't as much about heaven as I expected but I'm not really sure that was supposed to be the point anyway.

I certainly would not want to go through what he did, but a pastor with an \\"all about me\\" attitude left me with a bad taste in my mouth. His kids were \\"shipped off\\" to other homes for 6 months so that his wife could babysit him in the hospital until 10:30 every night. Really? Good Grief! If he cherishes his family it sure didn't come through in his writing. It seems that he thought higher of the people that prayed for him than his own family! He complained for most of the book and when he wasn't complaining he was glorifying himself with his good works (oh, and there was the minute or two of reading on his version of heaven). The only reason I finished the book was because I kept hoping that this guy would finally be humbled... didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's A Great Sell","review":"The book sells because it's a story we all desparately want to hear, to affirm our beliefs pertaining to immortality. To a degree, I enjoyed this borrowed book but couldn't help thinking about my own journey to \\"Heaven\\" which wasn't quite as dramatic and which would probably be scoffed at as a dream or side-effect from trauma, as neural waste, a process that ocurrs in the brain just before we lose all function or just as we regain it. We need to be careful of what others say, or, consider their reasons for publicizing and profiting from such a story. There are too many stories which too many people swallow wholesale as Absolute Truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I read it...","review":"This book isn't about heaven or a near death experience nor is it well written.

Maybe I'm just a horrible sceptic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed after reading this book that I felt compelled to write my very first review. The title is incredibly deceptive. Instead of 90 minutes in Heaven, it should be called \\"My Recovery\\". Other than a handful of pages (approx. 20), most of the book deals with Don Piper's accident and recovery. And the few pages dealing with his experience in Heaven leaves you hanging. It's as though you've been promised a Lexus and when you show up he gives you a Pinto. With all due respect to Mr. Piper's horrible accident, I feel that I have been duped and completely ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong title","review":"After losing a loved one, a friend of mine gave me this book. Because of the title, I expected the larger part part of the book to be about the 90 minutes the author spent in heaven. I was disappointed. Only a few pages are about that and there are no details. For example, we don't know what the author talked about with the family and friends who welcomed him in heaven. Then the rest of the book (the largest part) is about the author's road to recovery. I think the title is deceptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 minutes in heaven","review":"This was an awesome true story by a man that truly does love God and is willing to serve him no matter what. My son was in a severe auto accident in 2004 and this book gave me peace that someday, good will come out of his accident. God does truly have a big plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much about heaven...","review":"When I bought this book, I was expecting to hear rich details about what the author experienced while in heaven...After all, 90 minutes is a long time to be in heaven and you would think that's what the book would be about, but it's not...It's an inspiring book, with an inappropriate title.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing story but terribly written","review":"By the third chapter of the book I was rereading the author blurb at the back, incredulous that Cecil Murphey has apparently written 91 books. This book obviously made the best seller list purely on curiosity and shock-value, not on any literary value. It's an amazing story but the needlessly repetitive style is completely frustrating and structurally incompetent. It honestly amazes me that it got published as is. I couldn't finish it. The disappointingly short chapter on Don's actual experience in heaven proves how misleading the title is too, as other reviewers have mentioned.If you're not bothered by style and are happy to plough your way through amateurish writing then by all means enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I also agree with what some of the others are saying...this was not at all what I had expected. I have read MANY books like this and I always finish them within a day because I'm so interested but I have to be honest...I got a little bored with this one (sorry!). If you're looking for books on near death experiences (NDE), I would not recommend this at all; there are much better options out there. However, if you are looking for a story on what happens AFTER the NDE, then this might be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I also think the title of this book is misleading. This book was given to me as a gift after my parents were in a car accident (Easter Sunday 2006) that killed my father, and left my mother seriously injured. I couldn't bring myself to read it until now. What a let-down. I expected to read about a heavenly experience, and instead read about the trials and tribulations of a pain-staking recovery. Most offensive is the reference to Hell and how many of us seem to be headed in that direction. Hmmmmm - interesting. No offense to Don or his fellow Baptist ministers, but the only judgement I am worried about is that of God. If you want spiritual uplifting, try reading The Shack. Although fiction, it made me feel closer to God, and gave me this intense desire to nurture my relationship with Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"good bookgood storytoo many words required for this reviewtoo many too many too many too too many"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Whether you believe or not, this book is very hard to put down. Very riveting. Piper is an exceptional storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!!!!","review":"This book started out beautifully with a vivid discription of heaven, then it turns into a depressive and boring description of his recovery.

If you are interested in reading this book, do not spend your money, borrow it from someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misnamed - Should Be: \\"My Long Road to Recovery\\"","review":"I was very disappointed. The short section about Heaven just repeated about bright lights and people greeting you - that was it. Over in a flash. Then you had the rest of the book to hear about a slow, painful recovery from terrible injuries. Not particularly engaging - you read dreadful things about horrific injuries, but it never \\"pulled me in\\" to his struggle. What does a long, droning story about rehab have to do with Heaven? Nothing, after the aforementioned short \\"report\\" that appeared early in the book. And even that held no appeal for me. I suggest people read Ruth Montgomry's \\"A World Beyond\\" to get one person's fascinating \\"reveal\\" of the other side. This book just isn't worth reading. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is Deceptive","review":"Although this is a story of miracles and divine intervention, it is not primarily about the author's time spent in heaven. There is a very short description of that, and the rest of the book is about his accident and recovery. I didn't buy the book to read about his earthly experiences. I wanted to read more about heaven. If this is the story he wanted to tell, he should have chosen a more accurate title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I thought this book would be about Heaven, but it's really about recovery after an auto accident. Author shows no emotion. Very boring book with much repetition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring book","review":"This book is well worth reading. It mostly describes a mans horrific auto accident & the suffering he went through for recovery. In the beginning he describes dying & spending 90 minutes in Heaven where it was difficult to describe in words the beauty & music & goings on there. I enjoyed reading this book & it inspired me to see how much strength & faith this man has."},{"rating":"2","title":"You prayed, and Don Piper is here....","review":"This book is the printed version of Don Piper's 90 minute experience of heaven, and his miraculous recovery from a horrific car-truck collision. The book has a lot of material about the people who prayed for him along the way, like the late David Onerecker, who was praying when Piper came back to life, and David Gentiles, who led many prayers for Piper's recovery. If you have a difficulty with people being led to pray in a particular way, this book will challenge you.Piper's story about how his sufferings became helpful to others is inspiring.The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is because Piper doesn't compare the more popular near-death-experience literature with his own experience. He also could say a little more about the place the Ilizarov frame/fixator has in medical practice today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected or wanted","review":"I was expecting something like Betty J. Eddie's book about the experience of being in heaven. INstead I got a story of his miraculous recovery. I am glad he had a great recovery but it was not inspirational to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda for the Baptists overshadow message","review":"I was excited to see a coworker had this book and was willing to lend it to me. She warned me that it was not about the title, but I decided to read it anyway. She was right.This book spends very little time in heaven, focusing more on Piper's recovery and selfish behavior. He basically states that if you don't believe the way he believes, you will go to hell. I would not waste my time or money on this farce as it is clear he is just trying to sucker the 'true believers' into flying right and being good little Baptists."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 minutes in heaven","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my mum and I also bought one for my husband.

I felt that Mr. Piper dealt more with his recovery than with the time he spent in Heaven. Now if someone is looking for a book that deals with the strength and courage of someone who is overcoming a terrible accident, well then this is the book for him/her. But if someone is looking for a book that deals more with near-death experiences and the detail of those experiences, this book will prove to be very disappointing. This book left me hanging, whereas it did not give me enough proof of whether or not Mr. Piper truly did have a near death experience. In my opinion he never truly did die, but rather the paramedics made a serious mistake in determining if he was alive or not. I have read other books on near death experiences and this one I must say was one of the worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for....","review":"Was not up to my expectations.

The book consists on Pipen story of the accident and his recovery. Chapter 2 has the main purpose of the book.

My mom is really ill and I was looking for inspiration. I bought this book 3 weeks ago while waiting on line in tears for her medicine. What a joke. Conveniently placed to take advantage of those in desperate need of comfort.

I bought this book to hear about heaven, and it's about his recovery and his accident... He just keeps on talking about how its too amazing and then if you really want to hear about it, you have to ask him in person. For someone who claims to care about helping others, I found this terribly cruel. His title is misleading. It should read - My Experience after Going to Heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very contrived","review":"I really did want to enjoy this book and I was hoping that Piper would offer some fresh details about his experience in \\"heaven\\" but to be honest, his \\"heaven\\" is just one silly cliche after another. Streets paved with gold, angel wings flapping, the pearly gate, heaven's inhabitants walking the street screaming, Hallelujah! Praise to God!!! GIMME A BREAK...if I have to spend eternity with my arms in the air crying out AMEN! PRAISE BE! GLORY TO THE LORD! I would rather go the other way.....I would have been so much more convinced of this story if, let's say, it had been written by a lay person or someone who didn't have much of a belief in God BEFORE the accident...but a minister who becomes a regular on Pat Robertson's show? That just sends the whole credibility factor down to nill. This book just seemed to me like a Texas holy roller trying to make some dough with his preachy, fairy-tale, phony-as-can-be account of a near death experience that may or may not have really happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"Truly a disappointment. I should have known better than to purchase this book. How can an entire book be written about a 90 minute experience? However, I did not expect a blow by blow of medical treatments and his healing process."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 minutes in heaven","review":"a great read would recommend to uplift you with your every day stresses and to know there is something after you leave your body"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story, but no proof it is real","review":"Don Piper is a pastor with a bias towards the supernatural. He experienced a horrific car accident which caused him to be declared clinically dead. What he perceived to be real during his state of unconsciousness can not be proven true or not true. The burden of proof is on those who make a positive claim. If Don Piper claims his experience is real, he has the burden of proof to provide physical and/or presentable evidence, if he expects others to believe him. Unfortunately, he doesn't have any proof but his own testimony and the hearsay of others. Since he, himself believes it to be true, I will not call him a liar. However, believing something to be true doesn't make it true. Scientific studies prove that the human brain can and often does hallucinate when oxygen deprived, it is reasonable to suspect that that is indeed what has happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"I enjoyed 90 Minutes in Heaven","review":"I was given this book after the death of my 28 year old son.

Piper claims he was \\"prayed back to life\\". I'm sorry, but God is not subject to our requests. He does not change His mind based on our prayers. I cannot say whether Piper's account is true or false, but I can steadfastly say that God and His plan is much bigger than us and our perceptions of eternal anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"fraud","review":"I often wonder if people like Don Piper have any idea how God feels about lying and creating a fictional acccount of heaven just to make money. I purchased two of his books and both have been discarded. I can't believe any company would publish his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay, but Glad it was Free","review":"The Kindle formatting was challenging. Most sentences ended with a period immediately followed by the first letter of the next sentence. No space between.Other reviewers have talked about how little of the \\"heaven\\" experience is described. The author refers to a tape recording and various sermons given at churches across the country. I wonder if more information is given in these than in the book. I believe that this author may be like most people: able to speak, but writing is not a comfort zone. The interaction of speaking and watching those listening provides feedback which then allows the speaker the opportunity to expand.I do like the way this person seems to have found a way to connect to people who need to hear the experience to continue with life, both through the heaven visit and the method used to heal. What I did not like was his continuous \\"that's just the way I am and I'm not going to change\\" attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Nothing particularly new or absorbing. I don't recommend it for the reader who has read more extensively in this field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book after the sudden death of my father. The book only talks about heaven in one chapter (which is about 5 pages in length). The rest of the book is a medical diary of the author's injuries, pain and recovery. It tells all about his treatment and therapy while in the hospital and at home. I wanted to hear more about heaven. It also made me feel worse about my father's death: For example, Don states that when he entered heaven, he had no regrets about leaving the past, and had no consciousness of the family he left behind.\\" In other words, my father (or any loved one who has died) is now disconnected to their past life? It bothers me to think that my dad is not looking over us, as I would like to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"This book is amazing. It is hard to believe that it is true, that someone has seen heaven and returned to life on earth. Although the Bible reveals people who have died and were raised from the dead, there has been no actual description of what heaven is really like from them. I guess the Good Lord thought that a brief description was needed in our world at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 Minutes In Heaven By Don Piper","review":"I found this book very helpful especially for people challenging their faith. The first couple of chapters were amazing how they described heaven. I read these chaoters very slowly and carefully to vizualize every detail Piper described. I really enjoyed reading this book and then going back and pondering what was discussed. I would recommend doing the same, to fully understand this book. The rest of the book describes his journey toward healing and all the challenges he faced. It's a very good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and uplifting","review":"I recommend this to anyone who has ever had a broken spirit or needs encouragement.

This was definetely worth $2.99!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up reading it","review":"I love to read, and this book was recommended to me. I began reading it; the story is fairly straightforward, but suddenly veered off into Crazyville when the author recounted, over the course of three pages, a giant bowel movement he had. I gave up on it then. I have better ways to spend my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed but appreciative","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this book will be a disappointment for anyone wanting more of a revelation of Heaven than what we got in Sunday School as children. Actually, from my viewpoint, Rev. Piper's description of Heaven is no more revealing than what was given to us as children. Aside from that point, I wonder why Rev. Piper made no comment regarding the generally held view that the human brain is permanently damaged if it goes more than a few minutes (5?) without oxygen. Perhaps that factor would be written off as another part of the miracle? While I do respect Rev. Piper's devotion to the ministry, his courage during long suffering and have an appreciation for the quality of writing by Mr. Cec Murphey, I cannot rate the book more than a 2 out of 5 because it so terribly fails to reveal to me anything as to what Heaven is like,beyond what my Sunday School teachers taught me, and from the title, I was expecting something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"This book is 18 chapters and only 2 of them talk about his experience in heaven.

The story of Don Piper is unforgettable and it will touch anyone who reads his experience.

Nothing we can experience on earth can ever compare to the experience he describes.Nothing the author related after his return measured up to the beginning of the book; yet each section of the book has a value of its own. Someone in another review accused Piper of whining. Having lived through the experience of caring for my paralyzed husband, I can tell you the man was not whining! The suffering this man endured must have been much more severe than his words described.Although the book did not have the momentum throughout that the first section did, the entire book has a message of great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much about Heaven here","review":"Don Piper has a powerful testimony regarding his recovery from a terrible accident but the book led me to believe his experience in Heaven would be the focus.

If you are seeking insight into and minutial detail of hospitalization followed by details of an arduous recovery after a horrific accident, buy this book. After the first chapter, there's not much \\"heavenly enlightment\\" to be found. The book is clearly written by clergy -- undoubtedly with the best intention. However, his depiction of his time in heaven is painted through the prism pulpit oratory, which certainly must appeal to evangelicals. Otherwise, how this made the Best Seller List is a real puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 Minutes in Heaven","review":"Whine, whine, whine! This book was very boring and spent 90% of the time whining about his accident and \\"poor me\\". OK.....I understand a serious acciednt and can sympathize with the person. BUT this was way overdone!

God truly supplies all our needs and is so very loving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow the story","review":"The sequence of events in this book are written in such a round-about way, it is often difficult for me to keep them straight. It starts out fairly straightforward - Don goes to a conference, then is involved in a horrible car crash. He dies and goes to heaven and experiences many beautiful and wonderful things. Then the sequence starts to get fuzzy. And maybe that's because it's how the author remembers his experience. His recovery is a mish-mosh of various experiences, feelings, thoughts, people, memories, all jumbled together. A few select scenes stand out, but there's no progressive thread taking you from A to B to C. The author tried to sort most of the story into themed chapters, but many experiences are described over and over, and it's hard to find the stated theme of the chapter in what you're actually reading. It's a great story, one everyone should hear, but the book needs a lot more structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appreciation of Life","review":"At first glance,the title looks to be a little misleading as only the first chapter covers the author's experience in Heaven. However, the subject permeates the whole book as the author refers back to the experience throughout the book.The beauty of the book is in his sharing the insights he gains into life and relationships as he lives in the world after his experience. The amount of pain and suffering that the author endured on more than one level was kept in perspective by his experience in heaven.His perspective gave me insight into heaven, but more importantly, how to live life now no matter what the circumstances.It is a book I would recommend to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Validation and Inspiration","review":"I read this book a number of years ago when it came out. Not only is it a fascinating read it validates what we know as Christians in a vivid and inspirational way. I now give it to freinds and family that have lost a loved one as it is very reassuring that they are in a wonderful place, it is only us, the ones left behind that are hurting our loved ones are dancing in the streets and singing God's praises. I recomend this read to ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is not a home run","review":"I was expecting a much more detailed description of heaven in the book. the author is a minister and 95% of the book is about other people's stories of how they were almost killed ."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 minutes in heaven","review":"this story was very touching.

But, the title of the book is \\"90 Minutes in Heaven\\" he talks about it throughout his book but he never tells about it.... He should have title the book \\"I had a horrific car accident\\" My objection is as a Christian, I would be telling everyone, and would have included it in my book.

This book is about his accident and recovery, not about his time in heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book title is misleading","review":"After the 90 second replay of Heaven, the rest of the book was just reading about his stay in the hospital and his slow recovery. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enlightening","review":"Pretend your a baptist and write one chapter on a literal interpretation of what you've been told about heaven and you have this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but light on the \\"heaven\\"' experience.","review":"Not a bad read but hardly as inspiring as many NDE type of books. Believable but too much time spent in \\"recovery\\" mode and how the author rehabilitated himself. It's like being disappointed at a carnival after spending your hard earned .50 to get into a show on \\"weird\\"\\" people. May be a decent expenditure if this is your first attempt into this type of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY HARD TO GIVE ONE STAR ABOUT HEAVEN...BUT...IT'S NOT ABOUT HEAVEN","review":"As I said in my header it is very hard to give a book about heaven one star. The title makes you assume that this book is about heaven and what happens when you die but Rev. Piper actually only wrote 5 - 6 pages about heaven and the rest was about me, me, me. He spoke about his recovery which I know was and is very hard BUT he indicated in his title this book was about heaven. I checked this out from my local digital library so I am very happy I didn't spend any money. If he had given this bok a different title telling the real reason for the book I think it would have been much better. Would I have read it then? Probably not but then I wouldn't be giving it a bad review either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really BAD, depressing","review":"I believe in GOD and Heaven, but this book was awful. As others stated he repeats himself and seems to hate his painful life here. You really get the impression he is mad he came back. He doesn't really say much of anything about heaven, he was only at the gate. By the end you yourself wish he had not come back. Very DEPRESSING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I pick up this book at the local library and was excited to read it. After chapter 5 though his journey to Heaven has stopped and the rest is about David Pipers recovery in the hospital and at home. I came into this book thinking it would not be the religious type but a lot of it is focused on religion, God, and Jesus. He is not pushing his readers to believe in religion but the quotes in every chapter from the Bible was a bit much for me. The stay in heaven was short and brief in the book. A lot of it seemed like what he thought Heaven would look like considering his religious beliefs. If you are going into this book to read about what Heaven is like it is very brief. The rest of the story is about his recovery and overcoming of depression. A good book for those who have lost ones or have been in accidents themselves but the religious context is too much in this book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 minutes in heaven: a true story of death and life","review":"I personally was disappointed in the way this book was written, reason being, It kept repeating itself chapter after chaper as if to fill in space. The same information from the chapter before would be repeated as to the details of what he had to go through. After a few chapters its: I get it, I get it already, now go on with the rest of the story. In my opinion, it is poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps to Keep Your Eyes on What's Eternal","review":"Touching account of one man's recovery from death, his brief visit to heaven and the affect it is having on his life as well as the lives he encounters."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading!","review":"Not being a big reading fan, I thought this was a very interesting and easy to read with short chapters. I enjoyed Don's insight to what heaven was like for him and how he was able to reach out to others after his accident. The only down side to the book was a few chapters that when on and on about his depression and self pity. God only knows that must have been a very difficult time for him but one chapter could have covered that feeling he had right after the accident. I have since lent the book to family members to read cause I really did enjoy reading it and think it provides a great sense of peace about death and heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 Minutes in Heaven","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about the afterlife. I felt that Don Piper didn't write enough about his encounter with death. However, I gave it four stars based on the fact that it taught me to get my mind of my problems and be more appreciative of the blessings God has bestowed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading for the messages","review":"I think this book is really disjointed. It doesn't flow very well, and the author jumps around quite a bit. Nevertheless, there are many messages to be gleaned from the book, not just his experiences in Heaven.The author gives multiple examples of why God sent him back to us. Primarily, it was to serve others. He was able to provide comfort, realistic expectations, and understanding to people who were experiencing very difficult, painful futures.I feel this is a good book, not only for believers, but for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"The description of this book is very misleading. As the others stated his description of heaven is very limited and the remainder of his book is whining about his condition. It goes into great details about his treatment and frustration. It was not at all what I expected. I would be more appropriate in a category of \\"self help\\" for those with a long term illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious not Spiritual.","review":"An apparently authentic NDE (near death experience) written from a religious point of view that misses the deeper spiritual implications. The author's sense of self is clearly tied up in his religion which distorts and misses much of what is important from a more authentically spiritual perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Rip Off","review":"Check the other reviews and you'll see..... I'm new to eBooks and Kindle and really miffed that Amazon should rip me off - over $9 for a few pages. This was no book, more of a Newspaper article. Great faith, great life testimony, and a really uplifting piece on the life hereafter for which, with faith, we may hope. But it's all over in almost Chapter One. $9 bucks for that !!!Amazon, if this is the way you intend to market eBooks, forget it - I'm off to Apple Ipad. (Yes, a refund would help)90 Minutes in Heaven: A True Story of Death & Life"},{"rating":"1","title":"He wasn't dead!!!","review":"Jesus you people are idiots. The man was not dead. Here we have EMTs in some godforsaken Texas county that doesn't even have a coroner feeling this poor man's wrist pulse and not detecting it and pronouncing him dead. Level of education and training, anyone? Any first-year medical student could tell you that the absence of a manually detectable pulse is very far from evidence of death. They should be fired and sued for neglecting his care based on such cursory examination. A living body in shock and maybe coma can display no manually detectible pulse. He was alive the whole time and dreaming. Let him tell us something about his experience that is verifiable but that we cannot otherwise know, then we could believe him. Very convenient that both he and his prayer-buddy are Baptist ministers. I wonder what a Hindu or Bhuddist or atheist would have reported in the same circumstances. Don't be so gullible."},{"rating":"1","title":"No LORD in his Heaven","review":"Let's see, if I remember correctly to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. It is appointed to man to die ONCE, and AFTER THAT...the judgement. But strangly, poor Don did NOT see the Lord in his version of Heaven. Nor did he experience the judgement.He talked mostly about his recovery and very little about this great place called Heaven. Well, lots of Baptists are throwing out large parts of the Bible that do not fit into their experiences or agree with their prejudices. Looks like ole Don Piper has thrown out much of the Bible that did not agree with his experiences. Unfortunately, it looks like many non-critically thinking pseudo-Xtians are doing the same thing. It is any wonder people laugh at Xtians in general and Baptists in particular.So sad for the people who believe this book is legit. Just more confusion in the christian world. So very sad for believers. Not recommended for any believers with a brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa","review":"Maybe Heaven is what you make of it, but he lost me as soon as he described the Pearly Gates and the streets paved with gold.Whoda thunk it? God is materialistic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"90 Minutes in Heaven","review":"Don Piper went through/ and is still going through such an ordeal as witnessed in this book. He has clearly helped many, many good souls.However, I think the book should have carried a different title. I anticipated reading about his 90 minutes in heaven. His description of what happened when he died, only last a very short time into the book. The rest is about his great pain and struggle and depression, which I commend him for sharing, but I do think the title was misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Story","review":"90 MINUTES IN HEAVEN: \\"A TRUE STORY OF DEATH AND LIFE\\" BY DON PIPER WITH CECIL MURPHEYis the amazing experience of the author during and after a car wreck in which he died. He was declared dead by medics and ignored for ninety minutes while they cared for the other victims who were injured. During this time he experienced the bliss of heaven. Don vividly describes his amazing experience and his return to a life filled with physical pain. As a minister, he was able to share his experience and commute his pain in order to help others, especially ones who have had to endure the same excruciating physical treatments for severe injuries. As told by writer Cecil Murphey, Don's experience and the lessons gained are fascinating to read and uplifting to witness. I couldn't put the book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is believable","review":"I not only have read Don Piper's book,90 minutes in Heaven,but I also attended a meeting where he talked about his experience and book,his personal story is better than the book,in his relating his story,he brings to life his experience in Heaven enough to where you believe him,I do believe in Heaven,and do believe that God can and does perform miracles like bringing Don back to life.I recommend his book,but I also recommend anyone that reads it needs to know the Word of God and know for sure from that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This guy went through an amazing experience -- both in Heaven and on earth.

It's hard to put down after starting the book as you want to know what comes next. I loved it & have recommended the book to many of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing.","review":"This book was recommended to me immediately after the death of my spouse of 40 years. The title implies that the reader will achieve a better understanding of what loved ones who have 'passed on' will encounter. I was sadly disappointed.In my opinion, the book was \\"preachy\\", repetitive and poorly written. The focus was minister Don Piper's painful recovery and a prideful accounting of how he suffered, and later set a spectacular example for others.Many people courageously suffer through disease, yet do not use it as a vehicle to be a sought-after-speaker and sell books and tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last chapter ruined it for me","review":"I am a Lutheran. I've suffered through my own critical illness and that of my mother and my son. I was so comforted by this book up until the last chapter. Rev. Piper claims that near-death experiences don't exist. He says they are the result of the dying human brain. One could argue that *his* experience could have been just that also. He goes on to claim that he's the only person who had this \\"unique\\" experience of dying and then returning to earthly life. I find it odd that a minister would forget about the first and only person who has done that so far. His name is Jesus. I'd have thought Rev. Piper might have heard of Him."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 minutes in heaven","review":"The title mislead. The book is really about his long recovery from a bad car accident. If you are not of his religious belief this book provides littlle comfort. As there are NDE s reported by people of all faiths his seemed to be baptist heaven. I would have been more apted to believe in a more inclusive experience. I am sorry I spent the money on this teleevangelist book. I have agreed with almost every negative review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it could have been","review":"Wouldn't you think that having an opportunity to view heaven would make you a better person? Seeing what is waiting for you should make you yearn for it, not grouse about not being there. Piper suffers from a huge dose of \\"meism.\\" He doesn't seem to grasp that heaven is not about him, not about a family reunion, but about Jesus. He says he is a pastor, but he doesn't do very much ministering to others. He is too busy ministering to himself. Nonetheless, it is my hope that this book will make others yearn for that fair city."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little glance into heaven","review":"I enjoyed this true story of Don's afterlife experience. I was a little disappointed that his visit didn't last long. I would have loved to heard more. The book is mostly about his experience after the visit and how God touches so many people thru it. This is a Christian book that reaches farther than just, a NDE. It touches your life. I agree with other reviews that this would be a great book for those suffering from the loss of a loved one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called 'Recovery from a Horrible Accident'","review":"This was a disappointing book. The vast majority of it deals with Don Piper's recovery and a very small portion about his 90 minutes in heaven. It took me significantly less than 90 minutes to read the portion on his actual recollection of heaven. I believe his experiences actually happened, but I was left completely unsatisfied. If you are looking for a good book on heaven read Randy Alcorn's Heaven. Randy may not have had a near-death experience, but everything in his voluminous book is bibically based and well researched. You'll feel more satisfaction at the end of the book, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"90 minutes in Heaven left me feeling frustrated. If compared with scripture one of them has to be wrong as the Bible clearly teaches that of all mankind only Christ has died, gone to heaven & returned in bodily form. All others will have to wait until judgement day. To say that it is necessary to help people believe that there is a heaven is contrary to the words of scripture, espcecially those of Jesus when speaking to Lazarus in hell. People would benefit more from reading John Bunyans Pilgrims Progress. He was honest enough to say he had a dream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an inspiration","review":"This book outlines a man's journey to heaven and back.

There are really good pump up tracks like \\"How They Getcha\\", \\"My Neck And My Back\\", and \\"Be A Good Robot.\\" There are also some mellower songs that are also great like \\"I Am Crushed\\", and \\"My Special Moment.\\"I think this album was awesome.

My grandson says a lot of \\"to infinity and beyond\\" and I love hearing him say it. There's enough action to keep a soon to be 3 year old involved for the entire movie. I had to order Toy Story 2 and can't wait for Toy Story 3 to be out next summer. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen along with the rest of the cast did an excellent job.

The vast majority of Disney, since Walt passed on, is utter garbage. Almost all of the old stuff (before the evil Michael Eisner took over) is excellent and family friendly.

Recently I had decided that The incredibles was the best, but now I'm not sure. Toy Story is great. I hope that toy story 3 wont be a descrase to the franchise. Without Pixar I'm not sure that animated disney movies will last much longer. I'm not much on extras, but I found myself watching every little bit that the DVD had to offer.

The best one was the tortilla make-shift toy that made viewers laugh spontaneously on its brilliant design. The frantic monkey did a great job in securing the notorious Sunnyside daycare.Getting from the landfill, through the smasher, and to the final furnace was also an ingenious addition to teaching recycling through the vehicle of speaking toys. Barbie's love affair was as practical as it gets in favoring well being of her fellow toys over personal infatuation.Every garbage truck brought the dreadful sense of changing the fate of the great memories of playing with toys.After a while, you start taking sides, wishing the mean and arrogant bear would get his deserving punishment for oppressing the new arrival to Sunnyside, astronaut toy pay for switching sides, and the cowboy be rewarded for his loyalty to his previous owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color quality of DVD","review":"I received the DVD and it seems to me that the color/ picture is very bright- almost like a white out through the whole movie.

The film consists of very mature jokes and scenes, very accessible for \\"grown-ups\\", while kids will enjoy this animation for its dynamic and its very understandable storyline.Toys argueing about being favourite toy is what this film is all about, for all kids know.

Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear and Cowboy Woody are two of the most lovable and fully developed animated characters ever created. The movie is hilarious throughout though there are also many poignant moments (like Buzz's \\"I Will Go Sailing No More\\" song). Many talented actors contributed their voices most notably Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Don Rickles and the movie includes three memorable songs - \\"You Got a Friend\\", \\"Sailing No More\\" and Strange Things. And like all good stories it has some important themes including the meaning and value of friendship. Nothing scary for the little ones except perhaps some brief scenes of mutated toys and Syd's threatened violence toward Woody.

Which small boy has never imagined that his toys are real and come alive? Technically this is the film that revolutionized animation. It also brought animation from the \\"cutie-cutie\\", good always beats evil of Disney, introducing a more up-to-date cynicism, slightly dark & gray material, such as the kid Sid and even our hero Woody - though the latter is the main subject matter in that he is attempting to redeem himself. The characters are rich, three dimensional(Most are - except for most humans which is quite ironic and charming) Future generations will love these characters and they will endure forever. Toy Story 2 unashamedly attempts to bring the girls into the action with the lively girl-cowboy character Jessie, and while it is also very successful it just never reaches the freshness found in the original TOY STORY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received my product!","review":"I have emailed the supplier and he said he would check on the shipping status- I have not heard back from him (over 10 days ago) and still do not have my product or credit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not recieve my purchase","review":"i am very disappointed i emailed the seller and i have yet to get a reply.

It's really the soundtrack of many lives, and doesn't even come close to communicating the breadth and versatility of this extraordinary singer and songwriter.

Granted, they are classics that have found an immortal home in the sess pool that is pop culture, but they are also really worn and tired.Instead of highlighting the hits yet again, how about focusing on some of Simon's lesser known songs. \\"We're So Close,\\" \\"Love You By Heart,\\" \\"It Happens Everday,\\" In Times When My Head,\\" are but a few of the precious gems buried deep within Simon's catologue.

Al Green and Prince. in that same vein, the only writers who should take fantasy license and weave it into a novel full of Spanish-sounding names are Gabriel Garc��a M��rquez and Isabel Allende.I just couldn't go through with this novel. The heavy doses of fantasy and mystical imagery were so muddled, so over the top, that the story just did not gel. This was nothing but a huge pastiche of fantasy and magic, juxtaposed with the mundane Goth teenagers and the middle age crisis and pettiness of Elegia, Whit, and everyone else who was not touched by a sixth-sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"The beginning of this book drew me in, with its beautiful prose and the powerful imagery of eight women, gathering their brand new baby in a newly annointed \\"lucky\\" dress. The middle kept me engrossed, and while it was a bit muddled, it was still enough to keep me enjoying the book immensely. The end, I admit, was more of a challenge-I had lost a bit of rapport with the characters, partially because of Zan, an antagonist to even the reader I suppose. However, the end fit just right, and it was really a very good book. I plan on re-reading it, to maybe pick up a few things I missed the first time.

His crazed Tokyo mystery are the cliches of an orientalized Japan. Someone else was very right: it's a lot like the hyperfetishized worlds of James Bond, but precisely because neither is real.I really understand that many readers aren't going to care if this is the authentic Tokyo or that Adamson's flat characters and lifeless dead rockstar cult trash is based on beautiful and much better 3-dimensional characters. If all you are looking for is a standardly western contrived mystery with a different setting from what you normally read, I have no doubt you will find an interesting book.However, if you're an ex-pat or have any knowledge of Japan I think you'll be dissapointed, as I really was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fitting Sequel","review":"Just as the James Bond film From Russia With Love improved on the already good Dr. No, so too does Hokkaido Popsicle succeed in comparison with its predecessor, Tokyo Suckerpunch. FUN - that's still the operative word when it comes to Isaac Adamson's Billy Chaka series. Although the mystery aspect is more than sufficent, I think Adamson's best moments as a writer involve the hilarious comedic set-ups that occur between the protagonist and the outlandish characters that populate his Japanese Chaka-verse. Overall, it's a fun book. (Though I do like it, I hesitate to give it a gushing five-star review. I mean, it ain't Shakespeare folks.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first","review":"These aren't sequels, so you can pick either one up and read them. I can't believe how good Adamson is...I started writing again because I was so inspired by him, and promptly remembered that I['m bad]. This stuff is smart and modern, and I can't wait for the next one. Gamers: just imagine how much fun it would be if Adamson wrote the next Duke Nukem story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite in the series!","review":"This is my favorite book in the series. I love Japanese rock, and the fact that this is about a Japanese visual kei musician is awesome. It's very interesting how the plot twists and turns.

What a waste of time. The guy who produced this junk needs to seriously think about getting a new job. My 17 year old son has made movies better than this one. Nothing cleaver or original here. No surprises. Plot was horrible. The lines were so predictable. C'mon. Acting was REALLY Bad. Screenwriting obviously is a challenge for the producer, writer, etc. There was nothing that suggested it should have ever been released. I feel sorry for all the actors in this film and I would suggest that they leave this one off their resume's. Of course with Ron Jeremy in the film, what could one expect? What a joke..or maybe thats what it was supposed to be. I hated this film and thought that I could have better spent my time chopping up a turkey...a jive turkey. Perhaps then I might have been entertained. Don't waste your money people."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"this is one of those movies that is great to watch with a bunch of friends on a huge tv and just laugh!it has ron jeremy as the main murder which you will see in the middle of the movie and it has black metal as the back ground music all through the movie which is just great! it makes the atmosphere of the movie more intense it has a few jumpy parts but its basically a horror comedy. gets kind of raunchy in the middle but still worth the money if you want a horror comedy movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic flop","review":"Ron Jeremy did play a decent villian in this film, looks like he played a mix between Leatherface and the killer in the Prowler. The movie never takes itself seriously and I just didnt like it any part of it. I didnt really laugh at any jokes, but im sure some people would. I dont know who would enjoy this film but someone out there has too.Ron Jeremy is better in Terror Firmer. If you want to see him at his comic best watch Toxie Avenger 4: Citzen Toxie. Dont waste money on this cheap effort to be a Troma film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANDRE THE BUTCHER UNRATED DVD","review":"Ron Jeremy running around killing people, need I say more? Obviously, I knew this movie was going to be horrible, but I think it was one of those B rated movies where the plot was suppose to be funny. This movie is worth watching but only for some laughs.Overall, the fight scene between the two cheerleader teams and the childish vocabulary were the best parts in this movie, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Collaboration","review":"Legendary Blue Note pianist Horace Parlan teams up with Tenor Sax maestro Pee Wee Ellis on a wonderful, but difficult to get hold of, recording. At the North Sea Jazz Festival in 1999 Pee Wee and Horace showcased the albumn and, although judged a resounding success, since then distribution has been poor. The melodic piano of Horace is complimented by the deep toned, breathy sax of Pee Wee on standards such as \\"crazy\\" & \\"someone to watch over me\\" as well as a number of own compositions, topped and tailed by two wonderful versions, by Mr Ellis on his own, of Janis Joplin's \\"Mercedes Benz\\".

This was back in the early to mid 1990s. I remembered a lot of the skits and when I saw the box set of the entire series, I had to buy it; for nostalgia sake and for laughs. If you like Monty Python, then Kids in the Hall is right up your alley. KITH have so many strange, funny, awesome skits like Night of the Living Dead, 30 Helens, Citizen Kane, Head Crusher, Girl Drink Drunk, and Dave's monologue about the difficulties of being a serial killer. And I love Dave Foley. He was always my favorite. (And he makes a disturbingly pretty girl!) I'll admit, sometimes their sketches are little weird or unfunny from time to time, but that could just be my own sense of humor. But 90% of this show is gold!

It was probably just trading on that film's success. One suspects that it wasn't even released in Japan, as the title is English.The translation was so bad that it really distracted from the story. You were focused on the mismatch of the language instead of the story's progression. Also some of the supporting cast really overacted their parts to the point that they were comical.It was a good story and Kuno is always worth seeing, but it really needs work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notebook stand/cooler","review":"This is avery nice stand. Very sturdy and has several adjustable positions for various screen veiwing positions. I like the four USB ports in the back of the Chill Hub and the fans are not as loud as I might have thought. They seem to take away a lot of heat from my computer. I got used to them and didn't notice them at all after a short while. I had to drill a hole in the front of the stand in order to access my headphone and microphone jacks, but that was a very minor task. There is also a considerable amount of storage space under the computer for access wires and such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus Notebook Stand w/ chill hub","review":"This is a great product!

Los Fabulosos Cadillacs siempre fueron tremedos musicos, pero Fabulosos Calavera fue un episodio experimental donde los integrantes de la banda exhibieron su ilimitada capacidad como compositores para crear musica que a demas de ser variada y original, es de optima calidad. El disco recibio criticas variadas. A pesar de haber ganado un grammy y de ser alabado por una serie de revistas populares, muchos de los fans que crecieron con la banda quedaron decepcionados. Aun que Fabulosos Calavera no es una representacion musical con la prototipica asociacion que existe de los Cadillacs, el disco no deja de ser exelente.

Simple but effective design - easier to spread the box and make adjustments than a higher priced set (3200K) I bought on ebay. Only slight drawback - they're not as TIGHT as you might like - the wrinkly appearance in the photo is accurate. I'm going to iron the white rectangles on the front and give 'em a light bit of starch. Other than that, good to go. I'm buying two more - I need more light, but I don't think I need more INTENSITY, just more softboxes.

But it continues to stay afloat."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARQUES WYATT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!","review":"After reading the reviews on this CD, I went out and got it...actually, I did sample it in Borders, but passed it up for, what else--another lackluster chillout CD...if I had a dime for every one that I bought and didn't like, I would've had the money to buy this CD...at any rate, I'm digressing as usual. Wyatt's \\"For Those Who Like to Get Down\\" was the shiznit!! Perfect mixes, well selected songs and FUNKY!! Cuts 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10 and 13 are stand outs on this very impressive CD...but the groove is slightly thrown off by the infusion of a gospel song on cut 5 (Precious Lord). I see what Wyatt is going for, but with this song, it just doesn't work and becomes irritating after repeated listenings. Love the music, though. Nevertheless, that one track doesn't tarnish the concept and energy of the album, or disrupt the flow of it either. Marques Wyatt is a phenom and innovator in his own right in the oftentimes monotonous world of House music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Down With Marques.","review":"Marques's last disc, \\"Sound Design\\" was a very good mix CD that otherwise strayed off course a few times. But on \\"For Those Who Like To Get Down,\\" the mix is more consistent, the groove is tighter, and the beats are relentless. This CD clocks in slightly over 70 minutes, but it never wears out its welcome, and it gives us house jams that have soulful vocals and strong hooks. For those who like to get down to house music, you can't go wrong by following Wyatt's groove."},{"rating":"2","title":"House is a feelin'","review":"This is the real McCoy: Thumping bass, slick *ss mixes, a great groove for any party.

With hindsight it is easy to forget that those guys were pushing the envelope in every single subject and no one really knew how things would fall in place. The author experienced the ups and downs with the main players and gives us a insight report on what really happened. He manages to strike a good balance between technical details and the human as well as the \\"mundane\\" side of the X-15 program (e.g. when he is waiting for a ride on an Air Force plane to Edwards or when he describes details about the pilot's personalities). I think it gives an interesting perspective on one of the key milestones of aerospace engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warren Shibles: A Modern Narcissus","review":"The work of Warren Shibles should be avoided for a plethora of reasons. For starters, the topics covered are trivial and mundane which lack the breadth of a true philosophical work. The issues addressed are easily discovered through common sense and fundamental education. Secondly, the style is dry, the voice is weak, and the arrangment is lacking which makes the reading dull and at times utterly boring. Finally, Shibles has a tendency to overglorify himself at the expense of others.

When I contacted the company they said that I am lying and that it is not the reason for return. I was not even offered exchange. Second of all it is made in China, so u can imagine the quality and it is not mentioned anywhere. Plus if you decide to sent it back besides the pointthat you are paying for shipping both ways they still charging you 39.99 + 15% restocking fee.

It has catchy songs, lovable charecters, and finely portrayed setting. The plot was a little questionable, particularly at the end. Stuff happens that really just doesn't make sense, such as a car getting it's tires scraped off from subway rails and having the exposed wheels ride on the rails perfectly. Also the antagonist is a little too evil. Now you might say, \\"he's the antagonist, he's supposed to be evil!\\" but seriously, the way he over-reacts to the smallest of things is just downright corny. For example: grabbing his gun before greeting a pizza delivery person just because he didn't order it.Those are the negative aspects, but I'm sure any kid below the age of 13 isn't even going care about those. The rest of the movie leading up to the end is a great Disney classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters","review":"If I could, I would rate this film 3.5 stars. It was okay. Not as good as other Disney movies, but okay. However, the characters were great. I personally liked Tito and Francis best. Georgette was also great. Tito was a spunky, fearless chihuaha (I know that's spelled wrong) and Francis was an intelligent-talking dog with a taste for high-class items. Then Georgette was an egomaniacal (\\"Perfection is Me\\") pampered poodle whom is also hilarious.As for the other characters, they were good, too. The homeless guy, Fegin, was okay, just kind of pathetic. I didn't like the part when he wrote that ransom note and lied to Jenny about finding Oliver.

I expected an exciting story, great eighties music, and stunning animation. Instead I got cartoon music, overly cute acting, and a poor story. Disney had stapled this film as appealing to the teenage crowd. How? This is most defintely a kid movie. The music was not contempory to its time and the human characters lacked a lot to be desired.

Though dated (published in 1982), this is an affectionate look at the history of individually wrapped candy bars, told in short chapters telling the story both chronologically and regionally. There are lots of illustrations of candy bars, wrappers, displays and ads, with an eight-page center section of color advertisements.This fun book concludes with an informative list of more candy manufacturers; an interesting peek at the 1981 National Candy Buyers Bar Survey; the author's 20 favorites; and photo credits. The book really suffers from the lack of an index, but is so much fun I can't bring myself to reduce the star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Arrival","review":"SO I love the show. But, Lionsgate put no energy whatsoever into the DVD. I don't mind that the DVD's look cheap. I don't mind the packaging. But be aware that on Disk 2, the episode Flames is missing a large segment about 10 minutes worth. That whole one where Jr comes in with money to buy Flame and the group of them take off to go get him. I tried multiple DVD players to make sure it wasn't me. It wasn't. I am beyond disappointed after waiting years to get the DVD's in the first place. I requested a replacement from Amazon and the same is true again with the new copy.

I had the final season on VHS like a lot of people, and am glad the \\"powers that be\\" decided to release it on dvd. There are no extras, of course, but that's o.k.

However, this was the first time I have bought a new DVD directly from Amazon themself. Amazon states, they produce the DVD's they sale themself, on demand. Well let me tell you, it looked like the DVD that I got from Amazon was a copy of a copy. The viewing quality was like a poorly copied VHS tape, and not a new DVD. In addition, the art work on the cover and what came with the DVD looked like they printed it on a cheap printer and was lacking much of the information you would normally expect.While I certainly enjoyed Season 4 of Wildfire, and recommend it to everyone, I would not ever recommend buying a DVD directly from Amazon. Instead, buy this or any other DVD from one of Amazon's third party retailers. At least when you buy from the third party retailers listed on Amazon, you are getting an original DVD (whether new or used) and not some cheaply made copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"No subtitles or closed captioning?","review":"I love the show Wildfire!

I opened it up and the piece that holds the retracting prongs in place had snapped and now whenever I go to plug it in the prongs simply push into the unit and lose contact with other pieces in side. I might try using some super glue or I might just search for a better product.Do not buy this item if you want guaranteed quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple I-Pod Users Beware!!!!","review":"Apple I-Pod users beware. This product will NOT charge Apple products (I've tried both the Touch and the Classic). This is a huge ripoff. Yes--the unit works. The lights come on when you plug it into the wall, and I could charge my mobile phone with it. But nothing happens when you plug in an Apple product. Zilch! Given the number of people who use Apple MP3 players, the seller should warn everyone that it will not work on Apple products. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Dull & Confusing","review":"If only Eileen Goudge wrote the sequel to Garden Of Lies 2 or 3 years later, rather than 9! While I recalled the main characters & the basics of the first story-it was hard to keep up with the newer characters as well as this muddy plot. It is pretty hard keeping up with a storyline when you've read the first book 9 years ago. Too bad she isn't like Nora Roberts, who writes a main story, then one or two followups-sometimes within the same year! At least her stories are much easier to keep up with. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorns of Truth: The Sequel to Garden of Lies","review":"Two of the best books I've ever read! I just love Eileen Goudge's style of writing, she is one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorns of Truch","review":"After reading Garden of Lies I wanted to know what happened with all the characters. Upon searching for more titles from this author I found the sequel and immediately ordered it. Two very good books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorns of Truth: The Sequel to Garden of Lies","review":"I was glad to have more information about the characters created. The first book left you hanging- this book explains everything and tidies it all up with a great bow tie ending. A must read for anyone who has read this first book, Garden of Lies. I would recommend both books. It is a tragedy and love stories all in one...families in turmoil...secrets..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorns of Truth","review":"The author brought all the characters together with an ending that was acceptable. I think she had very powerful characters to begin with in the first novel and they lost none of that by the ending. Very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts on Thorns of Truth","review":"I was happy to find that Eileen Goudge had written a sequel to Garden of Lies. I was interested to see how the lives of the characters played out. I was not disappointed. It was great to catch up with all the characters. I was happy to find that Rose had moved on and had been happily married for a number of years. She had gotten over Brian. It was exciting to see all the lies come undone and the truth to come out. I enjoyed the book and thought it was an easy, uncomplicated read. I read several of the reviews that were posted before I purchased the book. I disagree that the book is a classic but I did like the story line and the characters. To me both books, The Garden of LIes and the Thorns of Truth were good but not exceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after the prequel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Garden of Lies but found this sequel boring. Several reviewers below expressed my feelings very well... too much rehash and reminiscing about past history... overly redundant... I kept reading (more like skimming), hoping for some progression in the story, only to find this continued throughout the book. Just when something was about to happen, the character went into memory mode. Sylvie faded into the background and her daughters are now just older whiners. Drew, Iris and Mandy were central characters but there wasn't enough background about their lives to give the reader a reason to care about them. When I'm enjoying a book, I don't want it to end; sorry to say this was not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARD TO FIGURE OUT","review":"I read this book from start to finish. Some parts are hard to figure out because of the switching of the babies, and I didn't care for the ending. I thought that this book was dragged out in parts. Wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional rendition of a legend of Ragtime","review":"Mark Reichle was somehow able to capture the magic of Scott Joplin as I have never heard before. Each selection comes to life as the expressions of Joplin's work are carefully re-told. The recording quality is excellent, and the sound is extremely crisp. If you are not a fan of Ragtime, this will convert you. If you are, then don't miss out on what Ragtime is really all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"Although I agree with the other reviewers that the performances respect Scott Joplin's intent, they unfortunately lack a great deal in phrasing, rhythm and sense of harmonic progression. Right-hand passagework often takes just a little more time to execute than the left-hand accompaniment permits, creating awkward-sounding moments, particularly at cadences. The accompaniment, while accurate and full-sounding, lacks harmonic direction to help shape phrases. The result is too often reminiscent of a strait-jacketed calliope with an erratic small gear a bit out of sync. I was also disappointed at the total absence of liner notes, hoping to learn more about Joplin and his marvelous output. I purchased this recording on the strength of the previous eight reviews -- now I'm wondering whether they were written by friends and family of Mark Reichle, or perhaps even by him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than typical rag","review":"I don't know if it's the performer, but this is really some of the most bland and plan piano I've heard in a long time. It might be precise, but technical skill without any sense of emotion is not worth hearing more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting non-martial arts movie by Tsui Hark","review":"I rented this movie expecting a martial arts show, instead, I got a fairy tale/legend. Tsui Hark, as usual, does a great job at making the movie beautiful and unique. But the english tranlation leaves the movie to be very confusing. I did not understand most of what was going on!! To make things worse, the way the subtitles are inserted, you can't read most of it at all.There is no martial arts in this movie, other than that, it was an interesting show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Tsui Hark's best","review":"This movie had potential. Great acting and good cinematography. But it is seriously weakened by the poorly executed special effects. Tsui Hark is a special effects master. So it is quite disappointing to see him make such a sloppy movie. Maggie Cheung shines as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps not the worst movie ever made...","review":"But without doubt the worst movie I've ever spent money on. The traidtional Chinese story of love and redemption is simply used as a background for third-rate wired-assisted jumps, silly props and make-ups, and juvenile come-ons and titillations. UGH!Is this what people really like to watch?I wish there's a 'No Star' rating - that's what this thing deserves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed with this CD and threw it in the trash.","review":"I have never before felt strongly enough to review ANYTHING online but I was very disappointed with this CD and threw it in the trash. I expected the soundtrack with the songs I loved as a kid from the motion picture and think I got the underlying musical score. Perhaps I did not pay close enough attention but I feel this album was deceptively labelled and marketed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new all-time favorite","review":"Now moving into a streak of African music, this album is now one of my favorite CDs. So often I hear great music and wonder what culture it is from or who the artist is...well this is one of those CDs...the Aha!, that's what I've been looking for. I feel at ease and happy when I listen to Baaba's music. I plan to buy more of his CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music","review":"I used a song from Baaba Maal for my presentation on Senegal.

I love the fact that I gained an additional 8 zones with this purchase, so that I could seperate some of the zones in my new house. I now have independant zones for each window and exterior door on my house, with room to spare! I'll be hooking up the overhead garage door as an auxiliary zone so that I can tell from my bedroom if my garage door is open or not. And with the relay zones available, I can hook up my garage door opener to operate as a contact closure. I will be able to add the routine to check the garage door for open or closed, and if it is open when I arm the alarm at night, it automatically closes! SWEET!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too deep and confusing","review":"I got this book for my step-mom for Christmas thinking she would get a lot out of it. She is a deeply spiritual woman and loves the original book, The Five People You Meet In Heaven.This book isn't extremely long, so I Figured she would have it completed in only a few days. I asked her what she thought of it and said she only got a few pages into it. She says the book is extremely dry and hard to get into.Once she was a little further into the book, she said the concepts described went way over her head and she didn't really understand how it related to the original book.I guess this is more of a textbook type reading and not a novel. Not for someone who wants a quick read while learning something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that some people should NEVER make a movie.","review":"I won't even bother to discuss the plot because it would be degrading to me as a human being. I'll make this quick. Some of the outrageous characteristics of this \\"movie\\" (located in Las Vegas) include the following: so-called \\"special effects\\" that were created by a computer and a blue screen, out of place stock footage provided by ABC News, a car which is driving in a straight line and goes by the Bourbon Street Casino FIVE times(!), a horribly cheesy set that we are supposed to believe is an actual casino, voice dubbing that is so out of sync that I might as well have been watching a kung fu movie...and on and on and on.The silver lining to this cloud is that I did laugh about five or six times while watching \\"Cult Of Fury\\". It almost could work as a comedy...but not quite. AVOID!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Irritating Movie","review":"This was a very irrating movie on many levels. The music and sound effects were irritaing, the car chases were irritating, the plot was.... well you get it. The movie is of a seemingly all powerful cult leader who comes to Las Vegas, planting bombs all over town at will, in an effort to get his girlfriend (who ran away) back. The helpful cop falls for the ex-girlfriend, as he tries to protect her. The movie has no supernatural elements, which might have helped it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting prayers when I needed them most","review":"As I read this book of prayers for the first time, I was so filled with emotion.

It was amazing that another mother had my same feelings, and it comforted me to pray the prayers she had written.This book was sent to me from Heaven, and it is something that I now give to every new mother I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"This paperback book is way over priced. The book is a 5\\"x7\\" paperback with limited content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seize the Day","review":"Life has a way of dealing us random cards at times ~ some are good cards, some are not so good cards. Paris is a movie which captures a dealt hand at a particular moment in time and what people do with their hands. The character with the most to loose, is in fact the most happiest and it is through his dispair that he sees how truly amazing life really is. All around him, are unhappy Parisian's and yet they don't know how lucky they are. As each of them moves through their moment, life has a way of working itself out. No-one is immune to happiness just as no-one is immune to pain. It is how we deal with these humanistic traits is how we measure our own success. Paris is a beautiful city and I can't think of a better location to shoot such a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"The film is disappointing to me for two reasons. One I was looking for a film that really concentrated on the physical allure of Paris and was disappointed in that it that did not give enough views or shots of the capital. The film hardly merited its title. I think it could have done a better job of integrating the \\" feel of Paris\\" into the life of the characters. This might not be important to some but I think it is a major flaw. Two the stories were rather disparate and boring. Good acting nonetheless by Juliette Binoche."},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so movie","review":"Te movie \\"Paris\\" has nice takes of the city. But the plot is boring and confussing at times.

I shared my copy with a friend who eventually moved away without returning it. I was merely looking for a replacement when I found this version on Amazon. This translation has some subtle differences from the version I read originally that I think make it a better read. There was also a list of similar books that I found interesting and intend to explore. I found the physical book itself a nice surprise-just the right size for travel with a unique dustcover and bookmark. Perhaps the best praise I can give this book is that I'm buying additional copies for friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very grateful to this book.","review":"After my second time reading this book (first time was in school) a lot more has happened in my life, and I can appreciate the universal path and story of this book.Easily one of the greatest books in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Sentence Review","review":"Honestly, I did not like this story.

My friend and I thought that the beginning of the book was confusing with the burgulars that let them stay in the house. If it had more of an understanding beginning we would have rated it with five stars. We think it was not explained well and that's why it took us some time to understand. We started to understand the book when it came to the middle (pg. 50-100) because it started to reveal the people and the Magic room at the end of the hallway. When we finally reached the end (pg. 100-150) we loved because it kept you reading because of the action and excitement. WE ALSO GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE ON ALMOST EVERY PAGE OR TWO THERE WAS A BAD WORD. Over all we loved the book because it caught your attention as soon as you were getting bored. I thought that Joan Lowery did do a great job with the story line and the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean's review of A Deadly Game of Magic","review":"This book is terrible! I told my teacher that we shouldn't have read it, because I don't read mystery books. I also don't like to be held in suspense. I wish there were pictures in this book.

I find myself having to check to make sure the pills actually went in the bins. Also, due to the space, the organizer is larger than others I have used, making it a little more bulky to pack for trips.Overall, a good value, and much better than similar orginizers I have been able to find locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to open","review":"I bought this for my mother.

Chomet's research seems complete, and the writing is rather easy to read. I found many interesting facts about Victoria's third daughter, some of which have been previously published (drug addiction) and others which are generally not known ( the flirtation with the librarian). The book is a must for anyone studying Victoria's family. In particular illegitacy in the royal family. Helena's only grandchild was illegitimate, and only one of her children married. Her family's life is a contrast to all of her siblings, with the exception of Princess Louise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly readable","review":"When I read Marlene Koenig's recommendation (\\"I recommend you read it\\") I bought the book and have enjoyed reading it. There is lots of new material and very little padding. This is not the usual volume stuffed with unnecessary detail. It is more of a story, based on fact, of a princess who was once described as dull and not very good looking but turns out to be handsome, talented, interesting and very popular with the Victorian public. There are also one or two unsolved mysteries. The price of this volume is not exorbitant either!

Because when I see 'dance' in a workout title to me it means non-challenging. However, just to add some fun on days when I need more motivation I like to start with a dancier workout and fun music. This DVD is definitely not it. The moves are so, so and could be modified, but the music is so boring, you don't even want to. I have never done such a short workout and wished it was over half way through. A complete waste of time.Even though I consider myself advanced, I own Tamilee's Motown FitHits DVD and while it is also a non-challenging workout, the music is so much fun that I find ways to modify the moves to make them harder. I have found that there are very few instructors out there that really know how to pick motivating music and it can really make or break a workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"Alright- these dance moves are ridiculously out of date- I can't feel excited about a \\"groovy grapevine.\\" I think she moved too quickly from one tempo to the other- and all in all, it wasn't very fun.Plus, there's one woman on the video who I swear was not wearing a bra, and it was extremely distracting.I worked out once, and probably won't use this video again... maybe I'll sell it in the marketplace..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this DVD and one from Prevention.

The shows bring back fond memories of my childhood. They're simple, honest stories with a comedic edge to them. They're enduring and stand up to more modern sitcoms replete with sexual references, four-letter words, etc.My 12 year old niece just happened to see an episode of FA recently and was mesmorized. She asked, \\"Why don't they have t-v shows like this today?\\"A totally honest question from someone who didn't have anything to compare the modern-day t-v shows to.I highly recommend all five seasons of Family Affair. As a member of the television media, I believe its so important that what goes out over the airwaves and into young minds is positive and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous realistic fantisy for the child in me","review":"I am Roger Bowman,it's been ten years since i've read these books.I'm now reading them again for my girlfriend,and enjoying them as much now as i did the first fifteen times as a child-teenager.

My mother would read a few pages and say \\"Good-night Roger\\" and leave me alone with the book and i just had to know what happened next. That's when i learned to read.

They would get better from the antibiotic and as soon as they were off it, they would be sick again. Since putting this in our home, (knock on wood) no one in the family has had a cold and that is awesome, especially because of the holidays and all the stomach flu-like symptoms that were going around...we didn't get it!!!

The problem is, there really is no objective way to tell if it works or not! I plugged it in by my bed, thinking that at least I would be breathing germ-free air while I slept. Trouble is, if it indeed does what it says it does, I should have placed it by my roommate who was already sick, in order to kill the germs he was breathing out! I ended up catching a bad cold and feeling like I wasted my money. The thing is kinda loud, too, so if you have trouble falling asleep I wouldn't recommend it. At first the \\"white noise\\" aspect was okay, but after a while it just got irritating. I unplugged it and now it's just collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably effective but can only fit US plugs","review":"It is probably effective, but the down side is I ordered it from Singapore. The product info didn't warn me about the plug - it couldn't fit our wall power points, and even after I used an adaptor, both (I ordered 3 and opened 2) blew and can't be used anymore. Totally a waste of money for me. My advice is if you aren't from the US, forget about ordering this.

I saw it at a film festival in Los Angeles and have been a huge fan ever since. Great movies like this get harder to find each year and you have to seek them out. This is a movie lover's film much like those seen in Hollywood's last great era - the 70's. It's a small, simple story with a great visual style and a thought provoking story that doesn't try to overwhelm you with heavy-handed techniques or by beating you over the head with the obvious. Some reviews for this film say it is even better on second viewing and I can't wait to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good; doesn't work.","review":"I had the same experience as the writer of the previous review.

I'll look into returning it but I expect I will just throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked properly...","review":"It took me a while to realize that this scale was not working. I set it up as the manual suggested and used it accordingly and was always amazed at how light everything was.

At this point, it is too late to return it. I am online now shopping for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short battery life","review":"This scale eats up battery so quickly.

It was otherwise well-constructed and attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was nice until it died","review":"I really liked this scale. It was used once a week in my kitchen.

One warning, NOT everyone will enjoy this cd. The ideal connoisseur of 70 minutes of Madness will be DJ's, electronic dance music-philes, and open minded music listeners. It's not a happy go lucky trance or house cd with predictable baselines, melodic synths, cheesy vocals, and a grand finale mega-hit track. Rather this is a collection of old skool hiphop, DnB, house, electrofunk, techno, and ambient cuts. With clever and meaningful samples littered throughout, Coldcut (Matt Black and Jonathan More) seamlessly blend various EDM genres into a beautiful fluid listenable mix. The mixing, which sounds effortless, is an achievement in itself. Also, the re-release is no mistake because although made in 1995 the music still sounds incredibly fresh.This is a must have cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value Subwoofer","review":"Although I've auditioned various subwoofers in the stores, this is my first. So I'm not an expert in low frequency speakers. But I am pleased with the performance of the Polk 505. I don't want the base to overwhelm the music or the soundtrack but I also want to notice that it is there. At the 25-30% of volume level and it does what I want. Since the subwoofer has such a narrow range of frequency and the difference between this and other subs that I've heard in 600-800 price range were negligible to my ears, I preferred to spend more money on the quality of the front and rear speakers and the price on the 505 allowed me to do just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sounding Sub","review":"This subwoofer sounds great, i am currently running it with energy rc micro 5.1 system and it sounds great. The rc micro system came with an 8 inch sub that sounded great but just wasn't quite loud enough for me. So i upgraded to this, was a little worried about the sound quality but after reading many reviews and doing my homework i decided to go with it. I was not disappointed let me assure you, this thing pounds and at the same time produces great sounding bass. I recommend using a good quality subwoofer cable with this, preferably acoustic research, picked one of these cables up on ebay for 14 bucks shipped. Also make sure to use the yellow line unfiltered port on the back if you have a newer receiver with a subwoofer out on it. And dont be afraid to move this sub around the room alot until you find the perfect spot that sounds best with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I am really glad I didn't spend more money on a couple speakers I was looking at.

If you're an audiophile you will probably find faults; however, for an average (perhaps even above average) listener this will be MORE than adequate. I am a fan of Techno, Hip-Hop, Pop, and Reggae and each genre sounds fantastic with it. It has no trouble crushing you with the low bass hits from across the room. Oh, I forgot to mention that it makes movies absolutely incredible! (Try Inception, I was blown away with the PSW505's performance with it.)Best song I have found to test it so far: Girls on the Dance Floor, Far East Movement (Even if you don't like pop, give the first 15 seconds a chance with the volume at 3/4) [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated speaker size","review":"The speaker size is only 6 1/3 inches.

I am so happy with the clarity of these speakers. This sub fills out the bottom end very nicely, I am driving the system with an Onkyo TX-SR606 i picked up used and actually works. Lots of people compliment the sound of the system I have the CS1 center and Polk Audio Monitor30 for surrounds with the Monitor70's for fronts.

The Polk PSW505 has nice punch and is quite articulate without turning up to the max. For the money it would be very difficult to find anything with its quality and output. I gave it four stars because of the size...not enormous, but there are nice compact sub's out there. That said, the smaller one's cost about $300.00 more and the sound was not that much better, or any better, for that matter. You can't go wrong with Polk PSW 505"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would buy again","review":"Very good value for the price. Would buy again.

I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews I read in regards to the technical and audiophilic reviews... but let me attest to this as well: it is LOUD.Whether at very minimal volume or really being tested, the response and clarity is superb. The power capabilities are also incredible; at 60-70% this thing easily shakes walls and rattles doors, windows, and light fixtures 40 feet away through 3 walls.I have, no joke, had it up loud enough I was concerned about it throwing off my heart's rhythm because the sound pressure was so great on my chest.In the end, I've had nothing but positive experience with all my Polk hardware.

I called Amazon they told me it was beyond the 30 day period and I had to call Polk Audio directly. I did, and then I was truly impressed with this company. Things can go wrong in manufacturing, and you can get the occasional flawed product. That is quite acceptable.

Although it is made in China, so far so good. I did buy an extended warranty from SquareTrade though because I don't want to pay for shipping even during the standard warranty period.It occupies a lot of space, but it think it is worth it. Of course it is not suitable for a small room such as an office or a bedroom, unless such a room is more than 12' x 12'.I am not a connoisseur of subwoofers, but it seems to me that this one produces somewhat softer sound which is good for movies but perhaps will not excite you if are buying it primarily for heavy metal, but of course, it is a subjective perception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Value!","review":"For the price of this sub, I couldn't be happier! Plenty of low end sound to play nice with my Paradigm bookshelf speakers. I'm using it for a rather large master bedroom and it's probably overkill for the space.

The Bass is subtle and not Boomy. It will shake your room if you have it turned up to loud. Just like in the Movies only the deep sound waves are in your house. The instructions are spot on and the PSW505 gives you three ways to hook up your sub. I have ordered Banana Plugs for my Speakers and the Pioneer VSX-1122-K receiver. I have Old School JBL L7 Front Speakers, Infinity Walnut SM62 for the Rear Left and Right, Infinity Kappa Old School for the Center, and I alrady have the JBLPSW1200 Sub_woofer. I have added Leviton JBL ES55 for the Rear other 2channels of rear surrounds. These are smaller and I have them mounted on Sanus Speaker stands behind my couch.

Wow, was I impressed. I did an $1100 audio upgrade (new Onkyo TX-NR709 AV receiver, Rotel 5-channel amp, and this sub) and I can honestly say that at least 50% of the audio improvement for my $1100 came from adding this sub. Prior to Audessy calibration, this sub would shake the walls, windows, and the couch I was sitting on! I like deep bass but not to have my windows rattled- that is effects that belong on a roller coaster simulator, not for movies (IMHO). Once calibrated, this sub gives the perfect amount of bass. The thanator chase in Avatar has the room shake JUST A BIT when needed, but I hear all the deep bass sounds needed. This is an amazing subwoofer, worth every penny.

This arrived in. 2 days, and at first I wasn't impressed sounded like the psw10 I just returned, I bought the psw505 purely because its published frequency response and the fact that it was at least 6db louder, anyway if not placed right in the room you use it in it will have no low end extension, and a lot of port turbulence on any real low bass passages, I play extensive amounts of bass mekanik and the sort and the sub can go cleanly down to about 45hz, any lower it sounds like there's a wind storm in the box, so I placed it correctly and it sounded a lot better, very clean and musical with excellent transient resp, it litteraly is the little bit deeper and louder! Psw 10. For 250 I'm not sure anybody could find a better powered sub, or build one for that matter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This speaker is VERY powerful!

Expectations exceeded and then some","review":"I don't usually review items I purchase on Amazon, but this product is an exception. We recently purchased a new home and I am in the process of installing 7.1 surround in the living room. I installed Polk Audio RC85i in-wall speakers for the front and front surround speakers. They sounded great, but my subwoofer just didn't fill the room. Since I was so pleased with the RC85i speakers I took a look at the Polk Audio subwoofer. The reviews were great and the price seemed reasonable so I ordered it from Amazon. As usual it arrived in a timely manner and was installed last night. The manual recommended starting with the volume at 50%. When we hit the first alien encounter in Cowboy's and Aliens, WOW! The last place I heard that much bass was in a movie theater. The bass was clear with no distortion and the room actually shook! Needless to say I had to turn it down a bit.

If you plan on doing a burn in period before turning this thing loose (recommended); I suggest you do the burn in while you are out of the house, or your ears will let you know that may not have been a good plan. Mine were sensitive to any bass for at least a week (bad plan). If you live in an apartment or have close neighbors, you should plan on having problems. Although this thing sounds absolutly great, your neighbors may not agree. It will definatly shake and vibrate anything near it, with that said the build quality is so good you can set stuff on it and for the most part it stays where you put it.

It is hard to believe that I could get such a fantastic speaker for only $250.00. I had considered getting the 10\\" instead of 12\\". The 10\\" may have worked fine, but I am still glad I spent a little extra for this one. Despite the booming low end nature of the sound, it is clear and never muddy. I like the Auto setting whereby it will turn itself off when it fails to detect a signal after 15 minutes. It is being powered by a Yamaha RX-V473 amplifier from Best Buy (575 Watts).

Intricate plot lines that allow the viewer to reach his or her own conclusions, award winning performances and the opportunity to watch as the production values of the series mature into what was to become The Wire. The packaging was excellent as is the quality of the discs, the extras are infomative and serve to support the series viewing. An added bonus are the track lisitings something perhaps they should have continued with the Wire.

In fact, his father was a land owner, Rasputin grew up in a nice home in a town that benefited from being located by rivers (making commerce an important part of the town), was never a monk, remained married to the same woman, brought his two daughters to live with him in St. Petersburg so they could have an education, and for a complex set of reasons, allowed himself to be a scapegoat.

It is a wonderful story - outrageous and compelling. Moynahan did an excellent job in his portrayal of early 20th century Russia. The vivid accounts of the Romonov family is the true reason the novel commands so much attetion from the reader.

As an Ecuadorian-American, I was very favorably impressed by the overall quality of this film. Sebastian Cordero engages the viewer with a very accurate portrayal of the atmosphere of delinquency, poverty and hopelessness aggravated by the financial crisis which Ecuador has been experiencing. The film was interesting and captivating from start to finish. Naturally, if you speak Spanish as I do, or are familiar with Latin America, you will enjoy the film even more. However, I was grateful for the subtitles in this letterboxed edition, as the characters' speech is heavily spiced with \\"gangster slang\\" and local vernacular some of which I was not familiar with.

These methods are extremely effective, and results are instantaneous. Anyone who has trouble picking up undesirable energy from the environment will greatly benefit from this book.

Instead, it offers little that those of us in the business don't know already and falls way short of a comprehensive analysis of this topic.

However, if you really want to learn how a language is structured, forget this book. Learning the basics of grammar i.e. verb conjugation, etc. is fundamental and to me, the obvious starting point. It is of little benefit to memorize how to say \\"Excuse me, but where might I find the secretary?\\" if I don't even know which word is the verb or which word is the subject. The tapes do not necessarily follow the exercises in the book, so I got lost rather often. One advantage, though, is that the tapes are spoken clearly, and it would not take a person very long to catch on to the pronunciation (once you've memorized how to say \\"Thank you for your hospitality, Miss O'Donnell.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one to start with.","review":"Irish is an extraordinarily difficult language to learn.

Cork in Ireland, I have always been interested in the Irish language and speak it well . Irish is not an altogether easy language to learn, and this book certainly doesn't help. The conversations are unnatural, the vocabularies are messy and the grammar is hardly explained at all. Bascially, this book encourages you to memorise phrases, not to actually learn to talk on your own. Ironically, there used to be another Teach Yourself Irish by M. Dillon, which was much better on teaching Irish.Do learn Irish, but avoid this book. My first recommendation would be \\"Learning Irish\\", followed by \\"Irish on Your Own\\". They are both superior to this book in every way. Another noticable point.

The villains were comedians, the subplots were less than engaging, in fact the only good thing were the action sequences and Reeves' affable charm as the innocent Clark and the MoS. Pryor should not have mugged so much, the Producers should not have been so desperate to make a few bucks on the franchise that they would neglect their core constituency. I can only hope that the next attempt at Superman will remind us of the 1978 original and not anything after Superman 2..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR disappointment!","review":"After seeing the first two Superman movies (which were both really great), and then watching this one, you'll be surprised at how much the greatness and quality of Superman has dropped. Christopher Reeve does a good job as Superman (as always), but that's the highest point of this movie. Why did they take Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor away and replace him with a pair of mediocre so-called \\"villains\\"? And why, oh why did they focus the movie so much on comedian Richard Pryor, who does such a bad job as a computer whiz? The script is bad (no, terrible), the special effects are bad, and the final battle between Superman and Pryor's Super Computer has \\"stupid\\" and \\"boring\\" written all over it! The film relies far too much on comedy relief. Yes, the fantastic Superman theme is there, but who cares?! This is one, put in my Movie Guide terms, big turkey!

I love Superman films and love Richard Pryor. But as I look at it today, I can see that it is an abysmal mess of a movie. From the very beginning, I could see that even the visuals looked bad. Everything looks as if it were shot in soft focus. The plot about a satellite controlling the weather and a computer powering itself is pretty implausible, even for a superhero movie. That kind of story should have been left in a comic book. Also, the special effects are awful. In the third act, where Supe dodges missiles, it's laughable. I don't know what the Salkinds were thinking when they made Supe III. The absence of director Richard Donner is evident.

For starters why put a comedian (no disrespect to the late Richard Pryor) in an Action/Adventure, Comic book movie; that is like mixing ammonia with bleach with really stinks with a strong foul odor.

All the wonder and excitement of the first 2 films are ill-chosenly traded for comic relief. Director Richard Lesters opening slapstick ballet is silly and doesn't belong in this movie.

I understand that he was one of the most popular comedians at that time but it took me a while to warm up to his character. However, I felt that the rest of the movie was good, but not as good as compared to Superman 1 and 2. There are plenty of comical scenes in this movie but it is evened out by just as many action adventure moments. My favorite part of the movie is when the evil Superman meets up with the good and mild mannered Clark Kent, fighting for the win, and also, the machine VS. Superman scene near the end of the movie. I have to admit that there is a scene or two with Richard Pryor's character where it makes you \\"ho-hum\\" but I continue to be entertained by this movie. What strikes me odd, is that some of the critics here who booed Superman 3, actually gave Superman 4, a 4 or 5 star rating, which is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly campy","review":"Too much camp weighs down this third movie. Christopher Reeves' performance, in combination with some good special effects, helps somewhat. But there are too many moments of slapstick and silliness, not enough moments of awe. Richard Lester's directorial style seemed ill suited for the Superman movie this time out. It was also the first movie which did not feature Mario Puzo's input on the story or script, and his absence is noticable. But for 2 hours of halfway decent entertainment it isn't too bad. Just not anywhere near as good as the first two, but still superior to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have never been made - One & a half stars","review":"Although there was bright promise in the storyline, the inclusion of Pryor, Vaughn and the \\"Super\\" computer, caused this thing to bomb!

When Superman III came along they couldn't really fire Reeve (the star) so they wrote Kidder out of the story to punish her for mouthing off. Without the Lois Lane/Superman love story, the film had no heart in it at all. Then, director Richard Lester did with Superman III what he really wanted to do with Superman II all along, and that was make a slapstick comedy. This undermined the whole Superman theme and made a joke out of the franchise. The only element in Superman II that didn't work was the slapstick that Lester added to the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to give it no stars, but it wouln't let me","review":"This is THE worst Superman film ever, it might even be the worst movie ever made!!!!

I saw it in the theater as a child in 1983. Its interesting to see alot of early 1980's culture and Christopher Reeve is a very good actor to watch regardless of the productions mess. The scene with Clark fighting the evil Superman is worth it, otherwise clear off! Very poorly made! It may have worked then in 1983, but it clearly does not hold up. There is no evidence of director Richard Donner's touches (1 and 2{Donner Cut}). The silly producers that fired and cut off Donner, cut the life off of the Superman series. Why did they think Superman is a comedy? What fools! Seeing part 3 makes you long for 1 & 2(Donner Cut)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superman 3 review","review":"This movie stinks. The opening looks nothing nothing like the ones from the films. They look like they added in at the last minute. Its like those Star Wars text things you get in most movie-editing softwares. It was also a bad reminder of those 3 stooges shorts starring Joe Besser. Infact this WHOLE film is a bad reminder of the Joe Besser days of the 3 Stooges. Richard Pryor is very unfunny in this stinkfest. I think he had more screen time then Superman did. There are some good points in the film like Superman saving the powerplant and the kid. The Evil Superman is pretty bad[bleep] and much more then Emo Peter from Spiderman 3. Sadly these good points fail to save the film in the long run. The effects and fights are standard. Overall,It still awful. I give this film a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time and Space are Shattered by This Movie's Craptitude","review":"If evil were to make a movie, I'm pretty sure it'd be something like Superman III. A poor story, a poor script, an obviously over-(ahem)medicated Margot Kidder (in her few scenes), ZERO chemistry between actors, poor filming, EVEN for 1983, and poor special effects, EVEN FOR 1983!!! Did this movie have ANYTHING going for it?One thing, and one thing alone: the Superman vs. Clark sequence is extremely entertaining from a fantasy perspective. However, whereas Richard Donner (the FIRST movie) kept one foot in reality and one in fantasy, director Richard Lester decides to take us on an acid trip into mediocrity with what, in my opinion, is the SECOND-WORST movie of all time!

Christopher Reeve is Superman--and is super as Clark Kent, too--and another good thing about this movie is Annette O'Toole, who looks really good as Clark's Smallville sweetheart Lana Lang, and makes you wonder why Superman ever wasted any time with Lois Lane. But Richard Pryor is silly and not believable as a computer whiz in this movie, and Robert Vaughan as a villain has obviously fallen far from his \\"Man From U.N.C.L.E.\\" days.The story isn't even worth discussing, but the one other impresive feature of this movie is watching Superman fly, which looks even more believable than in the first two Superman movies.

Hopkins, the sometimes drunken cowboy who is dubbed, \\"the greatest long distance racer ever.\\" The film strives at many points to touch you at an emotional level with very little success. Many portions of the film seem to go entirely unexplained (bad editing?), while others leave you pondering the mere plausibility of a few scenes.I would have expected that Viggo Mortensen would have had access to a wide assortment of roles following The Lord of the Rings, and am struggling to figure out what he saw in this script. Yes, the movie will lightly entertain you, but Viggo is capable of much more than this; action movies may be more up his alley, but this one doesn't deliver the real punch.

Hidalgo will rank on my list of horse movies to own, just like Seabiscuit, Black Beauty, and Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken.Viggo Mortensen gave a wonderful performance as Hopkins(and whether the western legend is true, Mortensen has my respect). Mortensen brought Hopkins to life in a way few could have done it.When it comes to Hidalgo's performance, I'm speechless! I have great respect for the trainer, but even greater respect for the horse! I agree with someone else who said, \\"Hidalgo should win an award for his performance.\\"There were a few slow parts, but overall it's a keeper:) I did my share of crying and was caught up in the moment. Thanks Disney, you've done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better action story than i thought it would be","review":"With all of the unintelligent, lame, story-less format action crap that Hollywood pumps out, I thought this was going to be more or less the same crap. I was pleasantly suprised to discover an interesting, original storyline reveal itself - that didn't insult my intelligence. This is a great movie for all ages.There are some aspects, like some characters, that are format- Hollywood- action- goodguy- badguy- stereotypes, but I found these enjoyable and presented in a way that worked well with the story and made it more fun.Go, Hidalgo, go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie that wouldn't play.","review":"Hi, I bought the movie Hidalgo for a birthday present and when they went to play it they got an error and weren't able to watch it. I have sent a message to the seller informing them of what has happened and waiting for a reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana Jones and Laurence of Arabia combined!!!","review":"I think this and LOTR was the icing on the cake for Viggo. I absolutely loved this movie!!! I don't know what else to say, I really enjoyed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You should really think about this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you...","review":"First seeing this movie in the theatre made me think, I'm glad I didn't pay for this (free screening). Then as the movie progressed my mind didn't really change. Once out of the theatre and conversing with my friends, as realized I actually did enjoy the movie.Yes, it was a little too \\"Happy Ending\\" for me and there wasn't much plot to think about after the film, but the horse who played Hidalgo and Viggo Mortenson worked well together. There are some slow parts of the film right after the Ocean of Fire starts but it picks up again.It's a good film and I'd recommend it to almost anyone, little kids will be bored and there's just not enough action for Steven Segal fans. Everyone else should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a really good movie.","review":"This movie was exciting and it took you on a long journey--a quality common to many of the good ones, you feel like you've been on a great adventure. It was not a children's movie, if it was I wouldn't have been able to take it, but you could watch it with your kids and not have to worry about it. And I'm by no means a sentimental teary eyed person, but one of the end scenes made me catch my breath and that scene stuck with me even though I saw it about 8 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Lord of the Rings\\" meets \\"Dances with Wolves\\" in Iraq","review":"The AV quality is excellent. The story is a first for me. An American native conceals his identity, goes to the Arabian desert, befriends the Shieq, and leaves the girl. In the cavalry of old, a man's horse was his best friend. For a farmer, a horse is as close to a soulmate as Adam was to Eve. I think this movie helps me forget about the terrible reality of war. Right now, I can't think of a better way to prove that 'It can be done'.I recommend this movie along with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy- Extended Version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For All","review":"This recount of the life and times of Frank Hopkins is fun to watch, thought provoking, and heartwarming. Even if one has not lived such an exciting life, it is easy to relate to some of the personal trials while wishing for such fun.As the story evolves around a 3,000 mile race, Hopkins' Mustang is clearly the underdog. Hopkins and Hildago (the paint Mustang) must each face the harsh desert and its perills, the \\"bad guys\\", and personal conflicts.Hopkins competed in races around the world well into his 60's, not only for the adventures, but to bring to light his personal goals regarding the Mustangs and protection of their lives and environment. He was an activist on behalf of the Mustangs all of his adult life.An excellent movie, good for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hildalgo - a movie worth seeing","review":"Got to see ahead at a Sneak Preview...it has been quite a while since I've been in an audience that cheered and left smiling! A rare event - a movie that had a good story, wonderful photography, an ENJOYABLE movie. I will be buying the DVD when it becomes available - that does NOT happen very often.The horse and Viggo had great chemistry, the people were actually interesting, and the story was entertaining, maybe moreso because Frank Hopkins was a real person, living from 1865 - 1951, a different time.For those who like knowing stuff, check out http://www.frankhopkins.com and make sure you see Hildalgo at least once...chances are you'll want to see it more than that!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The kind of movie I never get tired of seeing","review":"My profile. 43 yo (and getting better). No qulaifications as a movie critic whatsoeverThis is one of those adventure movies I just cannot stop seeing... everything is perfect, the production, the choosing of the actors, the action.. and the love between man and horse united in such way that makes you actually hear the horse's thoughts.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit LONG...But a very good film!!","review":"Has to be one of the better films that I have seen in a long time...the film was a bit long (136 minutes) but the action was there, enough to keep me interested. Excellent cinematography, acting and great effects as well....."},{"rating":"2","title":"the movie is very good","review":"Yes, this is a very good movie, much better than Seabiscuit, as a matter of fact. There aren't any special features, but I don't care. Would you rather own a good movie with no special features or a bad movie with tons of special features? And, on most of the DVD's with special features, they are all boring and try to make up for the subpar movie.Viggo Mortensen is a rising star. He's been in many movies alongside big stars, like when he was in Crimson Tide. It's a pretty good all around movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and Powerful","review":"I'm a horse person, so of course I might enjoy the movie more, but I saw it the first night it was released and it was a full theater--I was obviously not the only one moved by this movie. Viggo and his horse were such an amazing team! The scenery is awsome as well. The whole story was so moving to me. My sister-in-law and I had to go see it twice and I will definitely be adding Hidalgo to my collection of wonderful movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. First of all, I LOVE horses and this is a tale of a true-hearted American Mustang! I've owned Arabians, Quarter Horses, Thoroughbreds, etc., and all have their own great characteristics, and overall, I have a special love and respect for the Mustang. Viggo Mortensen is really good in this move as well. I like the spiritual aspect of it when he recognizes and ties into his Native American heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing gem of a movie...","review":"Not since \\"Dances with Wolves\\" has a movie come out that portrays the emotional complexities of one who is caught between the love of his people and his alliegance to his country so eloquently. Viggo Mortensen tears up the screen as a man haunted by a past he longs for but has distanced himself from for the sake of survival. Set against the backdrop of the Sahara Desert, the story revolves around an annual horse race that the main character accepts an invitation to participate in with his Mustang steed. Ambition, greed, lust, and power are all explored in this epic adventure. But the main theme is about a man finding his way back to himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidalgo","review":"One of the nicest true stories I've ever seen.

This \\"system\\" is about as effective as fighting a forrest fire with gasoline. The originator and his representitives are borderline insane.

I have spent 17 years deeply involved in the martial arts and this by far is the biggest fraud out there.

Self-published, the text is full of grammatical errors (would someone please explain to the author the correct use of \\"lie\\" and \\"lay\\"), and exhibits a self-absorbsion that borders on the pathetic. Rarely about the land and people of St. Johns, the author devotes chapters to her cockroach problems in New England (why should we care about bugs in New England?) and to her \\"difficult\\" decision over whether she should give up two weeks of \\"paradise\\" in order to give her brother a life-saving kidney. I tossed this one in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Ccan I give this book no stars? I purchased the book while on vacation in St. John. The cover is beautiful and very enticing. The content inside is just plain awful. Besides being full of grammatical mistakes on just about every page, it consists of the most mundane, boring details of this woman's life and her big move to St John from somewhere in New England. The first 100+ pages will tell you far more than you want to know about packing. The rest of the book is almost as exciting. A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ","review":"My husband and I just got back from my first visit to St. John. We found Desiring Paradise in a local gift shop - being adventures ourselves we bought the book.

Its got it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I stupidly did not read customer reviews for this book and was charmed by the lovely cover...the best part of the book. I have read grocery lists that contained more excitement. If you are looking for a relaxing beach read, this is not it! The author takes half the book to talk about packing (literally) and moving(driving her car, airport, etc-who cares?) to St. John in what should have been a short first chapter. It contains no interesting anecdotes of island living and is a torture to read. This book would only be of use to someone who is moving to the islands and wants a manual on how to do so and truthfully, I am not so sure it would be useful for that either. Save your money.

As I read on about not only Karin and Bob's plights but also the descriptions of places that were all around me somehow it made the bad weather a little sunnier and bright.

What I hoped would be a Carribean version of the more jounalistic FOUR SEASONS NORTH (Billie Wright's wonderful book describing her first year living in Alaska) was more like a letter home. I hope the author tries a second book, and I hope it starts with the crunching of their shoes in Carribean sand. I also hope she learns to show us the story rather than tell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A BOOK ABOUT ST. JOHN...","review":"It is a book about moving to paradise, and it is very interesting if you ever dreamed of doing the same thing. This couple made the dream come true! But it wasn't easy -- they don't actually reach St. John until the second half of the book [which I should also warn you contains a distracting amount of typos]. The first half describes all the planning and logistics of their move.This is a great book to read in the dead of winter, when you're longing to escape to your own paradise. But if you're really seeking information specific to St. John, I urge you to look at books written by Gerald Singer or Pamela Acheson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful tale of the realities of trying to live the dream!","review":"I picked this book up on island (St. John) while we were on our annual vacation there. My husband and I have discussed what it would take to pack it all up and move many times, so I was very intrigued by Karin's story. I do not usually read non-fiction, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story! It answered so many questions that my husband and I had been asking. I loved the details of the planning for the move and the reactions of family and co-workers. The tale was funny, entertaining and engaging. For those who complain that it isn't an accurate picture of the USVI - I found every comment about St. John to be spot on.My only regrets, after finishing the book, are:1) We have never seen the \\"snow float\\"and2) We have not met this wonderful couple yet.I plan to try to rectify both on our visit next year!This is a great dose of reality for anyone considering dropping everything and running off to live in paradise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Boston.

I got far MORE than I bargained for! You must realize that this is not your typical island tourist guide book. This is a tale of two folks who took a big leap of faith and changed not only their location, but their lives. I have to say that I have an unfair advantage over other readers in that we have actually spent time with Karin and Bob, and have experienced their \\"Paradise\\" first-hand as a direct result of reading her book, and I have to say that this author tells it like it is! Karin captures the flavor and beat of the island with great accuracy and knowledge and humor. In my opinion, you can't do better than \\"Desiring Paradise\\" if you are serious about gaining knowledge about how to leave the mundane behind and find your own piece of Paradise!

The whole movie is Woody Allen making a tribute to himself. Allen plays one of the main characters and the rest of the actors are obviously too much in awe, or is it fear, of him to improvise on lines that would have fit if Woody Allen was saying them, but really didn't fit their characters. Much of the plot plainly doesn't make coherent sense, and all that whining is tiring and cliche. Eeeegads! The movie would have been better if Woody Allen wasn't in it, and if Ricci wasn't used to add depth to an undeniably stupid shallow character.

Curse words are silenced -- at first I thought my audio was dropping out, as this program has a lot of profanity. Who knows what else has been cut from the original broadcast version?Why offer a version of the program that completely undermines its artistic integrity? I will, with 100% certainty, not be buying subsequent episodes via Amazon VOD... so glad they offered this free preview.As to the content of the show, it seemed rather ho-hum (although I love Laura Linney, who deserves a better vehicle). But who can really tell without seeing the real deal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful!","review":"It's fascinating to me that everyone who reviewed this season actually watch the same show!

It is even obnoxious in it's glib put down and stereotyping of the support group. This is for people who have no idea what the reality of cancer and treatment is like. This could have been a great idea to depict someone who has cancer and still lives her life. The writing is the level of a bad sitcom.

The fights we're mediocre at best, even worst is the acting and lines. A horrific movie, please don't waste your time. The only bright spot about this movie is the hot latina chick.

Other problems: The book bogged down in names and is hindered by a lack of an index. So when my head was swimming with names, I couldn't check the book's first mention of that person to be reminded who it was. Zackheim was repeatedly careless with pronouns, so a \\"she\\" or \\"her\\" in a sentence could refer to more than one woman.Zackheim speculated too much, such as who knew whom, and what motivated people. She speculated on small things, such as whether Einstein and his ex-wife resumed sexual relations. She speculated on big things - such as what happened to Lieserl.I was originally engrossed in the book. I dreamed about it one night, and the next day, I had to read the last 100 pages to find out what happened to Lieserl. Zackheim doesn't know. I felt let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Girl Lost--Or Not?","review":"Zackheim's style is certainly readable, but her conclusions leave something to be desired. She provides the reader with too much irrelevant or misleading detail and too many of her own strong opinions. I also found her explanation of Lieserl's ultimate fate to be unconvincing. To her credit, she has told a story that should be known, and provided a number of wonderful photos. In my opinion, two of the photos depict an extremely plausible candidate for an adult Lieserl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it covered...","review":"This cover was easy to install and makes my truck look great.

This one is excellent, although not up to the standards she had earlier set. It features a somewhat more produced sound, with a harder edge in some places. The album was later re-issued with an alternative mix of the first song. Some of the songs on this CD, such as Harmless Love have justifiably become some of her most popular songs. Seek out the albums \\"Testiomony\\" and \\"Shadows on a Dime\\" first, but also give this one a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A conscious search for nothing","review":"Terrible, disappointing, and unpleasant.

It didn't deliver on the promise of the title or the description of the book in any shape, way, or form in my opinion. For the price, I'd expected something along the lines of CITY OF LAUGHTER or VAUXHALL: A HISTORY. Something beautiful and filled with images. That is not what this is. It's a small book with a few black and white prints, all of which I'd already seen elsewhere. For $30, I'd have kept it. For $130, I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely built, does the job","review":"OK, nobody's going to get super excited by a rubber mallet. But this one's well built, and it works fine, and it's the kind of thing where you think you've gotten along for years without one, do you really need one? And then you get one and you use it ten times more often than you thought. There's just a lot of situations where you might need a little more force than you can provide by hand but a hammer's going to mar the surface. Yes, you can play around with padding and hope for the best, or you can just grab your mallet and be done with it.Just as an example, this one paid for itself ten times over when I had to dissemble a bed in a hurry so movers could move it - as they waited on the clock - because nobody thought to check if it actually came apart after 15 years of use. Oops. Even the big huge movers couldn't budge the components by hand, but a few taps with the mallet and the job was done with no damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"Don't waste your money, most of the chapters are about 2 to 3 pages long and are very generic.

As a teacher, Woody Mann is one of the best. He has planned these lessons well so that with respect to each song he sequences an introduction, performance, breakdown and then a slow rendition. Together these phases leave no question as to what he is doing. Further and where appropriate, he discusses technique and what can be musically accomplished by different tunings. The songs are acoustic blues, often updated from the specific traditional with riffs of his own that add to the interest and uniqueness relative to the original.

The questions in this book aren't nearly as hard as the registry's bank of questions, but I would say the way they phrase the questions makes it twice as confusing. This book might be a nice reference to a student who is going through the EMT program, but not as a guide for the National Registry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I used this video as a follow-up to reading the book with my middle school learning support students.

This story is based on the true story of Helen Kellar and her remarkable teacher, Annie Sullivan. The story is beautifully told, depicting on one hand the power struggle of the wills between the two women as Annie seeks to bring language to Helen who doesn't even know what words are and on the other, showing a family's struggle to cope with a challenge they don't understand. I found certain scenes humourous and others poignant. The two actors that play Annie and Helen were perfect for the part. All in all a really good family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Worker","review":"It is a very good movie, but it was actually different from the old film starring Patty Duke. Hallie did a great job to act as Helen Keller. According to the Story of Helen Keller, Hallie looks like young Helen Keller. It is great!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an abomination","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The original Miracle Worker (1962) is one of my favorite movies of all time- I watch it over and over. Incredible. Simply one of the most perfect movies ever made, in my estimation. This one is GARBAGE. Everything about this movie is BAD- the only good thing about it was the original premise, the original story of Helen Keller. The little girl's acting is just unbelievably bad- you don't believe for a minute that she is deaf and blind. Save your money and buy the life-affirming, incredibly profound and powerful 1962 version!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Not until You bless me\\"","review":"This version of the Miracle Worker stands up quite well to the 1962 version.The story itself is so inspiring, and the principal characters are so good, that one can overlook a weak performance or two by supporting cast.The horrors of Anne Sullivan's childhood are whitewashed in this version( ie we don't learn that she was probably molested as in the 1962 film), but her character nevertheless shines through.When Helen's father suggests that perhaps the Lord did not mean for Helen to talk, Miss Sullivans reply-\\"I mean her to\\" resonates through one's being.The bible passage offered as a mealtime grace by the son near the film's conclusion is equally apt- a man wrestling all night with an angel,being wounded in his thigh, and unwilling to let go \\"until you bless me\\". We understand at once the deeper meaning of the literal wrestling that has constituted much of the film.The story remains a testimony to the human spirit that perseveres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Worker","review":"I was unhappy withe the packaging of the product.

Possibly worth a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good representation of what probably happened!","review":"Compelling!!! The actress who plays Annie was a good pick; I love that she had the same large brown eyes, pug flat nose, & big lips that the real Annie Sullivan had. Two things I'd change, though...the real-life Annie Sullivan was much shorter than the actress & the real Annie's hair was stick-straight rather than wavy like this actress's. The performances were great, esp. the actress who played Helen. Only thing on Helen's actress...the real Helen had blue-ish purple eyes & straight hair instead of the dark eyes & curly hair that the actress has here. The actress who played Kate was realistically depicted right through the coloring. They also left out several of the flashbacks that Annie experiences about her horrible childhood, but the flashback scenes that are shown were nice & vivid & the viewer can feel Annie's fear at each of these flashbacks. All in all, a fairly accurate representation of the play, as accurate as can be squashed onto a video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, bland, bland","review":"I use clips from this production with my drama class to compare and contrast with the original version. In particular we look at the famous dining room scene which, in this version, is a tepid rendition without passion or energy. Why the plaintive cello music? Instead of highlighting the central battle of wills between Anne and Helen, it seems to be urging us to feel pity for Helen, the very thing Sullivan was combating within the Keller family.This version also adds dialogue to emphasize the subplot between Captain Keller and James - the original James was callow and abrasive, but I find this one unbearable. Overall a beautiful adaptation to look at but lacking a firm directorial vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Worker","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

As usual, Disney has taken a wonderful story and distorted it with fictional information. I am from Alabama and have visited Ivy Green twice. Aside from the obvious disregard for authenticity with the set, they also missed the mark on several facts. Just one example--the Kellers did not have slaves, they had sharecroppers. Slavery had been abolished by the time Helen was born in 1880! No wonder people have such warped images of the South, thanks to irresponsible filmakers like this. The story was great enough to stand on its own without all the changes, just as it has for many years. Disney changes it because they apparently aren't confident enough in their ability to produce a good film. This movie only further proves that. Don't waste your time on this one, parents. If you want your kids to know TRUE history, go for the other films about Helen Keller's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw it on TV and want it for myself!","review":"In two words, I would say \\"Loved it.\\" It was on ABC a while back, and wished I taped it.

In fact, I wonder at times how this book was ever published. For example, the book claims the word, \\"domo\\" means, \\"Thank you very much.\\" If you walk around in Japan saying, \\"domo\\" to people you don't know you will be viewed as incredibly rude. \\"Domo\\" is a, \\"thanks\\" to be used among friends only and in no context does it mean, \\"thank you very much.\\" The book is poorly laid out and does not make a great deal of sense. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it has a few decent pointers on etiquette. Get it from a library if you can but DO NOT buy this. For those of you expecting to speak conversational Japanese in 7 days as the title suggests, it won't happen. The title is as such because the book is meant to be read over 7 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"I only wish I could give this book 0 stars...because it doesn't deserve the 1 it is getting...but here goes!All I learned in 7 days was what a waste of money this book/tape set was! This book, along with the cassette tapes, are absolutely horrible. The book does not follow what is on the tapes, and the tapes do not follow the book. There are sentences on the tapes that are not in the book, and vice-versa. Also, half of the important stuff in the book is not covered at all on the tapes, making the whole set utterly useless.If you take the money you would spend on this book and burn it in your fireplace, then take the ashes and flush them down your toilet...you still would have used your cash more wisely than purchasing this worthless piece of garbage!If you are intent on learning Japanese...try \\"Learn In Your Car Japanese\\" by Henry N.

You can't possibly learn the book's contents in 7 days. And even if you could it wouldn't help much - too narrow, too little vocabulary, not enough grammar. Cute photos, though.

It is little more than a crippled Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, a couple of third party game development tools and a book full of game developers' anecdotes. It's a joke.Worse, the C++ documentation is in PDF(hard on the eyes) and VC++ is already difficult for a newbie.

The one program, Genesis 3D, can be downloaded for free at genesis3d.com, and the book tells you nothing accept a few interviews with publishers. The documentation is just short c++ references to the source code in the engine which you wouldn't be able to understand without an extensive knowledge of c++ much less know how to use it to make a game. It doesn't come with a 3-d modeler, which you need, just an animator which I believe you can also get for free.

Great???. However, the version you get, is an absolutely useless shareware version, and after checking out the rest of the stuff included, i was even more dissapointed. The version of C++ is a \\"working model\\" edition, so you cannot redistribute your files, and the Gensesis 3d engine is open source, and available for free, and you can get the latest version aswell.

I use VC++ 4 now for DirectX games -- though the documentation is complicated for even advanced programmers, and didn't help any. To beginners reading this, learn programming first (takes about 1 year), then get Andre Lamonthe's DirectX books. It may take 2 years before you create the simplest Atari-like game, there's so much involved. The very minimal DX game is 3,000+ lines of complex code.

On this it is Leonard Maltin whose head and moving mouth comprise about 1/4 to 1/3 of the one hour. Seeing Mr. Durante's wife and daughter speak today is fine. They were there. Maltin was not and while a Maltin DVD can include his opinions and insight, he does not belong here.

The photos are great,gives superb guidance and ideas to pursue and really is a must for anyone building a stroker. Some of the detail can be a bit light if you are the type that really wants to know everything, but I think for 90% of readers like me its excellent and you won't regret the purchase price.

The information on the ancient battles is great and the narrator Matthew Settle (Band of Brothers) is fine but the computer graphics to detail the battles is dull and repetitive.

Sure it had alot of pretty scenary and Depardieu is a handsome leading man and a good actor.But everyone in this movie was sullen and/or morose in almost every scene throughout the entire movie. (They all could have used megadoses of Prozac to boost their spirits for sure!)And when the brother and his continually whining half-sister have explicit sex, it made me feel uncomfortable and repelled rather than conveying any kind of sensuality or tenderness.Sitting through Pola X was like attending a very long, depressing funeral on a dismal, rainy day.

If this is the best the French can come up with, they're in sad shape. Complete Jabberwocky, the plot makes no sense whatsoever, the acting is leaden, depressing, joyless, and pitiful, perhaps because they didn't have anything even relating to a real movie script to work from. What the hell were the producers thinking when they allowed this thing to be filmed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete mess","review":"Pola X is beautifully filmed and well made, but that's about it. You don't feel anything for the characters, no matter how good the actors are and no matter how hard the director tries to get the viewer involved. This movie is a complete mess and even that explicit love scene can't make up for it. Pass this one by!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"That's the first thing that popped into my head after I saw this riveting French film: \\"Wow!\\" Everything about this film is of the first rank: acting, directing, writing. I think some viewers had problems with Pierre abruptly leaving his family and friends without an explanation for his mysterious behavior. Why didn't he ask his mother for the truth about his half sister--if she was in fact his half sister? I don't think it mattered to him if she was his half sister or not--I think he saw her as his ticket out of his comfortable and dull life. What I liked about the film was how it played with the concept of reality and fantasy. What may be real to a writer may be fantasy to a reader. Hence, that's probably the reason why no one believed that Pierre actually wrote his first bestselling novel. This film takes chances and will stimulate or offend some people--but isn't that what great films usually do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A musician without peer","review":"It is sad, but in a way fitting, that this album about \\"love and death\\" (according to Chris) will be known as the final album of this musical genius.

I am very open to the mysteries of the world and all of the possible origens. However, I was disappointed with this book. There was very little original/psychic information. Instead, there were a lot of common known background facts, references to websites such as www.mysteriesoftheworld.com, and self-promoting statements like \\"my psychic abilities confirm this information\\".Looking at amazon's ratings, I am doubtful of all the higher ratings given to this book. Amazon's ratings tend to be pretty much on target. Maybe Sylvia's huge church/corporation/followers are promoting this book. Also, it looked like ALL of Sylvia's books were highly rated on Amazon. Certainly, every author would have fluctuations on which books were better than others. I would recommend- check out the above mentioned web site. You won't miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack of all and master of none.","review":"This book summarize almost all well known mysteries.

The only reason I give it 2 stars is because SOME of the information was interesting, however I could have found most of it online! In fact she refers to websites throughout the book. I thought the book would contain more psychic information than it did---just a few tid bits from Francine. It seems as though she compiled some data from online and wrote the book on one of her flights. I'm sure she did more research than that, but the book just reads like it was thrown together in a rush.

Those with closed minds will be disenchanted with this book, and perhaps even angry, but if you prefer discovery over censure you'll love this journey.Though I must confess I wasn't convinced of everything written on the pages, I did feel enlightened to new experiences and possibilities. I hadn't heard of 'Tulpas' or 'Chupacabras', for example. I also found the historic roots of many legends, rituals, and religious beliefs significant reasons for all of us to dig deeper. It wouldn't be the first time research has been flawed and I felt I learned something.Slyvia is gifted, of that I'm completely convinced.

That is how all anthropologists will feel about this book. Anthropology is not for anybody's \\"witness.\\" It is to witness the diversity of culture and religion itself. Anthropology is not designed or intended to impose one culture or religion on another. In fact, that is the very opposite and antithesis of anthropology. Anthropology is a science and a method for understanding and valuing other cultures on their own terms, not \\"witnessing\\" your own culture to them.

This is the single/william orbit mix of the song and my personal favorite. Bono sounds great - in fact I don't think he's sounded this good since Pop. The 2 remixes of \\"New York\\" are good selections for the b-sides. The \\"Nice\\" mix is a slight reworking of the song (more of Edge's funky guitar) and the \\"nasty\\" mix is a techno, funk, and trip-hop explosion.

I am from Michigan and really to tell you the truth after certain things that I have seen in my life or heard, a few murders in Ypsilanti do not bother me that much. It might because I read it after the WTC attack. A few lives seem insignificant compare to the thousands that were lost. So really this book lost a lot of effect that it should have had on me. I also heard about these incidents a long time ago but when I read the book it seemed kind of boring and almost as if it went into too much detail for my taste.

I was a bit annoyed bythe manner in which the author generalised the behaviour of unconcious beings and systems as an description of the behaviour of concious individuals (humans). If the book was billed as a catalog of theories and observations (made by others) of nature and history it might be worth something for its reference section (which is gigantic), except there is not much order in the catalog. For a more rational understanding history and humanity, I would read Ayn Rand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Sociological Pseudoscience","review":"Typical sociological pseudoscience. Bloom mocks physicians and scientists unless it promotes his own agendas, atheism,and evolution. He stands by Alexander the Great's massacres as fact, but the resurrection and deity of Christ a figment of the imagination. Another atheist who hates God and his laws. Note there aren't books proclaiming Santa Claus as imagined, because it doesn't stir up the feelings of hatred that God does. If He truly doesn't exist why write about it, why not treat Him like the Easter Bunny. The truth is they do on some level believe, and the hatred comes pouring out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lucifer Principle","review":"If there ever was a book that explained the forces which govern society's behavior in understandable terms, this was it - and written in a way that makes the book hard to leave for a minute.

The arguments employed are artificial and pseudo-scientific, but what can one expect from a writer who lists among achievements management of Kiss rockstar Gene Simmons. In targetting certain cultures, especially the Arab-islamic one, the author reveals his own ethnic bias. Bloom adresses himself to the average American, the best and most innocent of people of course, but therefore also gullible and easily misled, so they are warned that they must have no mercy in dealing with these evil peoples. In Abu Ghraib prison we see that this advice did not fall on deaf ears. There we have Blooms proof of the innocence of the Americans and their determination eradicate evil people. In sum, avoid this piece of hate literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"Interesting concept mired by poor writing.

Split brain reality within an individual introduces massive errors in perception due to the fissure curve created by only having dual sensory input, hence one author will be slightly cynical and another slightly enthuisatic. Even abnormal Einstenian fissures grant no more than slightly increased dual or relatively true perceptions.Global realites contain more accuracy than any other perception, and so memetics should be a triumph of realization, but then my brain would think this would'nt it ?Memetics is far to cynical. All human knowledge is fragmented into opposites, but if you look at non human things and see and feel about that rather than use your higher cortex, the individual truth will be great indeed.What am I saying..dont be scared by what these people say. The true nature of things can never be known by any human.Submit yourself to global perceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-scientific collection of mildly interesting opinions","review":"Pretty well-writen assortment of opinons, based upon what seems to be a pretty large base of written material. However, this book is definitely NOT what it seems by reading the back of it: this is Bloom's version of reality. He cannot prove any of it, nor, it seems, does he really want to take the time to do so. This book is an interesting read for people who are entertained by opinions of fellow amateur non-academic (or even anti-academic) intellectuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most amazing psychology book I've ever read","review":"This book is so beautifully written and thought-provoking.

Of about 250 pages, over 35 contain misinformed expressions of his loathing for Islam and Muslims.The excerpts from the Quran that he chose to illustrate his ideas are partial and thus grossly distorted. His charcterizations of Islam and Muslims are about as accurate as a bigot saying \\"Catholics eat human flesh and drink human blood\\" or \\"Jews sacrifice Christian children\\".Except his target is Islam.His arguments appear to be delibrately distorted but they would sound convincing to those who do not know any better about Islam or Muslims.There is so much bigotry and so many misleading statements about Islam and Muslims that it hard to consider the rest of the material with any respect or objectivity.This book sits proudly with the \\"..The Elders of Zion\\" type of \\"literature\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mish mash","review":"This book is a catalogue of poor research and contrived logic.

The extensive reference list provides the appearance of scholarship and comprehensiveness, but the reader should be aware that this is illusory at best. If you are a nascent social Darwinist looking for rhetoric with which to back up your arguments, this may be the book for you. But if you want to learn something about evolution and the modern mind, seek out the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at UC Santa Barbara, and read Richard Dawkins, David Buss, Steven Pinker, and Robert Wright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staring A Killer In the Eye","review":"The Lucifer Principle is a courageous work. It brings to the forefront a reality that most of us chose to ignore: behind costumes of civility, human beings are barbarians. It would be easy to take this work as pessimistic indictment of the human race, but it's more of a challenge. Bloom illustrates the fallacies we incorporate into our logic as means to justify the annihilation of people outside of our social groups. Now that these forms of trickery have been identified we can began eliminating them from our collective psyche. The Lucifer Principle is a loud and convincing cry against complacency; otherwise the highest ideals of civilization will be trampled into obscurity by those on the war path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Royal Family Soap Opera","review":"This alternative history mystery is as charming as page turning.

Someone is killing courtiers and knows a long hidden royal secret. The tale, told by the kings' daughter, is a clever story of celebrity. love, and danger. This is thorougly recommended. It is followed by a sequeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Racism","review":"Dickinson engages in gratuitous racism to make the employees of the British Royal Family sound as though they were still in the 1920s or 1930s. Since the book was written in 1976 and takes place in that time period, there is no cause to use the N-word. I dislike the casual racism of British authors, but it is particularly bad when someone like Dickinson does it to show off. I am assuming that the fact that he grew up in Zimbabwe has nothing to do with this. I am disappointed in Felony and Mayhem, whose republishing I like, put up with this.

I'm with the people who criticized her voice as annoying and monotone, and the \\"Sat nam, sat nam, sat nam\\" really got on my nerves. I would not recommend this to anyone. ... I could have gotten a Kundalini instructor who knew how to speak English correctly! I guess I have just gotten very, very picky about what I spend my money on, and when I buy a professionally done instructional video, I expect to be instructed by someone who can speak properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really annoying instructor and difficult workout","review":"I found the instructor incredibly annoying and kept wishing she would stop talking. I found her \\"affirmations\\" inane and repetitive, with not enough instruction on the techniques. She starts with a backbend pose, in the midst of which she stops and explains in detail how to do breath of fire! In all my classes we have started out with less strenuous stretching positions. I also didn't feel the workout flowed well from one position to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent workout, weird energy","review":"While this kundalini workout is somewhat challenging, the teacher gives off a weird Branch Davidian-like energy which makes following her instructions a little uncomfortable. She takes the workout SO seriously, never once cracks a smile or says anything remotely light hearted or humorous. She almost seems bitter. In short, this tape isn't nearly as much fun as the kundalini tape by Gurmukh, who emits warmth, strength and wisdom throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Challenging but disorganized...?","review":"I found the actual poses to be good, difficult Kundalini practice though perhaps a bit disorganized.

I was fortunate enough to take classes with Carol in NYC before she moved to the wilds of northern Minnesota (my wife and I were really bummed). She and Ravi Singh were the best teachers we ever had (I own a bunch of Ravi's discs too but Carol's is my overall favorite). You don't have to be terribly experienced at yoga to enjoy this set, though it helps to be in reasonably good shape.

However, if you prefer a more regimented or athletic style, this one is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a treasure!","review":"This is beautiful, energizing and centering yoga. The benefits include a real work-out integrated with deep relaxation and meditation. It leaves you with an afterglow of tranquility, energy and vitality. Although I have invested in plenty of other yoga DVDs, I find that I keep coming back to this one time and again, as it feels like deep nourishment on both a physical and spiritual level. I highly recommend it to all. Many heartfelt thanks to Carol, for creating such a deeply moving program, and then sharing it with the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A hideous disappointment","review":"An insutlingly bad tape that is neither a good workout nor appealing introduction to the world of kundalini. Instructure Carol Carlson is so montoned and personality-free, that you have to wonder whether the kundalini has whipped right up her spine and left her brain damaged. Production values here are nil-shot against a white background, they actually use freeze-frame when Carol's resting or meditating (if only I could sit so still). \\"Sat-nam, sat-nam, sat-nam,\\" she repeats again and again in her passionless, nasal midwestern drone. It's a bizarre, bumpy ride. Furthermore, the workout comes with practically no instruction-which would seem to be crucial given the potentially life-shaking nature of kundalini yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be using this","review":"I found this DVD boring and the instructor had a strange attitude. She never smiled or had anything pleasant to say. The kriyas were rather advanced and she used the breath of fire too much.

In my quest to learn more about Kundalini Yoga I ordered this Carol Carlson video. After no more than 10 minutes into this tape I had to turn it off. What is she thinking to do a backbend with breath of fire as her first asana, with no options for modifications for beginners or people with shoulder, wrist or back issues....and even for advanced students no warm up??? I could not go on I was so annoyed at her. I found her tone condecending and annoying. Yoga students seeking an energizing, revitalizing, life changing experience should try Gurmukh or Ravi Singh, both instructors present the practice from a place of love and healing, yet the work outs are physically challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money....","review":"I am not a certified Kundalini yoga instructor, but I do have classes with friends and co-workers. Occasionally we do our class with Gurmukh's video... a wonderful experience -- very uplifting -- she is such a gentle soul. One day, someone brought in Carol Carlson's video and we decided to give it a try. Not only did every one of us find her hard to follow... but we also felt she was very annoying and rather condescending. It did not feel like a Kundalini yoga class at all... not one that we are used to anyway. We have not watched the video since... no one even wants it. If you are looking for a great Kundalini yoga tape, buy Gurmukh's. If you already have Gurmukh's, then try one of the Kundalini yoga websites and try someone else's. Even buying a Kundalini yoga book and going through the sets on your own is better than doing it with this. Honestly.. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"kundalini yoga with grace&strength","review":"i was very dissappointed with this video because for being a yoga teacher for over a decade she starts off without any warmup in addition she went straight to a very difficult pose.

The routine is at once strenuous, productive and soothing to the mind, body and spirit. Beginners can do this workout as long as they keep in mind that they are to only go as deep into the postures as they can; which I believe Ms. Carlson adequately emphasizes throughout the tape. The video production itself was obviously low-budget, but if you're doing the workout to get a good Yoga workout and not necessarily to be entertained by high-priced sets and Hollywood-bound demonstrators, it's worth every penny of this less expensive tape. Of all my Yoga tapes this is the one I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"The item is very good, just that the presentation si different from the showing pic, and the texture is diferent that the tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product I have used for years","review":"If you are looking for a good product at a great price, this is it.

There is little to no vanilla flavor,, it is overpowered by the vegetable flavor. The product does not have \\"soy\\" in the name, rather it is a whole food energizer ultra shake vanilla flavor\\" with a small box at the top that says \\" soy protein\\".If you are looking for a vegetable based shake with vegetable flavor (and by the way, when mixed turns into a green shake that I could not drink from a clear glass due to the color) you may be happy with this shake.

Like Madeleine L'Engle, a favorite among novelists for me, she has no ties to the Christianity that identifies itself with conservative political and social beliefs. Her life story includes alcoholism, battles with a co-dependent mother, single motherhood entered into by choice, and a passion for causes. In this volume of essays, she draws the reader into that life. She writes with grace, beauty, immediacy, and dark humor, and she kept me turning pages longer than planned each time I picked this book up.My one negative comment is that despite agreeing with her about it, I became quite tired of hearing about the Bush administration. Otherwise, a good read by an author whose other work may well interest me!--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of \\"Love, Jimmy: A Maine Veteran's Longest Battle\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Kind of Christian","review":"Oh, what can I say about dear, dear Anne? I could read her essays all day long, allow her humor, language, and insight to immerse me, flow over me. For readers, especially Christians, whom find Anne offensive, I say to them: Too bad! It's her honesty, authentic self, and even her deep flaws, which make people like me love her more. You'll find no hypocrisy here! Anne says it how it really is.\\"Grace, Eventually\\" is a book of essays...some humorous, others heartbreaking, insightful, delightful, delicious, and never boring. And Anne always talks about motherhood, which cracks me up. More than anything, one will read, \\"Grace, Eventually,\\" and exclaim, \\"Yea, this is me. I feel like this. I related to that. And God loves me anyhow.\\" This is the way Anne Lamotte writes. And I adore her for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rant and rant and rant","review":"I loved Traveling Mercies as it was autobiographical, funny and inspiring. This book is a series of essays mostly putting down conservatives, Christian or otherwise. The author admitted raging on about the benefits of abortion to a group of Catholics not knowing who her audience was. That's flunking presentation skills 101. And Christianity 101. Remember: Thy Shall Not Kill? Why did she need all those abortions anyway? Unprotected sex, while on mind altering substances with men unsuitable to parent. Not a bit of self scrutiny for her actions here. Where's the interest in that?She repeats herself several times, especially in putting down the Bush administration and goes on and on.

This book however is a thinly veiled diatribe to show her journey of moral superiority over George Bush... I got sick of the Bush bashing some of which is woefully mis-informed pulled thru the grid system of her extreme liberal bias... The title of \\"Grace...\\" in my 35,000 foot view of this book was a thin veil to show that she indeed has an inner struggle of adjustment to vicissitudes of life (don't we all) but in the end she may be maladjusted, but she's vastly morally superior to George Bush, Dick Cheney & Rumsfeld... I'd start to enjoy the book then she'd have to put Bush back under her foot again... it fankly got sickening... It should be called; \\"The Zen art of self disclosure and how to feel superior while bashing Bush!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahem...","review":"This is the first and will be the last book I have read by Anne Lamott. I expected a book on faith. I found less faith and more of a diatribe against George W. Bush. I wonder if I had the manuscript if I would find the word faith as often as George W. Bush. Needless to say, I was disapppointed. She may have some valuable lessons to teach, and I did glean some good information from her, but I couldn't get past that she really was on a rant, and to me, that has nothing to do with faith of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many lefty rants and too few thoughts on faith","review":"I adore \\"Travelling Mercies.\\" Having spent some time as a Christian, I expected some mature Christian thought from Lamott. Instead, I'm kind of horrified. Jesus was awful as a teenager? Praying to Mary? Yay for abortion? What Bible is Lamott reading?I admire Lamott's raw honesty and the way she turns a phrase, but the \\"I hate George Bush\\" rants got really old. I may not agree with our President's decisions and I may not admire him as a person, but a certain amount of respect is due to the office of the President of the United States. It's one of the most difficult jobs in the world.After reading Lamott's last three non-fiction books, I get the idea that Lamott doesn't have anything new to say. Although she occasionally has wonderful insights, I won't be buying Lamott's books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne's Downfall","review":"I loved Anne's books, Traveling Mercies and Plan B - she spoke of faith in the most refreshing of ways and injected her own socio-political leanings and life in a healthy and relevant way. But Grace (Eventually) is a disappointment because here she presses a no-holds agenda as she uses her 'pulpit' to beat her political and religious prejudices into people.Her angst demolished any sense of the Grace she apparently attempted to address. And unless she gets back into the groove she was in before, this will mark her downfall for speaking things spiritual, Christian or otherwise. She is a great, great author - but if she can't speak handle political differences within the same faith, then she is as guilty as those she condemns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"I Hate Bush and Other Thoughts\\"","review":"For someone who seems to be very perceptive on human relations and seems to have a very close relationship with Jesus, this woman has a disproportionate and illogical hatred of Bush. Perhaps this comes from only having friends that think as she does. When she is writing about her son and her relatives, she is very good but the passages and one-liners about her Bush hatred are hard to get through. I suppose this sort of writing isi a hoot to her Salon readers but it will date the book quickly. When she writes about abortion she is doctrinaire and pedestrian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold leftovers","review":"I had enjoyed Lamott's previous non-fiction books so thoroughly that I was genuinely excited to read this one. However, I was sorely disappointed in the general lack of creativity, wit and spark that so animated her other work. The chapters seemed derivative of her previous books on spirituality, and might easily have been leftovers or rejected portions of those works.I am pleased by her well-deserved success, but can't help but feel that she just phoned this one in for the advance and lecture tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound. Clumsy. Unvarnished. Helpful.","review":"While there were a few pieces in the collection that felt like rambling blogs entries rather than polished thoughtful messages, this is a wonderful book. Wonderful as much for its imperfection as its insight.It is personal but not just for the writer. Somehow Lamott manages in this collection to create a sense of it being personal for the reader, as if that reader could have written this too --if only she were as witty and aware and spiritually open as Lamott has been and then brave enough to not just write it but then not hit the delete button.It gave me something -- a sense of peace and wellbeing -- and it helped me help someone. That made my life and someone else's better. I don't think you can ask much more of a book than that. Cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasionally Christian","review":"It's difficult sometimes to find the Christianity in this book, where Lamott suggests (imagines?) that Jesus was awful as a teenager, that abortion isn't really all that bad, and that we should pray to Mary. I wonder where those ideas are justified in the Bible.And Lamott's frequent rants about Bush-Cheney were also a distraction.Lamott's simplistic theology says everyone is free to find their own path. How New Age! But Jesus is not just Savior, He is also Lord, and His requirements are more demanding than Lamott allows for.Lamott says, \\"There is not much truth being told in the world.\\" Exactly. Being truthful is important. And one truth that should be acknowledged is that being Christian isn't some touchy-feely exercise in spiritual superficiality.Lamott's book of essays was superficially entertaining in many places, but disappoints on a deeper level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you'd expect...","review":"I am enjoying this book and think the author offers a lot of depth yet very different than the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I read a lot of Anne Lamott in college and anticipated a good read. I would not bother with another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is about the author, not about God's Grace","review":"I picked the book up at a used book sale because of the title, I thought it was a book about Grace.

He proceeds to answer it with a series of interesting interviews and portraits from around the country: with leaders on Capitol Hill, with governors and would-be governors (his interview with Giuliani makes one wish he were still in the race), with academics, with ordinary folk. Although the questions Robinson poses are serious -- why are men more likely than women to vote Republican -- and although the answers he gives often insightful -- his tone is consistently light and often laugh-out-loud funny. In short, this is a book that one can take to the beach, or indeed anywhere, read relatively quickly, and yet learn something about the GOP, and indeed America. A great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed down not as funny as P J O'Rourke","review":"Author has good credentials but a silly irritating style.

The blue one (which came with a set I received with various size bottles) was okay, but when I ordered two more, the nipple top seems to be much harder and leaks constantly.

I then switched out the spout for a 6+ month spout and suddenly the leaking completely stopped. If you use the hard spout that comes with the cup, you will have mega leaking like another reviewer stated. If you buy the soft spout, however, you will have absolutely no problems at all with this cup. Definitely a must have for any toddler. My 13 month old cannot live without this cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of both worlds","review":"How is it possible that this sippy cup leaks so badly, while at the same time is too difficult for my 1-YO to suck liquid out of? I'm sick of her frustration at not being able to drink her milk out of this thing, and sick of getting sticky drips all over the place! It's just as bad with or without the handles under the lid.

I just threw it into the trash, because that's what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS LIKE CRAZY","review":"There are several reviews to the contrary, but I bought two of these cups and they LEAK.

I appreciate that it's BPA free, though it would be better if it were phthalate free too. My real issue if that it's ridiculous to charge so much money for such a poorly designed product.My son just used this again (because all the other cups were dirty) and there were pools of milk all over his high chair tray within 1-2 minutes. This happens every time and so I rarely use the cup, but I've decided to throw it away now -- which doesn't seem all that environmentally friendly -- but frankly I don't have a lot of extra time for the extra mess this cup makes.I hope this review stops someone else from making the mistake of buying this cup--and maybe the company will improve their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This leaks through the top. Not usable.","review":"I should've just returned this, but I tossed the packaging. I have the Born Free bottles and love them so was expecting the same quality.

The handle isn't fix -- it rotates all over the place making it tough for the baby to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"They will leak eventually","review":"The reviewers that say these cups don't leak must have left their review within a few days of recieving the cups. At first they are fine, but after a few weeks they will leak and leak a lot. I would have given this review 3 stars because they are nice cups, but after talking with someone in customer service they are lucky to get 2 stars. The woman from CS said they are suppose to leak and they make no statement about them being leak proof. Only that they are leak reistant, and that is when you put the cap on. I hate misleading advertisements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise!","review":"I bought these cups awhile ago and am trying to get my boys off their bottles. Today, they actually drank from them and thought, oh great, then the leakage started. I have no idea how they leak through the cap and cup, not from the \\"nipple\\". They have never been on the dishwasher, so the fit should be perfect. I had 2 trails of milk to the kitchen, 1 soaked shirt and a puddle on the rug. Not pleased!! It had such potential!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"We've gotten great use out of this trainer cup until my son hit about 20 months.

Even the nutritionist we saw liked it because, she said it wouldn't mess up their teeth and it flowed easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks A lot","review":"I purchased two of these cup at a store for my Twin boys. At first They could not drink out of them. It was to hard. They were about 9 months old. Once they turned a year old they could drink out of it just fine. About Two months of being able to use them they began to leak a lot. If it ever gets put down on its side it leaves a big puddle. We spent a lot of money on these cups...

I'll try these with our next but I don't have lots of hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally off bottles!","review":"This cup is GREAT. We tried MANY brands and this is the only one my daughter likes. The opening to spout was a little small, just cut and made slit a little wider to make it easier on her otherwise - great cup! And most importantly - she's off the bottle - yay! I'm buying another one for use at daycare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this cup!","review":"I love this cup! The handles made it easy for my son to hold by himself. I couldn't get him to switch to any other sippy cup after the bottle. I had a bunch of cheap/free sippy cups but he wouldn't use any of them. Most of them required too much sucking or had a difficult mechanism. I had a little sticker shock at first. This cup is a lot more expensive than others but when you are trying to transition from bottle to cup and this one works, who cares! The opening at the top was also too small and he couldn't get enough milk but I just cut the hole a little bigger and it works great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for transitioning to a cup","review":"This cup was great for making the transition while weaning. I already had a couple of other brands of cups but I could not get my then 12 month old to do more than sip from them. He needed to be adding several ounces of whole milk a day ... we tried this cup and the spout was a winner for him. The spout is soft and has a great shape, easy to suck from. The rounded handles make it easy for holding. He used the Born Free cup constantly for nearly two months, while getting used to other cups as well. However, the complaints about leaking and the handles spinning do occur over time. By teething on the spout it now leaks. Just one time of forgetting to put the valve in before tightening the lid down over the handle will cause pressure breaks on the neck of the handle, thus producing spinning. However I have yet to find a perfect cup and the Born Free was wonderful for us while making the transition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cup for my son!","review":"My 10 month old wouldn't drink from any sippy cups -- until I tried the BornFree training cup == it's the only one he will actually drink from (and not play with!!!) I now substitute 2 bottles a day with these cups so the transition off the bottle will be much easier when he's a year!! Yes they are expensive but if it makes transitioning easier -- I'll spend anything after what a tough time I went through with my first son!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - they leak!","review":"First I tried the Born Free toddler cup, which was a leak disaster. But I held out hope wanting a BPA free sippy cup that didn't leak. I shelled out $50 for a set of these trainers and after a few chews on the spouts and a fews times through the dishwasher - they leak. My kids fall asleep with bottles, they go in my purse, and various other precarious situations. Disaster at each turn. Save your money and get the colored Advent sippies or the Playtex BPA free ones. They defintely don't leak for at least the first 6-9 months and you can get them at the grocery store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a great \\"sippy\\"","review":"I have used Born Free bottles for my son since he was born and loved them. I don't love this product. It has been very difficult for my son to get much liquid out of it. I find the nipple to be pretty wide. Plus, our pediatrician has noted that this kind of nipple is not really that great, it makes a baby have to transition AGAIN to a cup that doesn't require sucking. I am definitely purchasing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many parts!! Not practical","review":"I bought this for my 6 month old daughter who is already successfully using the Thinkbaby sippy. Upon opening the package I was mortified to count 7 parts. Yes, I kid you not, this sippy has 7 pieces! I put it back in the box and will be returning it next week. It is not practical to have a sippy with even more parts than the most complicated bottle. This is not a sippy for mother's who are short on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommend this bottle","review":"You have to bite the tip to get the water out. For a baby who just graduates from bottles, they suck the tip the same way as they suck the nipples- They won't bite it. So it is impossible for a baby to get water from it. My daughter is 18 months when I got this for her, and she never get any water out of it. It is a major design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks","review":"I was very disappointed to spend so much money for this cup and then have it leak all over. The spout has a hole in it (not a slit as other soft spouts) and as soon as it is tipped to the side it steadily drips out. And babies like to shake things--this makes a big mess! I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Handles / Hard For Baby","review":"Having come from the Avent system on kid #1, we rolled on over to Born Free this time around. While the bottles themselves were fine, these sippy cups are terrible. First, the handles are very hard to grasp. They're too small and in a weird shape. Second, its impossible to drink out of. Me, the wife, the baby, the 2 year old... we all failed to get more than the smallest drop out of it. Not to mention, after several months, you do get tired of all the parts just for a sippy cup. We switched the baby to a Playtex one, and he grabbed on right away, and took a good sip out. As an aside, we switched bottles to simplify now that he's past the colic stage and he drinks 3x faster with no throwing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"we're finally off bottles","review":"My daughter really likes this sippy cup. We let her use bottles for a long time and this helped us break that habit. It also doesn't leak, which I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAK!","review":"Yes, I bought the training cups and not the drinking cups. I have correctly fitted all parts together and these cups still leak! I must be looking for an elusive cup that doesn't seem to exist. A sippy cup that won't leak milk onto my carpet. If your child drops his/her sippy cup the contents will dripple onto your floor--if you're okay with this then by all means buy these. I hated them. I cannot chase my daughter around with a carpet cleaner everytime she drinks from her cup. Yes, I have also just made her sit at her high chair and drink it but at the end of the meal there was more milk on the floor and high chair than in her mouth. Waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless sippy cup.","review":"In a hunt to replace our years-old Gerber cups (with the valve that pops out at the slightest bump), we thought we'd give this one a try. Don't make the same mistake we did. One piece of advice is to try this cup first before giving it to your child (my older kids think it's hysterical to see mom & dad drinking out of a sippy cup!). I almost gave myself a hernia trying to get water out of this thing. And then, to add insult to injury, when I put it down, it leaks out of the bottom of the cap area. This would seem to indicate a backwards seal is forming.If I wasn't busy shopping for a new cup while entertaining my little ones, I'd consider creating a video review to show just how ridiculous this thing is.Based on the positive reviews I see here, I can only conclude that either the company's quality control is non-existent or... all the positive reviews have been left by company employees!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't have US measurements.","review":"I have been using Born Free bottles since my son was born. I love them, and now I purchased a couple of the trainer cups for him so start transitioning. The one disappointment that I have is that the measurements along the side are not like the ones on the bottles. They only have UK ounces (although it just says \\"fl oz\\" and doesn't indicate which standard it is, but I compared to the measurements on the bottles, and it's clearly the UK version), and mL measurements, and no US fluid ounces. Not a huge issue, as the difference is pretty minimal.Also, I now have a green and PINK trainer cup for my son. That is just a bummer of the ordering system that Amazon has. So if you are buying for specific gender, just beware that you might not get the \\"appropriate color\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to get fluid out","review":"This spout was extremely hard for me to sip any liquid out of so I didn't even try it with my 6 month old baby.

I sucked so hard that my jaw and ears got sore.I wonder how can little babies drink from it without having their muscles getting sore themselves.

It did take 36 hours to complete the first full charge but then it holds that charge for a very long time. They suggest that you plug it in to maintain the charge every three months if it hasn't been used just to keep the internal battery in top condition or after each use to top off for the next time you may need it. Some writers have mentioned that the cooling fan is loud, they must have very sensitive hearing because I had to be right next to it to hear it. You will need a simple plug in extension cord to charge it since it does not come with one.I recommend the Schumacher PSJ-2212 DSR ProSeries 2200 Jump Starter to anyone who needs to jump start their car, boat or \\"be a good neighbor\\" for those @#%## times."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, So good...","review":"I live in Minnesota (Brrrrr...) and only drive my V-6 Ranger about twice a week. During the winter it is often a constant battle with keeping my battery charged enough to start when it is very cold. I ordered this item a couple of days after trying to start my truck. A couple of days before I received the charger, I tried once again to start it. Didn't even get a 'clicking sound'. So it sat there while waiting for it to be delivered.I followed the instructions that came with the charger, and let it charge for about 18 hours. (I believe they suggested a min. of 8) Went out the next day and hooked it up...and it started my truck on the very first try! If this charger lasts me a few years, I would say this is some of the best money I have ever spent. Time will tell however, but for now I am indeed very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold the initial charge","review":"I received the unit and immediately followed the charging directions.

It's completely useless without it. Not only that, but the type of socket that would fit the unit (it has a two-prong male receptor recessed into a narrowly fitted alcove) would have to be a VERY streamlined female receptor the likes of which I have never come across in a hardware store.This is completely obnoxious.

Do not read it because you will waste your time. Neil Snyder offers this as a \\"management tool\\" for all times, but what it effectively does is rehash better books by better authors on the same subject. Other books in the bibliography will give the reader insight into the issues that Snyder tries to tackle but cannot for he has rather monstrous biases that infect his work and call into question the work's accuracy. At best, the book is a summary of better books by different authors. The work lacks a delicate understanding of the business issues at hand. If you wish to read it, save your money and check it out at a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD BOOK -- STICK WITH COVEY","review":"Unfortunately, this book fails its reader on many, many issues. It reads a little too much like a kids work, with a small summary at the end of each chapter titled \\"Moving On\\" where the book provides the reader with an unenlightening preview of the next chapter of the book. On the whole. it's redundant, superficial at best, and supremely vague. Your best bet as a consumer is to find better books on the same subject, or simply peruse a copy of this book for its bibliography. All in all, not worth it. Stephen Covey's works are far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BOOK THAT FAILS THE READER AND DOESNT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE","review":"Apart from its title, the book itself superficially describes certain important issues in the work place. It merits attention for its \\"timeliness\\" but fails in its \\"prescriptions\\" for success in the upcoming millenium. Business per say is much more complicated than the book defines it to be, and improvement within the workplace depends on many other factors that the book at best alludes to. All in all, it simplifies everything rather than show the specific nuances that exist within the issues. It brashly treats such issues with zero tolerance. As so, this book deceives the reader, a classical work of appearence and reality. It appears to do a good job, but in reality it's just another mediocre book that summarizes the work of better books. Its bibliography, however, is worth a peek. Therein will the reader quench his desire to understand what this book fails to explore well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reason for Tardiness...","review":"I think the De La had some beef with the label under which this cd was released (Tommy Boy).

But I think this book is a very fine account of a very interesting and unusual life, with rich human, commercial, and natural connections, in the \\"one place\\" of Fitzgerald, in central south Georgia.

The cover art is encouraging - someone actually spent money to make would-be viewers believe the movie contained something meaningful. An effective ruse, given I fell for it and wasted 1.5 hours of my life in this meandering mess. Its a microbudget production, not even qualifying for low budget status. That in of itself is not a bad thing, and frankly, most of my favorite movies are low budget. But low budget does not have to mean bad acting, bad talent, poorly framed shots, etc. Worst, it does not necessarily imply a lack of a story. Movies are about visually telling a compelling story. Without a good story, the cinematographic exercise is a waste. And this one was a particular gem of a waste. The story was nonexistent, period. There's not much more I can say. Further, the acting and cinematography certainly did not even come close to distracting me from this glaring absence. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to this video!!","review":"I started doing this video six weeks ago and I love it!!

I tried to cancel within 48 hours of ordering, but it had shipped already, so I figured I could ask them to cancel the order (since it's shipped via UPS, and sometimes UPS does that) and they would just get it back. Not so, so my overpriced stand arrived 2 days earlier than intended, in a GIANT box, and I have no choice but to keep it, because it would cost more to return it (even via regular USPS) than is worth it. I'm going to see if anyone I know needs one next December, because it's a good product, but overpriced from this seller.I'm giving the ITEM 2 stars, but the seller 0, because of the stand being more than I found it for in stores and at tree vendors, and for having a crappy return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Easy, easy, easy.

The characters are fun and inventive, and the land is created with clear imagination and thought. Each page provides readers with magic and mystery, as they unravel the secrets of the Ragwitch's realm, while striving to stop her from her evil intentions.

The group sounds freshly inspired, locked in, yet as loose and free as any great Ornette Coleman or Paul Bley album.There are no standards, no expositions to get to the meat of the matter, there are no traded fours, no redundant II-V-I's; nothing but three seasoned pros, outguessing everyone including themselves and finding some magic telepathy in the process.This is great music, and great music-making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Inside Out Even Further","review":"Inside Out was a breakthrough effort for Keith, Jack and Gary. Moving into a unscripted format refreshes the music in a way that using standards as vehicles for improvisation did not. Jack is clearly the heart of this set. Keith's melodies are familiar to all who have followed his music and they inform this date and his technique and touch remain extraordinary. But it is Jack DeJohnette who pulls this music together and gives it cohesion.The moaning and grunting are a bit distracting but they come with the program. Interestingly, Jarrett is silent on his classical dates.The telepathy that exists among this trio is truly rare. Buy this recording. But even better, check them out when they come to your town. Live, it's even more remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random and Strange","review":"Ok, I'm missing the 'Genius' here. Being a huge KJ fan I find this double CD terribly egotistical and equally unlistenable. I agree 100% with the 1 star review below.Basically what you get is a bunch of random improvisation (the 3 instrumentalists playing 3 different songs at once). There are a few sweets spots when Jarrett decides to stop playing random disonnace but for the most part this is Jazz grandstanding at it's worst. Lack of melody, rythym or coherency. Just ego. Even worse, Jarrett's signature vocal atonal grunts, moans and squeaks are here in full force to detract from what quality Jazz there is. I'll stick with his standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belt works well on Mower","review":"Belt arrived in 3 days time.

Has anyone heard of fair use here? I just want to listen to these songs on my iPOD for darn sake - these discs won't even PLAY on a regular PC. I'm returning these discs to Amazon for an immediate refund - shame on the record industry for coming up with goofy schemes like this that cheat a guy like me from my money. I paid $40 or so for the music guys - can't I use the music on my iPOD or simply listen on my computer? What did I ever do to you people to deserve this?

This is a huge asset, since many history book tend to rush from one subject to another- leaving the reader confused and irritated. So for those who don't like the thought of a dry treatise- don't worry it's very accesible!!!!The author's knowledge is evident, it's written with security and straight-forwardness without unneccesary complications. There's no specific point of view, from which the book is written, so it gives a good, thorough review of this remarkable era in Russian history. Good for non-experts in medieval history- but also nice for historylovers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brass Nozzle","review":"The plastic adjustable nozzle that came with the Solo sprayer works better provides for more consistent droplet size.

You can adjust your spray from a stream to a light mist. I don't use the filter because I use surfactant in with the chemical and it tends to plug up the filter quite fast.

I would definitely recommend buying this nozzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book, wish they'd done a better job with the printing","review":"This is a children's book that has a cute story but is also in large part about it's graphic design (by the famous Saul Bass). Which is why it's such a disappointment that the publisher did not do a better job with the printing. Cheap paper and bad ink - the colors just are not as saturated as what I'm sure Mr. Bass intended. Also, this book will last about 5 minutes in the grubby hands of a child because of the uncoated paper. Good idea, bad execution. Still, I like it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup-it's great","review":"My 2 year old just loves this book, it's her new favorite.

This one isn't as overwhelmingly sweet as some I've had and definitely has its place in my purse, but I would like to find something similar to the sweetness that I like my coffee. :) I still can't bring myself to give it less than 5 stars though because it is probably the best coffee candy I've ever tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee candy!","review":"This is my favorite coffee candy.The quality is good and it is small and low calorie, a little bit expensive here though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive!","review":"The taste of this coffee candy is OK, but it is TOO EXPENSIVE!After I have just purchased a bag of \\"Kopiko Coffee Candy\\" from Amazon recently with a price of $5.49/bag, I found it (exactly the same candy, 5.29 oz bag) from a local Chinese grocery store for only $1.49/bag (5.29.oz).By the way, I like the taste of another coffee candy better: \\"Kasugai Sumiyaki Japanese Roasted Coffee Candy - 3.8 Oz\\".

Some of priddy's books have some obscure pictures that include words and items that you do not run across, like the Trucks/Vehicles. Way too many flavors of tractors there.Some of the pages are more advanced. The birds page has multiple variations on parrots that most adults are not aware exist. Distinguishing between a macaw and another flavor of a parrot is a pretty advanced challenge for a toddler.That said, my toddler enjoys it, and it is a great opportunity for her to work on words and pronounciation, no matter the word. The distinctions between child animals and adult animals will grow with her advanced understanding. I'd recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our 22 month old's current favorites","review":"Our 22 month old daughter loves this book, along with \\"Colors, ABC, Numbers\\" by the same author. The book is large, and filled with colorful pictures of all kinds of animals. There isn't any narrative to read, it's a grid of animals in different categories. Babies (with goslings, kittens, kids, etc), pets (dogs, cats, etc), on the farm (cows, horses, etc), birds, etc, etc, with each page spread representing a different category.The animals are then presented in a grid of squares similar to what you see on the cover photo, with the photo of the animal with the name printed below. That's all there is to the book, but our daughter finds it fascinating to point at each animal, say the names of those she knows and can pronounce, make the noise for the ones she can (and/or get us to make the noise).But when it's reading time, this is always one of the books she brings over. Plus, she'll open it up and read it by herself, as well. Really great book series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprize hit!","review":"I really only got this book as an 'extra' purchase, to qualify for free shipping. However it has become an unexpected hit with my 16 month old who can now identify most of the animals from the pictures, and she will ask for this book over and over and over again.The book includes some rather obscure animals, which probably wouldn't be on my 'introductory list' of animals for a young child. My list would probably run \\"lion, tiger, bear, cat, dog\\" (which are also included)... rather than the \\"gosling, chinchilla, parakeet, egret and kookaburra\\" which you'll also find in this book. My husband and I have both learned a few new animals as well!All in all and great buy that keeps my daughter entertained for hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies to learn!","review":"My son and I love this colorful big book. It looks like an encyclopedia for babies with many animals, birds and fish. The pictures are so bright and so many that it doesn't get boring to look at them and read the names all over again.

Thank you the publisher and seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"big, interesting pictures","review":"My 2 year old son has always liked this book.

The story itself twists and turns with some dead ends and it seems to take forever to get to the conclusion.I didn't think much of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible","review":"To put it simply this book is horrible. It isn't the plot or story. It is the writing. The book is only 285 pages long and cost $10. That is half as long and twice as much as most books I read, and they are a lot better. His writing style leaves something to be desired. With dialogue, it is only \\"said\\". Can't he use other words like \\"respond\\", \\"reply\\", \\"asked\\"? Also, nothing gets any description except for alcoholic drinks and a \\"white bowl with a blue stripe.\\" Who cares if the bowl has a blue stripe?

Parker novels is the witty dialogue between the characters and a strong, unique story line. That element is missing from the new Jess Stone novel and is replaced with the 'f' word (Jess uses the word, Jenn uses the word, they all are engaged in the word and basically is the entire premise of the book) and continuous sexual references. The entire book was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electricity from Boston to Miami","review":"Though not in the top tier of Parker's books, this is an intriguing detective novel. Part of the story is very sad and, unfortunately, may be reflective of some all too common happenings within today's households.

I mean even Nancy Drew books have more of a mystery than this one did.I have always heard good things about the Jesse Stone Novels. This was the first and only one I will read. I don't know if the grammatical errors were the author's fault or the editor's. Even the dialogue between characters didn't even have complete sentences. Very poor sentence structure. I agree with C. Richard's review...\\"Distracting\\" in that there are terrible grammar errors throughout this entire book and was hard to focus.Ths story was contrite and very easy to figure out way before the end of the book who the culprit was. This is the only review I have given that has been a poor one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Parker","review":"This is classic Parker; tight plot, crisp dialogue, light banter, and a character who believes in working on his personal problems and dealing in justice.

However, it is one thing to read \\"Jesse said\\" after every friggin time the character says a line, but to hear it spoken by Scott Sowers' mouth over and over and over and over, it is just too much.

Stone and his ex wife are slight variations on Spenser and Susan. Parker subtly alludes to Spenser during the course of the novel to neatly tie his characters together. Unfortunately, all the characters in this novel are cardboard thin and mostly caricatures that Parker can ridicule. Average at best for this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychobabble....","review":"I have been reading Parker since I discovered Spenser some 20 years ago.As I today, I can officially say that I am dead tired of the constant psychobabble that turns up in the alternating chapters of nearly every one of his books. Did he start the Jesse Stone series just because he had realized he'd worn out the welcome of Susan Silverman and her dreary \\"insights\\" years ago and needed to give us a new shrink?Jesse and his crew are an interesting bunch, written in Parker's classic spare prose style, but the entire divorce/recovering alcoholic subplot bores me silly. I'd much rather have every one of those alternate chapters filled with more characters, more plot and, bottom line, more interesting story development.OK. You get the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"b-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r","review":"This is a very nice book. What makes reading it worthwhile is that the author knows what she's talking about. Anyway it's written in a woman's voice. The book offers a lot: an epic journey and the preservation of a way of life in the Northern Territories of Canada. OK it is plot heavy but the setting is handled with a certainty and an economy that allows one to overlook it when the characters occasionally chew the scenery. I found myself referring to a map to get an idea of where the action takes place. The enormous, frozen emptiness displayed on the map provides a wonderful and deftly applied metaphor for apocalypse. It worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOES NOT Come with a gig bag but","review":"Tuned up well, nice action and just the right size for a 6 year old. It's very cool!

Lasted 30 seconds and resulted in a very sad dog","review":"My dog had received a chicken like this as a gift. She loves it to death, and very near death it is. We decided to get a replacement as the old one (which has lasted about a year) has holes and pieces of stuffing coming out. This one looked very similar (same mold, same paint) to the one we received as a gift so we thought it was the same quality. I took it out of the box, gave it to my dog, and within 30 seconds the chicken was torn in half and all the stuffing was falling out. My dog is a Boston Terrier, so while energetic, it's not like this chicken was mauled by a massive beast. It was very sad when we had to hide the remains from her and put the destroyed chicken in the trash. Not just sad, but tragic in the world of a Boston Terrier. This chicken just isn't pet quality, despite being marketed as a dog toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor chicken","review":"This dog toy lasted about 2 minutes. My Sheltie tore it in half!

I ordered 2 of them and when I got them I opened one up and gave it a try. Needless to say I didn't like the way it made me sound to other people that I was talking to. Every one commented that I sounded like I was in a tube. The sound quality in the ear piece was fine but, because of the mic being designed into the ear piece with unidirectional pick up it makes you sound bad to every one you are talking to.Bottom line: I sent them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I can't give this ZERO stars","review":"This was a terrible headset. The sound coming through the earpiece was terrible and the people I called said it sounded pretty bad coming through to them. I used this for a few calls and then sent it back. I have the cheaper Body Glove Sport headset that is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good ghost stories","review":"This book scared me so much as a little kid that I threw it out. Finlly after many years I have managed to get another copy. The story in there that will really make you wet your bed is called Levitation.

So if you find a copy hold on to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for anyone contemplating adoption","review":"Reading this book was like joining an adoption support group! The author deftly tells the stories of several adoptive parents in different circumstances, describing their joys, frustrations, hopes and fears with such sensitivity that I found I couldn't put the book down. I was also surprised to find that I am now open to other, less-traditional forms of adoption.I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Good for those who have adopted internationally!","review":"The stories were sincere. I was looking for more transracial adoption stories on older child adoption but only found one inside this book. The black children that were adopted were adopted as infants, so it wasn't of much interest to my situation. I found that each parental story was very honest and will help those of you who have adopted internationally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaeahh!","review":"This show is documented proof that some celebrtities need to be ground up into cat food.

It is totally relevant with the present administration and the wars going on. This presents a future that is not too unbelievable. The basic idea is that wars are pretty much staged by corporations in the future (hah- aren't they now?)There are these psychic soldiers with different powers -think X-Men meets Logan's Run. The art is great, and the book is action packed. I can't wait too see what happens in book 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Masher, But...","review":"...Needs to be improved. I was impressed by quality of this masher - length; handle is very comfy. But when it comes to the job, it's hard to push down. I found myself adding second hand for that. That's probably why handle is so long. Perforated holes are too small. My wife insisted to return it. But I fell in love with the design and decided to improve it:I took a peace of 2 x 4, cut a bit edges to fit into the masher, put masher up side down and drilled all existing halls as wide as possible. Then I polished both sides of mashing plate.Now masher does the job much better. If you want to do mashing faster, I'd recommend to start with wire masher and finish with this one for creamy texture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one is hard to fine","review":"Broke my first potato masher six months ago. Got it as a wedding gift 1969. So went looking for a new one. Could not find one in the stores with a long handle. So I bought one that had a very short handle. After using it twice, I went looking for another new one. Found the CHANTAL KT-13 STAINLESS-STEEL 13-INCH POTATO MASHER . It is wonderful. I can use a large pot with the 13 inch handle I don't burn my hand. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spud-errific, but not Smashing","review":"This is a solid piece of hardware and stood up to severe usage. (I'm known to break three of four \\"regular\\" mashers on a given Thanksgiving.) I recommend its use it concert with a wire-type pre-masher. The initial wire-masher will soften up the potatos so that this almost ricer-like face plate can render them the perfect consistency. I only gave it four stars, however, because it is just a little bit to small. The perfect design would've incorporated a mashing surface with about 125% of the area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killing Joke continues to maintain their own niche","review":"The thing I like about Killing Joke is not only do they create outstanding sound alternatives, but are consistently on the leading edge of alternative/grunge/metal; regardless of whether it is in vogue, or not. Great work on this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pandemonium 2?","review":"What can be said about Killing Joke? They are as old as the dinosaurs and still kicking today. As in the past Killing Joke has gotten heavier with each release, and Hosannas From The Basement Of Hell is going to be no exception. The title track is very heavy and dark, but with a good melodic breakdown in the middle. Geordie's guitar sounds better than ever, still sounding like sonic sheet metal. The new guy Ben Calvert does the tribal-esque drumming well, utilizing the toms more than anything else like Paul Ferguson did.Get the single for the b-sides for sure, cause there are only going to be nine tracks on the full album. That way if you have the single and the album you'll have all 11 songs recorded for Hosannas. Anyway, This band was around long before this style of music was popular, and they still prove relevant today. Hosannas' From The Basement Of Hell is tribal, apocolyptic metallic fury...thats the best way I can sum up the sound of Killing Joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what should have been released instead of \\"Democracy\\"","review":"Although the title is ridiculously cheesy, this album sounds like the next logical progression from 1994's \\"Pandaemonium\\", and my only real complaint about it is that it took 12 years to get here. I did not hate their 2003 self-titled release anywhere near as much as most people seem to, but I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I wasn't glad to see them switch gears and get back to coaxing these painful noises out of their fairly conventional instruments. It's a rare thing to find a British rock band devoid of blues and Beatles influences, so I'm grateful this one seems to be surviving. Not that I hate the blues or anything, it's just nice to see somebody do something differently every 60 years or so. The Beatles, yes; I do hate them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great CD","review":"Killing Joke the most underrated band ever. How are these guys not in the rock and roll hall of fame?"},{"rating":"1","title":"All power and no substance","review":"First I must say that it is entirely admirable to see a band as far along in its career as Killing Joke playing with such intensity, aggression and sheer power. However, these alone do not make for a good listening experience. Somewhere along the way the trademark atonal and eerie riffs of guitarist Geordie were largely lost, to be replaced by the simplest of power chord progressions imaginable (sometimes only one note!) strung out for way too long. Gone too is any semblance of melody or hook from vocalist Jaz Coleman (yes, melody - it used to be there!), who is reduced to hoarse shouting (one too many cigars, Jeremy?). On this album there are occasional glimpses of the band's previous greatness, and two or three reasonably good songs, but the overall impression is one of lazy self-indulgence - the fruits of extended jams rather than song writing. Very disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely perfectly miserable","review":"this album is brilliant. these guys never seem to get old. the energy and darkness never wane - their sound always evolving. any KJ fan will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Funny Funny Book!","review":"Joe Adams may be the funniest new voice in the South.

Surprisingly the new version of \\"Cose Della Vita\\" now with added Tina Turner, is a success. My other favourites are \\"Piu Bella Cosa\\", \\"Terra Promessa\\" and \\"Un Altra Te\\" but most of the 16 songs are very good indeed, with a number of ballads for those of you who like that kind of thing. Also try his most recent CD \\"Stile Libero\\" for more of the same - upbeat pop which is professionally played and produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italian Magic","review":"For those of you who have only heard the name, and want to truly discover one of the finest talents to come out of Italy, then this is the ideal start.

I ordered 2 more after hearing this one!I heard Eros in Chile this winter hiking in Patagonia. We stopped to refuel and grab a coffee in a cafe (interestingly where Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid laid low from their escapades in the southwest US..)and this fabulous singer/music was on the house sound. The owner of the cafe brought the cd to me. I initially thought it was a South American singer, but Eros is Italian! Music has no boundaries. When I returned to the US one of the first things I did was order up Eros on Amazon!!Thanks for your ability to connect us to music of the world!Lauve"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ramazzotti Rocks the House of Love","review":"Long is good, says Ramazzotti, and he makes this album a good one. Once you get warmed up to \\"Eros,\\" you refuse to leave it; his versatility is at his best here without losing the curious nasal appeal. Thrilling and smooth, from the jumpy \\"Ma che bello questo amore,\\" through duets with A. Bocelli and Tina Turner, to the sultry (can I use that word?) \\"Se bastarse una canzone,\\" his sound is as sexy now as it was ten years ago. Dance the night away to it, but be careful--it is dangerous.

I've purchased other \\"grandparent journals\\" in the past and this one just wasn't as good. It looks almost like a baby book or a story book. There aren't very many questions for the grandparents and the questions that there are aren't really worthy of having them spend so much time on it. I want them to enjoy filling it out as much as my kids will enjoy reading it, even when they get older. I did purchase two other books, \\"A Grandparent's Legacy: Your Life Story in You Own Words\\" and \\"Memories for My Grandchild.\\" I would definitely recommend these books. Unfortunately it's going to cost me to return these books because it is not \\"Amazon's error\\", so I'm going to just hang on to them.

The back of the light is flimsy, but seems strong enough once you bolt the whole thing together.

I actually found this quite helpful, because it assists you in putting your plans into perspective. Check it out from the library, if this intrigues you.Otherwise, the rest is pretty much a pagent of black, gold and silver lame' that's very reminiscent of Oscar party photos. It's impressive, certainly, and perfectly obvious that the couple wanted what was ultimately to throw a big blow out party, but ...

Pete Sheryako is brilliant when it comes to both topics. Tombstone would not have been as succesfull if it weren't for Him and Caravanwest... it give's detalis on the guns, gear and shaping of the movie itself.... I give this book 5 stars, I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK TO SPEND HOURS WITH","review":"One of the things that made the movie Tombstone so enjoyable was the authenticity of the guns and gear used by the actors. Peter Sheryako is not only an expert on old firearms and accouterments he also played in the movie as Texas Jack Vermillion. In this book he shares all the guns and gear used both real and replica. and even without the words the pictures alone are worth the entry fee.

After reading all the reviews, decided on this one.This last weekend we went to the snow; my friends had a Canon SD570 7 megapixels brand new. When we got home, we compared the pics taken with each of them...and this panasonic blew the canon. Much better detail, better contrast, better quality. Besides, the canon does not have the forced flash, so some pics with snow background came out washed out and the faces were dark.Buy this camera. Even though it's a bit bulkier than a canon, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera","review":"I did a lot of research before buying this camera.It works fine, pictures are good. Nice screen. No case included. Battery life is adequate IF you use rechargeable batteries. These are a must. Regular Alkalines don't work, not enough power. Pretty simple operation. You'll want to buy a memory card which are about $20-$25. Good camera for the money.

The low(7.2) mega pixels does not really bother me too much as I will not be printing extra large pictures. The quality of the photos are really good. What im really impressed with is the 6X optical zoom, (most small cameras average around 3X-5X zoom) you can really get nice close ups of animals and other things that you can't normally get close to, and there is no picture noise even with full zoom at 6X. The camera is bigger than the average point and shoots, but with the large lens and the 2AA batteries it takes, this is to be expected. Battery life is decent, I use re-chargeables though. All in all, good value, for the money.."},{"rating":"2","title":"XLNT \\"Mode\\" camera.","review":"For the price I paid,$130,it is a great buy. While lacking \\"manual\\" apeture and shutter speed settings,it's \\"Mode\\" settings plus optical image stabilizer really come through for most image situations, especially at high zoom. The image quality is stunningly good. The best 6X zoom lens, for the money, at 7.2 megapixels, you can buy, in my opinion.(Remember too, Optics 101: \\"In a rectangle the resolution increases by the square of the megapixels.\\" Hence, giant Megapixel sensors are generally unnecessary, for most folks). It will also optically zoom to X 7.2 at the 5 Meg. setting,and X9 at 3 Meg. Be sure and set the Camera to the Nickle Hydride Battery setting, which is a lower voltage . This camera needs plenty of power; rechargable 2500 MiAh or better is my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't beat it","review":"Very nice camera, does everything I want- easy to operate, high meg, excellent picture, runs on AA batteries.

It is a wonderful camera! It takes great pictures and video, the only thing I dont partcularlly like is that you cannot hear the video playback, but once it is put on my computer you can hear and it sounds great. Its a little larger than my other camera but not by much, I can still fit it in my purse.I dont like the fact it takes regular batteries as my other had a lumix rechargeable battery included.

The image stabilization works very well even at full zoom, I often had blurred pictures using cameras without it. I have liked this camera a lot and have given 3 so far as gifts to relatives. The multiple scene modes allow you to quickly setup the camera to match the scene you want to photograph. Very easy to use, this Panasonic camera has many features to help you, even if an amateur, take great pictures. The only item it lacks is an optical viewfinder, which makes it a bit difficult taking pictures on a bright sunny day. Otherwise, it is a great camera overall. You will be hard pressed to find the features and picture quality in a camera of this size and price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent point and shoot for the price","review":"Very happy with ease of use and picture quality. Very nice display, but impossible to see in the sunlight, a problem all cameras without a viewfinder share. I paid $150, and that is a fair price, but had my budget been higher I would have chosen the LX2K with the Leica lens and more solid construction. With the 1G card and an extra set of batteries, this camera will take and store over 600 pics, all you need for a vacation camera.

I was aware of the bulk, and decided the zoom was an acceptable trade-off. What I was not prepared for, however, was the insane time between pictures, 20+ seconds. I initially thought it might be the batteries, changed those. Then I thought the flash, so tried some outdoor photos, same problem. Then I tried a different SDHC card, I had the low-end Sandisk 4GB card that is rated as too slow for this camera. I upgraded to a fast Sandisk SDHC card, it's double the requirement listed in the camera manual. The camera still experiences 20+ seconds between taking one picture and being ready for the next.

It contains almost the entire primary series of ashtange yoga; however, the cd is divided up so that your actual practice can be 17 to 145 minutes long. Now that is variety! There is no music but Ms. Fox does a great job teaching the class, saying enough but not TOO much, if you know what I mean. Her 5 breath counts are a little slower than most so the class is not as fast say a Dave Swenson ashtanga yoga class but it is still a great and versatile workout. The only negative of any kind is that the poses chart is really small and so may not be useful to most while actually doing the class (I am tall and can hardly see it). I am lucky in that I know the poses but if you do not this may be a problem for you. Still a great effort though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dry and confusing","review":"I have practiced ashtanga yoga for about 4 years and this CD, although is does a nice practice overall, I find is lacking in a few major respects. First of all, Cynthia Funk doesn't call any of the postures by their sanskrit names or English names - she only describes where you arms and legs are supposed to be which can be really confusing. It comes with an insert with all the of postures she does on the CD but it is wrong.Also, it is kind of an imcomplete practice although it is about 70 minutes long. It is a great workout but I prefer Vinyasa Yoga with Kimberly Wilson so much more than this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping for more","review":"Relatively new to Ashtanga yoga, I purchased this CD in hopes of practicing at home without and instructor and while away.

You don't have to be on the cutting edge of climbing to understand in your heart what Crouch talks about in Enduring Patagonia. Empathy, focus, inner-demons, harmony, determination, pain, self-realization and the laurels of success are the streams of conscious thought that are conveyed so beautifully in Crouch's book. If you climb you know that all these feeling come out in great strength throughout almost every climb. I've never been able to put into words all the emotions and the reason for ones passion of climbing but Crouch's book does a stellar job of wording our obsession with the sport and lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly right.","review":"I bought this on Amazon MP3 because I heard one of the tracks on some internet radio station and wanted just that one track.

Sad.For an excellent book that lays out the other side of this issue see \\"ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT\\" by K. A. Kitchen; William B. Eerdmans Publishers, 2003; ISBN 0-8028-4960-1.

It is, after all, a fun idea--reviews of the critics who originally trashed the world's finest films when they first came out--but this isn't the kind of book you'd want to shell a coupla bucks for.

Brings down the snotty. Elevates the ribald and creative. Not for pretentious people who fantasize they breathe rarified air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the first one!","review":"Most sequels are disappointing, and this one is no exception. Meet the parents was a very funny movie with clever jokes, mostly coming from bumbling Gaylord and Pam's domineering slightly psychotic father. Meet the Fockers is nothing but a bundle of cheap gags. Ex: Barbra Streisand giving Pams dad sex therapy. Yes its wrong and not pretty to watch. Pams dad strapping a fake mammary gland to his chest to nurse a baby. Baby spouts profanities. You probably get the picture. To tell you the truth ben Stiller looks bored in this movie probably because the only jokes he makes are falling down and gluing babys hands to a rum bottle. The ending is horrible with beautiful lines such as Pam saying, \\"Daddy how can you have a circle of trust with nobody in it?\\" sobs quietly. Ok so dont waste your time by watching this sad excuse for a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Very dissapointing. Meet the Parents was funny and entertaining, but this heavy handed sequel was so forced it hurt. This kind of comedy can wear on you after awhile. Every single thing that can go wrong for Ben Stiller's character does indeed go horribly awry- and then they make up more stuff just to screw him over again. Its not even funny after awhile as they repeat the same gags from the first movie and reach for \\"plot twists\\" that neither surprise nor impress."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny at some parts, not appropriate","review":"This movie is definitely rated PG-13 for a reason. Most of the humor is \\"dirty\\". It's not exactly as funny as the first one and definitely isn't as good as \\"Meet The Parents\\".This movie is about a man(Ben Stiller)that is marrying another lady. The only problem is that they have completely different families. Ben Stiller's family is loud, obnoxious, and very open about private things. You can bet that's where some of the dirty humor comes from. The girl's family is very polite. They are very private about private issues...and the two families put together create a funny, not hilarious, movie. Most younger kids would not get this, and not to mention this movie is NOT appropriate for them. Alot of things happen in this movie, which I'll leave you to see. This is more of a comedy for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good laugh!","review":"Granted, we all know that #2 is never as good as #1 - but this one is worth getting. Barbra Streisand is fantastic - as she always is when doing comedy. Dustin Hoffman is his usual \\"out there\\" self. Robert Deniro is up to his old 'spy' tricks. And, there's a plot twist (which I identified in the first scene - woman's intuition). Enjoy this movie for what it is: another chapter in the lives of a cute couple with strange families!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel to \\"Meet the Parents\\"","review":"Now that Gaylord Focker has met his in-laws, he must introduce them to his parents, the touchy-feely, let-it-all-hang-out duo played by Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. She is a sex therapist and he is a stay-at-home dad, in contrast to Gaylord's in-laws, the former CIA straight arrow (Robert DeNiro) and his long-suffering wife (Blythe Danner). There is potential for humor here, but unfortunately the movie-makers go to the lowest common denominator and choose to saturate the film with tasteless sexual innuendoes and bathroom humor. There are a few funny moments, but unfortunately they come all too seldom in this star-studded flop of a movie. Take my advice, and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and relaxing movie","review":"This is a funny movie. Also, it is a pretty relaxing movie. When I watch it, it is so enjoyable.

Gotta love Jack!Skip this movie, see the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable slapstick","review":"Sequels are not usually that great. This one is no exception. The main gist of the movie is that, following \\"Meet the Parents\\", Pam and her parents go to Gaylord's house to meet his parents. While Pam's parents may have been more traditional and strict, Gaylord's are liberal, loose, and fun-loving people, and those differences cause obvious clashes during the movie. Also not surprisingly, Pam's father still has some doubts about his future son-in-law being man enough to take care of his little princess.There is some comic element to this movie, and I guess I would have to admit that there is a little thought in the plot, when the couple gets a little surprise in the middle of the story. And if you're into slapstick comedy with the usual cliched situations, you may just find this entertaining. For myself, it was hardly worth watching once, but never again.

Why? Well,it was predictable. The most funny parts came from thelittle boy and the animals. The adults in this movieall sucked.... Ben's wife looked like she is on drugsand \\"The Fockers\\" were very unfunny.They should have gave bigger roles to the animal andused the kid alittle more because they gave what littlefun there actually was.

Blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, If You're Bored","review":"\\"Meet the Fockers\\" is about Pam and Gaylord meeting the other side of the family tree.

I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated! This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard!

Very funny, situations flowed well, most of it worked, and worked together as a cohesive whole. Pretty much the opposite of this poorly put together sequel, which wastes a lot of good talent.The jokes are stupid, over the top, and require the characters to do a lot of actions that seem to be done just so the situations can be set up. The humor is dull and slapstick, and isn't funny. The \\"risque\\" jokes intended to be funny just by virtue of making the audience uncomfortable fall flat. They didn't make me uncomfortable, and they weren't funny. I did feel somewhat sorry for the actors forced to deliver the lines, but I figure they saw the script before they agreed and decided to do it just for the money.Save your money and spend it on the original, or on Zoolander instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since the movie is so impossibly boring...","review":"and clich��, and predictable and tongue-in-cheek, and trited, and mindless, I'm going to summarize this movie as:Utter Waste of Money and Time.There's nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing positive to say about this movie. They were pushing it with the first one, however, it was passable and watchable. This sequel is one that should have never put out. It's so enclosed in its idiocy that it obfuscates the acting value of thespians of great caliber. Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"If I could put zero stars, I would. This movie was that bad.I had liked Meet the Parents, unfortunately, this movie was a sorry attempt at comedy. The only glimmer of hope is Robert DeNiro's character, but that soon fades as his character decides to have a change of heart during the movie.If someone offers you the option to watch this film, or literally stare at a wall, you'll be glad you chose the wall option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deniro's lowest point in his career!","review":"I am saddened to see someone go from Mean Streets, Taxi driver, Raging Bull, Deer Hunter... do this junk. I guess the scripts aren't out there so he has to lower himself to do these formula comedies that might be funny to a seventh grader. The title says it all \\"Fockers\\" I could hear Bevis and Butthead laughing at this word because it sounds dirty. The movie isn't any better with its sophomoric humor. Once you've see a Ben Stiller movie you don't really have to see any of his other films because they are basically the same format and are as predictable as his other films. It seems like if you are an actor or singer on your way out you stop and do a Stiller film before you go. Sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Inferior Sequel to Meet the Parents","review":"Given the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Ben Stiller's parents, along with Robert DeNiro back as the hot-tempered Jack Byrnes, you'd think that \\"Meet the Fockers\\" would be a tremendously funny movie.Alas, I was very disappointed. The gags and dialogue don't work nearly as well as in the first film. What kind of screenwriter would think that attaching a fake breast to Robert DeNiro, or having a toddler utter profanities, or giving Greg Focker an illegitimate son, would be funny to watch?The running joke about Greg's last name ran pretty thin in the first film, and in this one, they run it into the ground.It's a shame so many talented actors had to work with such a lame script."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad....so very, very bad.","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life (and one time my ex made me watch a movie about Mare Winningham getting a brain transplant). I had to watch this with my girlfriend who laughed the entire time. I don't understand why she was laughing. I think she was drunk. Her lika da suds! If I could only get back that wasted time in my life I promise I would do something worthwhile with it. I would help an old lady cross the street or pick up cigarette butts along the beach. Hopefully by posting this review I will have saved somebody else some time. Somewhere out there an old lady needs help crossing the street.....go help her instead of watching this movie. That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Barb, Rain Man, DeNiro and Moses have the most fun....","review":"....I could use an entire film with father and mother Focker--Hoffman and Barb--because they definitely seem to enjoy their work here and it shows. La Barb is a bit zaftig here but that's okay, she still comes off as The Owl and the Pussycat kinda sexy.Hoffman's throwaway lines ('Can you believe I concieved him with one testicle?) are terrific. And the dog which 'humps everything that moves' who is flushed down the RV's terlit...funny, funny. Alas though. Stiller and Polo didn't seem to want to join the party as they kinda telegraphed in their acting. Oh, well...see it for the synergy of Striesand, DeNiro and Hoffman. You'll enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a fun movie and the casting was great....!","review":"Just to see Babs back in comedy was a great thing! I loved her in \\"What's Up Doc\\" and \\"For Pete's Sake\\" and am glad to see her back doing what she can do so well. Dustin Hoffman was a riot as well...he and De Niro were a scream together. The premise of getting the in-laws together is one that's been done a million times but this took it to the next level. Loved the scenery and the \\"Greg Room\\"...dog in the toilet and all that. I do have to warn parents that the PG-13 rating should be explored first...although it wasn't THAT bad, the senior on senior sex (therapy) is a bit..ah, disturbing (even to older folk!). I'd recommend this movie just to see the 4 'parents' in action. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light. Comedic. Funny. Star-Studded.","review":"\\"Meet the Fockers\\" picks up where \\"Meet the Parents\\" left off. The shaky truce between ex-CIA mastermind Jack (DeNiro) and would-be son-in-law, male nurse, Greg (Stiller) will be tested. Further, the emotionally distant Burns are about to meet touchy-feely aging boomers Bernie and Roz (Hoffman and Streisand). In the middle of it all, peacemaker and arbiter Dina, Mrs. Burns, finally has enough and puts her foot down.There are many chuckles in this movie; DeNiro, Streisand, and Hoffman play their roles with gleeful relish. The bonus features confirm what the audience suspects - the stars really had fun shooting this movie. The playfulness among them just shines.Inside the circle of talent, the four parents play like kids in a sandbox as Stiller watches from outside. All-in-all, this movie is fun and enjoyable. There is little to take seriously and mercifully, they don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"please, not a third time!","review":"Gee, it's pretty sad to see actors of this caliber, who've been in so many memorable movies, get mired in this kind of horrible dreck.But, this is what really offended me: in \\"Meet the Parents\\" there was one trained animal to provide a few cute jokes. In this sequel, not only did they feel the need to throw in a pathetic looking dog for a few more \\"America's Funniest Videos\\" style laughs, they effectively used a child in the role of a third \\"trained animal\\". Sick. They must have figured that it worked well with \\"Mini-Me\\" in the \\"Austin Powers\\" sequel, so why not stick Robert DeNiro with a similar sidekick? The people who made this movie deserve a swift kick (or two) in the pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"One forgettable film","review":"This is truely a tasteless and offensive comedy. Striesand and Hoffman must be desperate for work to appear in a film containing insulting Jewish jokes and mistreatment of animals, material completely beneath their talents. It's long, boring, and not even a tiny bit sexy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"When I ordered this movie from my rogers on demand network I was expecting something to make me laugh quite hard cause I heard much hype about this movie. Instead, I was dissapointed, I watched the whole movie and never laughed at all, none of the scenes were funny or amusing to me. Whoever made this movie doesnt know what true comedy is he thinks a bunch of lame gags are suppose to be funny.. For example one of the scenes when the baby speaks his first word and begins mumbling the words ass shole ass shole....he says it over and over again and its suppose to be amusing? NOT!! Wow what is so funny about that? This movie makes a big mistake that all rookie producers try to make out of a comedy, they try way to hard to make the audience laugh, everything is forced and unnatural. The only reason why I would think this movie is funny to you is if you can relate to the characters, other then that I dont recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tediously adolescent","review":"The story line was quickly lost in an overabundance of sexual innuendo and tacky bathroom humor. As is often the case, sequels are better left to the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a riot","review":"By far it is not the best movie ever created. I thought Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were fantastic in their roles. My wife and I as well as the whole audience just bellowed with laughter. There aren't too many movies out today that you can just enjoy. There was no subliminal thoughts passed on to you, no anguish, no sex, no violence, no subplot.... just flat out dumb humor. Every once in a while you need that type of experience.Bravo to the Fockers. Can't wait to get the DVD and to see the Focker's Have a Baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"These movies are not funny","review":"I didn't finish Meet the Parents. It was stupid, both literally and metaphorically. It was not funny. It was boring. Thank god I only rented it. I just shut off Meet the Fockers. I was expecting SOMEthing because it has Streisand and Hoffman in it. That's why I rented it. I didn't finish it either. These movies are boring, belabored, obvious and unfunny. Stupid people need entertainment too. But that's what television is for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewers with Arrested Development","review":"It's surely a reflection on the deficiencies of society and of parenting that most of the reviewers were among those racing to the theater to help this movie set records.

Try to get OUT for often and experience life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiller ruins it !","review":"I think this movie finally proves that Ben Stiller is more obnoxious than his mother. Stick with the funny fart movies, Ben, they're more your speed. Some comedy traits you are just born with, and evidently you got all of your mothers genes and none of your fathers. As for the big time stars in this movie.I don't know what the fock they were thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Funny","review":"Dustin Hoffman plays off DeNiro even better than in Wag the Dog and Barbara proves that whatever her shortcomings in political opinion, she can act and produce laughs in this wonderful sequel to Meet the Parents.There is very little to not like in this movies as once again Ben Stiller underplays himself and lets everything around him shine. There are too many funny moments in this film and it would be a crime to give spoilers to any of them, so I would just suggest watching it.All the cast from the first movie continues to shine to the point that there isn't much left to add. Only the totally expected ending makes this movie lose its last star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as the first","review":"I never understood why anyone thought the first movie was funny-Pam's refusal to stand up for her boyfriend didn't make me laugh, it just made me wonder why Greg bothered to try. The second is almost as bad, and I think the fact that it has such an all star cast makes it even more of a disappointment.Don't waste the $3 to rent this, get Eurotrip or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Funnier Than The First And Over-rated","review":"Meet The Fockers is a seuqel that was disappointing to me. As I progressed through the first 20 minutes of the movie, I figured it will probably get funnier. To my suprise, it actually did. But then the movie progressed into a bland tasteless comedy after the second half of the movie. The movie tries to reach its goal of being hysterical but sinks into a bland comedy. Although, I did like the idea Of Hoffman and Stressiand being in this film. They were enjoyable to watch. Although Robert DeNiro is less funny in this film and quite boring. I couldn't stand watching him in this film. He just got on my nerves. He was funny in the first one, but now he is just the opposite for me in this sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not funny.","review":"How could this be a comedy? It seemed more like a documentary of a couples' parents meeting. It seemed like everyone was against Gay(Ben Stiller)in the way they talked down to him, embarrased him, and showed no respect. Why would this happen?The parents became so annoying throughout the movie and were acting like children. I actually turned it off half-way through as the jokes were not funny at all and the attitudes of the parents were extremely unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what I ordered","review":"I received exactly what I ordered and quickly I might add. Thanks for superb service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired retread","review":"It's a shame to see talented legends reduced to low-rent comedy that tries to be hilariously vulgar but fails miserably. The only redemption in this sorry sequel is the amazing screen magnetism of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Who knew Dustin Hoffman could actually be likable in a movie? Who knew Streisand actually has a sense of humor about herself? Ben Stiller is funny but a little too old for the sad sacks he always plays. The Burns family trio (DeNiro, Danner, Polo) is so plastic and one-note I could hit the mute button and not miss a beat... DeNiro really needs to find something challenging before he starts competing with Robin Williams for film roles. If not for the pedigree of the cast, this would be a decent movie, but I really expected better."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY FUNNY AND WELL WORTH WATCHING","review":"just when greg thinks things can't get any more embarrassing, his future in-laws take the trip to meet his oddball parents! what insues is an almost non-stop laugh-fest!DVD includes deleted scenes, bloopers, commentary, the focker's family portrait, behind the scenes with jinx, and more.just a word to the wise-do not waste your time watching the extended version, at every extended scene the DVD stops then starts again really messing with the flow of the movie. just watch the theatrical version then go to the special features and watch the extended scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is one of the worst sequels in recent memory.

I liked how DeNiro's character loosened up in the end. The only part that ruined the movie for me was the presence of sexuality in almost every scene. Streisand's character is a sex therapist. She has books and statues all over the place. She constantly turns the conversation toward sexual things. She and her husband are constantly thinking about, talking about, and starting sex. I feel sad that people think that sex has to be part of everything. Comedies such as this would be just as funny without sex, but they always insist on adding it.

They try to recycle the same old shtick for the sequel, but it falls flat because Ben Stiller comes off as the most normal person in the bunch.

I can't believe it is rated PG 13","review":"If the system allowed a zero star review, I would have used it.This movie is about 1 thing.. sex.

It is sad to think that there are 13 year olds allowed into theaters to watch this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Bad","review":"A thin soup of potty humor, fart jokes, and juvenile cheap laughs.

You can guess all of the jokes before you put the dvd in. The thing that got me the most was how over the top stupid the Fockers were. It would have been much more funny if the 2 families would have liked each other superficially at first and then as they learn more...grow further apart.What a waste of time for some very good actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meet the sleep - zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"This movie was so bad I fell alsleep on the couch.Ben Stiller's worst movie tied with Envy.Don't buy/rent this sucky movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title sets the level","review":"The title was a stupid joke. I assumed the movie would not surmount that level.But given the quality of the actors, and that the listing as I got it had five--count 'em five--stars, I took a chance and saw it.Best I can say is that it was almost as bad as I expected. Not quite a zero-star rating, given Streisand, Hoffman, De Niro and Blythe Danner.Based on my judgment, I am recommending against it. Some audience members laughed out loud as I grimaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"a few yucks, but mostly just Yuck.","review":"This movie has a few ok laughs--Ben Stiller can almost always at least get a chuckle out of me. Unfortunately the rest of the cast lets you down. Dustin Hoffman is corny and unbelievable, Robert Deniro has more ham than a deli, and Streisand--oh god, Streisand. Barbra Streisand (or B.S. as I like to call her) makes me want to retch every time I see or hear her. Whether it's acting (if you want to call it that), singing, blogging, speechmaking, or kicking puppies like the soulless conniving parasite she is, she makes me want to jump off the nearest bridge to put myself out of my misery.Skip this movie and pick up a copy of South Park Season 1 which features the classic episode \\"Mecha-Streisand\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please","review":"The title tells you everything you need to know about this movie: stupid and sophomoric.

The star power present in this film could not salvage the story line. Some very funny moments but overall a huge disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the chemistry...","review":"When I first heard there was going to be a sequel to Meet the Parents, I was horrified. I hated the first one, and had some serious doubts about any sequel being able to redeem.However, with some excellent casting choices and just a better story I'd say this one did it. If you thought that Stiller's and DeNiro's characters were clashes then wait till you see Hoffman, ex-hippie, and DeNiro, CIA of course, clash.That's where most of the humor lies, although even the stuff that goes wrong this time is more interesting then the last film. Somehow, they even managed to throw in a few twists.Like I said, I don't know how they came up with an idea that would save the Meet the Parent's idea, but once again all I have to say is good casting creates good chemistry. And they found the formula.(Sidenote: still inappropriate for younger kids.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Fock!","review":"For all the hype and publicity this movie got, it really sucked. Stars galore in this, but you know what this proves, without quality writing the movie will still blow.

I'm sick of watching crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"To The Prudes","review":"Hey,To those that give this movie a bad review based on adult humor... I think you are truly out of your mind. What do you expect when you know that the movie's title is Meet the Fockers. Were you expecting a kids movie? Get over it. Sexuality is a beautiful part of who we are and humor about it is fanfockingtastic. If you don't like that kind of thing, I suggest you not see movies that are geared toward adults and stick with the kids flicks until you can grow up and see that there is NOTHING wrong with sexuality or having a sense of humor about it. Also, for those of you interested, I found a site that is awesome and carries the products shown in the movie based on sex therapist Barbara Steisand at holisticwisdom.com. An adult (not dirty) site worth your time if you are able to accept that sexuality is a natural and wonderful part of who we are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Dustin Hoffman comes off as a flake who is perhaps mildly retarded and Babs is a lecherous whore. Yeeach! DeNiro's character is a complete psychopath. I think his Taxi-driver persona was more sane than Jack Burns. They try to recycle the same old shtick for the sequel, but it falls flat because Ben Stiller comes off as the most normal person in the bunch. Even more so than his wife-to-be who deserts him at every turn. But that football scene - man that was funny though ... not. The Manson family needs to pay a visit to both these families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This movie was not as good as the first, but what do you expect from a sequel? I thought it was hilarious in certain parts. It was very crude for sure. This movie should not be seen by children because of all the sex chatter. Overall, it was a funny movie, just wit a little 'blah' at times. Worthy of buying when it gets down to $9.98 :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical sequel","review":"There was lot of hype for this movie, as well as several recommendations that I heard. Apparently hype sometimes actually informs the opinion of the moviewatcher. Ignore the hype--this movie isn't nearly as good as the first. Probably part of the reason for the hype is the addition of Hoffman and Streisand (maybe to make up for the weak script). If your sole definition of humor is sex and bathrooms, you'll like this movie (but don't eat while you watch it--you'll lose your appetite in some places). If your idea of humor is genuinely clever and funny scenes as in \\"Meet the Parents\\", save your money and time. One more thing--you can't trust referrals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid 19.99 for my first DVD.I've been FOCKED","review":"Its almost worth getting Focked seeing Streisand,Hoffman,and De Niro in the same movie,and THERE ALL GREAT,but this movie is not a film you want to see again.There are a couple of laughs,but this DVD is not worth buying,just rent it,or borrow it from a friend,or you will get FOCKED,Like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Meet the Parents, and I was a bit skeptical of this sequel from the beginning. I knew that it couldn't possibly be as funny as the original, as is generally the case with sequels. I would still have at least liked it if it hadn't been for all the sex jokes.If you're looking for an adult film that has a sex joke about every few minutes, then buy this DVD.

It had a few funny moments, but most of those were the ones you see in the TV commercial anyhow. It was almost painful to watch and the ending just never came quick enough. Even the bloopers and special added scenes weren't very entertaining. I felt sorry for the cast as they are all talented but you can tell they knew they were selling out this go-round.

However, if you know some of his classics, and you want to dig deeper into the trademark groove, you couldn't do any better. The packaging, booklet, and selection are all fantastic and it's a solid value. Because Bo Diddley is one of rock's Founding Fathers, people forget that he's great fun, possesses a sly and irreverent wit, and has diverse musical interests. He also doesn't get enough credit for being a terrific singer. All the essential tracks are here, and plenty of great surprises.

No blade movement up/down or side to side.-Ability to open and close with one hand (it's a right hander close, sorry lefties).-Sharp out of the package. Ready to use.Con:-After playing with it, the paraframe design gave me the feeling that one of my finger tips may get sliced. More so if I used my left hand. Right hand, not too bad.-The frame lock on this knife is very uncomfortable to use. I did play with it for nearly two hours, and my thumb hurts.-The handle retention is very weak. A little shake and the blade falls out of handle.-The pocket clip is really hard to use.-Doesn't feel comfortable in my hand when the blade is in open position.I ended up returning this back to the store.

Hmmm, right, how can you move sth that doesn't exist.The whole thing seems to be made of separate parts, which were glued together by the director.If you have to spend your money on something, better think twice before you buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"straight up good","review":"The Art Of Being Straight was obviously a low-budget independent movie, but was done well in my opinion. There is a consistent tone throughout the movie. It was not meant to be high drama or melodramatic to begin with, and I think a number of other reviewers here have missed this point, hoping it would be something matching their own expectations. And contrary to others' remarks, I found everyone's acting to be quite credible and real. Jesse Rosen set out to tell a particular story in a thoughtful and an evenly unfolding way, and it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know your Essence","review":"As a professional in the field of personal development, I give this CD to all my clients. The first part of the CD gives a better presentation on the distinction between living your who, not your what, than I can. And that distinction is the center of my work. Something I want to awaken in my clients. Something I need them to commit to awakening to.If clients want, they can go beyond the presentation and participate in a valuable guided mediation to actually experience their song. And they can repeat that experience until they begin to know the feeling of their essential self.What a great gift this CD is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

Then I log on to read some review and find all of them are written by the bands hardcore \\"fans\\" longing for a rehashing of the bands older albums. What a juvenile point of view. What if the Beatles had never progressed as artists and explored new sounds. They would have been washed up by the time they had released their seventh new version of \\"She Loves You\\" and the world would have been denyed the majesty of their later records. Maybe the Get Up Kids are reaching the point in their career where they are outgrowing there \\"Liverpool\\" crowd and finding a new audience to embrace them as the grow up, grow out and expand on their sound. So either you'll embrace them, or pine away for days gone past and listen to your old cds. At any rate. Kids, grow up and grow with your favorite bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Dissapointment","review":"Having read the reviews of some other long time fans that have grown to like this CD I just wanted to mention that I absolutely hate it. I can understand a band wanting to change/develop, but this album is nothing like their earlier releases. To me at least it lacks the raw emotion and feeling that made the earlier stuff, especially Four Minute Mile, so memorable. If you want to listen to bad college rock circa 1997 or so, buy this. Otherwise stick with their earlier stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I like overdue thats a good song but the rest of the cd is terrible they sound like a bunch of old 70's rock songs. I dont understand, some people are saying its good that they change there sound, i have no problem with that but u dont go from a emo-punk band to a 70's weird rock band in one album thats how u lose ur fans u have to gradually change ur sound thats how they might have one some fans over on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome five & a half stars","review":"Just an amazing album. My first Get Up Kids album. Better than Saves the Day and Better than Ezra."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Get Up Kids album ever","review":"Uninspired, boring and repetitive.... It's by far their worst album ever. I agree with the person who said they're not emo... they're really not. If you want emo, go for Bright Eyes, but if you want some fun rock music, skip this album and pick up \\"4 Minute Mile\\" and \\"Something to Write Home About\\" instead. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"nah","review":"oh my god. this band is NOT emo. stop labeling them as such. they stopped being good circa 1998.again, not emo. stop reading rolling stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well if you like old get up kids...","review":"If you like old GUK, you'll hate this CD! After being a HUGE fan of four minute mile, and somewhat of a fan of Something To Write Home About, I was really excited for some new material. But after going out and buying this, all I can say is this is a disgrace. The only songs worth listening to are Overdue, Walking On A Wire, and and Hannah Hold On. So download those songs and forget the CD. I really sorry for the harsh review, but Im not a fan of sellouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st Get Up Kids CD, I like it!","review":"I'd heard a couple of their songs before and really liked them but I could never find the CD. I finally found \\"On A Wire\\" and thought that the songs sounded different from the stuff I had heard before but I still liked it. It's an awesome CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"a step forward...but maybe not a good one","review":"ive been a fan of the get up kids for a long time. they are a great emo band to listen to. 4 minute mile was their most emo, then there was something to write home about, which is one of my favorite albums of all time, made with such emotional melody.on \\"on a wire,\\" they took a different path. it seems as if the most successful indie emo bands are taking a different path, like the promise ring and weezer have. it is a good album, but it's not emo, it's more older rock sounding, with some parts of grateful dead and maybe led zeppelin in there. it's a pretty good album, but not what i was expecting, a step in the wrong direction. i hope get up kids will go back to their 4 minute mile sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"i think lots of you have got the wrong idea...","review":"look, it's not about whether or not it's emo, or whether or not their sound changed for this album, or anything like that. it's just that the songs aren't that good. overdue, fall from grace, and hannah hold on are great songs -- but aside from that it's just not that great, musically speaking. people aren't mad because it doesn't rock out, (at least for the most part), so get it straight for all those of you who gave this all the possible stars and ripped on people for complaining -- the majority of the album just plain isn't very good. i'd rather have downloaded those three songs than bought the album. and can we stop all this talk of \\"growing up\\"??? their next album could be another rockin' out masterpiece. bands have been known to experiment. it happens. unless you are a diehard fan, i wouldn't recommend it, and even then i'd still just download those three songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is terrible.","review":"This album is nothing like 5 minute mile or Something to Write Home About. If you liked previous albums for the awesome guitar riffs and distortion and emotional singing you will probably think this is a waste of money. The whole album is emotionless ... with soft, extremally finished guitars with the whole thing sounding a lot more like they might be giants then tguk of old. The songs are melodic and kind of have this happy bouncy boring way about them. I don't like to criticize one of my favorite bands, but this is terrible. I'm probably not going to see their tour just because this album is so boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Good!!!!!","review":"Oh no! The Distortion Pedal Thief has struck again!!! First the victin was Green Day, now The Get Up Kids... what a shame!, but in spite of this, the Get Up Kids have managed to release a very good record, full of nice songs, I say nice becouse these are the kind of songs that you could listen with your parents, and they'd love them. But that doesn't mean that you will not like them, most of them are very catchy, mellow yes, but good mellow.So if you like nice rock songs, then you'll really dig this album, and if you only like punk stuff, then you should absolutely listen to this album, so you can open your mind a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch - the junior year slump","review":"Wow - the New Amsterdams are really working hard, what with two new releases in one year. What's that? This is the new Get Up Kids disk? Oh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter, Utter, Utter Rubbish!","review":"My beloved Get up Kids. One of my all time favourite band with the great albums \\"Eudora\\" and \\"Something to write home about\\", tarnished by this complete drivel!! I mean there are no redeeming factors in ANY of these songs. I feel angered that I've not only been cheated out of my [money], that I had shipped from the U.S to myself in the UK, but also that the genre of music has changed. There is no more banging beats mixed with beautifully placed emotional guitars and keyboards. All I can say is I'm really disappointed, and I can only hope that TGUK will go back to there original sound, as they will not pull there original crowd back in with this plain boring Indie music. If you are a GUK follower i highly recommend, and I mean highly, that you stay as far away as possible from this album. In my closing lines, I'd like to say I still have hope in TGUK creating another creative/emotional/moving/lifting album in the future!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the kids lost their emotion","review":"what a flat boring album. the songs go nowhere. the music puts me to sleep. what happened to the emotion that used to drive the get up kids. are they trying to get radio play with this album, cause if they are they'll only be played on adult contemporary rock stations. there's no hooks and no catchy songs on this album. the only good song is 'grunge pig'... the artwork on the album is the only good thing about CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"I am a huge fans of everything get up kids up to this album, but this is thoroughly mediocre. Not just because their sound has strayed far, far away from emo, but because it's just not very good. The first song, \\"Overdue,\\" is admittedly killer, and the second, \\"stay gone,\\" is pretty good too. After that, it is a whole mess of entirely forgettable songs. I've listened to the album more than half a dozen times, waiting for it to grow on me, wanting it to impress me, but it's just not happening. i don't fault them, good for the get up kids for trying something new, but i hope the next experiment is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Boring","review":"With the only redeeming song on this album being \\"Overdue\\" Id have to say that this album is not only a big let down, its also incredibly boring and uneventful. They've mellowed out not only with this album but in their live shows as well. I remember TGUK as spunky and fun live, now they just kind of stand around. Too bad, they use to be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand...","review":"I'll admit that I've never been a fan of The Get-Up Kids, but leaving out any biases, expectations, thoughts of the band, or past albums I really do not like this cd. I don't understand how I could be a fan of so many emo bands or partially emo bands and not enjoys this at all. I really like Taking Back Sunday, Dashboard Confessional, Finch, Alkaline Trio, and Rites of Spring, but I can't get into The GetUp Kids' new album \\"On A Wire\\". Maybe there's something I'm missing. I'll try listenning again, hoping that something will change, but at this point I say go listen to the bands I listed above, they're not quite as boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING to write home about...","review":"Woody Allen coined the phrase \\"a travesty of a mockery of a sham of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham\\" before TGUK were born, but I can think of no words more suitable for describing their latest offering, On A Wire. For me this was the year's most anticipated record. No wait. It was last year's as well.I'm shocked. I want my money back. Better yet, I want a do-over. I demand TGUK march their once-glorious, Replacements-lovin' butts back to the studio-and bring the guitars this time!On A Wire puts the first dent in the shiny car that was Vagrant Records. I'm fairly certain producer Scott Litt threw the rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"please avoid this at all costs.","review":"Ok, don't get me wrong because I am a big, big fan of the get up kids, but this album is just plain HORRID. I don't know if Scott Litt tried turning them into this, or what but to me this is NOT a get up kids album. I respect it when bands continually progress, but this album is not a progression, it is as if they all decided one day to vomit into an envelope and mail it to each and every fan they've ever had. I was very excited after 3 years to finally get this album and I have NEVER been so dissapointed by an album in my life. I even gave it time, and listened to it quite a bit to see if maybe I was missing something. No, I'm not missing anything except a good album from these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is terrible","review":"I dont know what to say this cd is simply slow and boring i cant just sit down and listen to it. thats it i dont know what happened i dont care what happened the new get up kids suck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album blows chunks!!!!","review":"What did they turn Country-alternative? Man, some of these songs sound like old 70's stuff your mom and papa used to listen to. Over all this is very disappointing for a band that had so much potential.

Mid-tempo and kind of dull. More like watered-down New Amsterdams than GUK. I had to force myself to keep listening. Try to listen to someone else's copy before shelling out for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back....","review":"The last new album we heard from The Get Up Kids was in 1999 with Something to Write Home About. In my opinion, this was one of the best emo albums ever. So naturally, I was going to be skeptical about this new album. At first listen I was a little let down. Where's this album's \\"Holiday\\" or \\"I'm a Loner Dottie, a Rebel\\"? This doesn't sound like my Get Up Kids! But one must understand that as artists, these guys have the right to grow and evolve their music, especially over the course of 3 years. Fans of TGUK's should be open to this album and listen to it for what it is; a very good album. There are some really stand out tracks, such as \\"Stay Gone\\" \\"Walking on a Wire\\" and \\"Campfire Kansas\\". I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys intelligent pop music. But if you buy On A Wire expecting it to be your same old Get Up Kids, you might be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and roll","review":"I guess you could complain that it's not like anything else the Get Up Kids have done, and you'd be right. But, with a CD this perfect, that's not a bad thing. You can't be a whiny 20 year old who can't get girls for your entire life. This CD shows maturity that the band has never embraced, and that may be hard for some to accept, but it makes for one hell of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best card game ever","review":"I think this is the best starter deck you can get.

The CD is especially helpful because it teaches kids how to play through a number of mini-games. The game is also playable right out of the box for two players. The reason I only gave it two stars in fun was because of one major problem with it. The problem is that the Starter cards are not allowed to be used in the real game! So basically if you have learned how to play already and decide to move on to the real game you can't use the cards from the Starter at all. This makes the starter just a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Cards","review":"This is easily the best thing that Wizards Coast has come up for decades.

The foil-rhox it comes with is worth about 6 bucks, so you could argue that you only really paid four bucks for it!The software it comes with is great. The educational video is very nicely done. It's entertaining and very informative. The tutorials in the software are basically games, and get progressively more complex as they move along. Even once I understood how Magic was played and had the rules downpacked (which didn't take long), the tutorials are still fun to play because they're essentially like playing Magic against an opponent.If you've been wanting to learn Magic the Gathering, you can't go wrong by starting here.

The only thing that's better is his video of the same title. Gabriel is absolutely electric before an audience. His upbeat tunes with snappy background vocals are nothing short of thrilling. The melancholy songs, especially those with Mariachi, are heart-breaking. All of the music is fresh, even \\"No Tengo Dinero,\\" the song that started him on the road to legendary status 30 years ago. His voice becomes a little hoarse during the last couple numbers making \\"Te Recuerdo Dulcemente,\\" the closing song, sound delightfully mournful. This live performance is Gabriel's finest work.

When I first viewed it, I thought maybe I just didn't get the overdone slapstick humor so I had others at my institution review it. The general consensus is that the video is disjointed, in poor taste, and poorly filmed. And although it attempts to highlight the complications of poor control, it does very little to teach how to achieve good control. This is not a video that we will recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, rather weak execution","review":"Using humor to appeal to guys not controlling their diabetes, is a good idea. These guys might dismiss regular information campaigns. Basing the story on a real person is an effective approach. Rather than telling Steven Furst's story in a traditional manner, this movie uses a series of movie spoofs to drive the point home to our main character.Does this appeal to those who liked \\"Animal House\\", a movie I haven't seen? I find about half of American comedy to be un-funny, including, sadly, D-4-G. Most of the jokes fall flat, and can't lift this movie from its low production value.The introduction, the Forrest Gump scenes, the stunts, and the outtakes are amusing, but the rest of this movie makes me cringe. How could this ever turn an out-of control diabetic around? I wouldn't show this to anybody.Disclosure: I'm a Babylon 5 fan. My father is an in-control diabetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY WITH THIS CD","review":"I was very disapointed with this CD. These are not the original cuts and the music is distorted.

I was afraid it was going to be a rip-off with X-men characters. I was completely wrong. It is so different from Magic, yet it still captures the feeling of a great card game. The dice feature is a welcome addition to card games that I have played. it is also simple to learn, but the more advanced you are makes it more fun. The cards are beautifull and well desinged. I think it is a great game with lots of inovation."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS BEFORE BUYING","review":"When this came out I thought it would be ok to play but as I found out this games has many bad things about it.Here is a list- 1.To hard to play.-2.VERY clumsly\\"with the playmat\\".-3.Not as fun as magic or pokemon.----If you are going to start to learn how to play a card game,play magic.This game will just cost you .. of garbage.Magic is alot more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid - Not as pictured","review":"The actual pin looks sort of like the picture, but more like something you'd find in a dollar store.

Keep your eyes on them, they will rock you sooner or later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Not Well Written","review":"I respect the subject matter very much, and have tremendous respect for the author and his comrades serving on the front lines, but I have to give an honest review of this book. It's bad. It's poorly written, very amateurish. Crawford relies on colloquialisms and crass dialogue, which is no doubt accurate from the front lines, to cover for his innate lack of writing skills. His accounts of experiences in Iraq are probably mostly factual, but mostly boring.Let me just put this in perspective, almost 20 years after reading Dispatches for the first time, I still recall the power of the words in that book. Two days after reading The Last True Story and I'm trying to remember something memorable about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like some cheese with that WHINE?","review":"Although Crawford does give some accurate accounts of experiences in Iraq, he by no means speaks for a large percentage of soldiers who served there including myself.We all have our personal opinions about the war and why and if we should be there. Many joined the military for college money. However, to whine about it achieves nothing. And the entire theme of this book is Crawford constanly whinning and blaming everyone else for his misfortunes. John, you were in a war... \\"War is Hell\\". You didnt spend anymore time over there than anyone else. I spent a year in Afghanistan, to only return to Iraq four months later. People should be aware of the horrors of war, but the story should be told with some dignity. You or your book has none. There was always blessing to count....even in hard times. You should have remembered your brothers in Bastogne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"War is hell.","review":"If the mossy old chicken hawks who make wars had to fight them there would be fewer of these heartbreaking stories told by our children who do go fight them. A wonderful, terrible book. Well written and riveting but bone sad all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no such thing as an accidental soldier","review":"I was a reservist that was called up to active duty to serve in afghanistan. The author pretty much uses most of the book to complain about being deployed. If he joined the military for the college money never wanting to get deployed, then he was wrong for that. Everyone joins the military knowing that they may be called up to serve in a war. He shows what the war was like, but for the most part makes the reservist and national guardsman look bad by complaining about how he was deployed just shortly before graduating college... that's the risk we run as soldiers... there is no accident about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast rewind to Vietnam","review":"I served in the military for 11 years before finally throwing in the towel out of frustration. It was like John was describing many of our experiences dealing with incompetant commanders or NCO's. I could not put the book down once I started reading it. It probably only took me a few hours to read but I felt as if I was in the middle of a fire fight along with him as he describes the action taking place around him. Even though there is very little comment or commentary on the political feeling of his fellow soldiers towards the war you get the impression that this was a giant mistake on the part of the U.S. to involve ourselves in another nation building agenda that has Vietnam written all over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worthwhile","review":"This was a very well-written collection of stories describing life in Iraq as a soldier. The author does a great job of portraying the feeling of being in Iraq and just wanting to go home. He did not over-glorify being a soldier or list exciting war stories filled with adrenalin, instead he just laid out the facts, good and bad, about each event. There's no particular chronology to the book, just sort of an assortment of stories, each with it's own lesson. When I was done reading I came away with a better sense of the misery that is war, and an even greater appreciation and empathy for the military."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"Gives you a real live, unsanatized look @ what hell our front line soldiers must experience. I appreciated his honesty and his frankness at what he had to do to keep his sanity and get through each day. Not a book for the faint of heart, it is hard hitting, fast paced and full of graphic language. Just what you would expect in a time of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED it","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone. If you liked \\"Jarhead\\" then you will love Mr. Crawford's book. It doesn't shy away from the ugly sides of war. It is an honest and deeply felt reflection of the War in Iraq. Great job Mr. Crawford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed to Print","review":"I can't say that this book was a good read. While I think John Crawford has an important story to tell--especially about the National Guard at war--his writing feels a little rushed. Perhaps a little more time to polish would have made a difference. I didn't find myself emotionally investing in Crawford or any of his fellow soldiers.Comparing this book to Michael Herr's Dispatches is really pushing it. Dispatches gave us a language to describe time, while this book doesn't reveal much more than the surface.I would suggest Colby Buzzell's \\"My War\\" as alternative. Not only is it entertaining, but it also puts a definitive on the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this book instead..\\"Detained Differences\\"","review":"Those of you that walked away with a sour view from this book, read \\"Detained Differences\\" by J. Robert Rowe. You wont be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to tell where the truth ends and the BS begins","review":"Its hard to tell what is true in this book and what is not true. If you can buy another book - then do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whining pathetic waste of time. A disgrace.","review":"The book is full of falsehoods. Most units that Crawford complains about not staying as long as he did, have served just as long or longer. Many of them have already completed a second year long tour. None of them whined like he did. He complains about everyone in his chain of command as being poor leaders. But why after 7 years of total service, Crawford wasn't serving even as a squad leader? He was a volunteer twice both to active duty in the 101st and then to the National Guard. He would have to be an idiot not to think he would be called to active duty. He was not an accidental soldier, he served because he made a choice to enlist.There are far better soldiers out there, with far better stories about their experience in Iraq. Crawfords story is aself serving dribble.By the way the 101st is now serving its third tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst True Story I Ever Read","review":"This just seemed like a bunch of random stories. There was no coherent story line, lots of complaining, and lots of profanity. It is a world of difference from the experiences described by world war II veterans and a drastic difference in maturity and values."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Stories that Matter","review":"John Crawford's not going to be winning any style contests anytime soon. But, if you're looking for a book that will help you understand what life is really like for a soldier in Iraq, this should help.In short, life in this war is banal, frightening, boring, and filled with officers who are wildly out of touch with their soldiers and the situation. This is, in essence, the story of a group of young men with automatic weapons and \\"needs,\\" in a country and culture about which they know essentially nothing.Crawford's stories are wonderfully and intensely compelling. He could have used some style pointers. Still, definitely worth consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating","review":"With a callousness and stoicism that seems ready to crack at any moment John Crawford's writng vomits horror into the social indifference that sent him to war in the first place. With casual brutality and moments of compassion,Crawford illustrates the degradation of being a combat soldier. Whatever your politics are, they dont matter. This is a must read for all accomplices in the invasion of Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for your thoughts","review":"I am happy to find a book written by a National Guardsman about time spent in Iraq. I am happy to have rumors that had circulated early in the war about no supplies and no equipment to confirmed by his story. There can be no comparison to his story and the story of an enlisted man's tale. He was a volunteer NATIONAL GUARDSMAN, these men should never have left American soil as far as I am concerned. To have it ruin his dreams of his future is a crying shame. I appreciate his guts in sharing his story and to the ones who call him a \\"whiner\\" you are only justified if you too walked in his shoes. Thank you for an eye opening book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope he doesn't mean it...","review":"A remarkable book. Crawford's prose style is clumsy in places, and this is not quite on the level of, say, Caputo's \\"Rumor of War\\" or Herr's \\"Dispatches,\\" but anyone who cares about the young/old men who are doing America's dirty work in Iraq should read \\"Last True Story.\\" His descriptions of urban combat are remarkable for their coherence and immediacy. And although Crawford's comrades in arms are pretty much indistinguishable except for their names, he has an almost Dickensian gift for making each individual Iraqi (who is usually nameless, and never more than a nickname) a vividly realized human being. Be warned: the last chapter will break your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This was an entertaining first hand account of one man's experience as a soldier in Iraq. I enjoyed reading, although there was not much new information or ideas in the book. It was an interesting read, and it should be deemed significant in its account because it is first hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brief Comment on our Longest War","review":"Mr. Crawford has created a picture of war that reveals the humanity of the participants and the inhumanity of war itself. It has been said that evil is ordinary, common place, boring. Uneventful. So it is slogging through garbage littered streets, sewage filled ditches, cityscapes filled with empty eyes and abandoned buildings. The humanity comes from the sensitivity of the writer to the pain and suffering he sees daily. He struggles with his relationship with his wife, ten thousand miles and a world away. He remains a friend and trusted team member to his Army buddies. He writes in a way that is everyday yet poetic, and shows moments of relief and humor amid days on end of ennui interspersed with sudden explosions of gunfire and IEDs. The stories are short, clean and eminently readable. A worthwhile read for anyone living in the present day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest but a bit sloppy","review":"Good, honest memoir held my interest. Was a bit put off by some 'extra-curriculars' that colored the conduct of our troops but this is a good story I was compelled to keep flipping the pages on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronic Complainer","review":"This is John Crawford's account of being a soldier, the horror's of modern warfare, and his unsucessful attempt at assimulation back into society. Some what of a depressing book. Crawford comes across as a chronic complainer who complains way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and Unrealistic Example of The U.S Military","review":"I can have NO respect for a presumed author that leads the reader to believe that he is writing an autobiograhy of his own experiences, and then lets the reader down with his weak \\"POOR ME\\" attidude. Nor can I admire ANYONE (no matter what the Nation) that can take pleasure in watching a small, weak child running from bullies,------and is so delighted with the prospects of seeing a bloody beating that he invites a buddy to observe with him. A whiner and a coward! I have read books by Female soldiers that were far better \\"men\\" than he was----and better examples of what we grow in this U.S.A.---- Not worth the time of anyone that lives and takes pride in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you sign up - expect to fight","review":"After having a college education paid for in return for military service, all you get from this book is whining about having to do what he signed up for. I guess he did not hear\\" ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country\\".In addition to a somewhat poorly written book that jumps all over the place you get the usual \\"those in command did not know how to run the war\\". After reading this I know the author certainly did not have a clue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Accidental Fabrication","review":"I haven't read Mr. Crawford/s book but I have read all 126 reviews. Based on the reviews, not one soldier that served in Iraq gave the book a positive review. That says those that know what serving in Iraq is like find the author something of a fraud.It was pointed out that Mr. Crawford previously served in the regular active-duty army and therefore he should know what service in the National Guard is all about, including being recalled to active duty in a time of war. You cannot over look this point. Therefore, the rest of Mr. Crawford/s claims must be suspect if he misrepresents being an accidental soldier.Drugs. You don't do drugs in a combat zone. I served in Vietnam and know that drugs and war do not mix very well.I suspect that the people who praise this book have an anti-Iraq war bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully simple","review":"I found the format of the book, a collection of short stories, and the writing of the stories to be painfully simple. There were times that the author injected his opinion, and came across as simply complaining. If you are looking for a book to describe the facts about the war from a soldier's perspective, look at the Nathanial Fick or Evan Wright books first."},{"rating":"2","title":"How a soldier got stuck in Iraq for 1 plus years.","review":"I liked this book, but I am surprised by the fact the author blames the military for his time in Iraq. As one of the previous authors noted, getting stuck in far away places at poor times is just one of the reasons why the military profession is a difficult job. However, I enjoyed the stories about the initial invasion and occupation of Iraq. These stories show how the soldiers lost the hearts and minds of the civilians when they looted and stole from Iraqis. It is hard when Crawford shows how his friendship with a young Iraqi women probably resulted in her, and her family becoming victims.This is a tell all book. There are some light hearted moments and some very serious and sad situations. I am sorry the author's marriage didn't last through his deployment, but the book is a tangible object to show for his suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not a must","review":"This eternally screwed Soldier is called up in the Florida National Guard with 2 credit hours left to graduate. As an infantry soldier, Crawford recounts his various tales of war. Crawford uses the Army institutional permission to gripe to the fullest extent which kind of rubs off onto the readers, but like a good Soldier, politics in this book is minimal - a plus. Recommended, but not a must"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soldiers won't enjoy this book","review":"I read this book while in Afghanistan. John Crawford is a whiny dirtbag who couldn't handle one deployment without being a valium drugged, self-pitying cry baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT","review":"I LOVED Frank!! More important, so did my children. What a refreshing film -- humor that is appropriate for all ages, a feel-good story and family fun. I wish Hollywood would make more movies like this. The acting was great, especially \\"Frank,\\" the little boy, the daughter and the dad! Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Frank","review":"\\"Frank\\" is true family film. Our kids laughed and laughed -- and we did, too. There are many poignant moments and beautiful scenes that make us want to watch it over and over again. You don't need to love dogs to love this movie -- it is for everyone. Go give it a try and share it with your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"This is a great family movie if you have young children and don't want violent or obseen images waking your children up at night. The first five minutes might be slightly scary (just because of the music, and it's dark, and noises are unknown at the time). After that, PERFECT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Pulp Fiction","review":"This book is a very clumsy attempt to update the pulp fiction of Richard Allen's \\"Skinhead\\" series to the modern \\"casual\\" scene that was big in the early to mid-1980s in the UK. Unfortunately, Anderson can't write a lick: the plot is the oldest in the world, and the characters are beyond cardboard. He can't even make the violence and sex at all interesting. Don't you dare waste your time with this. If you want authentic pulp fiction, stick to the master: Richard Allen. If you want interesting fiction about football hooligans, stick to John King's impressive trilogy (The Football Factory, Headhunters, England Away) or Kevin Sampson's Awaydays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"The stones were lightweight, and the words were not carved into them; instead, they were just printed on--and not very well either. The words on two of my stones were faded. The accompanying book contained a haphazardly compiled collection of quotes, and provided no insight to the use of wishing stones. Definitely one of the more lame kits made by Running Press. Puppychu made a wish on the stones, and nothing happened. He was extremely disappointed. The black \\"velvet\\" drawstring pouch is the only redeeming part of this kit, and can be used to hold other small items. Overall, this kit is not worth anybody's time or money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for terrariums!","review":"Although the words were printed a bit haphazardly on a couple of the stones, these worked beautifully for my CHristmas terrarium project.

Sick of the usual blandness you encounter in almost all travel books? Pick up any Cadogan Guide and you'll be entertained even before you travel. The authors are cheeky, to be sure, but I appreciate their willingness to interject their own preferences and opinions, and save me the trouble of visiting a ho-hum attraction.

Barbie was the Gestapo chief responsible for the death of most of Lyons' population, including women and children, during the Nazi occupation of France. After WW II, he cooperated with American intelligence agents, who helped him settle in Bolivia in 1951. Barbie was extradited to France and put on trial in 1987, where he received a sentence of life in prison. You will not find the normal usual footage showing atrocities. Instead he uses his interview skills with those who knew Barbie. This documentary is about 4 1/2 hours, and you will not want to take a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable, but Velcro Straps Might be Trouble","review":"I bought these shoes almost a year ago. They are very comfortable however, the velcro strap gives me trouble sometimes at the gym. It simply won't stay fastened at times and that is a little frustrating when you're trying to do cardio. I have attempted to clean the strap best I can, but of course that is difficult due to the stickiness of the surface. I have yet to try a sticky lint roller to get the job done, but that will be next.. Other than that, worth the money. It feels better than any other sneaker I've bought in the past..

They wear and feel like sneakers, but look a little better when you don't want the full sneaker look. I must admit they are not the most attractive - a little clunky, but the comfort is worth it. They run true to size. I am even able to fit them with my store bought orthotics. In fact, I am going to buy another pair to keep as an extra, just in case they decide to discontinue them.

So I use these to make sure my snowboarding pants are always pulled-up so the hems of my pants are not touching the ground or the snow.These suspenders, in my opinion, are little too wide. But that only adds to its sturdiness.

But there's something wrong about this book, something that -- excuse the bad pun -- defies description. Maybe it is the strange format? Or plain ugly visual design? Maybe it's the peculiar page numbering scheme? Perhaps the stories are less captivating, and the photos too artistic? Might be all of that. However, the most important complaint is that, save for two little photos, there's absolutely no information about Newton's unique GUI. The book glosses over the countless difficult decisions that must have been faced during its inception, instead focusing on yet another Newton stage presentation during yet another computer trade show. Pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful dictionary","review":"With a Google era, seems like a book dictionary is no longer necessary.But I still believe in books.

The jewel box does not say \\"Pearl Jam\\". Jack is a drummer and percussionist. He clearly put much time and consideration into Attention Dimension, and it shows. The other musicians that are on the CD are his friends and colleagues, not marketing fixtures, and they lend texture to a fine album. This is not cookie-cutter music. It is experimental and original. More importantly, it's good. Don't think Pearl Jam/RHCP...think Jack Irons, and listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"First, if you're looking for a sound that resembles Pearl Jam then it's not here, not even close. Eddie Vedder does sing on 'shine on you crazy diamond' and Stone and Flea make some contributions but the album never captures you. It's actually a collection of beats that get old. If you know 'in my tree' from pearl jam, then the whole albums basic sound and rhythm sound like that. He tries to pack the songs with too many sounds that are borrowed from music that's characteristic of sound from all ends of the world. Some may actually appreciate it for its different style, but if you're looking for Rock or Alternative then look elsewhere...I would recommend Stone's album, amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's definitely the Jack Irons show","review":"I purchased the CD thinking that the collection of talent brought together would create some very interesting and great music. No doubt Jack Irons has talent of his own, but he has the Carter Beauford syndrome of always being the center of attention and not blending with the other quite capable musicians. To his credit, the ability to incorporate many instruments is impressive and he was successful in creating a very unique sound. The names on this CD seem to be there for marketing purposes and very little to do with influencing the music.If your a Les Claypool fan, the Frog Brigades version of \\"Shine on your crazy diamond\\" which gives credit to the \\"Jack Irons version\\" is NOTHING like the version on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally useless Index!

I have recommended it to my business school class, and the MEN referred it to other women they know. Vliet gave me the ammunition to say, \\"No, it's not just that I'm getting older, and it's not just that I have young children, it's that something is wrong.\\" I had my hormones tested, and despite lab results showing them to be \\"normal,\\" they were all BELOW NORMAL for optimal function according to Vliet's clinical experience.

This book contains all the information and ammunition necessary to take to our doctors to demand our problems be addressed and treated. Women no longer have to accept the oft repeated \\"It's all in your head\\" comment so many of us have heard all these years. Dr. Vliet not only helps us understand what ails us, and suggests alternatives, she tells us what to look for and what to ask the doctor when we visit. And, she shows us how to listen to our body and to learn that there are things we *can* do to get the help we need.

Completely new Pokemon, some new attacks, great pictures, and some Pokemon even have DARK in front of their name (such as Dark Raichu, Dark Blastoise, and Dark Alakazam.) The only thing that could possibly be better would be if the Pokemon were a little more powerful. For example: Dark Charmeleon only has 50 HP and has an attack that does 70 damage, but it has to discard 1 fire energy NO MATTER WHAT and it has to flip a coin to see if it does damage or not. A fossil Moltres could do much better than that (no offense to Moltres fans.)

Just the right mix of up-tempo with laid back tunes, humor, and sadness. It's been nine years and it is ABOUT TIME, but Webb and the Nashvegans haven't missed a step, and in some ways, they've improved. It all adds up to put a smile on your face, and tap in your toe.

It is truly a mixed-bag, as the above editorial review admits. After expounding on the 'revolutionary' idea that software should be people oriented, it dives into pages of code that lays out an Asp.Net application. It then sandwiches in a C# fundamentals tour, and then dives right into more code. If there is a purpose to this book, I couldn't distill it.

Like the movie, it is intelligently done, but is overlong. I personally saw it largely because I'm a Stones fan, and I wanted to see Mick Jagger in the part that he couldn't complete because he had to go do the Stones 1981 tour. I thought I'd get to see Mick between shots, talking about making the movie. But there Mick is only in the documentary briefly, when clips from scenes he did with Jason Robards are shown. It IS a shame, as Herzog says, that Mick had to leave the movie, because, from these short clips, he does appear to act effectively, and had a charisma that comes across (surprising, because Jagger was so bland, and acted so poorly in the more recent FREEJACK). But the Mick clips are only a few seconds each, and I used the fastforward button for a lot of the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video for getting started","review":"The flexibility of being able to dowload this onto an iPod or any MP3 player is great.

It is cheapened a little by the plastic caps that cover the screws but so what, no one can see them. This is small enough to work well in any space and would be a wonderful house-warming gift (or with this price, an anyday gift for yourself). I definitely recommend this wine rack to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Way to learn Pokemon!","review":"I bought this for my 8 year old son who wanted to learn the game.

The next game is slightly more advanced, and the third one uses all the rules except for advanced.

I tried really hard.","review":"I was pulling for the son and dad sooo much in this story that I tried to look past the weird zombie demons doing human-like stuff and throwing out cheesy one-liners. Zombie animals, zombie birds, zombie fish that can think, talk, and plot out attack scenarios = hard to suspend belief, even for a \\"zombie\\" book.(possible spoilers)There is no hope here. We are strung along through a series of demon zombie vs human battles (which the demons always win) and then our main characters are slaughtered one by one until all humans are dead and the world is over. YAY! I felt horrible for the little boy, who finally gets his dad back, only to lose him during the final confrontation... and then die himself immediately after.The Keene format.Page one. Zombies take over.Page two. All humans die.The end.You just got \\"Keened\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak ending","review":"The ending has been stated in some reviews and while I think that's an unfair thing to do in a review I will say that the ending left me completely angry. It was weak and it violated the characters in my estimation. I can only think that Keene must have somehow either painted himself into a corner or just got tired of writing the story. I read both of these books (The Rising and this one) over the course of a couple of days and I feel like I pushed through all the gore and horrible events depicted in these books only to be completely let down at the end. It's not just that \\"everyone dies\\" it's that their deaths are completely pointless and without any logic at all. Basically, I feel like the ending gives a big, middle finger to the rest of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just walk away.","review":"I had my Iron Chef America moment and put this book down and walked away from the book, series, and author after one of the characters commits a sex act with a captive zombie. Over the line. Too much. Unnecessary. I read the first book in this series, The Rising, and liked it ok, even though I was not particularly thrilled with the possessed style of zombie and the concept of animal zombies. I always love the initial zombie outbreaks and the descent of civilization into chaos.This book starts out ok with the end of Jim's quest to find his son. After that initial scene, the continuous gore did get tedious. When I reached the scene mentioned above, I stopped reading. I usually can't get enough of zombie stories, but this was more than enough. If you are looking for a good zombie read, check out J.L Bourne's Day By Day Armageddon, Recht's Morningstar Strain series, Brooks' World War Z, and Frater's As the World Dies series. Those are the best I've read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother unless you're desperate..","review":"Keene's 'The Rising' was an okay read. 'City of the Dead' is so not. You can't expect much from a writer of throwaway pulp fiction, but you do expect a little more than this. Two-dimensional characters (the ones that are even remotely interesting he kills off quickly), numerous pedantic gross-outs that are totally unnecessary, and sequences that just flat out defy physics in their stupidity...like the Humvee catching up to a faster car, or the driver of the humvee opening a window and using a lighter to make a hairspray flamethrower (LOL) at 80+mph or whatever. Must have been some lighter to withstand that sort of wind pressure. Give me a break. Keene is an okay writer, but this book was pretty atrocious. The bio at the back about publishers bugging him for sequels to The Rising kind of says it all, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mr. Keene's Best Book.","review":"I read all of Mr. Keene's other books first and after reading COTD, I was glad I did. I didn't think this novel compared to his other books, way, way, too dark and depressing. That said, if you want upbeat and happy don't be reading horror books right? But Mr. Keene does it MUCH better in his other books, managing the horror but still not totally turning the reader off. Which he did with me in COTD.The zombies in this book aren't traditional shabby, shuffling, not-too-swift both physically and mentally \\"zombies\\". They are more demons inhabiting the dead bodies. They make for quick action sequences but how do you outwit them? That's the depressing part.Check out Dead Sea, Ghoul, or even Conquerer Worms; all by Mr. Keene and save this one for last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Zombie Tale","review":"This is the sequel to The Rising, one of the better zombie novels of the past few years. The Rising was an average book, with lots of borrowing from classic post apocalyptic tales. Especially McCammon's Swan Song. Keene's zombies are unique, in the fact that dead rise because they are being possessed by cross dimensional demon's that were accidentally released in a failed science experiment. These zombies are relatively intelligent and able to work together. City of the Dead is an upgrade from the first book. The characters are more fleshed out, and less whiney. They've had the time to adjust to the new world, and are starting to figure things out. Keene takes the opportunity to look at human evil and human triumph in this tale, and expand the spiritual concepts the first book only hinted at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"The rising was a fantastic book, lets face it zombies are nearing their saturation point and are everywhere these days but Keene injected some life into this dying genre with talking zombies.The only way to excuse how bad City of the Dead would be to find out that a super fan of the rising kidnapped him and forced him to write this at gunpoint.The story is really bad, the new characters are not even to a cardboard cutout level and everything happens at such a pace that there is no build up whatsoever so when it reaches the action packed climax its very dull.The biggest screw you to the fans is the ending, look saying spoiled this crappy book is like saying I spit in your spoiled milk and now you can't drink it so I will say everyone dies and they die pointlessly.Still there were some really cool ideas but just a crappy mess of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Zombies","review":"At first I thought this was going to be a great book. I love zombies. No one loves zombies more than me.If you love zombies, you will hate this. Zombies are classic and no one should change a classic or you get horrible results like the Resident Evil Movie (Paul Anderson)...This book is really about aliens.I was very excited and very pleased with this book until I got to the part where the \\"zombies\\" started speaking and using mental telepathy to communicate. And then they started driving trucks and cars and forming unions and then the novel came crashing down.It's not really about zombies. It's about aliens. It was misleading and for an alien book it wasn't too bad. But for a zombie book, it was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pointless follow-up to a terrible first novel","review":"I guess some people enjoy crappy writing and reading about characters that you don't care about dying horribly. other wise this clumsy piece of trash wouldn't have been written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes other bad horror novels look good by comparison","review":"I randomly picked this up from a used book store, never having heard of Brian Keene, and I was bored with the book within the first 20 pages. Keene is just a bad writer. No, he's a terrible writer. The characters are cardboard, and their dialogue is so very atrocious that it is difficult to believe that Keene has ever heard another human being speak. I didn't expect much of a plot in a book about zombies, but the constant \\"protagonists threatened by swarming zombies\\" quickly gets boring here. I do like the idea of zombies via demonic possession, but Keene's cheesy dialogue makes the demons as dull as everything else in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL BOOK!","review":"*MILD SPOILER*This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. When reading this book (the sequal to The Rising) I expected there to be some sort of fulfilling ending, but it's just as bad as the first book. I dreaded reading this book when i hit it half way, but i kept on reading cause i thought it would get better...it didn't. instead it got worse. it was a MAJOR drag. save your money please...save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's why...","review":"One star because:it's so stinkin' corny. I don't see the zombie apocalypse happening this way, and I don't see millionaires alerting their bodyguards as to when they want to...well...please themselves (to put it nicely.) I don't see doctors committing sexual acts (by choice) with zombies. It seems to me that Mr. Keene just wanted to write a bunch of crazy stuff in this crazy setting. The zombies being capable of speech makes it less than scary, and I think that's the opposite of what he wanted in writing this book.Two stars because:Bringing a spiritual element into the zombies is a cool twist on it. I also appreciate that he was looking to deviate from the norms of slow-moving, mindless zombies, but at the same time, if they think and reason and speak, they aren't exactly zombies. They're called zombies all through the book, but they're not really. Also, as bad as this book is, I can't bring myself to put it down. It's at least a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian Keene has no idea what makes zombies scary","review":"I bought this book without having read The Rising first. It was a zombie book so I purchased it. The author clearly spent some time trying to find a unique way to present the idea of zombies, and kudos to him. The the problem is, the very idea of smart zombies inherently makes them not something to be feared. Something with intelligence can be reasoned with. Something with intelligence can't turn on its family member, leaving them no choice but to kill the one they love. It's as if Brian Keene focused more on what he felt was an original idea (the notion of clever zombies is not original, and every time someone attempts it, it flops like this book) than a compelling story. I understand it's very hard to find zombie literature, but seriously steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, but . . .","review":"A good sequel to The Rising, but left me unfulfilled in a number of areas. I won't commit any spoilers, but I'll just agree with an earlier reviewer that a number of tantalizing angles were dangled in front of the reader, but were never to be taken up again. At the end I was satisfied, but couldn't help thinking it could have been so much more. A good read and still one of the better pieces of zombie fiction out there anywhere. Wish I could give it 3.5 stars instead of 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it","review":"He continues to amaze me.

When I heard Keene was writing a sequel I was looking forward to it. I read this book in one day. City of the dead was a waste of my time and money. I will not be buying another book written by this author.Too many characters are introduced too quickly. They all die and you really can't care that they do.Keene could have gone down an interesting path with the magic idea but instead he did nothing with it. Why even mention it?I would go into more detail about why I dislike this book so much but I do not want to list any more spoilers than I already have.One good thing I can say about it is that unlike several books I have read recently I did not notice any grammar errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced Gore","review":"Not knowing that the Rising was the 1st instalment, I still continued to read because I could not put it down.

I felt like I was in that skyscraper with the charectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not good at all","review":"I did not care for The Rising but I thought I would read the second book to see how the story ended (since the first book kind of cheated you by ending without a resolution). Unfortunately this book was more of the depressing same and maybe a bit worse. The super intelligent demon-zombies (you know the kind that can talk, shoot guns, fly heliocoptors, make wisecracks etc.) and all of the demon-zombie animals (you know all of the dead birds, squirrels, rabbits, rats, alligators, etc.) kill off everybody. I mean, come on, people do not stand a chance in this scenario where every single thing that dies comes back as a demon-zombie and the book is just basically an excuse to gruesomely kill every character that is introduced. Depressing and unenjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"I really enjoyed this book, the sequel to \\"The Rising\\". I have read a lot of horror over the years. This is certainly not the best written, the most unique, or even the goriest, but it is a fun ride. Lots of action, fairly skimpy plot, but loads of enjoyment. Keene knows how to write action, and he doesn't let up from the first to the last page. This book takes place immediately after the first book. It actually backs up a few moments. The story basically involves humanities last stand in a fortified high rise in New York City. We get a lot of new characters besides those who survived the first book, and we get to learn a lot more about the demons/zombies. The ending is a dark one and it may not be to everyone's taste. I liked it just fine. I get enough of the Hollywood happy endings in my movies, a nice bleak ending is refreshing. Pick up the Rising, and then grab this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Zombie Book","review":"When I read the summary of this book and found that the survivors were hold up in a skyscraper in New York, I didn't see how the author could keep the tension up like he did in the first book \\"The Rising\\", but he did. I'm not sure about the ending, it's sad but justified. I also like the author's explanation of what caused the rising. Overall I would say a good book if you like Zombies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent writing, silly plot","review":"I like Keene's writing. Terminal was great. The Rising was a miss in my book, and so was this. An over the top, not-so-thrilling ride through descriptions of gore and a silly plot. These arent really zombies, they're demons that take over the world in dead people's bodies. There's a master demon who's as dumb as a duck, and all his forces are evil comic-book cutouts gathering around to do whatever OB the demon master says. This is more funny than serious horror, and I did giggle along the way. But, it's not a horror novel. Not scary in the least. It's a silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talking Zombie? No thanks","review":"This is coming from a true zombie-lover who watches all the films and reads all the books. This book was very promising, great intro, great set up, until about 10 or so pages in when they come face to face with a family member while looking for his son.Don't get me wrong, it's fiction, I know, but something about a zombie who not only talks, but reasons, and is well versed? Sorry, that's a no go. I closed this book and got my money back.I did not read the book \\"The Rising\\" so I don't know the set up or if the Zombies were so talkative in that one, but this does not pass go, does not collect two hundred dollars.It's too bad, it has potential.Boo Talking Zombies.

Read this if you read everything and have read The Rising. This one steals from everything that did not get stolen from in the first one.

But this one is even worse. But maybe this is because I'm a fan of George Romero movies. If you like talking zombies that run, are intelligent, and just like normal humans except that they can only die by being shot in the head, then you might like this book. All the animals also become zombies in this book. The story isn't all that great either. Not recommended for true zombie fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZOMBIE FANS STAY AWAY","review":"Brian Keene, if you ever read this, shame on you for calling your creatures zombies! The BIGGEST complaint I have with this book is the false allure of it being a 'zombie' book. IT IS NOT. The 'demons' (I call them demons and not zombies) can think, talk, operate machinery, and are spirits/demons/ententies from another realm or something. The only zombie like thing about them is they eat human flesh. I am a die hard zombie fan. Zombie's can't think, or talk, or reason or use weapons. They are walking mindless corpses. In this book they were not! They were often smarter and more cunning than the people left alive. I just finished this book, and finished The Rising before this one. I say stay away, they were very dissapointing to a true zombie fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst than The Raising!","review":"After readin this two part series I could help but feel like Brian Keene had this written just so he could make a little bit of money. The first book was truly decent. This second one is like.....pulling you in and then loading the shotgun...and then putting it to your head.By the time you finish this book the only thing your going to remember is how much time you wasted.His horrible end leads me to believe he is a complete idiot who only seeks money. As I stated in The Raising review...Brian Keene is not the next Stephen King. He is the next Wes Craven. Someone who thinks they are scary when in all reality thei r plots are more chilling than their twisted writing.THE BOOK ENDS BAD! GO TAKE THE BOOK BACK. WARNING.you have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Zombie Book","review":"This was a pretty good book, but sooooooooooo depressing. Zombie book or not, I like somewhat \\"happy\\" endings.If you like gore and dark endings, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a no-win situation for these survivors.","review":"I wouldn't reccamend this book. The author is too wrapped up in visceral, in your face evil and awful ways to die. There were several points in this book where I was wanting to put it down and forget about it but having paid cover price I soldiered on and finished it. The ending chase and last scene were horrific to say the least but I wasn't terribly moved.\\"City of the Dead\\" is a mediocre story with excessive violence, some extreme sexual devience and too much emphasis on action. In short its not a book i'll look back on fondly.PS -The author Brian Keene does however make himself available to his fans on his own and other horror movie message boards so +1 to him for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Keene is one of the best when it comes to Zombie novels","review":"Once I read \\"The Rising\\" I had to read the sequel immediatelly. \\"The Rising\\" is one of the best zombie novels I've read so far. It puts a new different and scary twist on the Zombie genre, a whole different end of the world. If you are a Horror or Zombie novel fan this 2 books are a most. \\"City of the Dead\\" picks up immediatelly after The Rising ends and puts a new twist on the main caracters (Jim, Martin and Frankie) full of gore and suspense. With a surprise ending just like \\"The Rising\\" I could not put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one was good too!","review":"This book was really, really, good! The ending will shock you! I was very upset at the end of this book, I did not want it to end. Again, great scene setting, great plot, and great suspense.

A must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and not for the faint-hearted reader","review":"I read this book without having readThe Rising. When I got this I chose it because of a recommendation from a friend, without checking that it was the second in the series!I'd meant to try something by Keene for a while, and this was his latest when I went looking.Even though I'd not read the first book, this was enough for me to go out and buy pretty much everything I could get my hands on by this author.I love that the zombie crisis has a background that isn't your typical out-of-control virus.This is not a book for the faint-hearted reader, but definitely a recommendation for die-hard fans of horror and zombies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worth sequel to The Rising","review":"Keene does it again! If you were wondering what happened to Jim, Frankie, Martin, and the rest, this is the book for you. Keene's insane pace is kept up here, with the expected gore but with a few twists, as well as new characters, along the way as well. The book presents a pretty grim picture of the end of the world, and it's an enjoyable read the whole time if you're a fan of the zombie genre in general, or seeing how humanity faces the greatest challenge of them all. The origin of the zombies is dealt with in more detail here and they get a whole lot craftier as well, making things very difficult for our heroes. And God makes and appearance. You'll have to read to find out about that one! Can't wait to read another Keene novel after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail Ob!!","review":"It was a pleasant surprise to read this book. I haven't yet read The Rising, but expect to shortly. As I write this review, I'm watching the new classic \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".

For hygiene and to preserve their elasticity I rotate 4 bandages, and at that they last no more than a year. I was surprised to find this bandage so reasonably priced, about 20% of the Ace.

Indeed it covers the early years up to the Remain in Light-era big band. Musically it is much more interesting that the Stop Making Sense soundtrack. The sound recording is maybe not as nice and Byrne's singing is not as polished. The playing is however much more strong. However the set represented is overall much stronger and it is also quite evident that the Remain In Light band was the best line-up simply. Songs such as The Great Curve are simly great and these versions are actually the definitive ones in my opinion.

I'm glad that they finally did release it, but I have mixed feelings about the release. The additions to the first half from 1977-1979 are definitely an improvement over the LP or tape. The second CD of 1980-1981 adds some mediocre versions of songs in an attempt to reproduce the concert playlist. However, the CD was so long at this point (>77 minutes) that they axed the slow beginning of \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\".

Unfortunately, Colloquial Catalan is a prime example of the very worst Colloquial courses.The main error in this course is the fact that it's exceptionally limited. After completing some of the more extensive Colloquial courses, you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary. Colloquial courses like Colloquial Italian, Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Albanian or Colloquial Icelandic list over 2000 words. The average Colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words. In sharp contrast, Colloquial Catalan doesn't even reach 600 words!In my opinion, the Colloquial courses are often a better option than Teach Yourself courses, but that's not the case with Catalan. Teach Yourself Catalan will teach you more than twice as much as Colloquial Catalan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"Although a cd teaching Catalan is great, it really needs to have the guide in order to use it properly. This is not clear in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Case You Need Any More Convincing","review":"Not only is this one of the cornerstones of any popular music collection, it's just plain fun. Since I finally scored this set, I've just been driving around with it in my car grinning like a fool. No, he's not Segovia but he really COULD play the guitar just like a-ringin' a bell."},{"rating":"2","title":"3-CD Chess Boxed Set ~ Chuck Berry","review":"Chucky Berry is a an amazing rock and roll artist and this 3 cd box set is a must have for people that love this kind of music. Chucky Berry has surprisingly good vocals and his lyrics are right on the mark without being verbose and therefore sounding trite. The box set is well done but the book-lets have no information in them but the photos in them more then make up for this. The cover art is also adequate but it could have been so much better made. The photo is nice enough but the rest of the cover looks boring as if the record company did this as an after thought. Even so this is a very nice collection of Berrys tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Weak Track Here.","review":"Quite possibly the best box set I have. None of this grows tiresome, the music sounds more vital every time I listen to it. Highly recommended for anyone who loves impeccibly crafted rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive...almost!","review":"Some previous reviewers have said that this box includes every great Berry song...they're wrong. It would be perfect if it weren't for the inexplicable omissions of \\"Don't You Lie To Me\\" and \\"I Got To Find My Baby\\". There would also have been room for \\"Route 66\\"...I must say that 'Anthology' does an excellent job in boiling this 3 CD set down to 2, AND it contains \\"Don't You Lie To Me\\" as well as \\"I Got To Find My Baby\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is a Concert DVD Impossible?","review":"Wouldn't it be nice to put on a McCartney dvd and actually watch a concert? The substantial number of Mac's dvd releases are the same... song performances that often interrupt the talking heads. Interviews in 5.1 are really neat though."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Time, Paul, to Take a Sad Format and Make It Better","review":"I own all of Paul's concert videos, and this one is--by far--the worst of the lot. The music is fabulous, but the format is awful. It's time for Paul to provide a bona fide concert video. \\"The Space within Us\\" is outright tedium, with very few actual shots of the band performing the songs. For the most part, the DVD consists of celebrities and pseudo-cultural theorists talking about McCartney's readily obvious impact upon world culture. And then there are the ceaseless images of fans in various states of ecstasy.What we really want to see, Paul, is the concert itself. The rest is extraneous. And don't even get me started on the astronauts. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've got a feeling....","review":"I've got a feeling that if you own his live DVDs from the last 2-3 tours, you've seen it before. To make EVERYONE happy (since someone mentioned that there is so much more than \\"just the concert\\" with this release), Paul should copy what was done with \\"Concert for George\\".Disc 1: Paul's version w/fan interaction & extrasDisc 2: Complete Concert w/no fans or voice overs...This way, you'd get a) the concert that you remember and b) the extras that only Paul can provide. It doesn't seem that difficult, & real fans would pay the extra 5-10 bucks for the 2nd disc...Gotta wait for the concert video from the 2007 tour I guess:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to relive an incredible evening!","review":"I was fortunate enough to attend one of the concerts on Paul's 2005 tour, and this DVD wonderfully captures the energy of the evening. Paul and his band are in top form - and I don't know why people are complaining about the amount of audience shots. It's called \\"The Space Within US\\", and the theme of the whole thing is, well, \\"US\\", so it's perfectly natural to have many shots of the audience. Besides, we all know what Paul looks like - let's see his effect on his audiences! (And I'm not just saying this because you can see me applauding wildly at the end of \\"Penny Lane\\"!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of PAUL please!","review":"I was privileged to attand one of the concerts on that tour. Having a not so good seat (though I was thrilled just to be there) I was so hoping that I would be able to see more of him on the video. I was extremely disappointed in that there was less of Paul and more of the concert goers, backstage scenes, interviews with people I really didn't care to listen to (ESPECIALLY 3 of Bill Clinton). Except for the fact I did get to see him sing a few songs, it was not worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"As a Macca fan, I've bought all his music on vynil records, cd, vhs and dvd, and it'been great!!!!But now, with the appearance of blu ray, it is more than that!! Perfection has been reached.It is really amazing to enjoy image and sound!!!! I hope \\" The space within us\\" is just the begining.I hope to find more Macca stuff in BD, very soon!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one star and I've not even seen it","review":"I will wait until I PERSONALLY hear from someone who's seen this DVD before I lay down dollars to purchase it. Why? Because I'm sick and tired of Paul McCartney videos where half the footage is of the audience wiping tears from their eyes and fawning all over the guy. John Lennon would have NEVER done that kind of thing. Paul, your music is fantastic and I have all your released audio stuff. However, until you get your DVD act together, I'll stick with the CDs. Sorry pal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great song selection - The execution is the problem...","review":"McCartney rummages through his old songs and manages to come up with an appealing set-list: \\"For No One\\", \\"I Will\\", \\"Too Many People\\", \\"I've Got A Feeling\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and many other that have not received a proper live treatment.The problem is one that McCartney has been struggling with form many years, his voice is simply trashed for most of the performance. Rather than hitting the high notes he ends up yelling / screaming in time with the music.There are a few complete bummers too. \\"Flaming Pie\\" has always been a nothing wink-wink nonsense song written to cash in on a famous Lennon expression. New tracks like \\"English Tea\\", which is funnier than Spinal Tap's \\"Cups and Cakes\\", and \\"Jenny Wren\\" make you wonder when he stopped trying to write interesting music.If you're a huge McCartney fan, it might be worth a rental at the video store, but there's nothing here worth watching more than one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another emotional journey from Paul","review":"Just when you think you've been emotionally spent by Paul, he tugs on yet more heartstrings -- this time, by doing two \\"John\\" songs, Please Please Me and I'll Get You. Perhaps on his next tour, he'll pull out all the stops and do \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" -- but this collection is great and, unlike his last, gives you complete songs. Lots of commentary by luminaries such as President Clinton, but these do not intrude (too much) on the flow of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concert LIVE, great singer, great band, great songs...","review":"... but the A&E preview was enough to make me steer clear... I agree with all the other low-star reviews: pretentious, painful weeping soccer moms, two second cuts, few shots of band (never sustained), ugh... I could go on... It was a great show to see, but I guess we'll have to wait a couple decades before someone with taste and good judgement can re-edit these shows ~ Paul is obviously clueless and yes, his insecurities are bottomless..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A concert DVD without a real concert!","review":"I feel like I bought the \\"Back in the US\\"DVD all over again!! I should have played it safe and borrowed or rented this one!This was more documentary than anything else. Don't waste your time or money with this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?? Why doesn't Dolby 5.1 work???","review":"Pop this baby in the 'ol BluRay player and... What the heck?? Why does the audio sound soo dull? I'm talkin' extremely weak, flat, and NOT Dolby 5.1. Sure, you can select 5.1 audio in the setup menu, but the reality is you'll only hear stereo. And very dull, lifeless stereo at that. Somebody should lose their job over this oversight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Very disappointing, it is not a film of a concert, but a film about a concert tour. A few concert highlights in the middle of a poorly done documentary. It is more like a film student class project rather than a commercial product. The audience shots were of the people who ruin the experience for all around them. This further ruined the film of Paul's great performance. I saw the concert in Philadelphia and it was unforgettable. Why they could not show that concert unedited I will never understand. That would be a 5 star DVD. This is a lost opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Blu-Ray dissapointment","review":"Good video, sad audio. Instead of recording the audio with surround in mind, it sounds like they tried to re-mix the 2-channel into make believe 5.1. It didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I'm watching it right now and those annoying audience shots and pseudo documentary clips backstage are included as per the norm of all his tour videos. They even have a complete random family followed by a camera, kind of creepy actually. And the common people being interviewed well, I can do with out that too...sorry if any of you people reading this are some of the selected few who are on the DVDIt would be nice to have another Rockshow type DVD but I think Paul likes to show the backstage bit so to make it more personable. I'm also sure he sang \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" cus someone in the audience had a sign up.Go out and buy it its not that expensive so why not, a cheap indulgence if nothing else. OH and he plays all the songs from start to end. And no Heather clips either, Thank God for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The consistant entertainment of the \\"Super Beatle\\"","review":"I have always been a fan of Paul McCartney and of course the biggest fan of the Beatles. Paul again with his great fellow musicians do a stellar job of all the wonderful songs on this disk. McCartney again exudes enthusiasm , defies the age of time with his youthful yet appropriate movements and production to bring wonderful memories.The musicianship and phrasing of all the music is fantastic.The intermitant fan shots are emotionally charged and are so appropriate. Rick Wiebe Morden, Manitoba"},{"rating":"1","title":"some scenes pathetic","review":"Don't get me wrong, the music is superb, watching him play \\"follow me\\" is perfect, but I don't understand why they had to waste 15 min. in a lame family going to the concert, taping all the steps, from the preparing to meeting Paul, I just couldn't watch that clip.The audience, oh my god, how many takes do I have to watch to realise that people love him.I would really like to watch a steady cam on a tripod aiming only to the band, that's all I'm asking, no extras, no interviews, only an entire concert without cuts.I went to The Joint Las Vegas to see him and most of the people are not like the ones on the dvd, they enjoy, how many time did the camera man had to waste to tape that kind of audience, just not enjoyable.About the music, superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ME Tour","review":"Paul calls this the \\"us\\" tour at one point on the DVD. Rather it should be called the \\"ME\\" tour. Basically this is a collection of fan reaction shots interpersed with sound bites from personalities who are supposed to impress on us the importance of Paul to modern civilization. Oh yes, there are a few shots of Paul playing, but I don't remember any close ups and the camera never stays on him for even a full sentence during a song. Apparently, it is too important to show more fans in ecstasy, on ecstasy, or whatever, for us to actually watch Paul performing.Okay, Paul, we get it. We are supposed to like you. Maybe we could like you more if you didn't keep reminding us and just let us watch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your $","review":"I just watched this DVD for the 1st and last time. I don't know which I dislike more: the abbreviated play list, the constant cuts to audience faces, or the split second editing cut as if it were done on a roulette wheel. If you have never owned a McCartney DVD try 'Back in the US' or 'In Red Square'. I've watched both several times, and will watch them again.I was at the show at the Pond in Anaheim, GREAT SHOW! My family loved the new pyro in 'Live and Let Die'. It was awsome. Our favorite songs were 'Band on the Run' and 'Hey Jude'. Couldn't wait to see it all on the DVD. Between each song (and there were 35 that night!) Paul would give some insite into how he wrote the next song...or some little thing that made you feel lucky to be there. None of this is on this DVD.Save your $"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost like being there again!","review":"Saw Paul in DC Oct 8,2005, was so excited that they were coming out with a DVD of my experience. While he sang for 3 hrs here, the DVD I see is just less than 2 hrs so not sure what will or will not be on it. I too could have done without the interviews & just had straight concert footage. Yes, he sung \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" on this tour which was awesome, whether it will be on the DVD..we'll see! Such a wonderful memory finally seeing Paul in person after 30+ years of loving him, can't wait for the DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY FAR AWAY!!","review":"Paul... is so crafty and controlling! and dosen't even know how to make a real live dvd... still needs to take lessons from THE EAGLES!! Stay away from this disaster!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok maybe I'm overrating this but...","review":"Like the main reviewer states 'this is a Beatle we're talking about here'. Also, this is getting pretty bad reviews recently and it's not really a bad DVD at all. I am biased because I have seen him in concert and it is really an experience. I don't mind the interviews and the audience footage, I think it's fun.I think I could make two recommendations though: Why doesn't Paul release more audio CD's of his recordings? That would be even more of a bonus for us fans. Back in the US was a success and I think Red Square and this one need audio companions. One other thought: MORE WINGS stuff next time. I'd like to hear stuff from the Venus and Mars/London Town era too. That would be nice... just a couple thoughts..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again- \\"The focus on the fan...\\"","review":"Yet another of McCartney's endless ego trips, with the false modesty that it's all about \\"US\\", the fans. Sure the music sounds great and he plays many songs we haven't seen live before. But the concert is directed with the same painfully annoying cutaways of the audience as his last two concert films. This time we get to see more fawning celebrities paying homage to Sir Paul and gee whiz, folks- interviews with real everyday folks crying and letting us know that Paul loves them. I love the unintentional laugh and irony of the \\"fan\\" saying that underneath Paul is really a humble, everyday guy, you just have to look really hard! Will McCartney's depthless insecurity ever be satisfied?So far, Paul has dismantled the Soviet Union- and with this one, he claims to be saving family relationships through his music. I feel good in a special way!Oh, where is John Lennon when you need him most?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor with ADHD","review":"This is a useful movie to show to budding film (especially documentary) editors about how overzealous editing can destroy good footage. The viewer is never given more than a few seconds before it cuts away to another angle, or worse, another audience shot.A particularly egregious example of sophomoric editing is seen during Eleanor Rigby, when the stage is superimposed on endless faces from the audience, presumably \\"all the lonely people\\".Every song is followed by interviews with people (some famous, like Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, and others less so) who endlessly mouth platitudes about how great Paul McCartney is.I fervently hope that at some point in the future someone will use the high-def concert footage with excellent sound quality to put together another more watchable disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A&E- LET IT BE!","review":"I saw Paul during this tour - I was so excited when this DVD came out, and was really let down.I wanted to see a Paul McCartney DVD, not a bunch of people talking about how timeless Paul is. I'M A BEATLES FAN - I KNOW THAT ALREADY!The lowlight of the film is when A&E; decides to cut away from 'Let it Be,' the post beautiful performance of the show I was at, and show Bill Clinton talking about Paul. WHO CARES?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make The Next One A Concert DVD.","review":"EVERY McCartney concert video has the same format(fast paced montage of four seconds shots,dozens of zoom in-out and around and audience shots of moslty well endowed pretties, and ecstatic people, commentaries who makes you feel like you're witnessing the second coming).The music is great,the band is youthfull and energetic and the performances are often inspired,so please give us a well produced concert like so many other rock performers put out(Concert for George,Gilmour,Clapton,Chili Peppers,etc...).O.K, the bi-polar in me still loves this concert because of the great songlist,the very much rockier arrangements ,guitar heavy sound and fantastic drummer. This younger band has given Paul a major energy boost compared to his previous touring band with Robbie McIntosh and Hamish Stewart.So,it sure ain't going to please everyone,but i watched it three times already. It has to mean something no??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much focus on the audience","review":"Paul and his band give a great a performance but i couldn't make it through the whole video and would definitely not recommend it. For some reason the director decided to spend more time shooting the audience than the band. It is annoying to say the least. I didn't buy this video to see the middle aged audience members smiling and dancing around, I bought this concert dvd thinking I was going to see the show. The director failed miserably and should be flogged in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Macca--Way Less Audience","review":"I have watched this DVD once and will never watch it again. It follows the same format as all of Paul's concert DVDs--way too many audience shots, especially the blonde young chicks. How did they get there anyway? I want to see Paul McCartney. Paul isn't going to tour forever, so please put out one decent tour DVD in your career. This one is going to a friend. I can't stand the pain of watching it. It took me days to watch it. That is how bad it is and I'm a big time fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next best thing to seeing him in person","review":"I have to admit Paul has never been my favorite Beatle. Paul however is the last of the Beatles who wrote music.I do enjoy many songs Paul has written with the Beatles, with Wings and as a solo performer.What you have here is history. Paul McCartney and John Lennon are the two greatest composers/writers of the last century.This is a chance to see one of the Masters displaying why he is so popular and fameous.Paul opens the show with Hello, Goodbye and it just goes uphill from there.Another thing that was cool was how he ended a song with Foxy Lady, the old Jimi Hendrix tune.He does Beatles classics like Got to get you into my life and Penny Lane, among others.To me the hightlight of the show was when he did Jenny Wren and English Tea for the current album.He also closes the show with Yesterday and other big hits from the Beatles days.This is not as good as seeing him in person, but it is the next best thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back and Forth Camera Action Makes Me Dizzy","review":"Great performances! Paul and the band are kicking it, alright! They couldn't be any better. Too much back and forth camera work from stage to audience and back makes it hard for me to watch, however. Keep it on the stage more, next time. Paul is nice to look at and so are the others in the band! I'm glad I got it, though. The music makes it all worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointed Paul Mc Cartney Dvd","review":"I have been ordering items from Amazon for a long time and this is the first time I have been very upset with the item I orderd. The Paul Mccartney Dvd in blue ray was a gift for my husband for Christmas. He was very excited to watch it. When we all sat down on Christmas night and started the Dvd, it skipped and froze for the first 3 minutes. No matter how may times we started it over and cleaned it and tried it never would play the right way. I called amazon and they sent me a replacement dvd which was also very bad. After the 2nd one I just wanted my money back. DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM and if you do then prepare to be disapointed. I Think the whole batch that was copied was bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Shines On","review":"Well, he's done it again. Paul McCartney pulls my heart strings and I just can't stop crying. It sure makes it hard to sing the lyrics along with him. I'm a mess.My husband and I have been Paul McCartney fans since 1964, I was 10, Bruce was 14. We are now so old, but... so is Paul. Wouldn't want to make this journey without him. He just keeps getting better and better.His whole crew is so happy to be around him; it must be pretty awesome.The audience participation was wonderful, the close-ups are all people crying and singing and kissing each other.

The list is incredible, the emotions are sky high.

Also, mixing it with milk as recommended makes it WAY too rich. It also has an odd texture, it's not very smooth or creamy. It's really like the powder doesn't fully dissolve in the milk. Also, I think heating milk in the microwave and adding it to anything always tastes bad. Better on the stove, but who has time for that in the morning. Anyway, totally not worth the price.

The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk. Did they meant 4 tsp?

The publisher, Kluwer, prints a lot of PhD dissertations - which is what this book looks like.If you have a good foundation in the basics of modern electronics, you'll learn a lot about sigma-delta and low power analog design.

It almost makes me wonder if this is the cover art intended for some other book. The other book was probably better, too.Planet of the Damned was a short book, which is one of the few nice things I can say about it. I am usually quite easy to please but this book's plot was pointless, the characters were pointless...

It does the job painlessly. There is no science involved in setting it up and it is software or manually controlled. I have really enjoyed this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble switching USB","review":"I liked the price and compact form factor of this KVM, and it switched the video well and quickly, but it was always slow and temperamental when switching the USB. Sometimes, I had to toggle it a couple times before the USB would properly connect and the light quit flashing. But this degraded to where it would cause the laptop to get into very wierd modes, with erratic mouse behavior. This required switching to a different USB port, and increasingly so, even rebooting the laptop. So I finally scrapped it and replaced it with this 4 port versionIogear GCS634U MiniView 4-Port USB KVM Switch. Though more expensive, it's working much better so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"Ive had this for about 5 months and have had no problems.

This setup works great and ive had no problems with the switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for a while","review":"This KVM switch worked adequately for a while. One laptop and one desktop each running XP Pro. About every 20 times I booted a machine it would \\"loose\\" the mouse. Resetting was difficult. After 9 months of use, one channel no longer transmitted the blue signal to the display (red and green were fine). The failure was in the device, not the cables. Pay a few bucks more and buy a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice KVM for Windows, Mac and Linux plateforms","review":"This KVM performs well on switching between Windows, Mac and Linux plateforms. Very little delay on the switching. Also flashing LED to indicate the switching on the going is a good plus too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly slow, works sometimes","review":"This switch takes about 10 seconds to switch from one computer to the next, this is unacceptably slow. Other KVM switches have no trouble switching in <1sec, so if you're used to switching back and forth a lot, avoid this product.The hotkey feature only works part time between Windows XP boxes, sometimes you have to hit the key (double-scrl-lock) multiple times, which gets really annoying after several missed switches.Also, the hotkey switch only works one-way between a Linux and a Windows box (can't switch back to Windows, you have to use the button on the KVM switch), so this is a non-starter.The switch doesn't allow you to program a different hotkey, it's all burnt-in, take it or leave it.This junk goes right back to Amazon as we speak. Avoid this product, get something decent for a few dollars more if you use it on a regular basis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 1.5 hours --- piece of junk","review":"Installed.

I've used Amazon for years and have never reviewed products before as I am usually satisfied with the products I purchase. However, this KVM switch has got to be one of the worst products I have ever come across. I've used this product for about 3 months and it barely is usable as a KVM switch. Where to start? For starters, the USB connection cuts in and out frequently, the actual switching takes a few minutes on some occasions and every now and again I am force to do a hard shutdown as the KVM fails to respond (even Windows will complain the USB connection has failed). I'll stop here to keep the review short. Avoid this product, spend a few bucks more on a decent KVM switch. This is a cheapo product by a company looking to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable KVM at a Great Price","review":"Great KVM for the price.

I ended up getting a ConnectproUR-12-PRO 2-port USB 2.0 KVM Switch with Cableswhich worked very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlucky with this one","review":"I am disappointed at this product. I bought one about 10 days ago. It started to be working just fine. But within a day, it began to switch to the other box without any reason. I switched it back, kept on working and it switched back again.Then I thought I may be just unlucky to get a defect one so I asked Amazon for a replacement, and it came in the 2nd day (solute to Amazon). Put the 2nd one in, and it did the same thing. I read another comment that it could have something to do with docking station so I removed the laptop from it, and unfortunately it's still doing the same thing.I don't know what's the problem, but it seems to be only switching to one machine, not other way around. I even switch the cables to different ports. And that did not help.I will try a few more days to see if I can figure out. But it all seems that I will eventually return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I have found this product to be unreliable. It switches from my windows XP machine to the Linux machine. When switching back, the keyboard and mouse input often do not resync. It doesn't happen every time, but quite frequently. Sometimes unplugging and replugging cables works, but usually I have to do a hard reboot of the windows machine. I recommend trying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating problem with this switch.","review":"I rolled the dice when I bought this cheaper KVM switch. I wish now that I would have purchased a more expensive one.The unit seems to be designed ok, the cables are long enough and hook up was pretty simple. The owners manual and documentation are pretty good and the Trendnet website is somewhat helpful if needed.The problem that I've had with this unit is that it will switch without cause. I'll be working on one computer, with the other one shut off, and all of the sudden the KVM starts switching back and forth between the two computers. Sometimes it won't stop and won't settle on a computer at all, it just keeps flashing back and forth.I didn't install the Trendnet supplied software because the manual that came with the KVM said that the switch would operate fine without it and that the software was for \\"advanced features\\".I would not recommend this KVM switch. I would recommend spending a little more money on a switch with better ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware of its big hidden limitation","review":"For me, the problem with this specific model of USB KVM switch as opposed to my old switch that used PS2 connectors is that it won't keep the USB connection alive when you switch away from either of the PCs.Since it dismounts the USB devices (keyboard and mouse) every time you switch away and then remounts the devices when you switch back, there is a good chance the devices will lock up. The instances of this happening occur more and more frequently as time goes by, and each time it happens the mouse and keyboard freeze up leaving me no choice but to reboot the machine.It's cheap for a reason. Skip this model and look for a switch that will always keep the USB connections alive on both machines no matter which PC you're using."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead","review":"Dead out of the box. Did not matter how I hooked up the monitor and/or keyboard, and trying other monitor and other keyboard, nothing switched. Very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like most TRENDnet products, it's borderline junk","review":"I've gone to this brand a number of times based on their features and price point. And I've been disappointed nearly every time. This unit makes no exceptions. Switching between computers is marginal sometimes requiring rebooting the power on the unit or, unplugging and replugging. I've tried it with PC and Mac and it's even worse with the Mac. Better units fake that the device is still connected when you switch computers so your computer doesn't think it's gone. Also, the buttons to switch computers get flaky after limited use. Save up your money and buy a higher quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this for Computer Shops","review":"I purchased this KVM switch for a second KVM based on newer computers that do not have PS2 slots on them. I have a QVS KVM switch that is PS2 based and it has worked fine for years.However I have found this one to be seriously lacking in the field of computer repair, as I am constantly swapping computers out on my bench. I am sure this one would work fine on computers that will be hooked up to it for a mesure of time. But for test bench uses it never works on the keyboard and mouse. I have to always hook a seperate keyboard and mouse up to the computer to get windows to load, then once it loads, it detects the KVM's Keyboard and Mouse, and I can use it just fine. I blame this short coming on the fact it only has one USB cord that hooks up to the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with docking stations","review":"I purchased this to switch monitor, keyboard and mouse between a desktop and a laptop with a docking station.

Trendnet TK207K can ONLY use 4 ft cables so I can not use it for my set up.No where did it say anything about the cables being 4 ft long or that longer cables could not be use with this KVM. In fact they go to great lengths to hide this fact. I searched the net looking for a new KVM as I gave my old one to my grandson. Cable length of others are 6 ft so I gave it no thought when I did not see a length listed. When I opened the box and found 4 ft cables I went to the site to find longer cables. There I found no cables listed for the TK207K, though some longer cables were listed for other KVMs. On the FAQ page I found that the only supported length of cable was 4 ft. An inquiry to support gave me the answer that 4 ft was the longest length I could use with this KVM."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Stopped working after 3 months - that can't be good.

OSX will also work once, then never pick up the keyboard or mouse again. The Linux box is Command-line only, but does seem to recognize the keyboard properly on multiple takes.The buttons on top are fine and nice. And the screen switching is solid and effective, if predictably slow. I never could get the windows hotkey or keyboard-based switching to work, for some reason.

When switching to Windows 98, control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly. However, when switching to the XP OS, control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds. I also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one USB port on the PC. It frees up a port. Using the Numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch. It also has buttons on the device itself to select which PC to control.I rate this product 5 stars. When I posted the first time, I thought I put 5 stars; but I must have accidentally selected 2.

But they cannot salvage this turkey. The plot is obvious, the sets cheap and flimsy, the language never convincing, and the dreadful, tedious, and completely uninteresting Carmen Chaplin makes a overwhelmingly telegraphed romance not only unbelievable but implausible.Nice costumes, but this is a lame film, never really addressing its \\"theme\\" and containing all sorts of mysterious and silly developments that are never utilized.

In the end though, I feel that Rysdyk's recording is the better choice.There are two things that I really don't like about this cd:The first is the metallic quality of the drum sound, which reminds one of a synthesizer. Rysdyk's drums have a deep, cavernous quality that is simply wonderful, specially if you listen to them with earphones on. Strange to say, the drums on this cd are strident. There is no space in the sound in which your spirit can move.The second problem is the constant background incantation.What I take to be some kind of prayer to the spirits sounds so eerie and ghostly that I couldn't listen to this cd for more than a few minutes. I was afraid of becoming possessed or attracting some unwelcome visitors from the lower planes.So think twice before buying this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I'm a musician (singer/songwriter/guitar player), and I bought this CD based on two reviews which sounded very appealing. I was expecting to hear clear chanting behind the drums but could barely make out any chanting at all except perhaps for some very vague, and low-volume background noise. With the exception of the \\"Call Back\\" at the very end of the CD, the drumming for the most part retains the same beat for the entire length of the CD which is okay at first but becomes quite monotonous. As far as I know, they could have drummed for two minutes and then simply created a continuous loop. I wish I could get all of my money back on this one but fear that I will have to pay for return postage. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent support for the solo-journeyer","review":"With the help of an excellent shamanic teacher, I discovered (or more accurately, reconnected with past-life experience) the joy of trance journeying aided by steady drumming.

Then one day, up pops an Amazon recommendation for Drumming to Journey By---and it's designed by the author of The Reluctant Shaman, a book of which I am very fond. This CD quickly became an invaluable tool for my self-discovery.In the liner notes, Kay mentions that crystal singing bowls were activated by the drumming as the CD was recorded. My conscious self tried to hear the bowls and couldn't, but on my very first journey, I entered a cavern lined in crystals which began to vibrate with the drum-beats; THEN I could hear the crystals singing.

It is all about correction and not communication and teamwork. I hate to remember the things I did to dogs under Koehler's direction. You start the training by presenting a sudden distraction to the dog and then you drop the 25' long line (holding its end loop to your chest) and then run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. The object is to flip the dog over backwards. I wonder how many dogs' neck vertebrate were permanently crippled doing this. To teach a difficult dog not to chew objects in the house Koehler recommends putting big pieces of the destroyed item in the back of the dog's mouth and then you tape the dog's mouth shut and leave them gagging for way too long.

I have seen so many dogs turned either vicoius or neurotic by using Koeler's methods, I am 100% sure this is not the way to go. I refer to the Koeler methods as the \\"Short-Tempered\\" method for training a dog. By punishing a dog before it has a chance to learn what is expected of it, it creates stress and confusion, thereby making it impossible for the dog to learn anything. I find his methods for dealing with handler agressive (fearful????) dogs particularly objectionable, as they will cause a dog reacting out of fear to go into full blown attack mode and possibly seriously injure the handler. The average pet owner cannot discern betweeen an animal acting out of domanance and one acting out of fear.

The Conqueror Worms revisits that same world, incorporating that short story into it's second act, but adding an engaging story about an old man watching the waters rise around the mountain where he dwells.I found this novel thoroughly engaging and read it in two days. It avoids unnecessary characterization or dialogue. There were no slow or boring parts. I really don't have any criticisms. Granted, it's not super-sophisticated, but that's not what I was after.

It is extremely heartfelt, especially \\"Wasteland,\\" about drug addiction and the surrounding struggle it entails.

It's in a class all it's own. You will not find another album quite like this one. I've followed the band from the beginning and am most certainly not dissapointed with the major label debut. Seems a little more radio friendly than the pre-label work but is most certainly the most rocking album out especially that has lyrics that actually mean something. Jesse's lyrics speak for themself.

That is rediculous and now I am pissed. But to the business at hand here. This album is nothing special, except for Wasteland. That song is one of my favorite songs to hit the airwaves in recent years. Trust me though, all their focus and energy was on this one damn song. Every other song on here is so boring that you will need a nap after you listen to it. All of this has been done before, 10 Years is a fraud and I am ashamed that they are from my state of Tennessee. If you want a good band from Tennessee, check out COPPER, you 10 Years fans will be blown out of the water.

I just don't think this band has what it takes to stay around long. I've been wrong before, but I think it's the lack of 'excitement factor' here. The album sorta rocks OK, but it's not hitting me like say Seether's last album. Sure it's different music than Seether, but 10 Years actually sound like a handful of other groups I've heard recently, and unless they try more variety, they may be a one hit wonder band."},{"rating":"2","title":"not tool","review":"first off how can you compare these guys to Tool or APC? Tool is unique and has it's own sound. even APC has a different sound as to Tool. That's what i like about 10 years, they are unique and fresh. Great lyrics, great music, what else do you need. But yeah u just don't compare anybody to Tool. they are their own sound. 10 years have their own sound as well so listen and judge for yourself, stand out tracks: \\"Wasteland\\", \\"Through The Iris\\" and \\"Prey\\" all great.

I hope these guys continue to make beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I heard this band on the radio recently","review":"I immediately heard the Maynard Keenan vocal.But what was so surprising is how this vocalist pulls it off so smoothly.WHo else can sound almost identical to Maynard?Not many.Who can sound just like Trent Reznor?Not anyone I have heard.I think the music is thought provoking and effective.I do think of APC and Tool,however who else can copy these two bands this well? and at the same time?I dont think anybody else can do it as good as this band.Their music is good maybe not totally original,but hey I wish I could pull this off like Jesse does.I sing and I can pull off Daughtry,Matchbox and Creed pretty well,but there is just something about Maynards style and tone and vocal quality.And this guy nails it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No such thing as an unbiased opinion...","review":"Alright everyone...I personally rate Tool as my favorite band. After careful listening to The Autumn Effect...yes, i do see some similarities between the two bands.I don't think he sounds like maynard, but he does have a SIMILAR style to maynard's post-aenema work. The musicianship, on the other hand is very different. Some similar techniques used in some timing and contrasting of sounds. The actual styles used though are entirely different...nowhere close to the drum work of daney carey and nowhere near as much repitition or buildup in the guitars as tool uses.That aside...i would compare 10 Years with bands like chevelle with some prog rock/metal influences. The end result is a blend of many familiar sounds very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good!","review":"I really enjoy this CD. The guitar work is pretty good, and the drumming is pretty well layered in with all the instruments. The bass work is difficult to hear, though. I think the bass work could use some improvement so it isn't drowned out by all the other instruments.I like just about all songs on this CD (except maybe \\"Wasteland,\\" because it has been extremely overplayed).Great CD. Worthy of the money I spent for it and worthy of 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique among the common","review":"Unlike other hard rock acts that have entered the rock scene in the past couple of years, 10 Years brings a unique sound to the table. Fortunately for them, the sound is distinct enough that fans will recognize any new releases without having to wait for a DJ to tell them.The Autumn Effect brings a mix of sounds, ranging from angst-filled and hard to solemn and meaningful. I especially like tracks 1 & 2, 5 (the first release, Wasteland), 6 (one of those meaningful songs I mentioned), and the way the album ends. All in all, I rank this disc right up there with bands like Seether and Shindown, offering a unique sound among the common hard rockers of the past few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Perhaps Disturbed has 10 Years touring with them to make themselves sound better? Not that Disturbed needs anyone to make themselves sound better. But 10 Years could use some help.There is a familiar sound, like maybe Chevelle or Staind, to The Autumn Effect. That would be a compliment to some bands maybe, but 10 Years sound like they have put together a collection of what could be covers of the song-rejects from those bands' CDs.I bought this on Impulse after I heard the decent song Wasteland on Sirius radio and I also found out that they were touring with Disturbed. So 10 Years' The Autumn Effect just had to be good...it had to be...right? Well...the Autumn Effct is Nu Metal at its most generic. Very boring. A disk where the tracks all sound so much alike that you wouldn't even know that the track had changed if not for the numbered track indicator on your player.Absolutely nothing new here.Sorry, fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Maynard James Keenan please stand up?","review":"I can't believe it's not A Perfect Circle!

Broaden your horizons and break free from listening to the same old crap on top 40 radio.

THEY COULD NEVER EVEN DREAM OF BEING HALF AS TALENTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"How'd these guys get a record deal?","review":"I don't know how anyone can listen to this and not fall asleep! 10 Years could be a good band if they tried a bit harder, but they've got a few major hurdles to overcome before they get there.First, they need to stop emulating other bands, most notably, 30 Seconds to Mars and A Perfect Circle. You're better off picking up one of their albums, including 30STM's new one on August 30th. Wearing you influences on your sleeve would be a forgivable offense for a young band if they had any songwriting talent at all. The songs themselves fall flat, and are totally bland and unmemorable. They pretty much just plod along predictably, not really making an impression. They never really go anywhere except where you expect, and that's not what good rock is about.Bottom line, these guys are just plain boring.

However, when he would do comparisons to our more current presidents, i.e., latter half of the 20th cent., and into the 21st cent., Widmer would match Van Buren's positive achievements with democrat presidents, and the not so glorious moments, more so, with the republican presidents. My opinion. Personally, I don't need that woven into a historical book about a president. I just want the history of the president at the time. He also liked to use a lot of words that most people do not know the meaning of, or probably have never even heard. I think maybe he was trying to impress? Personally, I did not have a problem with this. I actually found it educational. That is, I had my iPhone alongside my Kindle, and I would ask Siri for the definition. Of course if a person reads Widmer's book this way, it will be more time consuming. Aside from this, it was an informative book.Scarback"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO EXPENSIVE","review":"This lamp is 19.99 on Target.com and even less expensive in Ikea.

This video manages to it all, and then some.If it's not the fake helicopter sounds it's the biased \\"narrators\\" making false claims/comments to what is happening.

Otherwise avoid this steaming pile of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"this documentary open up on netflix, it sounded like an interesting one to watch, boy was I wrong. First all the vids they show are really old nothing past the rodney king beating and the LA riots which is the last one they show.

Then I realize it was just two guys making the worst documentary in history. The narrators are obviously anti police to the point that it is funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash","review":"Not only is this full of bad voice-overs, fake helicopter sound effects, and horribly incorrect and biased narration, almost all the videos are the most boring pieces of work I have ever seen. The whole thing is just bad.

Amazing, outright garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap","review":"In every way Possible. I would rather take a dump with my clothes on than listen to the fake, terrible, biased narration. Just pure awfulness. The producers clearly grabbed the rights to some well known chase scenes, then hired a couple ass clowns to try to convince viewers they were \\"reporting\\" from the chopper (with the same awful helicopter sounds throughout).

As far as the story goes once you see this the werewolf becomes very REAL. Extremely graphic video of werewolves. Imogen Annesley is a beautiful young girl who is infected with the werewolf gene. A young man discovers her and hires her to act in a movie \\"Shape Shifters - Part 8\\". He drives a '60 Chevy convertible with right-hand drive (for Australia). This is a very graphic werewolf movie. If you're the least bit squeamish about these things be very careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back again!","review":"Dreadful 80's effects, average acting and above all, an over the top dumb plot.

And these nuns are evil, they kinda look like rats, still with me now? And then there's a town called Flow. (Pss, that spells wolf backwards, even though none of them are werewolves)Well there's this girl from 'Flow' and she hates being a werekangaroo, bla bla bla. She has kids in the end and dies, got it?

I will not watch this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another worthless Howling sequel, though not the worst of the series","review":"Philippe Mora, who directed the first Howling sequel, returned to the helm for Howling 3: The Marsupials, this time with more control over the film than he had on the previous worthless sequel. However, Howling 3 is really no different from the second film, the only difference being that this installment doesn't take itself seriously and even parodies itself. The storyline is non-sensical and the acting is atrocious, but there is a good looking babe as our werewolf main character, and some of the effects and makeup are decent. However, just like every other film in the exhausted series, this can't hold a candle to Joe Dante's original classic, and on it's own it doesn't hold up as a horror film. The following installments in the series would only get worse however, so if you're looking for some corny 80's werewolf fun you can still do worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely thrilling!","review":"I started reading this book in bed, and finished it the same night at 4 AM, fully aware that I had to get up at 6 AM next morning in order to be in time at the office. I think that says it all...This is one of those books that you will never forget. An absolutely awesome account of everything that nobody knew about crop circles. Note: no speculations in this book! The author is a mainstream scientist and very careful to keep a balanced view, yet manages to completely overwhelm the reader with an abundance of clear-cut proof that there must be a largely unknown and mysterious force that creates crop circles all over the world. I can't imagine anyone reading this book and not remaining impressed.Great picuters and many illustrations too, very accessible, easy language, and a very high overall quality for its price (especially the paper - glossy and heavy like lead).Very much recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deepening Complexity of Crop Circles","review":"Informative, well balanced and fascinating.

In fact, 100g of Shrimp Flavored Chips contain 100mg of calcium, equivalent to that contained in 100g of milk.

Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Victorious Fifth","review":"In fact, I believe this is the greatest performance of the Fifth ever committed to disc. As another reviewer notes, Strauss anticipated today's historically informed bunch, eschewing the Wagnerisms of Furtwangler and sticking to Beethoven's more classical drama. A reputedly unsurpassed Mozartian, Strauss reminds us that Beethoven never lost his love of Mozart. This Fifth is swift, transparent -- it's simply more musical than any other I've heard.Sadly, the Seventh is not on this plane, interpretively or sonically, although much better transfers (by Ward Marston) of both these recordings are available on Koch 3-7115- 2 H1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing songs one after another!!!!","review":"Backstreet Boys have put all of their greatest hits onto one cd.

This album released October of 2001 debuted at 4 and only sold 1 million and the song \\"Drowning\\" which was supposed to be a cut for \\"Black and Blue\\" only hit 36. The future looks cloudy for the Backstreet Boys due to the fact I have heard nothing about any new releases nor that the group is still together.

Why would the diehard fans want to buy the Hits cd to start with? If you are a diehard fan, you probably have every album to start with.When I was 15, I was such an avid fan of BSB. Then I grew older and now I'm just sick of them. The 15 minutes of fame is quickly dying, it won't be too much longer before they break up. Usually a hits cd spells the end for new musicans. They have 3 cds for christ sakes. I could see if they were Madonna and had numerous cds out, they would have a Hits cd.If the members of BSB have any sense at all, they need to look up to the Spice Girls for example. The Spice Girls had quite a short fame trip before the backlash started. Geri quit the Spice Girls, and I predict that Nick will be the one in BSB that quits. Each group member will try the dreaded solo career and fall flat on their face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest of the 'wannabes' out there","review":"A reply to Barry's review.

When I first heard of them I'll admit I was a bit skeptic, but I figured I'd keep an open mind. They have beautiful lyrics (More Than That) great pop songs (Larger Than Life) and ballads as well (Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely).

Every little girl that listens to this most likely already has every one of their albums. Plus the new song \\"Drowning\\"? Sounds even worse than \\"Shape of my Heart\\". I mean how many times can they repeat the same type song? And apparently its getting a moderate amount of airplay. Thank goodness this will probably be their last top 40 single before they break up. I'm not a fan of the backstreet boys, but if i were to release a greatest hits album, i would include at least 2 new songs.

But it looks as if Chopin fans are going to have to wait a while longer, because this one is unremarkable in every way. What appears to be a good idea in principle - a concise biography of Chopin's 18 years in Paris - breaks down due to Tad Szulc's complete inability to focus on any concept or topic.Szulc is an inept writer. His sentence structures are terrible. He seems to have nothing to say, and all day to say it. When the well really runs dry, he has a way of breaking off into obtuse generalities: \\"He must have been guided by destiny.\\" I was unable to decipher so many of his ideas, sentences, and phrases that I wound up skimming the last 200 pages of the book. I read stacks of books -mostly about music- and this is the first book in years I've been unable to finish.Approach at your own risk. Me, I'll keep hoping for that elusive, comprehensive Chopin biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book on his life and love: music and George Sand","review":"This book is a great read for anyone interested in learning more about Chopin and his love for music. You also get to learn about his love interest in George Sand. Szulc does a great job of keeping the material interesting as Chopin's contributions for all of time.This is a great book to have for anyone that loves Chopin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it was only $20...","review":"But I am horribly disappointed in it. I bought this lamp to go in my office to avoid the flourescent lights. It has lasted about 1.5 yrs. However, the light bulb blew out in it and now it no longer works by touch sensor and you have to unplug it to turn it off. That sucks. It only works on the lowest of the 3-way settings and my 100 watt light bulb is too dim for even my small office. I feel like this was pretty much a waste of money. For all the headaches, I would have bought something a tad more expensive, but more reliable. FYI, Garden Ridge has some nice cheap lamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touch sensor fails","review":"I bought three of these lamps because they looked great and had the touch sensor which I thought was a cool feature. The light bulb in one of them blew one day and the apparently the touch sensor blew with it. A few months later the next one blew and so did the touch sensor. The final one recently blew. The touch sensors are incredibly sensitive to blowing when the light bulb blows. I have to unplug them now to turn them off. At least I have a wall switch on one of them so it works like a regular light switch. Beware purchasing this lamp because it will not last you very long. However, they do illuminate a room very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. Plain and simple.","review":"So..... $20 for 10 minutes of operation? I don't think so.

The item is overall defective and unreliable. I purchased 3 of these at once, not just 1, and they ALL have problems! The touch settings the lamp is supposed to have do not work properly at all. At first it would at least turn on and off when I touched them, but after the first half hour they refused to change at all, forcing me to have to plug it in and out to operate it-I bought them so I wouldn't HAVE to do that!They've eaten 6 bulbs (of correct watts) so far in a 2 day period. Such a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable! Would NEVER recommend!","review":"So this lamp was used in the basement for the kids. I wanted a floor lamp that my 8 year old could turn on without having to reach a switch. From the beginning, the kids were scared of this thing. It would turn on in the middle of the night. All the time. I did some research and found that to be a common problem with these lamps. So I brought it upstairs. Now it won't even stay on. It worked right before I brought it up.... well it came on and stayed on, anyway.... now it doesn't even stay on. I give up. It has done NOTHING for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reliability","review":"I've now gone through two of these suckers. The touch sensor worked properly with a standard 3way light bulb with a max of 150 watts.

The second one happily lasted about 3 months and then decided to just let go... don't buy this expecting it to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touch sensor does not work","review":"We were looking for a simple, ordinary floor lamp and we happened to come across this one in Target. I thought - what could be wrong with a floor lamp? I only need a switch and it should be fine! No - a switch is no where to be found. I did notice the words \\"touch - sensor\\" on the box but I thought there had to a switch somewhere. The \\"touch-sensor\\" was supposed to change the brightness and it did not work. To turn it off / on, we have to pull the power plug. We returned it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I too was suckered into buying this lamp because I thought it looked good, and would match my decor. Well, it matches all right, as long as you don't need a lamp and are okay with an unlit piece of furniture. It is attractive but that is about it. It does not work. The lamp flickers on and off for a minute then stops altogether. DON'T BUY THIS LAMP. It is an attractive piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This lamp hates me and is evil","review":"I bought this lamp from Target about four months ago. From the beginning, it would turn on and off at odd times, but it would behave most of the time. The last couple of weeks it started just turning off, and I couldn't get it to go back on unless I switched it to a new outlet. I'd get it settled in its new location, then it would turn off again. But did I give up? No. I moved it again. Then instead of suddenly shutting off, it slowly faded out. I changed the bulb. It worked! Then it turned off. As embarrassing as it is to admit, yes, I once again moved my furniture around so I could crawl behind to plug it into yet another outlet. Success! Then defeat, as it slowly faded to nothing. Finally I checked the Internet and discovered other people's similar problems. I've been chasing this lamp around my living room for four months and it's pretty much just been flipping me off. It is evil, and it will be in the trash tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great until it doesn't want to, sometimes","review":"Sometimes you will see that this lamp doesn't want to turn on or off, don't worry, it's not broken!

Pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor lamp","review":"I purchased one of these lamps in hopes it would work as a normal lamp in my living room. My first mistake was purchasing a CFL 3-way bulb for it. The lamp worked for awhile but would randomly turn itself on and off. I did some research online and found out that touch lamps can be sensitive to static electricity or interference from devices. I moved the lamp. Still, it turned itself off. FInally, I realized it was the CFL light bulb. So I put in a standard 3 way GE incandescent bulb. The lamp worked for many months without a problem. Today, the bulb burned out and tripped my circuit breaker leaving me in darkness.The other problem I have is that one of my cats figured out he could turn the lamp on and off by touching it. So if you have children, pets or wish to use an energy efficient bulb, this lamp is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touch Sensor Lamp","review":"My touch sensor lamp shuts itself off a short while after being turned on - very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was nice until it stopped working two hours later","review":"Purchased this lamp from target through Amazon.

Found out that this lamp was defective. Sent it back and was refunded. However was still a waste of time.The lamp build is made sturdy. The light cover isn't frosted glass, but an opaque plastic.

The underlying concept is great: Batman in the 19th century versus Jack the Ripper. This really should work; Batman fits in perfectly into a typical dark, squalid Victorian-era city with its Gothic architecture. Unfortunately the execution is poor; the story lacks any real depth or excitement and the identity of the Ripper is incredibly obvious. It's all over too quickly, and I think that's the problem. For this experiment to work, to create a believeable alternate world for Batman as well as strong characterisation and plot development, it really needs to be much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted potential","review":"Gotham at the turn of the century, the steam era, that great cover- it looks awesome, doesn't? The idea is great. It starts off great. But the story seems to loose track of itself and fall from what it could have been to an awkward attempt to push a Jack the Ripper mystery into the Batman backstory. The art was attractive and fitting, and there were definite little highlights sprinkled about but on a whole, I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"The premise for Gotham by Gaslight was so really intriguing, so I was pretty excited to read it. That excitement pretty much evaporated after about the first two or three pages. The artwork was really bland and the dialogue was very forgettable. The plot was so obvious that anyone with half a brain could have figured out exactly what was going to happen after about the first five pages. Another flaw I found was that it was too short for any of the characters to develop whatsoever. To sum up, great premise, very poor execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Batman tale","review":"I was nothing but impressed by this book.

Seventeen tracks on this album feature alot of filler along with atleast nineteen different rappers. *Nineteen.* The guest rappers dominate, and Too Short is little more than a footnote on his own album. Overall, the album features only four or five listenable songs.Fans of course remember a time when Too Short made albums for himself and by himself. The idea of a guest appearance on album was truly an exception, and when it did occur, it was an established rapper appearing.

Long handle to help keep your arm away from the heat.I'm particularly pleased that it comes with two replacement heads. As you know, the brush heads get clotted up with grease and gunk well before the handle gives out. So, rather than toss the entire tool, just unscrew the old head (four screws), put on the new one and you're good to go. Helps me do my part to keep the solid waste down. The new heads include 4 new screws (they are taped to the top of the new head).As others have pointed out, the bristles are stainless steel.

The whole book is hokey and doesn't really have much substance. It is a romance (which is not my favorite genre), but I thought it would also be a true mystery story, expecially since I'm fascinated by the concept of lucid dreaming. The aura of a mystery was 'kind of' there, but not enough of a mystery story for me.If you've ever attended the UW in Seattle, you will get a kick out of his description of the campus gardens near the forestry and botany buildings (that was the bright spot of the book).

Found that the audio level was very low - when I cranked up the iAudio, the HON98-AUX started clipping, and worse still the audio started cutting out. More noise was heard as the head unit was talking to this box, lots of digital buzzing and clicking, even with the supplied earth tail connected (!!)Opening the unit up it seems to be a poorly made pcb with a PIC chip on board. While this is all that is needed to work well, you would think that for almost $60 they would bother to do a decent PCB design which would eliminate the majority of the clicks and buzzes.All in all I would recommend this product for a price point of $20 for emergency uses - but even then I would probably unplug the iAudio and use the unit's crappy built in speaker.Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new...","review":"LFO is something you listen to a couple times,then it gathers dust in a corner. They have same old tunes,with same old lirics just like all the pop sensations of these days. Nothing new I'd say. The song \\"Summer Girls\\" is pretty much just a promotion for Abercrombie& Fitch clothes. I say that because once that song was on the raido,BOOM(!) all the \\"cool kids\\" were waring A&F clothes. \\"Girl on T.V.\\" is a slow moving tune and the girl on t.v. they're talkin' about is Jennifer Love Herwitt. They will have the same fate as the Spice Girls(if they even have another cd that would be pure luck). Unless the same stupid rap lirics repeating over and over with barly any singing set to a (yawn) slow melody, is your type of music, I'd advise just listening to it on the raido.

The book encourages gutless (although creative) means of dealing with annoyances: some of the annoyances mentioned in the book could be resolved in a straightforward manner (more honest and manly way of dealing with the problem). But some people lack courage to deal with problems directly so they resolve to sneaky ways of dealing with it (like \\"I'll pretend that I'm sleeping\\"), well, they could be quite pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book that has an attitude","review":"I saw a review of the book on the news one night and I knew I had to get it.

It also encourages me to be more creative when it comes to being passive aggressive. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it before","review":"It's not that it wasn't entertaining. It's not that the subject matter wasn't right up my alley.

Everyone else should likely steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the annoyances!","review":"There's about two laughs in this whole book, and they are only chuckles. Most of the great ideas people have for \\"getting back\\" at people who annoy them are childish and many admit that they have exacted no results at all from their little private wars with the ignorant,intolerant and uncaring.This book only takes about an hour to read and sadly- it's a wasted hour.

But the author crafts too many exacting stories and not enough principles. If you're ever in exactly the same situations the author describes, you're OK. Normally, my hiliters work hard when I read books. Not this time. I'd suggest reading Strategic Selling and Spin Selling instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emphasizing the Politics of the Sale","review":"Jim Holden takes several of Sun Tzu's principles of warfare as chapter themes in this book on the politics of the sale. The book itself is not a riveting read, and the style isn't that engaging. Having said that, the material is excellent. Holden takes the reader through a number of sales strategies and how to diagnose and implement the one that best applies to the situation. His emphasis on the political landscape is pretty unique in the sales book arena, and is spot on based on my experience. The hypothetical scenario he walks the reader through is both relevant and enlightening. His specific techniques for analysis of the power base and setting traps were extremely useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good health and Well Being AT LAST!","review":"Wiley and co-authors research was so far ahead of our times in 2001 but thank goodness the natural plant hormones are available for us today!

However, their promotion of early childbearing -- preferably before 20! -- and MULTIPLE childbearing is preposterous. The costs to women of having babies too early --lost education and work opportunities, hasty marriage, immature parenthood, lifelong lowered earnings -- far outweigh the modest hormonal benefits. Basically, this is another book that tells women emancipation is bad for them -- nature wants them barefoot and pregnant and breastfeeding for 15 months per child.To read this book you'd think no woman lived past 50 unless she followed this taxing reproductive schedule. And yet, women's life expectancy in the US and other modern industrialized low-birthrate countries is the highest it's ever been, and getting higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book grossly misnamed and misleading.","review":"I picked up this book figuring it would be about menopause, HRT and the overuse of synthetic hormones. More than half of the book is devoted to encouraging woman to pop out their kids early. And, you had better have those kids. According to this book, if you don't give birth, you're destined to die of some form of cancer before you hit old age. Geez, what a 'positive' book. Since I'm childless and will remain so, this book is useless. I think I'll simply eat right, exercise, and avoid books like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money....","review":"Potential buyers should be aware that, of the 398 pages in the hardcover edition, 144 pages are reference notes, glossary and index.

Other styles that are visited include vallenato, old romantic stuff the likes of what Julio Iglesias would do back in those days, and good ol' ska.

It works well when the conditions are right, and not at all when they are wrong. The \\"right\\" conditions are a flat and smooth surface (asphalt or concrete - doesn't matter) that is completely free of gravel or any any debris. Under those conditions, the design works fine. Just sit on it, start moving the handles, and the motion of the front wheels \\"magically\\" pulls you along.

Strangly she found Jesus pretty much the moment her mother cut her off finacially ( she and her husband had never supported themselves) the scam seems to work enough to support a semi-lavish lifestyle - all in the name of Jesus of course.

The Bette Davis book they wrote must have been a huge sensation; there is no other explanation for why this nonsense was published. The Hymans have to be the most self-serving couple on the planet. Too bad they reproduced; I fear for their children. These people are reprehensible, and they embody the exact opposite of Christ's teachings.

The big let down for me with this CD, however, is the performance, especially since I have always trusted the name Rene Clemencic as a guarantee of at least a certain level of quality. There must be a back story to explain how this fine conductor got tied to the present group of village musicians: the soloists are weak, the choir and instrumentalists uncertain. Furthermore, Clemencic's decision to double the choir parts with brass -- while it may be supported by arguments of authenticity, or it may rather have been a practical decision, given the choristers at hand -- produces a disagreeable and unbalanced texture.

We all got together to play and found out it didn't have a LAN function. Pretty annoying but whatever, we'll play on XB Live. Too bad this game is so garbage no one plays it anymore. Team cooperation is near zero, and when you die that's it. No respawning. There is only one game mode and its not fun. Single player isn't much better. The whole game has a cheap, rushed feel. Graphics/textures are crap. Voice acting and script writing is retarded. The character animations are emotionless. Its like watching moving mannequins with guns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Gameplay & Storyline","review":"I love the run & gun shoot 'em up games. This game is a thinking man's shooter and I enjoyed playing it. The graphics are still decent for a 2008 game. The maps and menus were well done in my opinion. The controls were easy to get the hang of. You definitely had to use some strategy to make it through this game. You take on damage really easy so you can't just run from cover to cover. You command two squads. You must command them to provide suppression fire to get from point to point. You can choose to flank the enemy, or have your squad rush them. There are quite a few strategies you can use. The tank missions and sniper missions were really fun to play! The storyline was a pleasure to follow from beginning to end. The AI was good even on normal mode. If you have a little patience and enjoy tactical war games with a great story line, give this game a run. I can't wait for Brothers In Arms Furious 4 to be released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Story","review":"I read this not expecting to like it, but it was very good. I have since read other Isabel Allende books, and love her writing style. She gets into the heart of a woman and you can't put the book down.This was a very good story with a history to follow. How the life of a young woman was started and where she went in life. It took you on a journey through her life with grandparents and a sham of a marriage and her survival through it all.Loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequels are never as good as the original","review":"Portrait in Sepia is a sequel to Daughter in Fortune. The first book had wonderful characters and a good variety of characters. This book has mainly two characters, one of them from the first book. I found this book almost boring and depressing. It wasn't nearly as rich and colorful as the first. Nothing happy really happens. Isabel Allende is a good writer and I will read other book by her but I was disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under-developed disappointment","review":"I was greatly looking forward to this book, as I had heard and read so much about it. But I was ultimately disappointed. The language itself is beautiful and fluid, and the world it transports you to - San Francisco's Chinatown in the 19th century and the political and geographical climate in Chile - is fascinating. Her characters are interesting, but sorely under-developed and inconsistently characterized. In her plot, she alludes to the dangerous, beautiful, passionate and fantastical, but in the end only develops the conventional. There was so much potential in the culture and climate of this book and the language is so beautiful... it is such a shame she never focused and developed the story into what it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and easy read","review":"I found this book very enjoyable, it was an easy read and even if there are facts that aren't totally accurate (as another reviewer points out) this is a novel, not a history book, so you should just relax and enjoy it! I recommend you read \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" first!! Even though you can read them independently, Daughter of Fortune precedes Portrait in Sepia."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"Isabelle Allende really delivered for her fans on this one. This delicate masterpiece of a novel weaves together characters taken from 'House of the Spirits' and 'Daughter of Fortune' so beautifully, it's like a litte unexpected gift. The book explores a branch of the Del Valle not previously mentioned and enlightens Allende fans as to how the Del Valles of 'House of the Spirits' got to be who they are. It's just a beautiful, joyful homage to living and I loved every word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment =(","review":"Having read House of the Spirits and Daughter of Fortune, I eagerly awaited her new novel. This was a great disappointment. I wanted to read this sequel so badly that I even bought the Spanish version and read it a year ago. When I finished that book, I thought maybe it was my Spanish language skills that had detracted from the book. It wasn't.None of the characters were interesting enough to have a lasting effect. I couldn't sympathize with them by the end of the novel. It was also too similar to Daughter of Fortune in some ways. Overall, it was too predictable and boring.The only reason I read until the end was because I was unwilling to believe that this was it. I was sure there had to be something memorable by the end, but there wasn't. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"What a piece of work this was! I was only able to tolerate about 20 pages at a time, and I didn't give up simply because it was a book by Isabel Allende. The best part: the compelling tale of Diego and Susana. Now there's a wonderful book in the making!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Allende just keeps getting better","review":"I think this is an excellent sequel that also acts as a kind of prequel to House of Spirits. The way all of Allende's novels are connected is wonderful. The story was great, told through the flashbacks of Eliza Sommers' granddaughter. Because these are her memories of a disjointed past, the story is rough in spots and jumps forward and back in time, but is still compelling. I definitely recommend reading Daughter of Fortune first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book by Isabel Allende","review":"I am an enthusiastic reader of Allende's books, and this has been a real disappointment. She seems to have lost her capacity to render the most intimate feelings of her characters, this book is very superficial and sometimes very dull.If you are interested in this author, read Paula or the 2 books of Eva Luna, which are real masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent story","review":"Allende recounts the compelling story of the Chilean immigrant Aurora del Valle, who gradually uncovers the secrets of her strange childhood, the identity of her father, and the reason for her being haunted by recurring nightmares. As is usual for Allende, the characters are the lifeblood of a complex story, and all of them are as eccentric as they are lovable, continuously getting themselves in and out of trouble in innumerable, fascinating ways. Allende tends to treat Aurora's distant relatives with a great deal of imagination and panache, while the latter half of the book somewhat degenerates to a predictable love story. But it is still a fine novel. Read it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Book","review":"Although I didn't find this book as wonderful as some of the others that she has written, it was still a wonderful book from a very talented author. I went over my book budget to get this book, and I am not disappointed. If you want to give her books a try, I would recommend reading another one of her books first. If you have read her before, then give it a try. I think the opinion of the book depends on the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I've read almost all of Allende's work, considering her one of my favorite writers. Sadly, each book after \\"Paula\\" seems weaker than the last. I read that she was utterly devastated by the death of her beloved daughter, Paula, and had to go on anti depressants and that it was hard to write for quite some time because the medication made her feel muted. It may be, tragically, that the death of her only daughter created a permanent void for her, that she is unable to write with the same type of passion she was capable before. This would be understandable and yet a great loss for the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story","review":"I can't tell you that this is an excellent book, but is a good book to learn something about how is the life in Latin America, are parts of the book that it doesn't have many sense, but is part of writing and making a good story, if you try to verify in all the books the parts that couldn't be true or the \\"big mistakes\\" made by the protagonists, you won't like any book. The story of the book is not a page turner but you will learn something while you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait in Sepia","review":"Hello,I of course love Isabel Allende, both in English and Spanish.

I have an old version (1993)and thought this 2010 version would hit on the age of the internet... you know...Self promoting yourself/work vis website, blog, social networking.What I found? 2 pages on creating your website.That is it. Nothing about blogging, or networking via the internet.NADA.So warning, if you are expecting some Zen vision about developing yourself/work using the internet, it isn't happening in this book.Boldt's idea of life changing apparently means he's not looking to the internet that much.Look else where my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what is needed at this time","review":"We purchased this item at a time when I am considering a new career direction.

This book has practically become my own personal bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"long-winded","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't make it through the first part of the book -- too much long-winded pseudo-mystical rambling. If it's never occurred to you that you should try to find work that you find fulfilling, this book might spark some reflection and insight. If it has, you're better off with Boldt's other book, How to Find the Work You Love, or the old stand-by, What Color Is Your Parachute?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great subject made difficult to read","review":"Like another one of the reviewers, I have a four-year degree in English, and couldn't make it through this book (I managed to plod trough a lot of difficult \\"classics\\" in my life, but could not finish this book). Zen, as I understand it, revolves around simplifying one's life and shedding the burdens of the world. I didn't see that here. I think this author could cut this book down to 200 - 300 pages and make it a much better read. If an author can't make his point more concisely, he needs to employ a good editor or writing teacher to help him focus on the important points that need to go into the book and then to cut out the ideas that don't belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I purchased this book as a course requirement and found it a huge disappointment.

This book was a total waste of my money and time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"too cumbersome!","review":"This is just pages and pages of nothing. Most people are not going to waste their time reading 640 pages of sayings, witticisms, etcetera--most people searching for a career want to get to the meat of the subject. I was bored after the first 20 pages and never did finish reading the book. Boldt's other book, \\"How to Find the Work You Love\\" is much better, and gets to the point much more quickly. If you must select one of his books, pick the second one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost painfully difficult to read.","review":"Although I have a four year degree in English, I felt strained trying to read this book. Everything is so long and drawn out - by the time I finish a paragraph, I forget where we started. Part One about killed me. I'm 34 years old, in the middle of the country, working from home. I don't need to soul search and philosophize - I know who I am, and I have no patience.Part 2 did have some useful information, but I was so burnt out from part one, my enthusiasm was drained. Will keep it as a resource book, but will never \\"read\\" it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of brilliant!","review":"Boldt is a true visionary. This book has the makings of a new bible. It is a slow read, but that is because every paragraph is jam-packed with riveting truth. The author's comprehension of philosophies and religions combines with his very practical insight into modern Western culture and society to paint a scathing picture of our life today. Fortunately, he offers just as much incisiveness on how to thrive in the midst of it. Very few titles, VERY FEW, have ever affected me to this degree.

I found that I didn't particularly care for the book, but since that always a matter of personal opinion and expectations others may strongly disagree. Had I known more about the show than just the sangs that I liked, I might just have bought the sangs, on the other hand it certainly adds to my collection of Broadway Shows even though it won't be one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thousand Times Is Not Enough","review":"As a huge musical theater buff, I am always wiling to try new shows, especially shows that not a lot of people have heard of. Sometimes the result is less than terrific, but every once in a while a show comes along that makes me giddy I took a chance. That show would definitely have to be The Last Five Years. I have listened to this show over and over and I still get new things out of it. It has generated discussion about life and love and is THE best thing out there now. Jason Robert Brown has crafted an AMAZING story that is biting and powerful. The lyrics are gut-wrenching and poignant. The music is beautifully orchestrated and haunting. Sherie Rene Scott redeems herself after her less-than-peak performance on the Aida cast recording. Norbert Leo Butz' performance will make you hate his character, but admire his ability. All in all, the next show I invest in must be PERFECT if it will replace The Last Five Years as my favorite cast recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're Still Not Sure Whether to Buy It...","review":"Here's my advice: Download the first song, \\"Still Hurting\\", from your favorite file-sharing program, or copy it from a friend. If you like the first song, BUY THE ALBUM. Generally anyone who will enjoy this album got hooked after listening to just that one song.If you're interested in more information on the show, or if you'd like to see it live, I recommend searching the web for \\"Goodbye Until Tomorrow - The Last Five Years\\" to find a great web page devoted to the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't lose with JRB!","review":"What an amazing work of art. JRB is a genius. The music is just amazing. The lyrics quickly draw you into the world of the characters. The music is aurally delightful. Between Sondheim and JRB we in the musical theatre community should have many years of musical delight to look forward to. When all we hear on Broadway is revival after revival after adaptation of Disney cartoons you start to wonder if there are any musical theatre writers left in the world, but then you listen to The Last 5 Years or Songs For a New World and your faith is restored. Buy this album and send a message to JRB to keep writing fresh new shows that will keep the theatre alive. He is the future of the musical and it couldn't be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't think about this title, order it","review":"I needed to buy one more CD for the free freight and I picked up the disc because I read and article that mentioned the title.

It remains in my car while the other two have been retired to the CD rack at home. This was such a wonderful surprise.

At first I didn't like it at all--the characters were too self-centered, the orchestration too fussy, Sherie Rene Scott's voice too flat and shouty, and who cares about someone else's drama-filled starter marriage?But it really grew on me. I like the specificity and occasional goofiness of the lyrics, and the complex melodies. It really worms its way into your head, and there's more subtlety to the performances than I realized at first. After I had heard the whole album 5 or 6 times, I found myself listening to it and enjoying it quite a bit.

Unfortunately, there was no intermission so I couldn't walk out. After the first two songs, it was torture to sit through. The singers were GREAT, the musicians were very good. The concept was interesting, but the play was incoherent and unemotional. Well, almost. The emotions were sad, depressed, and complainy [not sure if that's an emotion, but it sums up the play.]Anyway, the music, oy, the music. EVERY song sounded alike. The lyrics blended into one, big, boring morass. OK, the exceptions were the second song, \\"Shiksa Goddess\\", and the Audition song. But \\"Shiksa Goddess\\" was only cute, SNL / Adam Sandler cute. VERY forgetable, as was the entire musical [no spoken dialog to speak of.] I hope I forget how much time and money I wasted on this as quickly as I've forgotten all the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Chicago live performance.","review":"I saw the show in Chicago. Then I bought the album hoping to capture the same energy. It lacked something. I really don't know the difference. Was it performed by different artists. I didn't remember the names of the two here.

My friends had told me how good this show is and I'd heard \\"Shiksa Goddess,\\" but no words can express the emotion I felt when listening to this soundtrack.

Even if you don't, you should buy this CD and educate yourself. It is truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Show","review":"This is by far one of the BEST musical recordings. Each song has something fresh and important to say. And they couldn't sound better. I am always hesistant to listen to a new show before I see it, but believe me it is worth it. Unbelievable. Norbert Leo Butz is a god and Sherie Rene Scott delivers. They both bring such emotion to this show. Unstoppable. Amazing. Poignant. Daring. Ingenious. Not enough words to describe the joy that is \\"The Last Five Years.\\" You'll love every minute of it.

It really made me want to buy some of her other books.Seduction's Gift by Angela Knight was so good I think it will set the scene for a whole new series similar to Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunters. I liked the premise and enjoyed the story.This was a very entertaining read for the afternoon. I don't think you could possibly be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked, Wild, Wonderful","review":"The terms I would use to discribe this book. Clearly all the authors show great talent but Christine Feehans rises above the rest. Her ongoing Carpathian saga is compelling, each book or story give you a deeper glimpse into the dark magical world of the Carpathians. I bought this book for Ms Feehans story and while I enjoyed the others I felt that the last story dealing with King Arthur being a vampire, while hot was a little too over the top for me. I might try something else by this author but overall I would not recommend this book on her story alone. The others are worth reading and to try stories by different authors is a wonderful way to expand your horizons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rip off!!!","review":"NOTHING like described in the picture.

It comprises images created by cutting up and re-organizing illustrations from Victorian encyclopedias and novels and it is a surrealistic masterpiece, full of strange images of naked women, creatures with bird heads, dragon wings in rooms that may have mirrors that reflect something else or simply flooded with water. It is divided in chapters that correspond to the days of the week and to the \\"seven capital elements\\".This book is the collection of full page reproductions of the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Une Semaine De BontE : A Surrealistic Novel in Collage","review":"One of the best books I own.

Do a 30 minute review of the text, getting the big picture.2. The next day review the text for 1 hour, placing sticky tabs with labels for quick reference.3. Start writing with \\"A Short Guide to Academic Writing\\" just out of arms reach.

A little of Freddie's \\"star\\" attitude and his mannerisms early on are also revealed.His on stage persona was in stark contrast, often, to his private one.It is worth a read for fans of the band. That would include yours, truly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book of it's type I've ever had the misfortune to struggle through","review":"This book reads like the author made a list of names of every person who has ever come into contact with every other person who's come into contact with any member of any band that any member of queen ever played in and then thought of words to string all the names together. There are very few actual band quotes or anecdotes, no amusing stories, no gossip and not many good photos. I was totally disappointed and unsatisfied after reading this book and will look for the \\"semi-official\\" biography\\" with hopes that it's the polar opposite of this dry list of everyone who almost was in the band but is so glad that they weren't because otherwise they wouldn't have fulfilled their life's dream of selling rugs or some such crap. I'm almost conscious-stricken about reselling it, but not quite since someone else scammed me and I want my money back, damn it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typos","review":"I agree with the other reviews about the book (only for die hard fans and interesting) but I just wanted to add that I noticed a lot of typos. That was quite annoying. For example: Oueen instead of Queen, Roger Deacon instead of either Roger Taylor or just plain John. I couldn't figure that out cause Brian was mentioned before Roger's name so maybe the author wanted to say Brian, Roger and John. Who knows? A lot of periods were also missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a nice big book with lots of large, colorful pictures for the kids to look at.

It loses a star for labeling a clapped out 80's van as a \\"Mini Van\\" and for using a lame picture of a truck for the pick-up photo. A lot of the vehicles are European with the steering wheel on the \\"wrong\\" side of the car. Those things aside, there is a really big variety of vehicles and my one year old does love to look at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is Not Accurate","review":"My three year old son received this book as a gift with mere excitement, only to be devastated. While the pictures are bold and bright the context (name of the pictures) are completely false! Even my three year old knows that a disk (farm equipment picture) is not a Plow. Come on Roger Priddy do you and your high priced publishing firm not do any research before writing your books? It is obvious that this author, Roger Priddy, is more concerned with making money while teaching children wrong information. This picture book contains 40 photographs with name depiction and of the 40 pictures 11 are named incorrectly! There is better children's literature out there, this guy is a joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and fun for a truck's fan","review":"This is a big bright sturdy book whit colorful pictures of real trucks, my son loves trucks and he can read his book for long time (I consider 15 minutes long for my 3year old) and just go over and over at this point he had memorized all the names, he has several trucks, transportation, machines etc..kind of books and to be honest, almost all the books have the same pictures but he loves a new book! and this one is nice.I just got this book, it is a 2011 edition and the error mentioned in another review about the \\"tractor plow\\" had been corrected and it reads \\"tractor and disc\\".I will say that my favorite transportation picture book is \\"Let's get moving (My first DK publishing)\\" it has more vehicules not only trucks and 28 pages insted of just 12, it's smaller and not as sturdy but it has hold on."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classics","review":"My son loved this book from the first day he got it, which was well before his first birthday. He's almost two, and has a lot of books now, but he returns to this one over and over again. When I got tired of just reading the names of the trucks straight through, we made up a game where he points to each truck and I say the name of it, in whatever order he chooses.The only thing keeping this book from 5 stars is the fact that a few of the pictures are mislabeled. However, there's nothing major -- the toddlers who read this book aren't going to be scarred for life by seeing a tractor and plow labeled \\"tractor and disc.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Oversized Board Book","review":"This book has a great variety of truck and heavy equipment pictures. My 19 month old loves it. He will lay on his tummy and look through it because the big pages are easy for him to turn. Someone else mentioned that a few of the pictures were mis-named, which I've found to be true with several of the Roger Priddy books. I've also found they don't consistently use the same name for the same piece of equipment from book-to-book, but it's hard to beat the pictures. Since it's really a picture book with a name under each picture rather than a book with a story you would sit and read, I still recommend it for anyone with kids who are fascinated by trucks and machinery. You can always just say the correct name of the equipment rather than what is printed under the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Trucks","review":"Kids love this book! I have put this book in a 2 year old early childhood room. Both girls and boys love to look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He really loves it! (bores me a little)","review":"I'm trying to be fair, it's advertised as a picture book full of different trucks, it's exactly that, and my 17 month old loves it. It's big, and sturdy, pictures are professionally treated and vibrant. It's a good version of exactly what's advertised. It's got no story though, just 6 or so big pages of pictures of different kind of trucks, and they've got names like hay bailer truck, so I'm not exactly teaching my kid truck names from it. It's not my favorite thing to see him pull of the shelf and bring over to me (which is why it's 4 stars instead of 5) but it's a good, big version of exactly what's advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"purchase","review":"Very nice quality, and a great value.

It would make a cute little gift item, but I'm not sure that it contains the entire text of Dr. Peale's book.Buyer beware! You have to dig down a few levels to get the product details and only there does it describe this book as a miniature version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, bad package","review":"Maybe I should have read the details more carefully or something, but let's just say that when I opened my package and saw a miniature little book about the size of a stickey-note pad, I was deflated. Even though I tried not to let that deter me from reading the goodies inside, I'd be lying to say it didn't. My advice: make sure you're ordering a \\"real\\" book, one you don't have to squint to read. Don't trust Amazon to do it for you. The first one they show available is the small one. Shame on them. I digress...On Peale's words, they are not new, but they are profound. The book gets kind-of repetitive early on, but maybe that's the author's point. Bottom line, books don't become \\"classic\\" for nothig.

If you're already familiar with the book, it may be a helpful reminder, but it is no way to become familiar with Dr. Peale's work.

First of all, I bought this version without realizing just how small this book actually was. I knew it was a miniature edition, but this is just a hair bigger than the smallest of post-it notes. That is small! Oh well, I can carry it in my purse, right? While I enjoy the affirmations that remind me to think positively, I am not a very religious person and I very quickly tired of the numerous biblical references.

Its a few weeks after Half Magic's ending, and Jane, Mark, Katharine, and Martha are now enjoying a vacation at an Indiana lake with their mother and new step-father. They inadvertently order up a lakeful of magic from a magical being who happens to be listening, and the fun starts once again. I was fortunate enough to happen upon this book and the others in the series as a child many years ago, and I still love to reread them every now and then.Just like Half Magic, Magic By the Lake will appeal to children because it features realistic children and scenes in fantastic and deeply humorous ways. Adults will enjoy and approve of this and other works by Edward Eager because they are deeply literate, with references to many other books and plays that will encourage children to read and explore their libraries and their imaginations."},{"rating":"2","title":"holly's review","review":"This was an excellent book. The view of relationships among siblings, and acceptance of each other's idiosyncracies, was accurate and positive. The adventures were imaginative and unexpected. There were many lessons to be learned relative to not repeating past mistakes, not jumping to conclusions, and not being judgmental of others. My only criticism was that in some areas, such as the beginning, the book moved a bit slowly for kids. Our 2nd grade Book Club chose this book to read, and it was a little hard to get my son to stick with the slower parts, to get to the exciting ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic in a book","review":"This book was great-all of Mr. Eager's books are. But if you'relooking for the best of his books, this is not the one. Sure, it hascool characters and plenty of magical adventures, but this story, unlike other books I have read from Mr. Eager's colection, had no basic plot. No real chain of events leading to a real end. \\"Half Magic\\", on the other hand, was written quite originally and all the adventures led up to one main event. I would also recommend \\"Magic or Not?\\" But all in all this book really was a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grimaud plays Chopin: Chopin loses","review":"This is my first encounter with Grimaud's playing and I can't say I enjoyed it much. Grimaud pounds the first two movements of the Chopin sonata into submission, rarely stopping to pause for breath or reaching anything below a forte. As for her \\"gorgeous tone\\" (as Dan Davis puts it), her sound gives a rich new meaning to \\"chalky.\\" Her attempts at lyrical playing in the Trio of the Funeral March and the Berceuse are remarkably metronomic, and her trills in the latter are distictly unmagical. I suppose some will regard such playing as \\"powerful,\\" but to me its mostly noisy. The Barcarolle is somewhat better, though no competition for the likes of Moravec and Lipatti. The Rachmaninov sonata, a remarkable piece of junk, fares better in Grimaud's heavy hands, but I doubt if I'll be listening to this cd in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Student-like playing!","review":"It is amazing that critics as well as audiences can praise such mediocre Chopin playing!!! Did you forget people like Dinu Lipatti, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Ignaz Friedman, Josef Hoffmann, and just recently Radu Lupu, Martha Argerich, and the brilliant Adam Harasiewicz, not to mention such excellent, if not brilliant, talents like Murray Perahia and the most successful piano comedian Lang Lang. Even the recent mediocre competition winners like Yundi Li and Alexander Kobrin play way better than Grimaud can ever even dream of.Grimaud's Chopin and Rachmaninoff as well as Brahms and Ravel are on the student level: overpedalled, generic, technically inferior, lack musical ideas, not to mention having new ones, in one word - boring!In addition, the cover photo is nothing much to look at. The eyes are beastly empty and express only nothingness, exactly like the playing. The pretentious, quasi-philosophical booklet writings only confirm the impression from the photos and the performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item picture is not accurate","review":"Just a warning to potential buyers that the product may not be identical to the picture above. The picture shows a chain with eleven links, while the product I received only has eight links. That means the chain is 2.5 inches shorter than expected. Probably not a problem for most, but we needed that extra length for our use.

I think these new ones will be fine after I break them in--to adjust the strap---I put my hand under all of the leather and I pushed the pin from under the buckle upwards while at the same time pushed down on the buckle ---this enabled the buckle to slide.

I got the suede camo ones with the pink buckle and pink lining. Walked around in them around the house all morning, and they fit well (I wear a size 10 and they are true to size). I adjusted the buckle so that they were a bit tighter on my foot and that old toe-grip feeling that I remember was almost the same as when I was a girl! Overall, I love them except for one thing: the lining is a very thin, hot pink synthetic type of material. I was expecting the lining to be suede or at least a soft, fuzzy type of fabric. That part is a bit stiff on the tops of my feet, so I am hoping it breaks in and becomes a little softer with wear. Otherwise, they fit great, the straps adjusted fine, and the color is cute and fun for summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sandals","review":"I had these same sandals 40 years ago! I liked them then and I like them now! The reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is because you do have to get use to walking in a shoe with such a hard sole. I wouldn't wear them of I was going to do a lot of walking, but for just ordinary daily errands they're great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected","review":"After having worn these sandals back in highschool, I was a bit surprised at how pricey they are these days.

I was hoping for the same sandal when I ordered these. My foot size has not changed over the years, but these sandals don't fit correctly. The \\"ball\\" doesn't hit at the right place and the leather rubs my foot. Also, I can't adjust the strap. I've read and re-read the instructions, but nothing I do will release the buckle so that I can tighten the shoe. The leather is stiff and uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these sandals!","review":"These sandals are great! I remember them from the 1970's when I was too young to wear them but now I have two pairs. I didn't see any half sizes so I ordered one pair a half size too big and the other pair a half size too small. The smaller pair seems to work a little better although it doesn't make a huge difference. The material on the top of the sandal took some getting used to so I had to break them in by wearing them around the house for awhile. I'm pretty sure these are the healthiest shoes I've ever had. All my other sandals feel inferior to these now as far as foot support is concerned. I developed a heel spur and plantar faciitis two years ago and it doesn't even bother me wearing these sandals without my orthotics. I'm glad I bought these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjusting the Buckle","review":"I read the instrutions here on how to adjust the buckle but they do not work for me.

Before I got them and wore them, I liked them better.. After wearing them, I realized they were just plain.. clunky. I clunk around in them all day. I haven't worn them in a while, needless to say. They ok in the comfort department, but not great. And, as some other reviewers mentioned, I was never able to get the hang of easily adjusting the strap. I only tried a few times, because, again, I didn't wear them all that much, but still. There are cuter shoes in the world that don't make you feel so dumpy and frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"DR.

Not only is the wood not well shaped anymore but the leather upper on any of the design sandals is thin fabric and thus flimsy. The best part of the original sandals was the great toe grip. That is what made this sandal famous and gave us all such wonderful calves! The new ones are almost flat. I also sent mine back but beware... check this before you buy. I had to pay a restocking fee to send them back! So you pay shipping, then hate them and send them back paying more shipping AND a restocking fee. Might as well have kept them. I am very disappointed and wrote to Dr Scholls to let them know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 70's are back!","review":"I have grown up with Dr. Scholl and this is a nice twist on and old reliable shoe.

Nice quality, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pair of shoes, for the most part","review":"I love these shoes for their comfort and ease of getting on and off when I'm on the run. The one thing I would change is that the clasp that makes them look adjustable does not seem to open. They're a little loose around my toes, and I'd like them just a smidge tighter. Other than that, they're my favorite pair of shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The right shoe does not wear well at all, I feel there might be a problem with the strap, I developed a blister on my toe which started within thirty minutes of wearing ( I had to purchase a pair of flip flops to change because of the horrible pain) the left shoe is fine but because of the problem with the right I am unable to wear them. I am updating this review I bought this product last year and received horrible blisters, I tried again this year and the same thing.

I loved them and left them when I moved so when I found these on Amazon I was very excited. These shoes are still great and very comfortable. The toe grip is a little smaller but overall still made the same. I did find that the inside of the strap rubbed and was rough I so I did as someone else suggested and took a little sand paper to it this did the trick. I am very happy with my purchase and intend to buy another pair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE!!!! Them","review":"I owned an origianl pair back int the 70's.

You do have to break them in though. I think it'm more your feet getting use to them as I had to gradually break them in again this year or the bottoms of my feet get sore."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like i remember them...","review":"These were a bit of a disappointment in that I remember wearing these as a teenager and LOVING them..I liked the idea of wearing wood, plus I used the muscles in my legs so it kept them in shape, but they seemed (after 30 some odd years) heavier and if you don't get the leather, they look a bit cheap.

It flows over, with and through the music so smoothly without a care in the world. It takes you to islands where the breeze is as soft and caressing as the voice itself.

Your eyes deceiveth you not. The Sea Hawk has the Panama section of the film tinted in glorious sepia.Which leads me to a couple of points.

In the end, frugality prevailed, and the suits decided to save themselves half a mil and shoot in black and white.And you know something? I'm glad they did. If you want to see what TSH would have looked like in color, go watch \\"Elizabeth and Essex.\\" That flick was shot eight months earlier. Same palace sets, similar costumes, all in robust technicolor. The art direction is wonderful, but I don't think it's better than the achievement displayed in \\"The Sea Hawk.\\" It's simply different.You want a pirate picture in color from this time frame, go watch \\"The Black Swan.\\" Me, I'll take Curtiz and Flynn over King and Power any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid for a DVD which wouldn't play on my DVD player","review":"I made the mistake of not viewing this DVD within the time period allowed for returns.

Although Flora is much better than Bette. All the old ingredients seem to be there, but somehow the cake isn't quite up to snuff. Curtiz seems a little exhausted, in spite of the standard trademark shadow-sword-swashing; perhaps it's just that Flynn can't quite take it seriously enough any more. Four swords against one is maybe a trifle over the top. Also, the film was over-budgeted, and the model ships still look like model ships. There are some interesting extras from the pundits on this disc, and Flora's message at the end comes across with some punch, but the reality of the Battle of Britain remains more vivid than any Hollywood hokum. Sorry, folks: I have to dock a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Hawk","review":"A great Swashbuckler of all times. Errol Flynn is at his best form.

He has created a hero with a depth of character, that is unique for this sort of story. The action scenes are good and the final showdown makes for one of the finest fencing scenes ever. One problem though: some of the footage was taken directly from Captain Blood, which makes for some strange continuity problems during the sea-battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous film! !","review":"The Sea Hawk is one of those films that you can watch again and again.

Flynn was never more handsome on screen than he was in this film. His portrayal of Geoffrey Thorpe is restrained and believable.

The Highest Grossing film of 1989. Nicholson steals the film here. Although it falls flat at the film last half hour but it's still entertaining.

Grade:B+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Keaton is the best Batman, so far","review":"There is no better Batman, yet, than the 1989 Tim Burton version with Michael Keaton. Yes, many objected to Keaton as being used for the Dark Knight role, but he plays it perfectly. He really looks like a believable Bruce Wayne. This 2 set DVD is great for any Batman fan. I love all the extras that are included in the 2nd DVD. It took me about 3 hours to watch them all. My only regret is that there isn't any more behind the scenes info."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Batman!!!","review":"Probably one of my favorite movies of all time, Tim Burton's Batman is a fantastic rendition of our favorite caped crusader.

It has some flaws when compared to the Comic but still a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"Very good movie. I first saw this movie in theaters, then owned it on VHS well since I recently got a blu-ray this movie was a must for me to get. This picture was a big improvement. The reason I give it 4 stars is because of the dolby HD I have a 7.1 Surround and a reciever that supports Dolby HD and Was not overly inpressed with the sound. The music played good and some explosions but overall background noises not so good. I do love all the extras they put into this dvd. This is a must get Blu-ray thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man who grew wings","review":"Batman is the best Super hero out there, and he all ways will be. The movie starts off with awesome music, which gets you ready for a joy ride with no seat belt.

Comes and kicks the buts of all evil doers \\"ENTER THE BATMAN\\"!He is a man with vengeance so powerful that all crime must pay, he is the dead of the night, he is the shadow of the night, hell his is the night period, and he dresses as a bat. In the beginning he shows all viewers this. Next the movie takes you on a looptyloop when a sinister psychopath is born, lady's and gentlemen I give you the king of laughs, the master of gestures, the ruler of sick demented mind games \\"THE JOKER\\"!

But with further due Batman doesn't fit in these catergories, if you read a Batman comic and enjoyed it, you will definenlty enjoy this movie.Many people who are not into the Batman comics often think of Batman as the television show in the 60's. A more of a slap stick style of a show, a mere [bad show] of Bob Kanes Dark knight comics. This movie The Batman is nothing like that show, this movie has entertainment and grit! And yes the Joker does give us the laughter of the movie. Nicholson is the star of the movie, an over done job as the Joker. He was a perfect match for his role.The acting and the special affects makes this a classic movie. A direct comic replica of the Batman! This movie will not be missed or forgotten, its a movie for all ages. Everybody has a little Bat inside of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a special addition like a crackhead needs a hit","review":"To make myself absolutely clear, the one star has nothing to do with the movie itself. \\"Batman\\" is such a favorite of mine, I can nearly quote the entire damned film. However, I own a perfectly good VHS copy, and I REFUSE to buy any DVD as shoddy as this.No trailers? No commentary by Tim Burton or Sam Hamm? No behind-the-scenes on the making of the movie, maybe with interviews of the late, great Batman-creator Bob Kane? And I suppose they made this entire movie without any outtakes and without having to delete a single scene? Even an isolated audio track of the score (which I normally never care about) would have been Heaven.....When \\"Batman\\" comes out with a Criterion, 2-disk, gold-plated, limited edition, cancer-curing, multi-super-giant DVD edition that costs [price]dollars, I'll buy it in a New York minute. Hell, I'll buy two. Until then, my [price] VHS copy is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"My childhood memories shattered again","review":"Now Batman was an alright movie, but its definitely over hyped. The series has gotten more attention now that the Dark Knight series has been in theaters, but its definitely not the same kind of movie. The quality of the plot line is somewhat lacking, and it often leaves the viewer scratching their head. In the final fight scene, the movie is so dark you can't really see whats going on, making it very anti-climatic. I would have been better off not buying and keeping the old childhood memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie... in a word; sucked.

For me, Batman represents that shining beacon of hope to the hopeless, and he always seems concerned for the safety of others. At least, he used to. Sadly, it seems that Batman is gone, along with Robin, the Batboat, the Batpoles, the Batcopter, and classic villains like Egghead and Louie the Lilac.In their place, we get a Batman who relies on gadgets more than brains, a Joker who hardly ever laughs, and fight scenes without the trademark \\"Pow\\"s and \\"Zap\\"s. It may have a decent story, but I'll always look at this big-budget bust as a missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a movie????","review":"The first Batman movie has got to be one of the most cheesiest heroic movies of all times. I've watched this film over and over and over again, and it still doesn't get to me. It's full of too much romance and way too much violence. I wasn't too thrilled with the pick of characters for this film. Jack Nicholson did an okay job as \\"The Joker\\", but again here's another movie where Michael Keaton is playing himself. He never takes his Batman job seriously. And I can't stand Kim Basinger in this film! Her wardrobe is God-awful!! When you're on a date, at least comb your hair and put on a decent dress than something handed from a second-hand store. And I can't stand her screaming in about every other horror scene. This Batman movie was a joke to begin with. The other two Batman movies were okay, despite the last one was without Michael Keaton.I was hoping for an action-packed movie when it first came out, unfortunately, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Knight as never before seen","review":"Dark, mysterious, intriguing is what Batman is characterized in this film. Basically everything that should of been taken consideration for the Dark Knight himself is all here, with director Tim Burton converting finally what was a long wait from the great comic book hero into one of the most acclaimed films based on heroes.This is one of Michael Keaton's (Bruce Wayne, Batman) best work, aswell with Jack Nicholson (The Joker) who gives one of the best evil geniuses characters based on a book come to life.Director Tim Burton knew from the start how Batman should be shown on screen and he couldnt have done it more perfect. He does it again with 'Batman Return' which is also extraordinary like this one.To own indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"BATMAN\\" SHOWS HOW A COMIC SUPERHERO FILM SHOULD BE DONE.","review":"Even if \\"Superman\\" is a decent movie, Batman is the real thing; Tim Burton created an ultra-stylized film, and his dark version of the superhero paid tribute to the true spirit of the comics, instead of using the style of the TV comedy series; in my opinion that was the right choice.This film is also the best of the series; when Tim Burton and Michael Keaton left this movie franchise after \\"Batman Returns\\", the quality of the rest of the films was pretty poor. In \\"Batman\\" there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson of course, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the Batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.A comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but Tim Burton proved to be the right choice in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman","review":"CLASSIC!First Batman film, hallmark of the 80s and 90s.Well done, incredible Elfman score, Joker's a bit cheesy, but Nicholson is still...Nicholson."},{"rating":"2","title":"more please","review":"this is a great movie i would have given the disc 5 stars if there had been more extras on the disc there are hardly any."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST AND GREATEST \\"BATMAN\\" MOVIE OF ALL TIME","review":"As usual, with ALL THE OTHER films that I have reviewed, I also have this classic in my collection. Tim Burton does an OUTSTANDING job directing this 1989 flick. Michael Keaton gives the BEST performance of his career as the \\"DARK KNIGHT DETECTIVE\\". Jack Nicholson is MAGNIFICENT as the manical \\"JOKER\\". The Danny Elfman and Prince score fit this film perfectly. Although this movie version disassiociated itself from the classic tv series, I PERSONALLY think that the studio SHOULD HAVE used Adam West the flashback sequence of \\"BATMAN'S\\" origin, as a way of handing down the mantle.

Michael Keaton is the best Batman of all. The only thing I hated was the it was too predictable. Jack Nicholson is a very good Joker. The only person I dislike in this film is Vicki Vale. She needs to learn how to mind her own business. The funniest character is Knox. That is what I think of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD Quality","review":"The copy they used to transfer this to DVD (I am referring to the cardboard front '97 edition DVD) is terrible. You can see screen \\"pops\\" and \\"scratches\\" throughout the movie. (The defects you see on films in the theaters when a movie roll has been played a bunch and starts to get worn). It is not much better than VHS. Surround sound is terrible, it is pretty much just Mono sounding even though listed Dolby Digital. Hopefully the special edition or Blu-Ray is a better transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Much Closer to the 60's Batman than I expected.","review":"I had seen this film in 1989, but had forgotten that it really wasn't that much better than the 1960's Batman.

Then you know he is the second most recognized American hero next to Superman. Batman was the next big success in DC's comic to film genre. Marvel is only now beginning to realize the potential in the mainstream comic to film genre. There are a lot of films around that originate in comics that no one knows about (e.g. From Hell). Spiderman was a great film for 2002, Daredevil is expected to do well, and Hellboy is in the making. If you liked or look forward to any of these, then you must own Batman. If you have not seen it, come out from hiding. Acknowledge that geniuses have made an incredible machine that allows people to views great stories on a screen. And then find a means to experiencing this film. Five out of five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie great pulls it to 2 stars","review":"listen, YES this is one of the greatest comic book movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorites across the board, but what is Warner Brothers thinking about not giving this DVD an upgrade to a special edition. Look at how many movies have been given this honor that have been flops. U.S. Marshalls for one. Knowing Tim Burton there has to be a ton of material waiting to be used to have hours of extra features. I would love to see even some new interviews with the cast reflecting back.

Sure the box might say 1080p, but this is not high definition. It reminds me of the first shipment of Fifth Element which was basically DVD quality on a Blu-Ray disc. That was recalled and Sony issued an apology. Now Warner needs to do the same for this film.The film itself is a classic, but just don't upgrade to this version, you will be disappointed with the film quality. It looks no better then the standard DVD version.(For the record, I put in the Blu-Ray of Lawrence of Arabia right afterwards, and let me tell you- that is a real Blu-Ray remastering!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Batman Movie","review":"With dark directing legend Tim Burton and none other than musical virtuoso Danny Elfman at the reins of this original the Dark Knight is portrayed as he should be, not as some child's Saturday morning cartoon with a batman credit card (Batman & Robin) which was truly a disgrace to all genuine Dark Knight fans everywhere. After Tim Burton ceased to direct the films they instantly dropped down the mountain. Luckily for fans the Nolan Bros resurrected the Batman franchise and justice for the Dark Knight is once again served, although to me this will always be the best of all Batman films ever. PS If you want to see what Gotham City REALLY looks like (not Chicago or Pittsburgh), watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman","review":"A great movie.

The surround sound on this current disk stinks. The picture isn't horrible for a 12 year old movie, but it could be a heck of a lot better.

Micheal Keaton was without a doubt the WORST BATMAN! Val Kilmer is the best Batman. It didn't have the \\"comicbook\\" look to it like the others. You didn't get as much of a Gotham feel. Like old cars and so on. It looked like New York. You can see it if you must but... It's nowhere near as good as Forever. The suit wasn't tight enough, so it was flopping around on his face. Anyone can look like Batman, but only some can look like Bruce Wayne. An old, fat, short ugly Bruce Wayne isn't exactly what most picture as Batman. The only one who has been spoke of that could do worse is Kurt Russel. At least he dosn't wear tights! (boy would his gut show then)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're gonna adapt a comic book for a movie...","review":"stick with the damn comic book. This gets 2 stars for Nicholson and Palance. That's it. Every kid who's ever read Batman knows the Joker had absolutely nothing to do with his parents' death, much less saying anything to Bruce Wayne as a child. Gotham looked like a sci-fi fan's fantasy, not like a super-hero's domain (yes, that's a fantasy, too, but of a different sort; a \\"real-life\\" sort). The whole museum \\"dance\\" sequence, other than an excuise to showcase a Prince song, was pointless. The whole thing actually, was disjointed and rambling, and yes, I agree Burton was far more concerned with visuals than authenticity.

Chief among them is his obsession with proving academics wrong. Rather than write much on how he thinks through and makes real-world investments, he spends most of his ink distinguishing value investing from Efficient Market Theory and Graham-and-Doddism. It gets old, and dull. And he constantly qualifies his statements with \\"probably\\", \\"would seem\\", and so on, and undermines himself. The writing also utterly lacks any sense of humor. Finally, I was disappointed that Whitman--who is an astute and detail-oriented investor--did not include more case examples, with financials, to show his reasoning and method at work.His first outing, The Aggressive Conservative Investor, is better in many ways, but is still turgidly written.Given Whitman's talents, track record and reputation for smarts, this is a real let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique perspective","review":"As someone who has read the works of Ben Graham and the letters of Warren Buffett, I can honestly say this book offers some new ideas you are unlikely to find anywhere else.

It is not intended to be an update of Security Analysis, despite what previous reviews on Amazon may say.
