In reality, we learn nothing about Gardner we didn't know before but we get a lot of melodrama and self-serving introspection about a person who simply would not be of interest except that the allowed herself to be manipulated by a man, who while a great writer and teacher, crossed the line once too often, taking advantage of his celebrity and status.The details of Gardner's life are not new; Ms. Thorton's story is not much beyond whining and self-loathing, and she does, perhaps, ultimately reveal or imply more about herself and her role in John Gardner's fall than she intends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love is Blind","review":"To me, John Gardner was egotistical, self-serving, and liked nothing better than the sound of his own voice.

Worf is challenged to join two Klingons that are on board the Enterprise into commandeering the ship. Worf makes a few interesting remarks regarding what a true warrior is, and reveals a little of his personal background. However, the episode itself is paced a little too slowly. Not that TNG episodes need to be replete with action, but for instance, the first scene on board the wrecked freighter just seems slow and pointless. There's a bit of time exploring how Geordi views through his vision device, but it doesn't serve the plot at all. Later on the episode's pacing starts to suffer again. Once the action starts, it's ok. There is one good stunt though in the final scene in main engineering.Overall, good reveals about Worf, and good exploration of the concept of being stuck between cultures. However, the episode's pacing is too slow at times, with some elements that seem pointless to the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality here, baby!","review":"OK, so you like ST:TNG, and you really want these DVDs, but you're scared of the price.

Most other TV series DVDs are released in their broadcast Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack. However these ST:TNG sets have all been remastered in glorious Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. Yes that's right. Paramount has done their fans right with these sets and remastered each and every episode in 5.1 Surround. Imagine the amount of work here. 178, IIRC, episodes all remastered in 5.1 Wonderful! Even the more expensive X-Files sets aren't in 5.1. So you're actually getting a bargain here.Looking ahead to next year and the DS9 sets, imagine watching the Dominion War episodes in 5.1 Surround!

When I first heard of this DVD boxed set I couldn't wait. And even though many people say season 1 wasnt great, re-watch the episodes as I have done... you'll realize just how good they really were. Especially some of the early character development. Some other perks to this DVD are the sound in 5.1/although I would have loved to get my hands on a DTS version the 5.1 sounds is crisp and clear, and the bonus footage... over 20 hours to entertainment.Overall it's a great set to own...

Every episode is like watching a different DVD movie in 5.1 and NO COMMERCIALS!

Early as they are, they do show the philosophy that makes TNG different from other Star Trek series in my opinion. For example, Where no one has gone before, a lesson on taking responsibility for our mistakes. No shooting or fighting during the whole episode, I can happily enjoy it together with my 4 yr. old son. Another example, in Lonely among us, Riker and Picard discussing about fights for religion or economic systems and how now it is only in history books. Something to look forward to.I was disappointed however by the quality of the transfer to DVD. Contrast isn't very good at some points and there is noticeable macroblock noise from time to time. The studios should be more careful. All Star Trek series are heavily pirated on the 'net, if the DVD has a poor quality some of the skilled and dedicated rippers out there will filter and clean the images and the pirated versions will look better than the one you can buy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, we finally have it!","review":"Well its finally here. I got mine in the mail right on March 26. I opened it right away to see what it looked like. The best part about this set is the character and staff interviews on disc 7. I hated giving it a rating of 4, but it is seson #1. The other seasons are by far better, but this is the season the set the standards. If you are a Star Trek fan this will be a great investment. The DVD's will last for forever. We all know how teadious it is to take ech episode on VSH from TV, and we all know that the quality of VHS only last for about 15 years. If you are going to get the other seasons get this one. Its better that buying the episodes one DVD at a time like TOS. Live Long and Prosper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This was delivered with no damage and all contents play fine. The clarity is uncanny and it's been a true joy to re-watch these as they were meant to be seen. I was surprised how thin the case is compared to the normal DVD set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the cast & Mr. R himself hated this one","review":"It's certainly worth watching for its educational/historical value on how our attitudes on cultural sensitivity in the media have shifted since this episode was created. It's pretty certain this sort of thing would have wound up littering the cutting room floor these days (thank goodness).Jonathan Frakes dubbed this episode a \\"worthless piece of ****,\\" and Mr. Roddenberry himself was disgusted to the point of firing director Mayberry as a result of this piece.At the same time, racism wasn't the intent of the story; if one manages to sit through it, this one was supposed to be a thought-provoking look at the differences between perceived technical and cultural advancement, and the concepts of \\"superiority\\" that come out of those concepts. Had the Ligons been cast more diversely, as originally intended, that may have come through. Sadly the message & moral were lost with Mayberry's poor decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Wow, it is finally happening. If you are a Trek fan, this will be quite a prize to own. Even though the first season or so isn't the best the complete seet of all 7 season will be a hit. The best part is the crew intervies on disc 7. Have fun and enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Begining","review":"I really enjoyed the first season and watching all of the personalities develop. There were only a couple of episodes that I decided to \\"skip\\". Worf's evolving appearance is cool to watch between the first shows and the second season."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of the best","review":"What can I say? The best Star Trek series ever, on DVD, from the very beginning? I am THERE. Of course, the first season, they were still a little rough around the edges, getting their acts together (remember boys in skirts?!). But, there was Tasha Yar, and that says it all. Great set to own for any Trekkie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Code of Honor","review":"This episode is notorious for being (hilariously) racially insensitive. The people of the alien planet are black, and wear clothing that resembles traditional sub-Saharan African clothing, and behave primitively. The whole story is pretty lame, but it is a nice episode for Tasha Yar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek: The Next Generation is Great!!","review":"I have enjoyed Star Trek: The Next Generation since I was a kid!

Great to watch without commercials. It is good to have Amazon Prime.

Oh oh and the best thing ever - it is the first star trek dvd/bluray to have a 'play all' function that is oh so missing on the TOS blurays and TNG dvds."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY...a price drop!","review":"Like many Star Trek fans, I've been pretty vocal in my objection to paying over $100 for a single season of ANY t.v. show, including Star Trek. Now it seems my patience has paid off, as Paramount has finally reduced the price (on the first 3 seasons so far) to within range of us poor working-class types.As for the show itself, I've never understood why so many people dislike the first season. Sure, there are a few duds, but that is to be expected from virtually any show. Season one adheres closely to Roddenberry's original vision of space exploration, as well as exploring the many facets of the human condition within a science fiction context. I admit, it's not as fun as the original series, or as mature as DS9, but there's still much to recommend these maiden voyages of the Enterprise-D.Hopefully, Paramount will soon make all season of ALL the Trek shows available at this new lower price."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sound Effects?

Buffy's Season Two has almost as many episodes (22 to 25) for less than half the price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Package, Horrible Season","review":"The first season is easily the worst of TNG's run. Sexism and racism are evident, as this season is the most like TOS. The thing is TOS was in the 60's, to have this traits in an 80's show is sad. That being said, the overall package here is pretty great. The new documentarys are very well done. All extras from the previous DVD release are included, and we finally get some officially released gag reels! The upgraded pictures look great, and the new effects are amazing. Can't wait for season 2, it only gets better from here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, Don't Buy","review":"Much as I have enjoyed viewing the Season 1 episodes, I would enjoy them more if they looked better. On DVD, many episodes or scenes within episodes suffer from one or more ills: washed out colors, erratic brightness and contrast, distracting digital artifacts. I recommend renting Season 1 (or checking it out at the public library) instead of buying it. Maybe Paramount will remaster Season 1 when the studio prepares it for distrubtion on Blu-Ray. I hope so because at higher resolution, these episodes will look even rougher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Image Quality","review":"I agree with most reviews on content and sound, but I am disappointed with the image quality. The number of (large) artifacts that appear now and then is scary, but the overall graininess and rough edged appearance is worse. Also I wanted to have the option of hearing and seeing TNG dubbed and subtitled in multiple languages. I suppose the North American region loses out in that respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It, however, am somewhat dissapointed (image quality)","review":"I have long-awaited the release of TNG on DVD in a box set. I had hoped to see the epsiodes in HIGH Quality, as opposed to the various purchased VHS tapes of TNG, namely the Pilot Episode. The box-set package is eye-candy inside and out. You get the DVDs as well as the bonus Episode Guide CDROM. This was a great addition to the set, esp. for the price.My greivences: The video quality is very poor. Images are very pixalated as you would see in a very poor quality ASF or DivX file. Also, a minor detail -- The episodes aren't in numerical order on the discs. Maybe this was done for maximum utilization of disc space. Some episodes may have taken up more memory than others.I have some Star Trek: TOS DVDs. They have better quality than TNG, and they were recorded in the 1960's.Overall, this box-set is STILL well worth the purchase. I would still have purchased the set, even if I had seen the video quality beforehand.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre lack of sound effects makes weak episode unwatchable","review":"I'd forgotten how truly bad the first season was. Between the overly emotional responses, contrived plot and everyone hamming it up, the pilot comes off as a parody of TOS. I'm glad it survived and got better.There are no sounds effects in the Instant Video version-no warp core throbbing, ship rumble, klaxons, door closing, console responses, torpedo sounds, jumping to warp, etc.There is only dialog and the music soundtrack. Where did this version come from?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing SoundTrack for weapons","review":"I don't think its worth watching any more after what has been done to this episode. Within minutes of the start of the episode you will notice no sound for the Guns or Photon torpedoes. Stopped watching after that. It took alot away from the enjoyment of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Picture quality","review":"The long-awaited Blu-Ray release of TNG is well worth the wait. Picture quality and audio are amazing. Looking forward to the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Filler","review":"This episode is a lackluster cap on an otherwise phenomenal first season. There's very little conflict, and the people from the 21st century are annoying caricatures. I think the half of the story involving the Romulans was good, but it could have been its own episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Tasha Yar was never around long enough to make the death \\"emotional\\" for me. Denise Crosby was a terrible, stiff actor. And unfortunately for her, Tasha was never developed further as a character. In that sense, there is no attachment here because up to this point her character has been superfluous. Crosby as Sela later on would be better.As for the rest of the episode, the concept of Good vs. Evil was glossed over. Armus never made anyone truly suffer. In the end, this is an episode solely for the purpose of getting rid of Yar. And it did that without being memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a comfortable shoe","review":"I recently ordered all 7 seasons of TNG and started at the beginning. Im not a trekkie, but was an avid fan of this series from the start, and have also seen it many times in reruns over the years. However, hadnt seen any startrek in at least 5 years and had built up a craving for it.There's something very comfortable and sentimental about watching TNG. It might be part nostalgia, but whatever the reason its a nice feeling to come home from work and watch an episode or two of this show.The first season (like many first seasons) isnt perfect, and there are some pretty bad episodes, but also some really strong ones as well, and even the weaker episodes are still entertaining in their own way.Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special features not too special.","review":"If you are a Next Generation fan, this collection is definitely a RECOMMENDED BUY. The quality of the episodes in sound and vision are both top notch! However, if you are not a serious Next Generation fan, or if you are looking for extra/special features other than the TV episodes, you may be disappointed by the lack of special features and the ridiculous pricing in this gift set!Special features do exist in the gift set, but they aren't too special. If you want special features or want to learn more about Star Trek, go and buy:- Star Trek 25th Anniversary Special (1991) (ASIN:6302424216)- Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond (1996) (ASIN:079214550X)Don't waste your money on this pricey collection!But, if you are a Next Generation fan who likes to watch Season 1 episodes over and over and over and over (etc.) again!!

The first season was not as good as the others, but to appriciate the next six seasons you need to see the beginning. The behind the scenes stuff is worth watching also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vintage cheese","review":"If you're wondering why you've never caught this episode on repeats, I suspect it's because they're embarrassed to replay it. The writing and acting is on par with the original Star Trek series which, if you're a dyed-in-the-wool trekkie (like I am), makes this episode at least fun - if horribly painful - to watch. At least it's one more notch toward your \\"I've watched them all\\" achievement badge.With so much fine, vintage cheese as you'll find here, I'd recommend a good wine.

Ii enjoyed the book that i read before. The Mysterious Case of Sidd Finch, but I did not like the Paper Lion. Thi book is too slow for my liking and it didn't keep me very interested. Plimpton is a great writer but this one kind of bombed to me. The book starts out very slow. George Plimopton is going undercover as a backup quarterback, third strign that is. He goes and plays for the Detroit Lions. Not the greatest pick if i say so. The ciach of the lions was George Wilson, no not the neighbor form Dennis the Menace. The story is mainly duriing the preseason. Plimpton howeer does take snaps, and doew get his fair share of bruises and cuts. Like i said earlier, PLimpton needed to put a little bit more of action into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Work","review":"This is a very informative book, which expertly counters some of the erroneous understandings stubbornly clung to by modern scholars. The Rotting Goddess is a scholarly work in its own right, and the author employs sound methodology in his presentation. This is sure to annoy many modern scholars whose own views come up short in comparison.Essentially the book deals with archaic concepts regarding witches, focusing mainly on classical witchcraft, since this is the oldest material in Western literature about witches and witchcraft. The author nicely demonstrates how the image of Hecate shifts from a Great Goddess figure to a chthonic crone figure over the centuries, and how the villification of witches follows suit in a parallel course.Every witch and wiccan should have a copy of this book on their bookcase, and should read it at least twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diffrent Look","review":"I bought this book for a project I was doing for school. Unfortunatly this book had nothing to do with that subject. It although was an very interesting read. It was a bit much at times but I find that every thing that lasts through time is. The time that must have been put in the little book must have been great. But I would not recomend this for any one truly wanting to learn of the goddess. This book was a study of the declime of women in a male dominate society, using the Goddess Hecete as an example of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What passes for scholarship these days?","review":"Rabinowitz's book is not merely silly, it is pretentious as well. His conclusions are specious at best, when they are not actually fanciful. All of this is presented in prose of Saharan dryness.

The pagan woo-woo set,who will read anything endorsing their views, will be defeated by the short text's sheer turgidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious innacurate gibberish","review":"There are so many worthwile, neglected texts out there on the subject Rabinowitz has chosen, I can't see why anyone would bother.

Sorry everyone who loves it. I did not find it inspiring or well written. I found it teeth grindingly preachy and overly religious. As a non religious person who has given their life to public service and the greater good I found this book to present a narrow view of generosity. If you are Christian you may like this book if you are a generous person who is not Christian you will close the book with the creepy feeling that your hard work for a better world doesn't count to some people. If it inspires anyone to go out and do good for others great, but can't we do good for others without spreading our own religious agenda?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

It contains half the modes a standard fighter has and nothing new. The story mode is short. The gameplay is good and filled with action, it's just that you will be sitting down playing the same short and lacking modes.

Many of those who are ill have found that doctors are not the nicest of people with whom to deal, and there is nothing to make a patient feel comfort or empathy in this book.

The victim this time is a nasty serial killer who has been brought to a laboratory to test out a new breed of skeeters that might help lower the casualties in a new virus propagated by mosquitos that is 100 times worse than the Nile virus. He makes an escape attempt, however, and in the process is infected with the DNA of these mosquitoes and turns into a nasty mosquito man.

At higher volumes, the tone settings really don't make any difference because he still can't hear because of poor voice quality. This phone is supposed to be hearing aid compatible, my father can here on this phone better without his hearing aid and on a much lower volume than the phone is capable. Hopefully there will be a learning curve associated with using this phone, but for now, it is not worth the money.

Unbelievable. And it's true: all the walkthroughs on the internet are completely useless, because the PS3 game is completely different from the other platforms. It's a pity, because they put a lot of work on this game which potentially would be very nice.-- Edit:I have now dedicated more time to the game. I'm still convinced there are several issues, but I must say that all in all it is not bad. It is rather fun to play and probably it is worth trying.

When I bought 2000 I just expected it to be a notch above 99, well it's not. The graphics are terrible compared to 99. The play control is really bad! On defence you move your guy one way and he moves the other way! . In the pro bowl game I thought it was so cool in 99 how they kept their own helmets, not in 2000. They look like generic teams.

Additionally, little things like always getting called for delay of game penalties after touchdowns and the fact that it was impossible to kick field goals made this game extremely frustrating.

It's nice to hear someone other than Attenborough talking on a nature show (not that he isn't great, it's just that he has a near monopoly on nature documentary narration these days).While I am familiar with most of the species in this documentary, I never get tired of seeing them.

I was amazed at the diverse animals, the landscapes, and of course, the picture quality on this title.

The first half dozen times I tried to play it, the disc couldn't be read and kept coming up unplayable. To make sure it was the disk and not my player, I inserted several other HD-DVDs, which all worked. In a turn for the better, I tried Galapagos one more time after that and it played.

River Deep sounds a little odd in a trancy format,but it's still kickin. Adeva's vocals on In an Out of My Life get a trance mix for the first time. Martha's Harbour is a smooth female vocal trance track. And this style of music takes us euphorically to the end of the disc, which is topped by a gorgeous female vocal track.

I'm sorry to say: not for this reader.The psychological effects of the stories, was, for me, not \\"chillng\\", but depressing.The characters droned, seemed hopeless, usually WERE hopeless (no discernable changes by the end of a story), and generally just plodded on, until the author abruptly ended their adventure.Oates is a skilled writer, but less so in crafting horror fiction than other genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Stories of Uninteresting characters","review":"The short stories are unbeliveble and the characters unsympathetic.

I was sorely dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pac-Man is Difficult to Play on GameBoy","review":"I found this game very difficult to play on GameBoy due to the setup of the GameBoy controller, and the size of the screen. The pac-man does not maneuver very easily with the X-style controller. Also, the screen does not show the entire maze, and must pan as you maneuver. This becomes confusing, especially when trying to plan a strategy. I would not recommend this game for GameBoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The king of all video games","review":"I remember being absolutely fascinated with Pac-Man when it first came out. It was truly groundbreaking and I had to get it when I bought my Game Boy Color. As others have said, it is a little hard to control with the Game Boy pad thing and not the joystick and I have lost several lives because of that difficulty. Also, others here have complained that the maze doesn't change at all but I'm 99.9-100% sure that it never changed at all in the original arcade version. It was Ms. Pac-Man that introduced changing mazes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get 2 for 1","review":"Pacman is always a fun game, I was surprised however that no one mentioned how hard it is to see the blue lines that make up the maze. Unless you have a very strong light on the screen, you may waste some time missing a turn because the blue maze boundaries are so hard to view.

It has many good moves including numerous different slam dunks that are totally cool! I also like the funky music at the menu screen! The graphics is very good and the animations are slick! With all 29 teams and more than 100 NBA players this game is a must-have for arcade basketball fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back!","review":"Anyone who's spent time with Katrina and the Waves' great albums (the two Attic LPs, \\"Shock Horror,\\" or their self-titled major label debut) knows that Rew is the king of succinct, rocking anglo-pop. \\"Tunnel. . .\\" is an amazing return: great melodies, clever lyrics, and typically superb guitar work.

Well,I'm afraid the old adage...\\"never judge a book...\\" applies in the negative here. Let me qualify something first...Rew is a good musician, with a crisp, ringing guitar tone and amiable chord chemistry, BUT... a compelling songwriter/singer he is NOT! With the impressive roster of guest artists on the album and considering who he has worked with in the past, it's a shame this material just kind of...lays there and fails to inspire repeat listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solomon's Men","review":"Professional thief Gregory Valdez finds himself in a world of trouble when he is hired to steal an ancient artifact long hidden in a church in Portugal. Not knowing the true identity of the item he was hired to steal, he finds himself being pursued by the last remaining Knights Templar now known as Solomon's Men. Things go terribly wrong when Valdez learns the true identity of the artifact. Glen Starkey takes the reader into the strange world of a secret organization formed during the inquisition to hide and protect the true shroud of Jesus from the Pope who was about to put the Knights Templar on trial for heresy. This is a well written thriller filled with action and well developed characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Page Turner!","review":"My usual habit is to have several books going at one time. What I read on any particular night is dependent upon how tired I am...until Solomon's Men! No matter how worn out I found myself, I would be engaged in as fierce a battle to defeat my exhaustion as Greg Valdez was to save those he loved!What normally would have taken me about a week to finish only lasted me two nights.Glenn Starkey has managed to work just the right amount of descriptive verbiage into a finely woven piece of work. Nothing to bog the reader down...only send them on a fast, fun filled, exciting adventure that all too quickly ends. Definitely leaves the reader anxious for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller of the first order!","review":"SOLOMON'S MEN by Glenn Starkey is on my list of top books!This is a tale of modern day Templar Knights and their total commitment to protect a Christian artifact, at any cost and the man, Gregory Valdez, whoo is contracted to steal a pouch, without knowing its contents. He is to return the pouch to its rightful ower--or so he thinks.SOLOMON'S MEN is a strong character based tale in which I am sure took many hours of research. It is a tale will make you believe in the truth of it.A Thriller where two sides pursue Valdez as he discovers the truth about what he has in his possession. Action, suspense, drama carry the reader along and won't release you until the end. This is a book you will want to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Greater Love","review":"Greg Valdez had become a professional thief, retrieving stolen art and putting it in the right hands. He accepted one last mission to do the same - or so he thought. After Monks tried to kill him, curiosity about the pouch he retrieved was at an all time high. Even so, he didn't take a look, in spite of his temptation to do so.Running for his life and, in a desperate effort to save his son and the woman he hoped would become a part of his future, Greg Valdez took on each enemy he faced - whether involving people or nature itself - fighting as a man who had everything to lose.Despite the battles being fought, Solomon's Men is an exemplary story, detailing just what it means to love to the extent that it cannot be greater than what the human soul feels in a given moment.I already know, despite other titles I will read in 2012, that Solomon's Men will rest at the top of my list. Great job, Glenn Starkey! I look forward to reading your other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Concise Business Strategy and Economics book","review":"This is an excellent book about Business Strategy and Economics in the airline environment.

Mr. O'Connor possesses exceptional credentials and this particular book is considered part of a group of classic educational material for the serious student and aspiring aviation manager to read.There are many books written about aviation and airlines.

Herein you can read all about mumps, measles, and malaria (if you want to read about the pleasant diseases) or plague, anthrax, and rabies (if you want to read about the unpleasant ones). Each has a fascinating story to tell.What can you do with this book? Well, you can read aloud the descriptions of gastrointestinal diseases at the dinner table.

For instance, with Rabies, the author states humans can only contract the disease if bitten by a rabid animal. Not true. Infection can be transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal or another human by contacting saliva with an open wound or mucus membrane. The author also states that humans are a dead end for the virus because we can't infect others. Absolutely not true. Visit a hospital with a rabies patient and you'll likely get a very different opinion as to the danger of the virus spreading.Overall, the information felt unverified and dashed off.

On at least half of them the rubber band breaks within minutes of putting it on, if not when you try to put it on - no matter how carefully you stretch it. If you do get it on without breaking a band, it may not seal against your nose. This respirator has no way to adjust the fit on your nose, and everybody has a different nose, so one size does not fit all.Now about those other masks that have the metal bar. People complain about the metal bar in other masks being uncomfortable, but if you take a second to form it right it won't be uncomfortable and it will seal. Don't just put the mask on and then squeeze the metal bar - it will get a tight bend in the middle and hurt your nose. Form the metal over the tip of your finger before you put it on and it will be close to your nose, if not just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent filtering and very comfortable","review":"I have been using these Moldex masks on my job for several years. The company stopped purchasing these for a much cheaper brand. For the price, these are the best masks I've found for general purpose. I use them for everything from blowing out dust in electric motors and brakes to mowing and edging. The best feature by far is the comfort factor. There is no metal band across the nose bridge and the nose pad is so much softer. The elastic bands stay pliable much longer than other brands and I've never had the bands break when donning and doffing.

In Knockout Kings 2001 - Boxers were able to enter with music, some of them even had them had their own dance. The overall gameplay was much more enjoyable. I just hope that if they do come out with a Knockout kings 2003, it would be in the format of 2001.

You can not throw body punches, only one signature move, two ilegal punches, and use of analog stick (a nightmare!).Second, no SLUGFEST. That was very fun when playing with your friends, but, not anymore.Third, no Training in career mode. You fight, win, get Reserve Points, and move on. \\"Boring\\"Fourth, No Ranking in Career mode.

Forget about ring introductions, referee interaction or camera pans in the corner between rounds because none of this is there. Fighting is totally, totally unrealistic.

This book provides a systematic and usable model of assessment in counseling, yet gives the user of MMT complete freedom in choosing and creating appropriate interventions. This book discusses the theory behind the MMT model and presents examples of the model at work in different therapuetic contexts.

Be careful with this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not wash out of ANYTHING!","review":"I normally love Melissa and Doug products, this is the first one that I hate! (that is a really strong word, but in this case it is applicable). We had been using Crayola paints, but the bottles are so small you end up wasting half the paint because you can't get it out, so I was looking for something like a squeeze bottle that was a little bigger. I think I am going to throw it away after this first use! (I normally really try to use things up even if I don't like them) We only used the green because we had the other brand left of the other colors, but it completely took over my kids project and EVERYTHING ended up green. And everything it touched it stained, even the plastic cups we were using and the paint brushes! I still can't get it out of my fingernails either! I will say that it has great \\"coverage\\" as it advertises :). Buy with caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WASHABLE","review":"The paint lasts a while and would otherwise be great to use except for the fact that it is NOT washable. It's hard to get off skin and it doesn't come out of clothes. I am going to try another brand to hopefully find some paint that is truly washable. My daughter wears an art apron or smock, but it often gets on her skin (or even hair, which it then dyes!!) and may accidentally get on her clothes.. to which it does not come out. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Paint OK but a very purple blue","review":"This paint is fine - covers well and seems washable enough but I was disapointed with the color.

I went and bought a Hardy Kiwi plant this spring and can't wait until it matures enough to produce fruit. I am also interested in the Mulberry and the Pawpaw because of this book.

I wrote that the lyrics were cheesy gore lyrics. That is what I thought from once glancing at the lyrics sheet. But lately I bought the cd and played it. No the lyrics are more socialpolitical and cooler! And yes the metal was wonderfully heavy. I liked how they parodied the blackmetal scene with the artwork. However, I am much more interested in the deconstructive sound of the next album. It makes a unique flavor that helps the music stand out.

No camera angle choices. Fielding is basically impossible for any tough plays. If you want to play like Ichiro forget it.

While ALL STAR is a really good baseball game, TP '02 still has that \\"at the ballpark feel\\" to it that no other game has. The gameplay is not awesome but it is really good. Yes, like other reviewers have stated, the players heads are slightly too big for the bodies while they are batting. But aside from that flaw, the graphics are the best ever seen on a baseball video game. For players looking for a more \\"true to life\\" game by maybe getting 4 or 5 hits in 9 innings, get ALL STAR. But for the most fun, TRIPLE PLAY is still the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your cash.","review":"This game is bad. I thought I'd be on it for hours, but I lasted 30 minutes. The game play is dull. The situations aren't realistic. I dont recamend a game where Toby Hall can beat Sammy Sosa in a HR derby. The graphics are horrible. I cant tell the difference between Bonds and Preston Wilson! The stadium graphics are OK even though They're not as good as ASB2003 and WSB2K2. I'd recomened not to wast your $$$ and buy ASB2003 or High Heat Baseball 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like an arcade game to me...","review":"The graphics are sharp, except they seems a little carttony for the players. One big problem for me is the rather difficult fielding and even easier hitting--you'll have a 10 to 10 game by the second inning if you're not careful! And lastly, the game feels a little rushed, I'mrenting a version and it crashed on me 3 times :-( Not a good impression EA Sports, back tot he showers with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic, arcade action","review":"If you are considering the purchase of Triple Play from a video/arcade game perspective and have a cursory understanding of baseball, you will probably find it enjoyable . . .However, if you appreciate the nuances and strategy involved in the actual game and you're looking for realistic gameplay and outcomes, then, depsite its misgivings, your only choice is High Heat - as evidenced by the (nearly obsessive) web communities dedicated to the discussion and development of 3DO's product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst baseball game ever!!!!","review":"i would rather play regular baseball for nintendo. I have been a triple play fan ever since it has started. I find it impossible to field the ball in turf stadiums and i couldn't hit the ball with one of those big red wiffle ball bats i had when i was a kid. I'll buy tp03 but EA Sports better get there stuff together and make a better game. Alot better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Do the people who made tp02 even try to make it better than last years? They did not suceed in any case. It is relatively to hit and pitch, but fielding is just too difficult. My advice: buy High Heat 2003 instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"This game is definitely addicting. The graphics and gameplay are really awesome. The most annoying parts of the game are the music, the fact that home run derby is way too easy, and that the easiest level is too easy and the hardest level is to hard. Playing the pro (middle) level is just about right. I win some games and lose some games. It's a bit hard on the pro level to strike people out, but it can be done. One truly great mode to play is human vs. human. I believe that this is the most realistic part of the game. The batting cursor can be invisible so that you really have to tell what type of pitch (fastball, curveball, etc.) it is before you can swing. It really gives the game a good, true feel to it. As said before, the announcers are sometimes inaccurate with their calls and there needs to be a dynasty-type mode, but overall I would definitely recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"homerun derby","review":"I have had this game for a while let me tell you Ive also have high heat and all star baseball and triple play is better than those two no matter what anybody says those two are not better.The graphics on triple play are better stadium wise and player wise.My only complaint is I think the graphics could be better and the players heads are too big just like everybody else has said. I think the people who play the game say its too easy are playing on the rookie level or pro.They should try the all star level when playing a game. During home run derby though its too easy.Also what [makes me mad] is the repeating replays when there is men on base and you the hit the ball it also bothers me when you are playing defense. Thats basically my opinion triple play is better than high heat and all star baseball."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"I played a demo of this game and it's worthless. It's so hard to put the bat on the ball even on the easy mode. The pitches just wiz by, you have to swing and guess it will be a strike (it's that hard to tell). Pitching isn't any easier and it takes a long time to throw the pitch you want. This makes games seem much longer, almost like the length they are in the Major Leagues. It just takes away from the fun of it. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to wait until Triple Play 2003 comes out to see if it got any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"maybe not the most detailed game ever, but it just feels like baseball. also, the comentary is as good as any sports game"},{"rating":"1","title":"TP 02 is BS","review":"I can't agree more, with the other ratings I have read.

Season 1 looked amazing. Such care and love went into that set and now all I can say is what happened?! Season 2 looks terrible! It's really sad and frustrating that this was actually approved of by CBS. The space shots are now totally inconsistent from the Season 1 space shots. Planets look blurry, the Enterprise looks unrealistic in certain scenes compared to the previous release. Even some of the interior shots with the actors look grainy.The only postives are the extras like the extended cut of The Measure of a Man with commentary, gag reel and new docs along with the old docs from the DVDs. Still, it's ridiculous at the quality drop for the actually episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"The quality on Season 2 is terrible. Picture is very grainy.

Definitely one of my favorite episodes of this season, and one of the best of the whole series, is \\"The Measure Of A Man\\". As one reviewer has already stated, this episode alone is worth the price of the box set.My other season two favorites include, \\"Q Who?\\", \\"The Outrageous Okona\\", \\"Loud As A Whisper\\", \\"The Dauphin\\", \\"The Icarus Factor\\", \\"The Royale\\", \\"The Emissary\\", \\"Up The Long Ladder\\", and \\"Shades Of Gray\\".Anyway you look at it, Star Trek:TNG season two on DVD will become a valuble addition to your collection.

Guess I will have to buy a new printer. it WON'T be HP!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bye Bye Inkjet","review":"This is a perfect replacement for an inkjet if you are tired of finding cartridges dried out and streaky before you barely get to use them. The LaserJet 1012 is very fast and whisper quiet, is very easy to set up, is relatively low-power, has space-saving design, and outputs beautifully sharp text and lineart that does not need drying time (no smearing). All this and the price is right, not much more expensive than cheap injets. With my old Canon inkjet, it was costing me close to .50 per page for occasional printing due to dried-up cartridges; the HP costs almost nothing per page. The old inkjet is now on its way to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A home user's dream!","review":"I needed a printer to print out b&w text. I considered the Brother 1440 and the Samsung 1710 along with this item after I decided to switch to laser over inkjet.I test printed all of them in the store and was extremely impressed with the advantages this machine had over it's low-price competitors. For one thing it has quite a small \\"footprint\\" on the desk. It also begins printing faster than it could say \\"yes, sir!\\". It also makes absolutely no noise that I can tell while it is on. I have heard the other two can offer a noticable whine when they are powered on.All-in-all it is exactly what someone like me, who has modest non-color home printing needs could want. The reduction of printing costs from $.12 a page (inkjet) to $.03 a page is enough for me to justify the higher upfront costs of laser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Printer, Highly satisfied.","review":"I got this delivered couple of days ago and let me tell you this is one smooth printer. I wanted a laser printer with which I could print my work documents from home. I was worried about the quality of print not matching the high-end laser printers at work, but let me tell this is one professional printing device. I compared it with Samsung ML-1710, brother HL-1440 but finally decided on the HP after reading some horror stories about Samsung's print quality and Brother's customer service.The printer is so compact that it is hard to believe that it is laser printer and not a Inkjet. I am more than positive that if you are home user looking for better quality printing this is the printer for you. Feel confident, make sure you buy the USB cable as it does not come with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troubles with Windows XP SP2","review":"The printing preferences window contents does not fit into the visible window area. It looks like a driver compatibility problem with the new Windows XP Service Pack 2. I didn't install SP2 on my other computer, and the driver is working fine.The Email technical support was terrible. They suggested me to download a \\"newer\\" driver from the HP website. However, this so called \\"newer\\" driver is more than one year old (September 2003) and is identical as that coming with the installation cdrom. They also referred me to the driver installation web page which was not suitable for the USB printer installation.The printer itself is working fine. Also, I believe that they will update the driver some time in the future and the problem will go away.I'm giving this product a single star mainly because of the HP technical support incompetence and the bogus and outdated driver software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for light-duty home use","review":"I've been using this printer for 4 months. So far, I'm satisfied with its performance. I'm chagrined that I suffered with an ink-jet printer for years, when laser printers are now relatively inexpensive.This particular printer does not come with a USB cable (or other type of printer cable), so make sure that you have one or aquire one.The paper tray and the other accessories are not the high-quality, heavy-duty things you may be accustomed to seeing on your printer at work; they seem flimsy but adequate for home use.There is no written manual, and the assembly instructions are merely pictographs - no written instructions on the sheet. Still, it's easy to assemble and connect to your computer. The only unclear step is the one that instructs you to rock the toner cartridge back and forth before inserting it into the printer. If you're unfamiliar with replacing a toner cartridge, you probably won't understand the picture-directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great printer got better","review":"This is an improved version of the Laserjet 1000. Changes primarily include better drivers (some of the silly install problems the 1000 experienced are gone) and a new manual paper feed that does not require removing the standard paper. All in all, this is another winner for HP, and a bargain at that. As long as it meets your needs (USB interface only, less feature rich, lower print volume) it is a great value. I'd had no problems with it, and it works great. And, yes, you do have to buy your own USB cable.It is worth noting that the paper feeding mechanism is less than industrial. While I have had no problems at all, I sense that it would not stand up to heavy use. E.g., it fine for a SOHO but not for something larger. Consider an HP Laserjet 1300 if that's your environment.We use it at home attached to a Windows 2000 laptop and it works flawlessly. Printer output quality is fast and very clear. I highly recommend this printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer, once you get it installed.","review":"This printer does everything it promises, and more! The printouts are crisp and professional. And the speed is downright amazing! If you've been working with an inkjet printer, and are tired of waiting 30 seconds or more for a page with rich, black text, then this is a fantastic upgrade.On the downside, installation is not user friendly. The install program failed 3 times from the CD. You have to copy the contents of the Install CD to your hard drive and run it from there to get it to install properly. (On a Windows XP Pro system). Now that it works, however, I can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functionally: Excellent. Paltry documentation","review":"This is a fine consumer/home office laserjet pinter. Affordable, quiet, compact (including a power cord with no \\"wall wart\\". Easy installation. Only two drawbacks (they are minor, but HP and other manufacturers need to pay attention to this):(1) One of the shoddiest quick start/set-up posters I've seen. A monochrome rebus on cheap paper. If you are not an experienced user of personal computers or printers, you may not understand what you're supposed to do.(2) No users manual. There is a 92 page pdf file, but HP (and others): please ship a manual with the product. Please!If you can get past that...then 5 stars:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect light duty laser printer","review":"I don't have too much to add, except to emphasize value. The printer is thoughtfully designed, I was just now appreciating that there is a second paper tray so I can pop in a single envelope without unloading the main tray, and lasers are to begin with so much cheaper and more reliable than inkjets (I have 3, 1 works). First page out is a bit slow at about 15 seconds. But I really am surprised at people here who complain that the printer doesn't do more; the price is the point. Good luck finding a significantly better buy in this price bracket. I don't think you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Stop the Steam","review":"In spite of this reliable printer's great reputation, it creates steam during the printing process. This is a real deal-killer. No matter how consistent its performance, there is no way I can recommend a printer that steams as it sucks moisture of out printer paper. It turns out this is a common complaint from owners of the LaserJet 1012. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before buying this one","review":"Warning: you will not be able to use this product without buying a separate USB cable. This is like buying a new car and first having to push it to the nearest gas station before you can use it. Apparently the USB from my digital camera is not the right size. There appears to be a parallel port but it is covered in a removeable-looking plastic bracket that I have so far been unable to pick off with my fingernails. I do not know how to reconfigure the printer to use the parallel port or how much force is too much to remove the plastic bracket, because the documentation / driver CD, which the instruction leaflet tells you to install first, fails the installation because it can't find the printer.I would cheerfully have forked over the extra - what - $5, to actually be able to use the product. HP used to be such a fine company, what happened?Buy this product only if it's cheaper than its competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Printer, BUT doesn't work with Vista","review":"I loved this printer until I bought a new computer with Vista and it wouldn't recognize the printer. No driver at HP, no solution at this time. So it is disconnected. I am pretty disappointed in HP not having a suitable driver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb printer!","review":"HP Laserjet 1012 is one of the best consumer grade laser printer. It costs slightly more than Minolta, Samsung or Brother offerings but that's because its built better & designed to last.The printer has small footprint, easy to set up and looks good. The paper tray can be folded for smaller storage space and replacing the toner cart is simple. Finding the hp toner and laser paper at local stores is also much easier than other brands.Print quality is excellent, just like business class lasers and print speed is good enough for a single user. Noise is moderate when printing. This printer has quality parts unlike other cheap & disposable lasers. When it comes to laser printers hp is the king!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long-lasting printer","review":"Have had this printer for more than 5 years, and it's still working well. I'm very impressed. When purchasing cartridges, I would recommend purchasing original HP cartridges, rather than cheaper refurbished ones, as the former tend to last far longer and prints turn out darker."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY RELIABLE","review":"I bought this printer in Nov of 2003 and still with us. Basically used for home and school use with 4 kids. Toner replacement is about once a year to 18 months depending on use. The toner maybe costly but it prints thousands of pages. It can print black and white pictures in which the quality will be dependent on the compression of the pix. Overall, very sturdy, reliable and cost effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice printer","review":"This is a very nice printer. as of yet we haven't had any problems with it and the printer quality is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little laser printer","review":"I bought this laser printer when I realized I will need to print out dozens of pdf research papers. Laser printers can churn out black and white prints much faster than ink jets. As a low end laser printer, I was surprised at how good the quality of its print outs are. The printer is quiet and compact. Toner cartridges cost around 70 bucks for 2000 pages, which is a bit more expensive versus that from other brand names. But I am very satisfied with my purchase. A great laser printer to have at home for printing out forms, documents and homeworks! I'd give it a 4.5 if i could, but its more 4 than 5 because it prints a bit slow and is a bit on the expensive side versus other budget printers.P.S. I also own a Konica Minolta 1350W, I find the LaserJet 1012 a much better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING and BEWARE","review":"I previously gave this printer 5 stars. However, beware. If you print, say, 50 pages in a row, the printer slows from its rated throughput to only ca. 4 pages per minute. HP tech support confirms this, and indicates that a cheap printer 'without a fan' overheats, and compensates by stopping the continuous printing...it could not be expected to do any better. Then why is it rated at 15 ppm?What nonsense. The printer is misrepresented. If you only print a couple of pages at a time, then this is fine. But if you print out program code or book or article manuscripts, this is a BIG problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for, thank god it was only 99 cents.","review":"First off, the thought of this product being $19.99 is ridiculous! It's a damn good thing it was on sale for $0.99, or else I would definitely be returning this product. Basically its a piece of photo-quality paper with a print out of this image. The printout appears to be from a really crappy $10 printer with horrible image quality. The whole image is ridiculously pixelated.Like I said, its a damn good thing this product went on-sale for $0.99 or else this would definitely be returned, but for the cost its not even worth returning.A product I was hopefully going to be proudly displaying in my living room right above my TV, is now being displayed in the spare bedroom so I don't have to look at it everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Lord is ALWAYS HERE","review":"This book brings much confort when you are looking for reasons for the many hurts present in today's world.

It is a strange and haunting story about a family and their surroundings during three generations, and Antunes tells us about their inner lives and their deepest feelings. Despite the surreal and tragic settings of his characters, the author manages to convey a genuine feeling of compassion in his story (or rather, stories). This is truly a tragedy in a dark landscape. But it is all so beautifully told! A wonderful book it is, and I recommend it to all book lovers who are willing to put in an effort. I believe this is one of this century's great books. It may seem confusing at times - Antunes uses parallel monologues and stories throughout the book - but it all adds up, as they say. Read it, and you'll see - it really is strange to be so happy after reading such a sad story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superbly crafted, totally engaging novel.","review":"In The Natural Order Of Things, Antonio Lobo Antunes tells the story of two families and the secrets that inextricably bind them. The finely tuned, vividly articulate voices and memories of his characters present a dreamlike reality that resonates in the mind and imagination of the reader: an army officer tortured in prison on charges of conspiracy; an elderly man, once a miner in Mozambique, now reduced to dreams of \\"flying underground\\"; a diabetic teenage girl and the middle-aged husband she despises. These and other elements combine to create a portrait of a disintegrating society and the history of Portugal as a family history. The Natural Order Of Things is ably translated from the Portuguese by Richard Zenith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmm Good","review":"Joop is a very teasing but sweet smell.. smells like a sweet grapefruit mixed with something else.

Beautiful orchestrations, great vocals, and amazing atmosphere. The band shines on all tracks but my favorite is the title track played at the two versions. If you must find a fault on this live is that they should be using some 15 horns instead of synths but you cannot have everything in life! I beleive that with this release and Fires At midnight the band is really expanding, writing and playing beautiful music, and (i think that all of us Ritchie fans agree) my favourite guitar player is cleary shining again playing music in a way he only knows instead of repetitions of a great past (for whom the bell tolls?). Do yourself a favor. Go by the album. Ps the greek version of Home Again (i am Greek) has wonderful lyrics and singing but the accent is somewhat greekamerican - anyway we are honoured by such an act of the band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, rather boring","review":"I like the music of Medwyn Goodall. Likewise, I have an appreciation of Terry Oldfield. I love meditative, relaxation & New Age music. Om, however, offers nothing to recommend it. It lacks heart, with music that is milquetoast, pedestrian and rather uninspiring ... so much so that I found it annoying rather than relaxing. You would do no worse by buying one of those generic cheap CDs that are sold at kiosks in Walmart and Target.I purchased this CD to use with my massage therapy clients, but instead I believe I'll drop it from my collection ... something I hardly ever do.

Based on the descriptions it sounded like a potentially good choice. But in reality it is a lot of plastic parts, the motor is not really powerful, and it did not tolerate any extra voltage. It was easy to put together for two 12 year-old boys, so in that sense it worked. But the end result is not very good, at least not for our project. The gears made some unpleasant noise despite all the greasing. In fact the only useful thing for our purposes was the grease which we used for our Lego gears. That's not so good for the price...

Although the viewer is often distracted by the slum environment in which the main characters lived, and even by \\"do-des-ka-den\\" (Japanese onomatopoeia for the clicketty-clack of the streetcar wheels), this movie focuses more intensely on the human condition than perhaps any of his other films. In addition, the contrasts between the poverty and the aspirations of the poor was insightful and sensitive. Do-Des-Ka-Den will never have the power or stature of Rashomon or Stray Dog, but in its genre, it will always hold a special place for those who hold Kurusawa's work in high regard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affecting, Accesible Story","review":"\\"Dodes Ka-Den\\" comes from the child's punning imitation of the sound of an electric train clacking over the tracks. Despite the title, the movie is not for kids, mostly due to the difficultly of reading subtitles, but also because the movie deals with death, extreme poverty, and prejudice.Those who don't enjoy the effort required to decipher Kurosawa period pieces might enjoy this sad, simple story set in the present. The movie is a series of interelated stories about of a group of people who live at the edge of a dump.Although my life is nothing like theirs, I found the story powerfully affecting. I highly recommend it. It's been five years since I've seen it, but I still remember it well enought to review on the occasion of Kurosawa's death. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Guys Are Kidding, Right??","review":"This film simply meanders around in a most depressing manner going exactly nowhere. There is no story other than the unrelenting poverty of its characters. And you could have ended the movie at any number of points with no impact. It was almost like they realized they were running out of film and decided to wrap it up with a shot of the trolley boy parking his trolley for the night.When you watch this movie you will swear time has stopped. It is dreadfully slow and depressing. You do feel sad for characters trapped in this squalor without a hope in the world of getting out of it, but at the same time you can't help telling yourself that you don't mind growing old but you do mind growing old watching this movie.Kurosawa is a great filmmaker but this is a soulless movie with no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Kurosawa Masterpiece","review":"Although not as well-known as several of his samurai films, I would rate Kurosawa's Dodes'ka-Den in his top four or five films. The movie is more of a slice of life than a traditional story with plot and character development and growth. Mostly, we follow the lives of some of Japan's poorest citizens, who live next to a large construction and debris waste site.The movie starts out with a wonderful pantomime performance worthy of Charlie Chaplin himself, as a mentally challenged young man pretends he's a trolley car driver. The movie becomes increasingly surreal and abstract as the colors morph into wild oranges and reds splashed across the screen, and the characters become more and more nonsensical.I can't say the movie was very uplifting, but it sure is one great piece of art. Dodes'ka-Den is still way ahead of its time, which is probably why it wasn't well-received when it first came out. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Do-des-ka-den\\" Reverberates Through the Years","review":"I saw this film more than 25 years ago and it still makes me smile when I ride a trolley or train. It takes very little imagination for me to convert the sounds of steel wheels on rails into the simple do-des-ka-den cadence. And with the conversion of sound comes an alteration of vision as through the trolley windows, I see Pittsburgh's urban humanity through the compassionate lens Kurosawa's uses to show his brave characters. This was my first experience with Kurosawa, and I always imagined this film as his version of \\"Cannery Row\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding reference book of UK genealogical research","review":"Contrary to the availablity information provided here, this book is not out of print.It is an absolute MUST HAVE if you're doing UK genealogical research!

Would that he felt as strongly about 'anti-catholicism.' The blatent anti-catholic bigotry of the book is reflected throughout.

Overall though, I found most of the performances to be quite rough around the edges, some didn't seem well rehearsed, there was a lot of \\"tugging\\" on costumes during the middle of a dance, the \\"asian\\" piece seemed almost to be mocking instead of interesting, and basically the entire thing just lacked a certain \\"finish\\".

I found it okay but I really can't think of anything in particular that made me go 'wow!'Curiously there is one act with a guy just hoola hooping.

We had a lot of fun with it, and for months later we regretted not taking it home with us then and there. Eventually, I realized I could probably find it on Amazon - and lo, there it was.The monkey is soft, cuddly, and very adorable. The arms are expressive, the tail luxurious, the legs ask to dance. Its only flaw is the mouth, which is difficult to operate. This occasionally makes the monkey appear vaguely surprised, since its mouth is often gaping.Otherwise, a great little monkey. Four bananas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way small","review":"This monkey puppet is a lot smaller then they make it look in the picture.

Unfortunately, the thing sheds worse than a real monkey (I imagine, anyway, I'm not sure if real monkeys actually shed). The fur falls out so easily that it's impossible to play with it without getting clumps of fur on your hand. If I let my baby play with it he would destroy it in no time. Even when I use the puppet to entertain him, he loves it, but then he wants to grab it, and clumps of fur are everywhere. It's too fragile of a toy, so it mainly just sits on his dresser and never gets played with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I've used this puppet for years in a public library. Children love him, they're entranced with him. He is absolutely adorable. Everyone wants to touch or hug him.

He is my favorite storytime puppet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly expressive-best puppet ever!","review":"I have been a teacher of preschoolers for over 20 years(special needs for the past 14 years) and have had a variety of puppets but this one (he is CoCo in Ms. Pam's Playschool) is sooooo real.

I am just a \\"soccer mom\\" with no political party ties, but after 9/11 I felt that the middle east conflict was one of several threats to my country and this book helped me understand why there is so much justifiable hatred toward historical American foreign policy.

It's heavier than some of the other hot air brushes and the smooth plastic bristles don't grip the hair particularly well. It gets quite hot; you can change the heat with the cool shot button - not convenient but doable. The \\"low\\" setting controls the blower, not the heat.There was a problem with the first unit I bought; after only a week of use, I retracted the bristles and they never came out again, no matter how much I pressed the release. I exchanged it and haven't had a problem with the second one.Despite the drawbacks, I've had good results and unsolicited complements. I get a nice, smooth blow dry with some fun shaping.

It drys my medium lenght hair which has a little natural curl very quickly, leaving it shiny, soft with just the right amount of smoothness and bounce. I use the low speed because it works for my hair. The higher level blows a little to hard and my hair get blown off the brush before I can curl it. I also like the fact that it doesn't seem to be getting too hot which is what would happen with the other brands I have tried.

It's a bit hard to put a finger on exactly why this book leaves one dry, but I suppose I would say that the book simply does not communicate well with the reader. The writing style is average (at best), explanations are superficial, and the code examples are consistently unfocused. The author just does not strike me as a born writer.

It is clear, concise, and contains few errors. Although it is 'short' compared to other technical tomes, it does not short-change the topic covered. I wish all technical books were of this quality.This book provides an excellent overview to what Enterprise JavaBeans are and then goes into details on how to use them. If all you need is an high-level understanding of EJBs, chapters 1-3 are for you. If you will be developing EJBs read chapters 1-9.You do need prior experience with Java and JDBC to get the most out of the examples. The provided diagrams are effective, I just would have liked seeing a few more at the point when new concepts are being presented.This will be a book I will continue to reference as I develop EJBs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre introduction to EJB","review":"Upon first reading this book, I didn't know to think little of it. Then I took reading other EJB books and found this one wanting for the following reasons: Entity Beans are described prior to describing Session Beans (when Entity Beans can be likened to specialized Stateful Session Beans), at no time did the book clearly and concisely state the bare minimum necessary to implement a Entity and Session Beans, and the book seemed to assume prior knowledge of other Java technologies such as JNDI and RMI.As I stated above, there are other books out there (that I will not name as I believe that I had a review censored for naming a book) that more clearly delineate what an EJB developer needs to know to hit the ground running. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for a solid understanding of EJBs","review":"I am currently doing EJB development using the BEA server and have found this book a necessity. He does a good job of tackling the different types of EJBs in a step by step approach, having each chapter and example build on top of the other.

From beginning to end this recording is great. Towards the end of the CD Tomas really picks up the pace, and shows amazing talent as it gets faster and faster, but staying completely tight. This CD gets the most play in my home, which is saying something considering my prog collection.

They are clever, and many have very detailed (and many) steps.However, the main reason I rated the book rather low is that the figures are very hard to see since they are printed in a very dark ink, and the instructions are, in many instances, almost impossible to see. It would have helped greatly if the diagrams were not printed so darkly -- indeed, the sample pages given when ordering are NOT what is seen. Also, it would have helped if there were some sugggestions as to size of paper with which to begin.I suspect that very experienced folders will play with the models and will be successful, but I also think these great figures would have been much more accessible -- as they should be as they are really good -- had the authors or publishers used a bit more care in what the end book would look like vis-a-vis the diagrams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cool+fun+hard= a great game","review":"This game is one of my top 5 GBA video games!

Episode II finds Anakin fighting the scary Tuskin Raiders. Finally, Episode III pits Anakin and Obi-Wan together. This time they're fighting the Separatists aboard General Grievous' ship.This is a very fun and action-packed game. My son prefers it to the Star Wars Episode III game pack. The graphics are excellent, and the official Star Wars music plays in the background while the player is slugging it out on the screen. I recommend this game very highly.

The work of Ms. Eakin and her contributors is stunning. It is very inspiring. She covers instructions and tips on more than I could imagine would happen or need to be considered. Stitching for a cabochon without backing is not included, but don't let that stop you from getting this book. It's fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This book makes it very easy to learn to mount cabochons.

There are so many beading books available & it was a bit intimidating trying to find something for a beginner to follow. I started with this book first because it gives you the basics in starting out; materials, stitches, etc... I did find it difficult in finding some of the materials listed, especially the thread ~who knew there were so many brands/sizes to choose from? I still haven't found the right backing listed but I just went with sturdy felt.I'm really looking forward to starting on some of the projects in this book. I'm going to attempt to make myself a necklace to wear on my wedding day. I love challenges!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cabachon Basics","review":"I found this book to have a great variety of techniques to embelish your basic beaded cabochon. I did not really care for the technique the author used to actually hold down the cabachon. I don't feel it is quite as sturdy as I would like. There are beautiful photos to help inspire your own pieces. I think this would make a good book for someone who is around beginner level in bead embroderiy, but has some knowlege of basic bead stitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beading Caboncheons","review":"Excellent hardcover shipped and arrived in perfect condition.Just love the book!

It is a genuine issue that has, unfortunately, been largely ignored by the mass media.Sadly, I was disappointed to find that Ms. Schlosser's book seems little more than a discussion of issues which seem irrelevent to the true matters behind CFIDS, and at certain points I wondered whether the author does indeed suffer from the affliction.Readers and the general public should know that CFIDS is a very relevant issue.

It has a very unrealistic plot (I realize many of this genre do, and this is no exception), and the writing is horrible.

With this Beatles '65 Russian import you get \\"I Feel Fine\\" and you get Beatles VI along with 9 bonus tracks that you can't get anywhere else. Particularly interesting is the Beatles version of \\"Come and Get It\\" which was made famous by Badfinger but written by Paul. Most of what is on this CD is on other CDs but with 2 LPs and 9 bonus tracks, this is really a great one to get. Another cool thing is that the CD itself is designed to look like an LP from Capital Records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented musicians","review":"Well, for each listener there is an album that really \\"nails\\" it.

Ben Lobst's excellent work with the singing bowls reaches deeply into the mind and consciousness and is hypnotic and powerful.As for \\"Siesta\\", and \\"Rivers of Zimbabwe\\", I found them limpid and way too long overall, unfortunately. The final song \\"Affinity\\" has the zither, and peruvian quena flute that bring some interest to the violin and fretless bass. To me, the album feels unfinished and I have a sense of waiting to hear the rest of their message or perhaps a direction for the music.

The claims it makes are based on straw conjecture and fantasy. This is typical junk from the right wing of Japanese politics and is no more trustworthy than the fools who make up the extremes of Japan politics. That anyone would take seriously the ideas offered up in this book is laughable...it's like claiming the earth is flat and the moon is made of green cheese.

Never ask a Taiwanese about what happened in China. Most Taiwanese liked the Japanese occupation. They were lucky that the armies that occupied Taiwan were friendly. Some units on the mainland were not savages either. My grandfather and uncle met them. Unfortunately, for most of China and Asia, people were not as lucky.2. The Nationalist army was weak. Too dispersed and corrupt and eventually fighting an internal war with the Communists. They did little to ward off the invaders. They even invited the invaders and served to support the invaders. (Not all units, but enough to be noticed by the people.)3. Yes, in some cases the Nationalist army did attact, rob, and rape their own people as stated by some witnesses.4.

It is not true, however, that they can relay that information to others in an easy to understand manner. Important terms and concepts are lost in numerous mathematical functions. The functions themselves would be somewhat self-explanatory if they had included numerical examples;however, they did not include enough to make the concepts crystal clear. Besides, how many college students can really get into products such as wine and cheese which the author's uses to illustrate a concept in the second chapter. They could have illustrated it much better with the use of beer and pizza. Agreeably, this has to be one of the worst economic textbooks I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best econ book I've ever used","review":"This is easily the best economics textbook I have ever used (and after getting an MA in economics, I've used several). It has clear, colorful graphs with notes right next to the graphs explaining the movements. The main text is very accessible for the lay reader, but each chapter also includes boxes and appendices going into greater depth. It also addresses the policy challenges and political economy, both of which are crucial to understanding international economics. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An important and useful text for understanding trade theory","review":"Krugman and Obstfeld provide a full detailed analysis and examples for the basis of trade among nations. It is relatively straightforward to comprehend for both economists and noneconomists.International trade is an important component of economic policy for the growth and development of countries. This book examines various theoretical trade models and provides real world examples of policy formulation and their impact. The authors do not take any political positions, thus making their analysis a purely objective, or positive study.I would highly recommend this book to students interested in doing research in international trade and development. It is a must read for prospective international economists. Noneconomists might also find it as a useful reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"international economics","review":"Have those reviewers really read the book? As I started reading, I found that Figure 2-3 in Part ONE is misprinted, that the definitions of the key terms are not clearly mentioned where they are indicated, and that it is hard to find the key point in each section with too long verbal explanations on mathematical points.

I did like Pack and felt sorry for him everytime Mara took offense to something he did or didn't do.I suppose the authors who have written so many books, such as Ms. Garlock, do tend to run out of characters and some of them become wimpy.

For example, the \\"lorena stove\\" sounds interesting, but i'm not satisfied with the brief description. But then, the authors do give references to other books, videotapes etc. that one may pursue. Many photos of cob being made, walls being built, and finished houses. I was already motivated to build a cob house before buying this book (from reading Dan Chiras' The Natural House) but now i'm even more fired up! This book is a HUGE help, inspiring, with useful detail, but is not in itself complete in detail for someone who want to build with cob.

This book is absolutely terrific, it is wonderfully and beautifully illustrated, includes color photos of some great cob houses, and is absolutely THE book you need if you want to learn about cob, or build your own cob structure. It is a wonderful balance of fun, personal stories, expertise, and technical info. (And really very inclusive too!) I read both Becky's and then this book. It really made me comfortable with cobbing because it is so well done, so inclusive and informative.

This is definitely a comprehensive cob-building guidebook, and soo much more. It strengthens our seemingly spontaneous cob building decision, and gives the reader a sense of lasting reverie for more evolved ways of living a truly happy existence.

This book brings warmth, inspiration, and practical guidance on how to truly live a mortgage-free fulfilling and creative, artistic and expressive existence on today's modern sheeple infested planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Surely this book will be a milestone in Cob building.I really enjoyed all the successes and, more importantly, the failures the authors experienced. The authors not only go into the detail of why something works but also emphasize the \\"spirit\\" of why one should build a cob house, what you need to have inside of you before even starting.I measure how good a book is by how much I underline its important points.

Just another film maker who finds war to be an exciting little game played by children. I guess the next move for these filmakers will be to dramatize what it must have been like in the two towers. Maybe they can strap a camera on the back of someone and jump off a building just to get a 'cool' shot. If I were to meet the people responsible for this Jerry Springer inspired trash I would love to accompany them as we visit some of the family members. This call this film a disgrace is giving it too much credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blair Witch Almost Meets Osama Bin Laden","review":"My advice: don't waste your time or money on this one.If you were expecting a serious treatment of September 11, Afghanistan, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and/or Osama Bin Laden, then you will be utterly disappointed with the September Tapes.On the other hand, if you enjoy excessively dramatized documentaries that ooze with hokey dialog, transparent story lines and bogus sentimentality..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and pointless","review":"This are two good things about this movie. First of all, the footage inside Afghanistan. That was great. Second, the DVD feature where they show just how dangerous it was for them to shoot this movie. Everything else was pointless. Why fake being in danger when you really ARE in danger? They could have been killed so many times. Why not make a REAL documentary? And as for their fake documentary, it is so unbelievably stupid. Nobody in their right mind would think this is real. The guy who plays \\"Lars\\" is a bad actor and the script is just terrible. It starts out being something believable but then it turns into an action movie where Lars becomes Rambo. It's insulting to watch. Do not buy this movie! Rent it! And then just watch the DVD features. Skip the bad movie.It's a real shame these people put their lives on the line and came out with something so stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN BLAHHH blahhhhh....................................","review":"Osama, are you in there?

Like other reviewers, I too rooted for these guys to get killed! No one can seriously be as dumb as the three guys in this film!

The main characters in it are actors using 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan for their own profit.

Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst movie I've ever seen.","review":"If I could give this ZERO stars I would. It's rah-rah America so over the top that I would have been happy to climb into the movie and machine gun all the idiotic Americans myself. It's offensive beyond belief (the main character's wife was supposedly killed in the Twin Towers on 9/11 - pretty offensive to all of those people who had family who DID lose their lives on 9/11). The acting is atrocious, the characters are morons, and the movie has no point at all.Once I'd watched it, I actually snapped the DVD in half and threw it in the garbage. Dreadful. Don't waste your money. There are many other war movies that are 100 times better than this. Watch THREE KINGS and see a movie that truly shows the horrors of war and terrorism in the Middle East."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Say Cheese in Arabic?","review":"I found it amusing how this \\"documentary\\" filming seem to catch every tense moment and fighting episode so perfectly - being just in the right place just at the right time....which makes this movie's unwilling confession scream out \\"VELVEETA!!\\" - about as fakey-cheesey as it comes. The first 30 minutes of the film I thought was well done, but then the story line & filming deteriorated into a bad con-man's ploy that left me humuourously thinking \\"are you serious?\\". It made me think Rambo got lost in the Blair Witch Project."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad acting and script","review":"Although the movie is a fake documentary, the beginning 10 minutes resemble real life. Thereafter, bad acting and poorly written script are noticeable. All the fighting scenes were creating in India and not afghanistan. During the RPG firing and get away shooting, I saw posters of \\"Oxford coaching institute\\" painted on the walls in hindi (The director needs to pay attention to details).I wish the movie could have shown the real scenes from Dan larson's tapes with background narration. Waste of 1.5 hour of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff","review":"This entire Homespun series is totally bogus, in my opinion. I have tried two, and both were poorly produced. They give the impression that they just set up a camera, then let the artist ramble on with little forethought or scripting.In this case, I have to assume that Peacock is a good musician, but he is a marginal teacher and speaker at best.. little eye contact, lots of mumbling, and even several of his playing examples are not what I would expect from a supposedly top-notch player.My advice... avoid Homespun videos like the plague, and invest your money in a good instructional book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing his touch?","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of this series and I preordered the book prior to publishing because I couldn't wait to see how the next chapter in the saga played out.Unfortunately, I was dissapointed and let down by this latest installment. Although his historical references are still engaging and instructional, he failed to keep my interest in the ongoing characters in Gordianus' family. And where is the promised explanation of how Bethesda was miraculously returned to the family after supposedly drowning in the last book! Was Bethesda even present in this book? Yes, she sat with the family in the grandstands during the triumphs! Is that as extensive as her role is going to be from here on out?The story was loose and not nearly as page turning as the others in the series.

We like these so much because we are fed up with the sleezy over-sexed gaudiness of most current dolls and these are NOT. However, the dolls and furniture were bought for another company's doll house and although all the doll house manufacturers/vendors, etc. say they are all designed to the same scale, I am not so sure that is the case. . .they fit just fine with the other Plan furniture we ordered but all seemed a bit larger than we expected.

The dolls bend easily to fit in different furniture. My only complaint is that the clothes aren't very toddler friendly, the black belt has started to come off one of the dolls and you can't put it back on (unless I glue it myself). I like the yarn hair and wooden heads on these dolls. The feet are flat so they do stand up well on their own. Overall I'd recommend these dolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"dollhouse fam for girls OR BOYS!","review":"LOVE everything made by plan. these are SO much nicer than the cheap-o family that came with my dollhouse.

We had heard great things about the VAIO line. However, this computer is unbearably slow. Simple tasks, ie working in Outlook, take far too long to process. Boot time averages 5 minutes. I'm not sure if the problem lies with the processor or is related to RAM (comes with 1 GB), but Vista does not function well with these specs. The computer sounds like it's constantly in overdrive. I imagine this computer would perform much better with XP. It is a beautiful ultracompact but the poor performance is unacceptable for a $2000+ computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"Brilliant book, funny at times, very well written, the characters - to die for.

EL repertorio elegido, excelente, es interpretado con gran convicción y sin exceso alguno de alarde por el grupo. Quizás se pueda achacar a Hackett un poco más de variedad en los temas que elige para los conciertos, prácticamente más de la mitad son los interpreta sistemáticamente desde principios de los 80. No hay ninguna necesidad de seguir tocando Horizons cuando tiene decenas de temas impresionantes para guitarra clásica. La excelencia de los últimos discos de Mr. Hackett le permiten hacer de \\"King Crimson\\" y centrarse en ellos sin necesidad de echar mano del pasado, ni suyo, ni de Genesis, aunque siempre sea de agradecer escuchar tan grandes temas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve, please get a better camera if you expect to get $18 for this","review":"I'm an old fan of Steve and have seen him live several times and decided to try the video.

A very thorough section on benefits of breastfeeding as well as practical information on how often and how much the baby should be nursing in the first 6 weeks, two to four months etc. There is also information on pumps, going back to work and more.

Why and how you should breastfeed","review":"I read this while nursing my two year old and still found it to be inspirational. Discusses why breastfeeding is best- 'way beyond the formula company's required pablum- and the very real risks of denying a child breastmilk and giving formula. Discusses the history of feeding infants, the history of weight charts for assessing growth, and the pitfalls that hospitals often inflict on mothers who intend to breastfeed. Gives great insight into such created feeding problems as \\"insufficient milk syndrome\\" and points out that most of those cases are due to inadequate letdown. And points out how to get beyond such nightmares.

Prehaps it was because when I took the body type test I came out 50-50 between two types. Chopra gives an excellent overview to Ayurvedic medicine and does have some help for people who are not clearly one body type or another, but the bulk of the book is spent on helping people who are clearly a Vata, Pitta, or Kapha. In fact some of the information for 50-50 types was contradictory which only heightend my confusion.I recomend to borrow a friend's or library's copy and take the body type test first. If you are clearly one body type over another and interested in Eastern medicine I would highly recomend this book. But it didn't help me personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Title","review":"This was a good read if you want to learn about the Ayurvedic health principles.

The book covers a lot of ground, from the basics of ayurveda, to practical elements such as diet and basic yoga exercises, abhyanga daily massage, and the ever-important daily routine. The book has been invaluable in helping me understand my specific imbalance, and how to practically address this. I have made phenomenal improvements with my digestive problems and numerous other ailments. Ayurveda is not about a quick fix, like fixing a broken machine. It addresses the whole body as, well, an ecosystem, taking account of environment, physical body, mental body, and spiritual body. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a persistent chronic disease. You will discover that the body is always trying to maintain balance & equilibrium with its environment, like all things in nature. It is the lifestyle, habits, and daily choices that brings us out of balance over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Health: A Review","review":"This Item was rated as practically new, but it had come apart from the binding and there were many underlinings.

However, it is actually from a series called \\"Battlefront\\" and is based on what seems to be (not very well) colorized footage instead. There is little, if any film that looks original to me. Given that there is a surprising amount of the genuine footage available, I've lost interest in this sort of thing. Also, the narration, while not bad, isn't especially interesting either. I'd recommend: \\"World War II, the Lost color Archive\\", \\"World War II, the British Story\\", \\"World WAr II in Color\\", \\"Perilous Fight\\", or \\"D-Day in Color\\" over this. They have the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell, but ok...","review":"Well, I can't say it isn't original, but it really doesn't have that touch you expect in a WWII DVD.

I wish I hadn't. This was a journalist who sailed around the world on a cargo ship. Actually, it was a converted Russian ice-breaker. The journey is evidently one of introspection, and he shouldn't have bothered with the small amount of material he had to examine. He whines and complains and snivels until you wish he had fallen overboard. Too damn little about the ship and too damn much about himself. That Jaynes chose to read War and Peace on his journey was ironic. When I slugged through Tolstoy, my only goal for the last third of the tome was just to finish it and get it over with. I can say the same thing about the last third of Come Hell on High Water. There were some great moments, mostly when Jaynes discusses his career as a journalist. Some of those anecdotes were great. Jaynes should write that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame.","review":"Pretty lame, as books go. I read the whole thing and at the end felt like I'd been had. Is airing your every selfish thought now qualified as literature? If you think not, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manuscript Should Have Been Swept off the Poopdeck!","review":"Sullen is not the word I would attach to this diary. Petty or Bitchy would be closer to the point. Mr. Jaynes writes as if he thinks himself witty and clever. Though some may appreciate his brash sense of humor, I did not. He tells of his Camp Granada-like voyage at sea with ten elderly English-speaking passengers, a Russian crew and British officers as if he were the only decent person on board. His superior attitude immediately crushes any observation that might otherwise have been amusing. He calls the ship the \\"Anti Betty Ford\\" but seems to feel justified in believing himself sober, though time and again he falls off the wagon and engages in disgusting antics while his wife waits for him patiently in New York. Once again I was duped by a book advertising itself as funny, when it is nothing more than the ravings of a smart-ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughts and feelings better left unpublished","review":"I don't have much to add to the other 1 and 2 star reviews. Really no humor (black or otherwise) in this book. If the author read his memoir before sending it to the publisher he at least has courage to reveal to the world what a sad and lonely life he leads. If you are looking for bile leavened with humanity then read Mencken or P.J. O'Rourke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented writer produces mean-spirited travel book.","review":"I always loved Jaynes when he wrote for the NY Times and my files are filled with clippings of his articles which I share with my feature-writing students. I enthusiastically bought his book and kicked myself for doing so after the first ten pages. The main focus of the book is how Jaynes can make fun of the passengers with whom he travels. He clearly hates women, old people, and fat people--to name just a few. Jaynes went out to find himself. I wonder if he likes what he found. I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitle should read \\"A Really Sucky Memoir\\"","review":"Horrible, boring, and completely uninteresting book about a subject with so much potential: sea travel.

I laughed laoudly and often from the time he regret mailing his check to his abandoning ship. The irony is amazing (beginning with the ship that was designed as an ice breaker destined to carry cargo and passengers through the Caribbean), his alliances of the strangest sort, and the language scathing. A quick read and one of the best this year.

I liked it a \\"nine's\\" worth and early on thought Jaynes' sarcastic portrayals of his fellow passengers bordered on cruel. Then I decided I'd be dealt with harshly also - but would love both the treatment and the longevity I'd gain via this very funny book. Jaynes exposes no one more than himself and readers can mentally fast forward to the day when Jaynes himself repeats his own tales ten times in ten days - a hundred times in a hundred days. The sea journey serves as conveyance for the author's own inward journey - both end abruptly in Singapore. Fast and fun. Most readers will enjoy the phrasing, the portraits, the writer's own great circle voyage to nowhere. Loved it, maybe it is a \\"ten\\" after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yer Dough","review":"I thought this book was one of the worst I have ever purchased.

It details life in the Aztec empire, has some important historical and cultural details of Mexico at the time of the Spanish conquest, and then, quite importantly, details the way in which various enemies of the Church and of the Mexican people have tried to destroy faith in her intercession but were always unsuccessful.This book increases and importance as time goes on with the Latinization of the US and rapid Hispanic population growth and influence here in the Southwest. The fact is that Mexico has a wonderful and beautiful history completely apart from the US - and this history centers on a person: the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Guadalupe.

He raises legitimate concerns about the spread of socialist thinking in America, describing it as a \\"mind virus.\\" Given the pathogenicity of the leftist agenda, the term is apt.However, Mr. Snow falls victim to pop psychology, specifically the heresy that positive thinking alone effects change in our lives, as opposed to reflection, hard work, and persistence. His introductory discussion of the unseen \\"vibrations\\" all around us is as confusing as it is disturbing. Come to think of it, THAT may be a mind virus.Finally, nearly half the book is devoted to a reprinting of the United Nations Charter and the Humanist Manifestos I and II, which are easily obtained online; no need to pay $16.95 for them. If Mr. Snow stuck to politics and writing original material, his readers would benefit greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"works for a week - sorta","review":"The first few days after I plugged this in, you could smell the difference in the air (I smoke and have a dog; it smelled cleaner in a metallic way)After having the air purifier for two weeks or so, the smell was gone, once again replaced by smoke and dog - it's good for a quick fix (in-laws coming over, holiday dinner, etc) but don't expect much for long-term."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Is NOT The Plus One from THE PROMISE!!!","review":"I was very much surprised when I got the Obvious CD and it turned out so much different.

The \`Going Crazy,' I Don't Care,' and \`Kick Me' songs are really good, if you like that kind of music. I do, and no matter how heavy the songs are, the message is great. I feel that way sometimes too. The songs \`Who Am I,' \`Forever,' \`Calling Down an Angel' and \`You' are more of what one would call the younger Plus One band. Light and beautiful. I totally fell in love with all of the songs!!I hope you all get to hear it, and I hope it touches you like it did me....."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLUS ONE REVIEW","review":"This cd is good, and the lyrics have an upbeat sound which will catch christian's ears.

I'll leave you to decied if that's a good or a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their not-so-great first album","review":"What can I say? The band went from mediocre to awful.

I definitely would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough One","review":"I hate to give this CD one star because I love Plus One, but I just had to be honest. I loved their first CD so much and I was so excited about the second album. Unfortunately, I didn't like their new sound at all. I like rock music, but some people just can't do rock at all. Sorry. I've only listened to this CD once and never got through it without pushing STOP on my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Truly an excellent CD, Plus One is a group that is not only delivers fun and hip music, but also delivers good messages to their listeners as well. The album's 12 tracks are all well written and performed. Some of the highlights of the CD include \\"Camouflage\\", a high energy song about standing out and being different for Christ, \\"Forever\\", a beautiful ballad to God, \\"Calling Down An Angel\\", another beautiful ballad about caring for others and wanting to bring them to Christ, and \\"Kick Me\\", a song about how we should forgive others and treat them the way Christ does. My favorite song is probably \\"Going Crazy\\", which is a truthful song about how life would be chaos without Christ's love and guidance. This CD is wonderful and I would defiantly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Plus One!","review":"Hey guys! I think you all should buy this CD! Of course, don't buy it if you don't like alternative/techno music. If you have heard Plus One's first CD, the Promise, you will be amazed at the change in Obvious. There are still some slower songs, though. Personally, I thought the Promise was a little bit too slow, and I like Obvious a whole lot better. It's got a good mix of different songs so most people should like at least a couple of songs on the CD. I really recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you!","review":"My favorite songs on Obvious - so far- are \\"Kick Me\\" and \\"Let Me Be the One.\\"I love the energy on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severly Dissapointed","review":"I purchased this book thinking it would be like many of the other resource kits Microsoft makes.

It's level of information is geared more towards the beginner-intermediate audience. The most glaring deficiency is the TOTAL absence of ANY software tools! All you get on the CD is an HTML copy of the book! So if your looking for that utility that lets you migrate print services, or any scripts, you came to the wrong place!

It took a few weeks for the repairs but their customer service was courteous & helpful. The 3rd time it broke, the watch face was turning instead of the hands.

Actor Crispin Glover, best known as George McFly from Back To the Future, takes a book written in the late 1800's about catching vermin and randomly inserts several sketches and ink blots, as well as changing the text when he doesn't like the way things are going, before releasing this thin \\"book\\" under his own name.

The Panasonic colors are supersaturated. The reds are unusually muddy, the blues and greens very noisy, and the flesh tones annoyingly artificial. I also found the resolution (sharpness) to be poor compared to Sony. I would highly recommend seeing a demonstration of this set in action before purchasing. On the positive side, Amazon.com was amazingly cooperative and helpful in allowing me to return this set and exhange it for a 32\\" Sony Wega, which I learned the hard way is more than worth the substantially higher cost.

I hope Kathryn Hughes writes more biographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eliot: All Too Human","review":"I never thought a biography could be such a page-turner. Credos to Hughes for succeeding deliciously in bringing Eliot to life with all her faults and insecurity, in the fullest context of Victorian Britain! The fact that towards the end of the book, the reader starts to tire a bit of the description of repeated character flaws in the person of George Eliot only attests to the realness of the biography, bringing all of the multifacted personality behind the writing to light. Her deep-seated insecurity and her desperate struggle to cope with it should be comforting to know for all who suffer qualms about themselves from time to time. And plus, the touch of humor in Hughes's writing every once in a while was a joy. I never went near Eliot's books since childhood, I did not know much about either her or her works, and it was sheer fluke that I came across this book, but now I am glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great paint glaze","review":"My van needed a new paint job, and this is a rare product that can be used on uncured automotive paint.

Linda Dachtyl \\"Blue Bop\\" is sorely missing the point, it want to hit the soul blues feel but backs off and eventually just falls off the blues cliff, under the direction of the monsterous Tony Monico I'd expected a lot better. My suggestion to future buyers, if you enjoy the topical feel in the style Linda plays the B3, then this disc is for you, BUT, if you love the soul jazz blues that is drenched inj the warm soulful and the not afraid to go there blues licks that make you say 'YEAH', then stay away from this production, cause you\\"re not gonna get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good code, mediocre explanations, rampant typos","review":"I agree with the other reviewers concerning good code and rampant typos. However, the author seems to think the audience is captive, and is willing to put up with his idiosynchracies. [I for one am not.] As an example, much discussion is devoted to the comparison of the GCD algorithm variants, so much so that one of the variants, Left Shift Binary, is \\"name-dropped\\" in the middle of the text, leaving the reader wondering why it deserves mention. The Least Remainder variant is missing critical information on the modulo arithmetic operation - namely, that '%' gives the same result on argument pairs with differing signs, even though the quotient is not the same as with same sign pairs. '%' just works, and that's all we are expected to care about.Overall, the book appears more like a user manual: the code works, and is packaged for the user.

He just doesn't strike me as the idealistic scientist type with his low key mumbling. The space uniforms were very wierd....watching Lacey Chabert (presumably 14 years old at the time) wearing a skintight outfit ... makes ya feel wierd, though I didn't mind it much on the older chicks.Gary Oldman plays his tired evil-guy sniveling role yet again, and while its nice to have cute kids and robots in movies, this is definitely not a kiddie film with all the violence and stuff blowing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with Search and Rescue","review":"They should have taken some of the money spent on special effects and bought a decent script.

After putting in several other DVD's to confirm this phenomenon I am convinced that the sound/video synch on this DVD is flawed.Putting the sound through a regluar TV set seemed to minimize the problem, although it was still apparent. If you have a good quality sound system you'll find this effect almost unbearable.Aside from the sound, the video is clean with a tremendous amount of special effects. The images seem to suffer the same problem as does the Star Trek - First Contact DVD, inasmuch as the video is SO detailed that it starts to look TOO artifical.

It takes good actors like Gary Oldman and Mimi Rogers, and makes them seem as inept as that heroically bad actor, William Hurt.The real problem is the writing.The dialogue is painfully bad. At one point Mimi Rogers says, \\"I don't like the sound of that sound.\\" And that's the way the whole thing is written: clumsily, clankingly, ridden with cliches, melodrama, and ineptness.Also (bad writing again) the characters are dizzyingly inconsistent. For no discernible reason, they flicker between being smart and dumb (Judy), dumb and dumber (West), cowardly and schizoid (Smith), nerdy and compassionate (Will).And then there's the plot. Or, I should say, plots. There are at least 3, maybe 10. All of them tired-but-untrue, none of them very much connected with each other.Even the vaunted special effects are silly.I'm sure a lot of money was spent on this. Please be wiser, and don't spend any of yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning, Warning, no plot, Dr. Smith!!!","review":"What happened to this movie?! The special effects were convincing and even advanced and believable. But when it came to the plot, all we got was a hackneyed view of some metal space spiders out of Battlestar Galactica and a thoroughly unbelievable time-travel sequence, which wasn't necessary in the first place. Talk about suspension of disbelief, this movie required the science of the impossible! No reactor, no matter how powerful (and this includes the Jupiter 5 main engine) can be manipulated into producing space/time vortexes! This would require something on the order of a black hole, not a puny spacecraft. How about a remake with a believable plot?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get lost...in space...for good","review":"This movie stinks like a 400 year old hot dog in a dump. The story is just as dumb as the WCW Bash At The Beach 2000 PPV. The writing is just as bad as the writing from TNA Impact. The Acting is just as bad as the acting from Ready to Rumble.

Sure it's cheesy as all get out, but heck so was the original show. I loved it. They added some more drama, but they kept the idea that Lost In Space should be a cheesy entertainment for kids. They added tons of modern FX, but they didn't kill the heart or fun of the original idea. It's impossible for me to hate this movie. I was afraid they'd take out all of the fun and make it so called adult sci-fi (zzzzzzzz), but they kept it goofy. Too bad these folks weren't around for Battlestar Galactica the remake (zzzzzzz)."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT Was a good try, but failed...","review":"This was a good try to remake the television series, with great budget, but it sounds a little bit \\"heartless\\".

Good thing, because I wouldn't want to pay for it. Excellent special effects, a potentially viable premise, but it falls flat on its face.

This crucial element from the television series is entirely missing from this film. Unfortunately, no amount of special effects or high-tech wizardry, which this movie has plenty of, is enough to save it. Instead of interesting aliens, the movie bombards us with a horde of spiders that become tedious after two minutes.

It's \\"new\\" and yet it doesn't fail to capture the imaginative fun of the original. It's a little too serious in places, but much of it is just imaginative fun just like in the \\"old days\\". It's very kid oriented and wildly fantastic. It has plenty of adventure and fun for my kids (and the kid in me) to enjoy. The makers were obviously fans of the original.

This was a very fun movie since the Robinson family mapped to ours, age- and gender-wise. Penny's character was a delight, but Robot's voice boomed way too loud. The film probably has the most SFX shots ever, and some were quite innovative. However, that heinous little space monkey creature cost this movie a full star. It was interesting to hear the director agree and explain the reality behind it; a digital Band-Aid of sorts.

I really do feel sorry for New Line Cinema, I love the company, they put out some awesome movies(I think The Island of Dr. Moreau is under rated) But when they venture into big budget films they always flop. Here is the latest. The Story was straight out terrible. When are the writers going to learn that time travel sci-fi movies rarely work(Star Trek Iv being the exception). I can't totally complain, because the movie did have some of the best special effects. Although they don't translate to TV very well.

I instantly fell asleep watching it in the theaters. And who wouldn't during a boring film with nice, plush comfortable stadium seating seats? The original show is the best bet to watch, it's good fun for the family and is a classic TV program. The only reason why I gave it two stars was because it had good special effects. That still doesn't make it more interesting, though. Star Wars is the best sci-fi film to see. Let me sum all of this up: BORING CRAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy","review":"Back when I watched this movie when it was first released, I remember thinking it was quite fun. I had the chance to watch it again recently, and was looking forwards to doing so. Unfortunately, there was very little about the movie to enjoy. The acting was weak, the characters uninteresting and under-developed, the plot was simplistic and the conflict not particularly exciting. The quality of the environments varied from obviously fake, to pretty nice looking. All in all, it was a barely okay movie. I liked it more when I was a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.....yeah","review":"I was never a fan of the original \\"Lost in Space\\" TV show, so I didn't know what to expect when I saw the '98 film adaptation. Well, I'm not a fan of this film, either. This is not a fun sci-fi movie: the characters are dull and annoying (Penny and Will Robinson, especially), the acting is wooden (except for Gary Oldman), the dialogue is stiff, and the story is nothing special (and it does get way too complicated in the third act), and even set designs are not really interesting to look at. I'll give the movie credit for Oldman's performance and for its special effects, which are actually pretty decent. Besides that, this movie is really lame. It's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's still boring, silly, and downright unenjoyable.Grade: 3/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw the dvd in the trash","review":"Sure, the special effects are slick, but there's not a single fresh thing about them.

I like sci-fi, and hate to see it done so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Thankfully, it barely seems necessary to insist that this is a terrible movie, but I will happily add my two cents to the trashing of it. Because in addition to all of the bad things already cited about this film, I for one didn't even like the special effects. Honestly -- I thought they were terrible. This disappointed me because I was at least hoping for eye candy, but the effects struck me as terribly, painfully computer-generated and tacky. And that stupid little cute creature they bring in, which serves absolutely no purpose other than introducing \\"the mandatory\\" cute creature, and which seems so pitifully superimposed on the screen ... geh. A waste of talent, money, film, and most imporantly, my time. : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dreary Mess","review":"This dreary, no fun mess has nothing to offer except excellent special effects and great sets.

OK, the special effects are decades beyond it, but the writing stank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid's movie","review":"I was really looking forward to see this movie as I like to watch science-fiction movies and Gary Oldman performing. But it came out differently. This film is about a dysfunctional family, but unfortunately the whole film is dysfunctional. A lot of cliché's and (unwilling?) references to other movies and tv shows. Spider Smith looked like a combination of 'Darth Vader' and 'Death' in Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal'. The spider aliens looked like they crawled out of 'Alien'. Time travelling is explained better in comical series like BBC's 'Red Dwarf'. The robots looked like upgraded version of the robots in 'Dr Who', resulting in a slapstick kind of movie. Hypergates and virtual reality didn't bring anything new. Matt LeBlanc looked like Tom Cruise flew his jet fighter straight in this picture. Soundtrack by Apollo 440. Probably chosen because of their name, but at least they got the sound good. This mission really sucked. I hope they weren't serious about making that sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made!","review":"I don't know why people dare to patronize the works of Mr. Edward D.

It's staggering to see such a concentration of talent and special effects being brought to bear upon such a terrible screenplay. This film would be a candidate for cult status for its consistent use of sloppy dialogue and cliches if it wasn't so sad to think of how much money went into the making of it. How many quality, low budget films could have been made with the money that went into this turkey?

It's a film that has absolutely no direction. Instead exploring more the director and screenplay writer decide to see how many loud sounds they can make. I still don't see how this movie got a PG-13 rating. It has even less action and violence than Star Wars. The performances by everybody except, surprisingly, Matt Leblanc, were terrible. Heather Graham and Mimi Rogers, who are very good-looking, deserve better material, but they could have tried harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like terrific CG animation, don't miss this one!","review":"I have to say that this was one of the best DVDs I have seen yet.

I found one of the inmate's books from the library, and it just happened to be \\"Brandenburg\\".It was barely engrossing enough to continue to read it. It has too much explaining about the scenes; right before Volkman tortures someone for info, the author describes the cold night with wind whipping off of the black water. Who cares? Also, anytime he (the author) brings up Erica, he has to mention at her beauty. Not that that is bad, but reading this over halfway through the book gets kind of old. I haven't finished this book yet, but I am uite sure that I will be disappointed. I agree with the other reviewer that talked about who financed the trip, and how stereotypical the characters are, how he is a Jew and she is a daughter of an SS officer. Ugh...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling page-turner","review":"I was stuck on the tarmac at the airport in Providence, RI for 4 hours waiting for O'Hare to reopen: and was I ever glad I had this book to keep me company! Not great literature by any stretch, but a truly compelling page-turner.

Somebody drained the pool. The pace was turgid, the characters - for the most part - shallow and the plot contrived. Even Meade's skill with the language seems to have deserted him. Everyone's eyes either sparkled, were knowing or were intelligent. The weapons all \\"exploded\\" in the shooter's hand. This was a plot which limped forward on its cliches. On top of that, the editing was abysmal. Treat yourself to Snow Wolf if you haven't read it yet, but don't waste money on Brandenburg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Snow Wolf Instead","review":"I was dissapointed in this book. I read what I thought was Glenn Meade's first book \\"Snow Wolfe\\" and thought it was excellent. I couldn't wait for his new book to come out and when it did I could not understand why it was so boring. No thrill in this thriller! Then, while perusing my favorite used book swap, I encountered an old copy of \\"Brandeburg\\", published in England in 1994 by Coronet Books. It was a little different than the \\"new\\" Brandenburg, but mostly the same (written by Glen Meade in case your thinking something bad here). So, this was another publishing attempt to recycle an old book into a new one. Now I understand! Why they didn't just mass market it in paperback like everyone else, I will never know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and unexciting.","review":"Glenn Meade has done an incredible job of making an attempt to resurrect the Third Reich into a boring, run-of-the-mill thriller. Most of the novel tracks the protagonists, a half-Jewish British agent working for the EU's security apparatus and a Paraguayan police detective, as they work along a threadbare string of clues that link a brutal murder in Paraguay to a neo-Nazi coup d'etat in Germany. A few exciting moments punctuate this Boys From Brazil knockoff, but with characterization that makes Ian Fleming look like James Joyce, it wasn't enough to sustain my interest.In an afterword, Mr. Meade states that some details of his plot (not to give anything away) are grounded in fact. I'm not sure if he's trying to be cute or if he's serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brandenburg","review":"A fascinating story of incredible events.

His facial expressions tell the story just as well as the subtitles, if not better, and his harp melodies are gorgeous. The bonus interviews give good insight into the origins of this performance and the incredible amount of work that must have gone into creating such a deceptively simple show.I've watched this movie three times in the week since I've had it, and it still has my attention.

Then imagine the painful contrast of Julie's crystal voice and that awful background noise. If they could remix this, isolate the vocals, and then replace the synth with a simple piano, bass, and drum combo, it would be great. But as is, I just can't bear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"half a star.. if that..","review":"I've heard some of the greatest stars stumble with albums, but I havent heard a \\"stumble\\" this bad before. When we think of Julie, we of course think of glorious arrangements featuring The London Symphony Orchestra or something wonderful like that. Love, Julie falls flat. Highly dated orchestrations featuring the really BAD '80s synth and drum machine almost to the point it makes you sick. The only worth while track on the album is \\"What are you doing the rest of your Life\\" Julie is perfection on that track. I bought this album thinking it might be worth listening to... but I cringe at \\"dated\\" music.

She's simply NOT the singer to interpret modern songs, though she's game. I also wonder why someone, anyone, didn't bring it to her, or someone else's, attention that a few notes were...well...off.

It is not how Agatha Christie envisioned it in her novel and I did not care for the dark, brooding Poirot in this production. David Suchet is my favorite Poirot but I prefer the Albert Finney version of Murder on the Orient Express because at least the Poirot in that production is not angry and dark. I love a sense of comedic release added to murder mysteries because it lessens the tension at the right times but there was no comedy in this at all. I would rather see Poirot as the ingenious character that he is instead of this dark man he is portrayed as here.

Yet I think the overall performances and scripting is the best in series 12. The female characters are particularly striking in both aesthetic and acting gravity. Highlights include the rapport between Poirot and the mystery writer, and the tortured main female character. She was really spot on; I couldn't think of a better portrayal of mental illness. Finally, this episode moves faster than other episodes of Poirot, so you don't have that usual confusion of trying to figure out what is going on (a common feature of even the best Poirot stories)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie With Albert Finney is Tops!!!!","review":"If you have viewed the movie starring Albert Finney along with a long list of other top stars, you will be greatly disappointed in this version. It lacks all the professional performances and the outstanding production and direction, plus all the amazing costumes. The photography of the train is also more authentic and beautifully done.

In fact Agatha Christie never ever brought up even her attachment to the Church of England in her stories. Did her family even okay this?

The greatest thing about it is that it doesn't only talk about the \\"usual\\" FS stuff, like symbols or gadgets that'll enhance chi in certain guas, but it also works as a kind of a psychological guide: it takes you trough the different phases of a relationship and gives you ideas on how you can make your inner self more -so to say- productive - as well as your home.

However I still liked the old style rubbermaid pitchers better :-(I was somewhat hoping to get the exact pitcher shown in the picture. However Rubbermaid has discontinued this style and what you get is the new style Rubbermaid pitcher that is much inferior in many ways:1. The volume of the pitcher went down from 2.25 qt do 2qt which makes it almost overflow if you mix frozen OJ exactly to the instructions2. The design is now somewhat tapered instead of exactly cylindrical which makes it more difficult to handle3. The design of the lid is completely awkward - the old ones could be turned 360 degree with ease but the new ones have notches that make turning the lid for opening and closing a lot harder4. The lid does not provide the same tight seal as the old ones did.The seller should update the product picture to reflect more accurately what you will be getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Covered Pitcher","review":"This is the ideal way to make Crystal Light ice tea.

The spout is at the rim, so there is always a small open space between the spout and the lid. This means the contents cannot be sealed in. The open space also does not allow any kind of shaking to reblend liquids like instant tea or fruit juices. It also increases the risk of the contents pouring out if the pitcher is full and is tilted ever so slightly. The choice is to throw it out or spend months or years risking spills in the fridge or on the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are ok","review":"Just like some other reviews, I found that the lids on these are hard to turn, in fact you musttake them off and turn them to close the spout.

The one thing that prevents me from giving them five stars, however, is that the weight of the lenses is such that they have a tendency to slide ever so slightly down the bridge of your nose when you wear them causing you to have to push them up periodically. It's not a deal breaker for me because their shape prevents them from sliding down more than half a centimeter or so, but it is something to be aware of.

My daughter is now 7 and we have memorized them and enjoy reciting them to each other in Spanish. There is one rhyme that is a little harsh, however, one must remember that these rhymes have been passed down from one generation to another, just like the Mother Goose rhymes,and unfortunately, this one particular rhyme gets lost in translation and sounds horrible in English. The Spanish language is a beautiful language and very rarely do the words translate into English very well, so please don't take it to seriously.

I do not particularly like his artwork, neither is the text any help for me. I've had it for about half a year and tried many times to study it, but I keep finding it most frustrating.

The quality of Winter Greetings Everyday did not measure up to my expectations. The glazing was not consistent from one piece to another; consequently, some dishes had a high sheen while others had more of a matte finish. On one of the salad plates, the paint had been scraped before glazing leaving an obvious white spot and a glob of paint visible under the glaze. I wonder if the dishes I received were intended to be sold as seconds. The design and colors of this pattern are beautiful.

I have worn this almost everday for 9 years except for about a year when I wore a Casio Pathfinder that broke. This watch goes scuba diving, mountain biking, dirtbiking to name a few and it's BULLET PROOF. I'm probably going to get a Suunto soon just because I want another Altimeter watch. Even after 9 years, I still catch myself staring at this watch. I wish I could say the same of my wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa's Past Meets My Past","review":"When I purchased this CD, I did so because Melissa sings a song very dear to my heart - I Run for Life. As an 11 year cancer survivor, I've never forgotten those with whom I shared the \\"dark\\" times with. The important thing that Melissa says and I believe is that we, as survivors, have to continue to represent those who have died, those like us who have survived and to support anyone in the future whose body is \\"darkened\\" by this disease. I'm with you Melissa... I run for life.As I began listening to the entire CD, I heard songs from her past and some songs I had never heard before. All in all, I enjoy to this day listening to The Road Less Travelled, maybe that's because it is the road I usually take.Rosemarie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been so much better.","review":"I loved Melissa Etehridge and her music since I first heard her in 1988. Since then I have weathered the good (YES I AM) and bad (SKIN) cds and always wondered whne she would do a greatest hits when others who came after her (namely Sheryl Crow) were already doing it.Well, it's finally here, and it is disappointing. I don't like the fake desert motif she was placed in at all.The 2 new songs Melissa wrote are just \\"ok\\". I like I RUN FOR LIFE alot better than the other. I do like her covers of REFUGEE & PIECE OF MY HEART, but I found it quite odd that she's turned to covers to get radio play.Very disappointed that YOUR LITTLE SECRET, NOWHERE TO GO, BREATHE (which was listed as being on the cd up until the last minute), ENOUGH OF ME & I WANT TO BE IN LOVE were not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Apart from the fact that Your Little Secret isn't on here, this is an excellent cd.

Full of passion and courage, these songs represent an already phenomenal career. Etheridge identifies with the longing we all have for the one that we love.

Don't do it! That is unless you really like bland dance music with a slightly jazzy feel. Basically every song on Shri Durga is superior to anything on this rather uninspired effort. Outside the context of comparison to Shri Durga, it's not that bad, as far as mellow, jazzy dance music goes, but if you're looking for more Shri Durga, you'll be better off looking elsewhere. Krishna Lila would be an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunities","review":"I had high hopes of this remix cd considering the names that appeared in the credits. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. This album is a prime example of mediocrity at best. This album seemed to have direction, pointing to a height it wanted to achieve, but never quite made it. It remained a bit too anchored to its roots, while not being able to reach the realm of true electronica. The mixing seemed too generic, not bringing enough unique flavors to it. Too often, the songs reach a plateau, and you wait for it to peak, but nothing comes, and you end up feeling dissapointed and a bit cheated. This album is throughly confused, trying to be both ethnic yet on the cutting edge of asian-electronca. It failed to be either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter disappointment","review":"Although perhaps not as profound as the heavy-weighing ragas featured on the original release (and, in some form, on this one), there's an old saying I'm sure we've all heard that goes something like this:\\"If it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it.\\"Get the idea? Stay with the original of this one, and don't even think twice about picking up the \\"remixed\\" version.

It works just as well with jeans and a t-shirt as it does when he wears it with one of his suits. Also, he doesn't have to worry about wearing it when he has a shower/does the dishes/jumps into the pool either!His only gripe is that he wishes it had the date on it and initially it took him a while to be able to read it due to the fact it has no numbers.

I consider the Bean Farm,the Hundred Acre Wood and the Shire home,if only for the little while I get to visit them through the author's words.This particular book has Freddy camping out to rid a friend's home of ghosts. As usual in Mr. Brooks' works,things supernatural turn out to be something more down to earth.Let us hope all these books become available again (especially his finest,'Freddie Goes to the North Pole' and the 'Bean Farm News').These books should be republished so that a new generation can become friends with the world's best pig!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for beginners","review":"I would say I am at an intermediate level of fitness and have a couple other pilates videos. This instructor is non-annoying and explains the moves very clearly --- first doing \\"half\\" the move, then going into the full move e.g., legs and arms not fully extended to show motion, then fully extends arms and legs to do the harder, complete motion.That said, I felt like every time I felt myself starting to break a sweat, the set would be over. Never really felt like I got a serious workout. The moves are fine, it's just that more of them needed to be done or something.

One page for instructions (this is the area that needed more detail) And that is it.Look at the house shaped box collage called \\"Crossings\\". The material list is there but the written instructions don't match the list. I expect to learn in the instructions how the 3 3/4\\" x 48\\" birch plywood is cut and used.

But when I started playing it with my friend, we got through 4 levels having, fun, teasing each other, and solving minor problems. The tollerence is low because instead of like, blood pouring out of the bodies like some games, the enemies, (made of legos) fall apart! This game is better than Lego Starwars 2 because it tells the story better and they use light sabres more in the first. Plus, Obi Wan Kanobi dies in the second =(. The game is beautifly designed for any age to think about the different ideas of the problems, and finishing them in 5-10 minutes. (If you haven't played the game before). It tells the whole story of the star wars trillogy, without ANYONE or ANYTHING talking! This is the second best game of my life. (1st is Dragon Quest 8)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning combination","review":"We got this for the PS2. Great game for kids combining Star Wars and Legos. The game play is easy with unlimited lives but plenty to do collecting mini kits and gaining new characters. The graphics are nice. Lots of fun going back and replaying areas with new characters, even fighting Darth Maul by being Darth Maul.If I had any complaint voices in the cut scenes would have been a bonus, but they really weren't needed to understand what was happening. Older kids, pre-teens oe teens, might find it too easy but if they don't mind it being geared for younger players it is still quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!","review":"Read the reviews and had to get it for my boys (7 & 10). As said in other reviews this is a kids game and it is easy. But it is so creative in the lego format that I'm enjoying playing it with the kids. What makes it great for me is when one of the boys gets stuck I pick up a controller and jump in to help and when my work is done I drop out. They get my help and they still get to play. Another plus for the game is when a player dies they break into lots of lego pieces. No blood or guts.

We are on our third game, and each had the same problem - disc read error - when we tried to load the game. I called Sony and they told me the problem was with the disc. However, the questions related to the age of my console and the COLOR of the disc. In the end they told me there was nothing that could be done. We would just have to get a FOURTH game to see if that would work. This seems exceptionally odd to me. All of our other games work perfectly fine, but then again, those games are not blue. If the product is that defective, then it should not be on the market.

My two sons and I have each had a few rounds with it. We all so wanted to love it, because we love the Star Wars movies. When you're first getting into it, it's a blast, tons of action and all kinds of extras. Then, you hit a brick wall (sometimes literally!) and cannot seem to keep advancing, no matter what you try. This frustrated us all to no end. The manual that came with the game offers very limited and generic help, it gets you started then you're on your own. I should point out that we aren't big time gamers, it's just something we do on the few days it's too cold to go out and the many, many days when it's too hot to go out. With this being a Lego game you would think it would be super easy and fun, but it's not.

The sound sometimes seems murky or blurred, but this is probably desirable in some places.

As a result, the phone will not close completely and the part over the body tends to slide downwards when open. The hinge portion will probably loosen over time as the leather stretches. Although it has a cutaway at the hinge section for the camera lens, the view is still partly obscured when the phone is open unless you hold the case down with your finger (while trying to keep your finger out of view). The case can be unbuttoned into two halves, but since the lower half is somewhat loose there's a chance of it coming off. The w300i has flush keypad buttons, and the plastic keypad cover makes it difficult to operate the recessed center nav button and power button.

As others have noted, the alarm is of limited value due to the low volume when engaged. The stopwatch is a handy feature and it works well. The titanium finish is very durable. However, I am noticing some wear on the clasp which is due to some abrasion which typically occurs when the clasp is in contact with another surface. (e.g. typing on a keyboard). This area is not readily visible when wearing the watch and the finish color does not highlight the wear marks. Overall a very nice watch.

The decal responded well to Testors decal setting solution, but I was still able to adjust the position after application.

It was easy to print onto the decals. However, because the decals are clear and not on white backing, they become completely transparent when moved off the decal backing. The white backing acts as a \\"backlight\\" for the decals, so as a result, the decals looks more like stains or shadows. I assume if you place these on a white or light-colored surface, they look \\"better\\", but they are completely unsable from why I need them.Also, the setting spray you have to spray them with to get them not to blur did not work very evenly, so some did smudge, some didn't.

What is this tendency? It's the \\"oh, crap -- researching how this stuff was ACTUALLY done is difficult\\" realization, followed by pages of cookbook-style \\"ritual\\" almost wholly created in the mind of the author (as opposed to the ways our ancestors would have done the rituals) and presented to the reader as though the reader had just lately learned how to read.

Each piston was compressed in under a minute each.Great for use on disc brake pistons that need to be rotated and pressed when replacing the pads.I know that this tool is designed for the sigular purpose of rotating and pressing but it could be easily modified to do the compress only. Adding the ability to remove the pin on the threaded shaft would allow this tool to be easliy used for both types of brakes.In addition, more detailed instructions would be a good improvement.

Whether it should be considered fiction or fantasy depends partly on whether you believe in psychics but also on the twist, which has, to my knowledge, no precedent in human history and is inclined to make you vomit. It is not hard to figure out in advance if you read carefully. The story probably owes some credit to the late John Wayne Gacy.

I began to get bored by about page 100, but suffered through the rest of the book because one of Lisle's other books was a bit slow for a bit, but then got MUCH better.

It's got a hypnotic sexy beat that makes me want to find someone to groove with. Upon first listen, I was disappointed that the slower tunes alternated with kind of hyper, a-little-too-electronic songs like #2 Brazilectro and #4 Zabumba No Mar - which always makes it hard to maintain any particular mood and that might annoy some of my higher strung company.The dreamy songs remind me of Nightmares on Wax's Carboot Soul. Very provocative and sensual. And then there are a couple of more traditionally composed Brazilian tunes some with a more batucada beat.

Only slight drawback I have so far is that when opened the zipper pull is on the \\"hook\\" side and they tend to scrunch together, you'll grab the hook when going for the zipper and vice versa. These apparently must also be sold in retail environments since it took two hours to cut the zip tie, get the two industrial staples out, cut the external plastic tie and then cut the internal plastic tie.

Kids who liketo make fun of smelly or otherwise less sophisticated kids mightenjoy it. My daughter aged 4 and son aged 7 both disliked thebook.

It reminded me of cowboys in the late 1800s breaking wild mustangs. I have been involved with dogs for 25 years, am a student of dog psychology and have observed many different trainers and their techniques over the years. What I saw was a man putting dogs under incredible amounts of stress to the point where they had to give up fighting for their lives. His customers who were awed as his results must not be aware of such professionals as Victoria Stilwell or Martin Ruetter in the German-speaking countries. I prefer working WITH my dogs and having them enjoy working with me. Pinning a dog to the ground with a death grip and taking being bitten for granted only demonstrated to me how primitive his methods are. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibilities squandered by weak preaching","review":"A story I tried very hard to like. Great beginning and superb crafting of a believable last days environment. Unfortunately the writer has to make all people with religeous faith out as morons and unthinking zombies. Of course, the heroes of the tail are agnostic and never leave a chance to show their superior understanding. This hang up flattens the story to 1 dimension and continues to weaken it so that by the end, what should have been a great book, was preaching and as such was unsavory. Funny how one who obviously has a disdain for religion would be so willing to shallow her own work by acting like the characters she depicts as religious in her book rigid and without ability to see and understand others."},{"rating":"1","title":"The world ended and it's all the Christian's fault.","review":"That is this book in a nutshell.

ONKYO states that speakers have a 2 year warranty, only if the item was purchased from an authorized dealer. I live in Louisiana and the nearest authorized service center is in Michigan. After sending the product, they told me that the unit is NOT covered under warranty, since BZTRENDS is NOT an authorized dealer of ONKYO.

I love it and have used it for years. Aside from a bristle brush it is the only one I will use on my poms as it won't eat their coats (though it does remove dead hair).It is very narrow and the pins do not have the round balls on the end that have a tendency to tear out healthy coat. It makes for easier, gentler grooming (for both owner and dog), and your pom will keep more of his coat. While using this (or any brush--especially a pin brush), I recommend lightly misting the coat with a water bottle with a drop or two of doggie conditioner. It makes the grooming even more gentle and will help loosen smaller knots."},{"rating":"1","title":"wimpy and overpriced","review":"Tiny diameter pins are so flexible in their fabric mount that they glide over my bouvier's coat and accomplish absolutely nothing.

For me, it turned out to be a great purchase. I like the mix of old (GUYS AND DOLLS), new (INTO THE WOODS) and lesser know (ONE TOUCH OF VENUS) show tunes. Mr. Dow has portrayed many of the characters that sing these songs or has sung them in his cabaret performances and you can tell. He has a good tenor voice that's easy to listen to. I was pleased to see that he had included \\"Her Face\\" from CARNIVAL, a show that seems to have fallen unfairly into obscurity. \\"New Words\\" from IN THE BEGINNING was a poignant discovery. My favorite track is \\"Lucky to Be Me\\". I play it over and over again but every song has become familiar now and I love them all.

Not only does it have Jackie (in his prime), but it also contains three of his former classmates: Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung (now in CBS's Martial Law), and Yuen Wah (from Supercop). The Fight scenes directed by Sammo are probably the best of his career. The humor is actually funny for once, there is somewhat of a plot (it's \\"The Usual Suspects\\" compared to \\"Mr. Nice Guy\\" and other recent flicks), and the action and stunts are downright astonishing at times. If you want to see Jackie when he was young and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, rent this one.The only downside is that the amazing talent of Yuen Biao wasn't used as much as it should have.Buy It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie Chan's best movie,period.

Sammo Hung is amazing. Yuen Biao is amazing. Put the three of them in a movie, and it'd be hard to end up with something bad. Well, in this case, you end up with something great.To begin with, there's the martial arts. These guys are three of the best Asian cinema has to offer. Yuen Biao, though not widely know in America, is considered to be one of the most athletic martial artists around. Of course, Jackie and Sammo are no slouches either, and this movie delivers a lot of colorful action.But it's also funny. It reminds me of those old screwball comedies of the fifties. It's ridiculous, absurd comedy based on misunderstandings and well-intentioned deceptions. The scene where Jackie's date is interrupted by his two fighting friends is damn funny. And the interaction between these three friends is what makes this film a classic.For another great collaboration of this terrific trio, check out \\"Wheels on Meals\\", another fine film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy, but cool","review":"Yuen Bao, Sammo Hung, and Jackie Chan are like the 3 Stooges of Martial arts. Only difference is the Stooges could only poke and slap each other, these three martial artists kick bootie! They are hilarious together and I really wish they made more movies together. Fight sequences are top notch and very well coreographed. The story is actually pretty good, and contains genuinely funny and humorous stuff. The only drawback is that some parts seem a little long--maybe because of subtitle problems. The subtitling is kind of off with many typos and the like. Also conjunctions that don't make sense like \\"I've to go now.\\" etc. I thought it made things funnier, actually, but I would really like to see the movie with subtitles that made more sense sometimes. (IMO) In the end, though, I regard this as one of my favorite movies. When I show guests the flick, I fast forward through some parts. Great fight sequences between the Opera brothers.

But, the action in this movie is awesome. Besides this being the only movie where you get to see the Opera brothers fight, Chan rematches with Benny \\"The Jet\\" Urquidez(Whose sporting an odd and disturbing makeup job). And hey, Yuen Wah is back, this time playing a sleazy industrialist. Wah was also trained in the Opera alongside Chan, Hung, and Biao. He was the stunt double for Bruce Lee in \\"The Chinese Connection\\" He was the one that did the aerial somersaults. My only complaints were the video game music and the underuse of Wah's martial abilities. I could have done without the romance, but it was a necessary plot device. All in all, an excellent film.

However, I'll give this two due to the main character. The main character shows his butt twice and it's a prize winner! Talk about buns of steel.

It makes the whole premise less believable to me. Also, people come and go with too much convenience to the plot and not enough motivation.

Some other very notable songs on this CD to check out are, \\"Voices\\", \\"Bitch\\", and \\"Higher Level\\" just to name a few. This album is great from front-to-back and back-to-front.

The recipes, ones which I have prepared, are good, tasty, but not easy. Some of the directions are ambiguous and make the recipe more difficult. Again, this is a typical-Martha book - very ambitious and only for those who are of the \\"Martha cult\\" - are striving for perfection.

I am quite disappointed in this book, however. Perhaps it is because I am a pretty good cook with a background of working the front of restaurants. I found this too, too simple. Four of the vegetable recipes are: toss the vegetable in olive oil, salt and pepper and roast on a cookie sheet. The cheese section actually says to go to a good cheese store and buy the best and then arrange it attractively.I needed to be told that?I should have know better.

I've tried the Grilled Lemon Chicken, French Potato Salad and Banana Crunch Muffins, and all were excellent. However, everything is LOADED with fat (the muffins have 2 sticks of butter for 18 jumbo muffins, plus coconut, whole milk, nuts, etc.). I reduced the fat and sugar in the muffins and they still tasted great. I hope I'll get good results with slimming down other recipes -- otherwise this will be a splurge-time-only book for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it...!!!","review":"I own several GOOD cook books, but this is different in the way it's written...

Decided to gamble and buy one - glad I did! I used it the first night and haven't put it back on the bookshelf yet. Recipes are as easy as Ina makes them look on TV.

I especially love the pecan bar and brownie recipes in this book. Although each recipe calls for large amounts of butter, chocolate and pecans, they make large pan fulls that can feed a crowd.

I bought all three--this one, the basics one, and the recipes you will make over and over again one. Between the three of the them I noticed similar recipes in all--the chocolate cake, the roasted veggies, the chicken, among others.

However, a girlfriend saw Ina on the Martha Stewart Show, and asked to borrow the book. The next day she invited me for tea, and presented the salmon and turkey tea sandwiches, the coconut cupcakes and the maple oatmeal scones. Everything was...incredible. The scones melted in my mouth--the maple glaze was a unique and delicious touch--and they looked just like the photo in the book! My friend said the recipes worked perfectly. Although the scones have a pound of butter in them, I have decided that a splurge, now and then, is called for when the results taste like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to cook a bad meal","review":"I love this cookbook.

It was easy to read in an hour, and I often caught myself mentally planning to use several recipes and ideas. The side notes are very helpful in making the recipes successful and simple. Most recipes were ones that I would use for special family events and for entertaining. The best cookbook that I've read that includes detailed descriptions in parenthesis with the ingredients listed in the recipe. I enjoyed the forward by Martha Stewart and the intro from Ina Garten. The photos were vivid and personable. The sources are listed for specialty foods also. If you like to cook simple specialty dishes for family or friends, this is a cookbook to read and use. Ina Garten's book is not just your ordinary cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to prepare, hard to resist","review":"After making just three recipes from The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook -- the Outrageous Brownies, the Fresh Corn Salad, and the Parmesan Smashed Potatoes -- I know I can trust the recipes in this delightfully designed, gloriously photographed paean to good cooking. Co-workers and friends could not stop enthusing about the brownies, which many claimed were the best brownies they'd ever tasted, and dinner guests went back for three helpings of the potatoes. As some have pointed out, this is NOT low-fat cuisine -- but neither is a Big Mac and an order of fries, which would leave one infinitely less satisfied than the dishes here. So, when taste is your primary concern, trust this invaluable resource from Ina Garten -- I know I will for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cooking","review":"Using The Barefoot Contessa's Cookbook makes it very easy to make new dinners.

The comments included \\"These are the best I've ever had, even better than my mom's Triple Decadent Brownies.\\" I overheard my son say proudly \\"Yes, it has 2 and 1/2 pounds of chocolate in it!\\" This book is worth every penny just for the brownie recipe alone, but all the others we have tried are scrumptious also. The recipes, pictures and anecdotes all create a pleasing, immensely useable treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"This is one of my favorite books by the Contessa.

For example, the chocolate cake has no baking temperature and the icing recipe makes twice too much. Ms Garten, next time you write a book please make sure the recipes are fullproof! Many of the recipes are credited to outside sources, which weakens the credibility of the author. I also think this book could have used a bit more work before going to print. Otherwise the book is OK. It certainly contains the kind of food we all love to eat. The muffin recipes are fantastic! Good for a beginner or a casual gourmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook review","review":"Love this book!

The recipes all look good in the photos, but I will not waste time and money trying any more. anyone interested in a second hand book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad recipes","review":"I made the dill & cheddar scones, ginger chicken, and potato salad. None of them tasted good. The scones had way too much baking powder (2 T) and it was overwhelming. I cut the dill from 1 cup to 1/4 cup and even that was too much and made them bitter. The ginger chicken smelled wonderful while cooking, but there was way too much liquid and the cooking temperature was too low. At 350F degrees it just stewed the chicken and I wound up with greasy ginger chicken soup. The potato salad was bland and gloppy. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth purchasing...","review":"As a private chef who used to work in homes in East Hampton, I was not impressed with the selections described in this book. I was expecting more Entree salads such as those which I used to purchase at the Barefoot Contessa... instead, this book contained almost common sense recipes with no educational value... Great for a novice cook... not worth the time for a chef."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book mostly due to the other reviews I read. I am returning it because there were no recipes I thought I would use. All were kinda strange and didn't stir my taste buds at all.

Guess I just picked the wrong cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Boring!","review":"I bought this cookbook years ago and have only ever made the baked chicken from it, because all the other recipes look so boring.

But as I read through the book, I kept thinking \\"Been there, done that.\\" I remember making fanastic lemon and pecan squares back in the 80s. Back then, my waistline could handle it. But as I get in to my 60s, I would rather exercise and maintain my figure than reach for those 2 sticks of butter. It's all a choice really, and if I am going to indulge, I'd rather have champagne. That's enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Martha.","review":"Garten is probably the most egregious of all the \\"hobby job\\" cooks (one could NEVER call them chefs) flogged by the Food Network (followed closely by the laughably inept Sara Moulton and Rachael Ray). Here as in her other books, she recycles recipes done earlier and better by Martha Stewart (her obvious role model), Bert Greene, Lee Bailey, etc. Better to buy books by professionally trained, working chefs like Tyler Florence, Bobby Flay, Mario Batali, etc. or at the very least, by truly gifted home cooks like Nigella Lawson or Nigel Slater. You might actually learn something original from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I'm a big fan of ina garten and this recipe book is one of the best. the recipes are just so delicious and really simple to make.

In fact, it's just the opposite: it's about making them feel comfortable. I invite friends to lunch and make bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches. They are the best BLT's I can make.\\" A great approach we all can abide by with our guests.

There are some songs I skip, but that's the way it is with *most* music cds I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty listening but slightly morbid","review":"I love the music and her voice. However, almost every song is about death in some way. It's not offensive or depressing, and there are a wide variety of character perspectives which is interesting like reading historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightingale's Song","review":"Being generous, Alison Krauss participates in many projects besides hers and Union Station's, but not all of us can afford all of them just for the 1 or 2 songs heard. This collection compiles recordings from soundtracks, \\"Down to the River to Pray\\", for instance, from \\"Oh' Brother Where Art Thou\\", tributes and collaborations (there are three with soft rocker Tom Waites, including \\"Missing You\\"). Given Alison's voice and sensitivity, they are all beautiful. Initially, there is a feeling of too much of a good thing, mostly being mid-tempo, but that feeling eases away as the nuances of each song seep in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly disappointing","review":"I am a new fan of Allison's, and I must admit, I was disappointed by this album. I found the whole thing to be slow and depressing. There were a few good songs, but mostly all the songs have the same slow tune and melody. I would not recommend this. It is definitely NOT bluegrass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Cd if you like Depressing Music","review":"I love Alison Krauss but this cd is very depressing. I would not have bought it if I had heard it before hand. Her other albums are so much more up beat and fun. This one wants to make you go jump off a cliff."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS","review":"Yuk . . purchased this CD on assumption that it would beas enjoyable as all previous AK purchases. Not so. Boring, dreary, slow -- what else -- did I say Yuk?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad... so sad","review":"I LOVE Allison Kraus... but this CD stinks... its sooooo dark about death and sadness... really a bummer album. It has a couple tracks that are on the Cold Mountain CD.. buy that instead... skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Miles or More Collection from Alison Krauss","review":"My favorite singer, this is such a haunting melodic series of songs. Most are sad and introspective, make you feel about loss and family. As a longtime fan of her with AKUS I was surprised at the departure from the more traditional bluegrass, however, it is absolutely lovely to listen to. The duets are outstanding. Highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hundred Miles of Pleasure","review":"This is a must buy for Alison Krauss fans. It provides a wonderful journey through her recording history that will have you quietly singing along with all your favorites. I recommend it for any listening time you have for dialing down life's stresses, and it's great for those long road trips. Just stop reading this and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Just Gets Better","review":"Alison Krauss is one of the best and this one has topped it. Every album of hers is great, and this one is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"She does it again.","review":"What a beautiful voice...what a talented musician...I don't get sick of hearing this voice...I think it's the prettiest in her genre. This is chock-full of great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hundred Miles or More: A Collection","review":"Some of the best Alison Krass cuts that I have heard. Even if you don't like her Pop/folk background, this is a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one for Allison Krauss","review":"I have just about all of her C.D.s. This is another really great one. I really like most of the songs on this album. (There is only about 2 - 3 songs that I am not crazy about.)Allsion Krauss is a rare talent and only seems to get better with time. I have always loved her and I suppose I always will."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"There are a few songs on CD I liked. The Duet with Brad Paisley, Molly Braun the Irish song were good but for the most part the music was boring. Nobody in the world sings like Alison but I like her much more with Union Station singing bluegrass-country ballad style of music. This sounds like someone just threw a bunch of movie background songs together with a few good ones to have something to sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel's voice with range of material","review":"I have to agree with another of the Alison fans ... \\"If the angels on my arrival in Heaven do not have a voice as good as Alison Krauss, I will be dissapointed.\\" I have had this in my car CD, constantly playing for a week. \\"Whiskey Lullaby\\" which is an uncanny dark but exquisitely beautiful collaboration with Brad Paisley, is worth the price of the collection. I find myself surprised to be humming it during my day. Her title song, \\"100 miles or more\\" is genuinely Zen in its spirituality. I am considering having it played at my own (hopefully very distant) funeral. It was also a delight to revisit the sun-drenched scene of baptism from \\"Oh Brother\\" in \\"Down in the river to pray.\\" Just get it and put it your own car. Bet you play it over for a week yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Alison Krauss","review":"I have every recording AK has made and I love this one the most. Yes, it's sad. Yes, some of the tracks appear elsewhere. But there is not a single stinker on it. I love to listen to every song. Her voice is like an angel's, fallen to earth. If you don't like this recording, you don't REALLY like AK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laid Back and comfy.","review":"Alison's new offering is fine but it seems to me that she did not have enough material to complete a full CD so a \\"oldies but goodies\\" was thrownin for good measure. My favourite from the new selection is Lay down beside me with John Waite. But then if you're a fan you've got to have it whatever it is.My four star rating is because I feel the best is still out there waiting to be released.(In terms of song materials.) I enjoyed watching her on the James Taylor tribute show. Hard not to love her stuff.PG"},{"rating":"2","title":"She is an angel","review":"What can I say. I was turned onto Alison by my friend Samwise Gamgee and I have never been disappointed!. This new album is another gem. I've seen her in concert many times now and if you like the best add her to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I'm a huge fan, pretty good music on this one but agree that the mood is more somber and ballad oriented vs upbeat bluegrass. Way better than the Robert Plant one which I didn't like at all !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Notice it isn't called 'the best of' or 'greatest hits'.","review":"After listening to this cd a few times I gave up on her. I didn't like a single song on this collection. Fortunately, after getting rid of it, I found a copy of New Favorite Thing at a used cd store and since she sounded so good on Raising Sand I decided to give her another try. I'm glad I did. New Favorite Thing is a very enjoyable album. This collection - A Hundred Miles or More- is not a good introduction for new listeners. Seems more of a repository of odds and ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, What Happened?","review":"I fell in love her voice the first time I ever heard Alison Krauss sing. It was as if an angel had entered the room. She was the first artist whose every CD I purchased and I was never, ever sorry......until this one! Her voice didn't even sound like her voice. Instead of it being clear, it was raspy and the new songs were terrible. This CD was so bad I couldn't listen to the entire CD. Wish I could get my money back. I hate this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's been three long years of waiting for Alison to release a new album. This collection of songs, with very few exceptions, is mawkish, saccharine rubbish.Away Down The River, Sawing on the Strings and Missing You are about the only high points on an album of godawful Disney covers ('Baby Mine' from Dumbo), and schmaltzy, over countrified pop ('Simple Love'). Alison, at her godlike best, is heartbreakingly bleak and wonderfully thought out. This hastily thrown together mush is a huge let down for her legions of fans.Bring on her next release with Union Station, and if this is your first introduction to the Queen of Bluegrass, don't let this huge mis-step put you off, you'd be missing a lot. Check out So Long, So Wrong and her Live Album, or if it's solo work you're after the stately 'Forget About It' to get a true taste of this amazing talent, before she sold out. Let's hope its not permanent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dé perfecte aanvulling bij mijn Alison Krauss CD's","review":"Alison made it again and good!In dutch: deze CD met nummers die niet op haar andere cd's te horen zijn is een perfecte aanvulling.Gevoelige nummers zoals je gewend bent van haar en toch voldoende afwisseling. Een aanrader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect; but for a melancholy mood.","review":"This isn't for your upbeat, dancing mood; but it is beautiful and satisfying in its own right. Listen to it a few times before making a judgment. I love Alison's pure voice and the simple, heartfelt songs she chooses. The only song that I don't care for is the \\"Sawing on the Strings\\", as it doesn't fit the rest of the mood of this more melancholy, yet lovely collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"a hundred miles","review":"This is an outstanding CD that pulls together some great mellow, melodic songs (as opposed to her bluegrass side).

The shipping company came and put it in the back of my suburban at work too, good show. This bar is made very well and is strong. My problem came when we tried to put it on. My vehicle is a 1993 Suburban and on these older trucks they had factory bumper blocks on the front. This bar WILL NOT FIT over these blocks or between them so they had to be removed before installing. My only compaint is that Westin could have made this bar a little wider...about 3/4 of an inch and it would have worked perfectly. The company responded quickly to my e-mails and confirmed that the blocks indeed would have to be removed and that this was the correct model for this truck. If this had not have happened, I would have definately given 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEJAVUE","review":"I DONT REALLY LIKE THE CD.... THE MUSIC SOUNDS AMATURE.

My computer used to crash all the time after long periods of being on... However, I accidentally left my computer on for the whole weekend without any crash from overheating. I concurrently installed this with a Zalman as I was looking for an overall cooling upgrade to cool my computer.The only reason that I am rating it as 4**** rather than 5***** is because it is not a perfect fit into my double hard drive case. It sticks out a bit. Well-made product and a great addition to cooling your computer. .Noise Level: Quiet!! I did not notice any relevant dB level increase.I strongly suggest upgrading the HD cooler as well as the Zalman CPU cooler in an effort to cool your computer and increase efficiency.

The first few steps are the foundation of any painting and in this area the book is inadequate. Their is some instruction in this area, but not enough.The author also fails to show alternative ways to achieve the results desired. I like art instruction books that show more than one way to get to certain results but few do this. It is important, especially in books that are introductory in nature, to show more than one way to get to a result. Most art books fail to do this and this book is not an exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"no miss fungus killer antifungel","review":"i didn't use this. did not work for husband and he finally went to the doctor for meds. that''s all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"I used this for several weeks and it did notwork very well.

For example, there is more than two times more text on preventive dental care than on dog sledding.The same publisher has published essentially the same book with a different title ('Alaskan Malamutes') and a different author name.I'm sure that anyone with a serious interest in Siberian Huskies would find this book next to useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great snack","review":"These cookies are not only great for \\"grab and go\\" but are also great for the portion control that they offer.

I have great confidence in where we are going with the steps Becky Bailly gives because it is not just a book about how to control your little beasts it's about pulling yourself together as a person, then helping your kids pull it together. Not just outward behavior but solid inside change. If you've read lots of parenting books and still find it hard to make real change I recommend this book for filling in the gaps, this is the missing links.

Two of the three do not 'snap' shut therefore leaving the cover to flop open when walking and obviously prone to get hooked on many things making the likelihood it will fall off much greater. Occasionally an old one would have this occur after a year of use, but never with a brand new one. Is this a re-design flaw or just something that happened with the particular lot that I received? Until I hear from the supplier I will have to live with the two that I currently have that will stay shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sportline Pedometer","review":"The pedometer is great for those interested in a healthy life style.

Sometimes you have to hold the button for 2 seconds, sometimes for 5 seconds. The mode button itself has multiple modes. The manual refers to the buttons by letter A B C not by their names, and guess what? The letters are not even in order! Then it has sharp edges which tend to dig into your skin when sitting down. And if you are over 280 lbs, the calorie counter feature will not apply to you as it has an upper setting limit of 280 lbs. As for how accurate it is, I cant say, as I cant figure out how to set the stride length, or how to have the display remain on the step count mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell off, broke","review":"The actual device was fine, but the clip is crap and it fell off and broke. It had fallen off before and survived, but there is no good way to attach a line to it to tie it to a belt-loop. After this one broke I bought another, a different model of the same brand, with a clip that is larger and seemed more secure. That one just fell off and is now lost somewhere along my hiking route. I give up. They are not cheap enough to keep buying. I wish I could find one of the very old ones that had a metal alligator clip and actually stayed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ran 3 miles per hour!","review":"I was excited to purchase this small pedometer that had every feature I needed. The only problem is that none of them work. After running my usual three mile route, the pedometer told me that I had run only .3 miles. It also said I had burned under 100 calaries and was running 3.2 mph. I would have not been as upset if at least one function worked, but nothing did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate - don't buy this one","review":"It really is not accurate. When I attached it to sweats, it counted way too many steps. When I attached it to jeans, it was better, but still incredibly finicky. Get the Omron one with all the rave reviews. The only reason I didn't in the first place is that it was out of stock. As soon as it came back into stock, I bought the Omron model and the difference is NIGHT and DAY.

Even being over 30 years old, it is still as good today as it was then. It is also extremely accurate in the logistics and history of the time period the show is set in.Given the age of the show and technical issues of the time, the DVD quality is good. There was a strike in Britain at the time causing several episodes to be shot in black and white. Those episodes did not air in the US during the show's original run as PBS only wanted to air color episodes. As a result, a second, slightly different version of the pilot episode (originally in black and white) was reshot in color specifically for PBS.

This was a little too much for our children.There were a number of reviews that gave low ratings because of the quality of the video and sound. We did not find any problems with this.

Because of those reviews I almost did not buy this set. That would have been a grave error. I suppose, if you are some type of audio/video expert you might find a few reasons to complain, but this is a 35 year old British TV show. If you expect special effects, buy Star Wars, not Upstairs Downstairs. The quality of the audio and video was quite acceptable and certainly better than when it originally aired. (It should also be remembered that the first season was filmed during a technicians strike.)As for the show itself, Upstairs Downstairs is one of the greatest TV shows ever filmed. It is an extremely entertaining examination of the British class system from 1900 to 1930 (particularly what happened to it as a result of WWI). After you have watched a couple of shows, you will have difficulty turning them off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent series - Outrageously bad DVD transfer","review":"The series is a gem. Believe every positive review about it. It is television at its best. The only outrage is the poor quality of the transfer on the A&E set released in the US and Canada. The picture, colours, sound are awful. I bought the set and returned it. I saw the United Kingdom release, Region 2 encoded, and it is much better. You can get an idea of the difference in picture and colour quality on the Upstairs Downstairs web site, video availability page at http://www.updown.org.uk/vidtab.htm.

I own over 400 DVDs, have rented many more than that, and have never seen a worse transfer to DVD. If you must own this show on DVD buy a region-free DVD player and get one of the European sets.

If there is anything that may take some getting used to it's the variety of London accents of the characters, just as was the case in 1971.This is a series shot in a studio for television in the early '70s, not some \\"blockbuster\\" film shot a year ago with 21st century technology. But this set looks and sounds the same as it would if Masterpiece Theater reran it on television today. It's perfectly clear all around.

He is amazing in this film. I need more of that sarcastic, I don't care if you like me or not attitude. And the film itself is amazing. It is the first to manage to portray affluent blacks in a vast array. The characters reflect dignity. Sure there's some snobbishness, but it's discouraged throughout. The reluctant romance between Haviland and Lee are kept central, but humor dominates the film. Cherot is downright outrages. Chenoa Maxwell is a perfect cold-blooded stiff and Robinne Lee somehow manages to downplay her stunning beauty enough to pull of the little sister role. It's the characters and the dialogue, not a big budget that make this a must own. No clowny, cartoony buffoonery going on. It's just how we are.

This guy looks terrible so why would these women who already think of themselves so highly want to seduce him and he also refuses them.

The lead character is broke, smug and downright silly while the women are nasty and materialistic. There is no one to like in this film, the acting is mediocre at best, and the plot crawls along. As badly as Hav treated Lee, I desperately wanted to see him grow a backbone and walk away from her. That scene where she cussed him out after he confronts her for causing problems in her sister's new marriage made my blood boil. I don't know any man that would hang around after being spoken to that way.I don't see how anyone can seriously compare this film to Love Jones which was vastly superior. Love Jones had ambience, rich, multi-faceted characters and the cinematography was excellent. The same can not be said of Hav Plenty. I'm just glad that this was a free rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"HavPlenty was a Must Have for Me","review":"Cherot's first film examines relationships most particular the lead character's . This is film is \\"loosely\\" based as a recount of the writer who is the acting lead in the film. His journey makes him very relatable as he attempts an introspection in examing his true feelings for his friend who is the object of his affection. Tracy Edmonds & Kenny \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds partnered to produce this film. If you like Soul Food then perhaps you'll like this film. Though not a blockbuster commercial success this film has a genuine story with some sentimentality. The lesson is we as men should be strong enough to show and talk about our feelings. Being stoic and restrained can do some damage by missing an opportunity for love. I am glad I was able to purchase it here on DVD for it can be a hard find in general retail."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST...","review":"How can anyone resist this movie.

When I learned to swim 15 years ago the techniques and drills she teaches were already outdated, especially in the freestyle!

The film-makers captured animal aggression and little else. They don't even cover most of the wildlife a person encounters there. They also do not show the beautiful variation in the land there or any footage of people at all. The image they present is of a wild and hostile land, which it is not.

There are some matters of more importance and others of less importance. There are some teachings that are central to understanding everything else. Surely there is no dispute that the heart of all Biblical revelation is found in the cross of Christ. Edward Fudge shows how Jesus' suffering and death shows us the end result of sin. Should one refuse to accept Jesus' atoning death they must endure the consequences for themselves. It is in the cross that we learn how horrible sin truly is, and by this understanding we realize how marvelous is the redemption made possible by the cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd edition renders earlier versions obsolete","review":"Now that the 3rd edition has been \\"Fully Updated, Revised, and Expanded,\\" caveat emptor---let the buyer beware---about buying an outdated publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I purchased this book based on the many positive reviews and because I hoped it would provide information on hell for a book that I'm writing.

There are quite a few errors in the book; it is an awful lot like a first draft of a novel but good none the less. If not for the typo's and sentence errors, I would have given this novel 5 stars.Now that the criticism is out of the way; E.C. Dearing is a good solid writer with an extremely open minded view of the martial arts. Martial artists tend to fall into two camps: Traditionalists and Non-traditionalists.

I was immediately dissapointed. It uses regular batteries, it comes with no charger, it doesnt take standard memory cards, it is very UN-user friendly. I took it to my sons school concert to take pictures and they all came out blurry, it is very difficult to use and the quality of pictures is poor. I ended up reselling the product and went with a Casio Exilim which I am very happy with and its very easy to use with great quality pictures. Dont waste your money on the Sony,Sony has great electronics but I wouldnt say that for their cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Let the buyer beware, this product does not come with a memory chip. When you are reviewing all cameras you tend to forget which one comes with a memory chip and which does not. It does however let you take up to six pictures with no chip at all which is kind of nice. So before buying do some price shopping there is another Sony out there with a chip I think. But this is my second Sony and I bought it because it can take alot of abuse. My kids have dropped it, kicked it, you name it, but it still works well. This one I purchased for my job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera","review":"We bought this camera and have been more than happy with it's performance.

Unfortunately, I lost my own camera and decided to use one of these as an emergency replacement. When I opened the box the first camera was dead on arrival. Well, not exactly DOA. It constantly powered up only to shut down immediately. I tried replacing batteries to no avail. Sent it back to Sony for warranty repair. Then I decided, I had better open the second to see if it functioned correctly. It did. But unfortunately only for a few months. Now, it has the same problem. Evidently, it has to do with the the lens not retracting. I have to physically force the lens closed in order to power up the camera; in addition the flash never works.I'm not sure if they're still selling this model, but if they are, you would be wise to stay away. I thought I got a great deal because of the Sony name and Black Friday price, but it was a total waste of money. Buy a Canon instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Cybershot S650 7.2MP Digital Camera Does Not Work","review":"I purchased this camera for a friend. The camera turns on and shuts off right away.

Followed instructions carefully and it did not stick to anything. The only salvation for my project was that its adhesive property is so poor that I was able to peel the material off both my particle board bar top and the Formica.

I didn't like the first novel (Doctor Doom), because the villain was written just like a madman. (Dr. Doom's behavior was very illogical and abrupt. It bothered me a lot.)In this book, Magneto's personality was portrayed very carefully and thoroughly. In his new world, Magneto was written as a person with a noble soul and ideal and I could understand him better than in any other novelization. I was touched by his conversation with Professor X.This book is above the average and definitely worth to read. But as a person who read both Legacy Quest and Chaos Engine trilogies, I will recommend the Legacy Quest trilogy over this one. Legacy Quest has more interesting plots and character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a buy","review":"when i first started listenin i was like ok this is pretty good but then by the time the first track was halfway through i was considering it to be the best jazz ive heard in a long time u have to buy this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Henna Ever","review":"I've been dyeing my hair with henna for about two years now.

No wonder that the journalist colleague (played by Robert Williams) has hard time after snubbing her for a rich platinum blonde. The great bit of nostalgia stems from the fact that Williams died later that year the movie was completed and Jean Harlow (the platinum blonde) died a few years later.

The main character, forty-two year old Juanita, is ditching her mundane Columbus, Ohio existence to see what lies beyond mothering her adult kids, and going to her nursing job. She ends up in Paper Moon, Montana, about as far away from the inner city projects that she can go. Readers will get a kick out of Juanita, a loving, sassy, and gutsy character who turns the town around with her bold attitude and passion for cooking; Juanita's journey may make readers think of their own life, and will give hope and inspiration to those who seek an existence beyond the ordinary.Dancing of the Edge is full of heart; the character's voice is clear and endearing, and the writing is crisp and to the point, with vivid descriptions.

The music is so simple, it makes me wonder if these guys can even play the instruments. On the \\"fast\\" songs, the music is so jumbled, like they never practiced, just recorded it in one take and the lead singer, woah! Talk about trying to force a sound. It sounds like he is trying to make a certain sound that his vocal chords just can't produce.

It seemed to work fairly well until the temperature got below 30 degrees. The accuracy of the thermometer below 30 is very poor, and as it gets colder the accuracy gets worse. I exchanged the unit, and the new one was even worse. The thermometer was at least as inaccurate, and it did not display any temperatures between 9 and 15 degrees. If the thermometer did work, the fact that it doesn't register temperatures below 1 degree limits its usefullness in Vermont. The compass seems accurate most of the time but is prone to go out of adjustment and requires re-calibration fairly frequently. It would be a fun device to have in your vehicle if it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get suckered!","review":"It only goes down to ONE degree - will not show temps below ONE.

You need to find a suitable place to put the sensor in order to get a \\"true\\" outside temp. We placed it in the door jam as a suggested placement, but found the reading to be off 10 degrees. If placed under the hood or in the grille, you would need to buy an extension cord.Also, the unit can not be left in the car during extreme heat or cold so it would require remembering to take the unit inside and back to the car in summer or winter months. To me, it was not worth the extra effort. Easier to turn on the radio and listen for the temp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good unit for direction and temperature","review":"This unit works as advertised. I mounted it using the suction cups on my windshield in the lower left hand corner, and ran the temp sensor cable about a foot over to the edge of the door frame to get outside temperature.

It works only for the direction you set it at. For example if you set it while facing north, it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions, the result is completely random....This compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually (gasp) might turn.absolute rippoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deffective Temp Senor Plug in Wire","review":"Please advise me if I can get a new Plu in senor Temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work?

He corrorborated it in a written confession shortly therafter. Mr. Mineo was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was killed by a small time thug. The murder had NOTHING to do with his lifestyle.I am aghast at the slander of the murder victim I have heard over the years, and if you are one of the defilers, I hope you ask your God for forgiveness. It seems his gayness nudged people into a viciousness of conjecture that might not have been if Mr. Mineo were straight.

Ioan Gruffudd does an excellent job bringing Horatio to life making him even more lovable.He gives the most amazing performance of a literary character I have ever seen.

He is supported by an amazing cast of equally talented actors such as Robert Lindsay, David Warner, Paul McGann, Jamie Bamber, Paul Copley, and many others.The made-for-television movie features well-constructed storylines.

There are also plenty of bonus features including a great documentary on life aboard a sailing vessel in the 19th century.If you have an itch for an Age of Sail adventure that is more than the typical pirate story, this collection is your answer.

I actually preferred this series to the books, and my only disappointment is that the series ends with Horatio making post captain, instead of continuing on further--it's still a satisfying ending, I just didn't want the series to end at all. Lots of gorgeous period detail and costuming as well. \\"The Mutiny\\" is especially well written of the series.

It is certainly the best thing I've seen on TV in many long years, and better than nearly every movie I've seen in a long time, too. It is good to see a production that honors the highest values. My husband had to be pushed to see the first one, but by the end we were watching 2 or 3 a day and looking up the history behind it on the internet.

Instead, I often had to consult many of the references listed in the text to obtain sufficient understanding of topics. (Fortunately, the book includes extensive reference lists.)

The author gives accurate details about Wicca and shares some of his own personal life of becoming a male witch. I recently got into Wicca and I really needed a man's perspective experience and guidance to this spiritual path. You will feel enlightened when reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful in anyway!","review":"This book was such a bad introduction to Wicca that I would never recommend it to anyone. What little bit there was on Wiccan practices and beliefs could be found in any other introductory book on Wicca but with better detail.Penczack should have called this his autobiography because all he talked about was himself and his own personal experiences with his mother, his sexuallity, and his finding the Wiccan faith. It is not helpful for other young men, not even other gay men. The chapter on divine mothers/sons is just an excuse for him to talk about his mommy and has almost nothing to do with Wiccan beliefs.I am glad that I had read two other (and much better) intoductiary books on Wicca before I read this one otherwise I would never have been interested in going farther in the Craft. I admit I only got halfway through this book before I stopped reading it, because it was just aweful. And I have seen Penczack on TV and he is a pompus ass who really likes to milk his publicity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book probably has some good and correct information, but I didn't find, read or see any.

This author grew up on the Hudson River shipping ports of Hoboken, NJ and Mahattan, NY. He knows more about ships than any encyclopedia could give. I expect to continue purchasing his books.

I bought it last year after Christmas because I really love my Pfaltztgraff Winterberry Christmas dishes, and this looks like it should have been the exact same product without the Christmas design. I spent around $300 to buy lots of accessories because I was so sure that I would love it. I couldn't have been more wrong. First off, there were several broken pieces in the shipment. Second, as soon as I tried to put the plates in my cabinet, I noticed that they were of varying thicknesses, and they didn't stack nicely.

The flaws involve the occasional tiny ceramic \\"pimple\\" (for lack of a better word to describe them).It's been a good set, and it goes with anything.

Instead of a well-done plot now there are 1.5 hours full of trashy lines, sight gags and overdone stereotypes. You would think it was done by a whole different crew. No life lessons here, just constant slapstick with sexual overtones. My seven year old enjoyed it because she didn't get the lewd stuff, but it got old for me pretty quickly. Just my opinion. This is the end of the run for me, and it's a shame, but I guess when you run out of creativity and need to bring in revenue this is what happens.

Kids enjoyed it and that's all what matters, or not? Little boys love playing with the dinosaurs, they love to watch them in movies (from Land Before Times to Jurassic Park), so when this movie was supposed to come out during summer, we were among first its viewers.

But it seems Hollywood is running out of ideas, so we have the third Ice Age movie in about a decade. This time we have dinosaurs as both protagonists and antagonists, along with a mate for Scrat. All the other main characters are back from the first two movies, with the same actors and actresses providing the voices. Like the first two movies, this one is a combination of comedy and family drama. The soundtrack is lackluster, the comedy is primarily one-liners and some screwball comedy, and the action is OK. Overall, a slightly boring movie that might keep your kids occupied for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection of earlier works.","review":"This is a re-release of an LP I had many, many years ago.

I bought my first CD, The Journey of Man. Simply outstanding. I then bought Alegria and Quidam. Quidam is good but Alegria's quality is poor in various places on the CD. Especially toward the end when the daughter leaves the circus, from that point on the picture changes to a transparency of some sort. The picture gets darker and you can't make out a thing. You can still see the people moving but you can also see their shadow or outline of their body and faces. I was willing to put up with it the first time in happened it was brief and short. The second time it lasted too long and just ruined the experience. I would like to buy Dralion but I don't know now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware","review":"This video was incorrectly packaged by Cirque Du Soleil. Those wanting to re-capture the wonder of the Cirque named Alegria and shown on BRAVO TV - beware! This video of the same name and produced by Cirque Du Soleil is NOTHING like what was presented on TV. This is a dark, depressing movie - not the program presented on TV . This MOVIE is inapproriate for children as well as extremely depressing for adults.

I did not know that this was in fact a film around the show. What a disappointment!! All the more because in the end you do not see much of the show since the action is mainly on the mime. Now I am definitely after a copy of Alegria (pure and simple show) which is certainly the most beautiful, emotional, involving, tender, dream show I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in it's presentation","review":"First, my disclaiming caveat: I love Cirque Du Soleil; Alegria was the first one that I had seen live, so I had high hopes for this video. I knew going in that this was a movie in it's own right, not a filming of a performance.As a film, I didn't much care for it. The story took it's time in developing and then moved slowly once it did.There were some circus performances, but just enough to get annoyed at them. It made you want to watch the performances, not the intercuts to the dialogue/'action'. I can understand the desire to show off the performers and their rather impressive talents, but the acrobatics so overshadowed the plot/dialogue/acting that they could only suffer by comparison.Other notes: The set design and costumes were sumptuous, up to the usual CDS standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this if you want to see circus performance","review":"I thought I am buying this for performance.

Alegria is my favorite Cirque du Soleil performance. I thought this was a video of the live performance. I must have misunderstood what the DVD was about. I was very disappointed by this DVD. I just wasn't what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Cirque du Soleil","review":"If you are a big fan of Cirque du Soleil you will be sorely disappointed by this production. It is a movie loosely (very loosely) based around a Cirque performance. There are brief (very brief) glimpses of the Alegria performances. If you are looking for a DVD of the stage performance search for Alegria - Langella. The stage performance is a feast for the senses and a joy to watch again and again. Better still, if you get the opportunity, go see a live performance. It ain't cheap but it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole family loved it!","review":"We picked this up used as an ex-rental and did not know what to expect, other than our basic familiarity with Cirque performances. I can't tell you how pleased we were. The plot was enough to hold our interests, some darker images more than offset by the \\"alegria\\" ending, and the music - WOW! We can't get the title tune out of our heads and even the younger children run around humming the hauntingly beautiful melody. This is the only movie that everyone has requested to watch more than once (and we've seen it 5 or 6 times at last count, although hubby does think it a bit \\"strange\\".) Our 4-year-old now claims she wants to be a clown when she grows up! Hmmmmm... I guess you could call it inspiring! (I'm inspired enough to search for the soundtrack CD...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised it was a movie","review":"Cirque du Soleil's Alegria is not a video of the show Alegria but is a love story that has small bits and pieces of the show Alegria and it's characters thoughout. There are three or four times when mild profanity is used. There is implied mistreatement of young children which could also be upsetting to small kids viewing it. I enjoyed the movie, but it was not what I hoped it would be - Alegria (the show) I'd seen in Atlanta and at Beau Rivage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinema pour les enfants","review":"Boring Cirque Du Soleil melodrama.Good for kids.Good for Cirque Du Soleil fans who love anything that this talented group of people makes.The plot is predictable and the usual Cirque stunning performances are almost totally absent.Some of the usual Cirque flair,magic and romanticism is momentaruly glimpsed here and there but not nearly enough to make Alegria a worthwhile buy.I own Quidam on DVD and Alegria was a big disappointment.I often revisit Quidam, but Alegria gets a big fat zero for replay value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you may expect","review":"Although it has a few performers from Cirque Du Soleil it's nothing like one of the specials you'd see on cable. It's a story and not a CDU performance. I was very disappointed. I had my three year old watching it with me and the first scene is a man in clown make-up who lies down across a train track, puts his head on one of the rails and closes his eyes. This with a train barreling down the tracks. He doesn't get squished but it was not what I was expecting. (I won't spoil the outcome.) My three year old ran out of the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and major ripoff","review":"This is my first review on Amazon despite being a regular customer for two years. I am moved to write because this DVD is a major ripoff. I have seen the Alegria show, loved it and now am very suspicious of any Cirque tie-in. This is a depressing movie totally unlike the show. Don't waste your money or eyesight. Shame on you Franco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Angry","review":"Upon seeing the show titled Alegria on the Bravo channel, I went to a local audio-video store and purchased what I thought was the same show I had seen on television. It was titled Alegria, and I couldn't wait to get it home and watch it. You can't imagine my disappointment when I fired up my DVD player and started watching. It wasn't the circus acts that I had been so thrilled by. It was a movie about two people who fall in love behind the scenes of the big-top. So be very careful when you go to purchase Alegria. If, like me, you were intrigued by the circus acts, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALEGRIA- CIRQUE DU SOLEIL","review":"i WANT TO RETURN THIS DVD. I AM REALLY MAD BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. REALLY, I DID NOT LIKE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cotton Candy Movie","review":"One of my favorite photographs is of a little old lady walking with cane, eating a huge cone of cotton candy. \\"Alegria\\" reminds me of that photo: in a dreary world, there is cotton candy and the joy of a moment which is beautiful, engaging, filled with awareness.No, the plot isn't much. And no, the dialogue is pretty mundane at times (\\"How do you feel?\\" \\"Happy and sad at the same time.\\" \\"That means you're in love\\".) But what is captivating is the allegory and the symbolism: the constant interplay between real and fantasy, between good and bad, between love and loneliness, between childhood and maturity, between good and evil.To experience this, one has to be able to accept the film in and of itself: the music, the cinematography, the narrative sequence. No, it's not a stage performance, and no it isn't a 'movie'. It is a complete and unified emotional and artistic experience, and it's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately not the live show","review":"If you re expecting this to be like the live performance, it isn't. This is a movie based on the live performance of Alegria. I personally would rather have the DVD of the Live performance. In other words do not waste your money on this one because the movie does not even compare to the live performance and frankly is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might think","review":"If the History Channel were to do a documentary on Cirque Du Soleil this would be it. I'm personally not interested in the life story of a few of the performers (perhaps that's a bit to harse). I prefer the shows like I would see in Las Vegas. Give me Quidam, you can keep Alegria."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!","review":"If I could rate this as less than one star, I WOULD!! This is NOT the live show performance of ALEGRIA that I was expecting and thought that I had purchased. It was a rather weird, dark and depressing movie with a fleeting snippet or two from the circus performance. What a let-down! VERY DECEPTIVE PACKAGING! I feel that all purchasers of this film should have the REAL Alegria made available to them at a reduced price. I REALLY FEEL CHEATED!! SHAME ON YOU CIRQUE DU SOLEIL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cirque Du Soleil - Alegria","review":"this movie was a dissapointment, I was hoping to see a display of Cirque Du Soleil performances but it was a corney movie sidetracking the circus."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're not getting what you think you are getting.","review":"If you think you are getting one of the outstanding Cirque du Soleil performances, you're not. This is an imaginative, but depressing movie with very few sketches of Cirque du Soleil performances interspersed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Children","review":"This is to depressing to show to young children...I am just glad my wife and I watched it before our 6 year old daughter saw it. I regret having spent money on it and probably would never buy another of their videos without having watched it first...It starts with an abused child in a work house forming a \\"relationship\\" with a young adult. Nothing about it is atractive or uplifting.I wish someone had told me this before I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizing","review":"This DVD made me feel so peaceful and the music very soothing. I definitely loved it! The bungee dancer was captivating!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If these mimes could talk....","review":"As someone who is a connosieur of the Cirque du Soleil, I must say that this DVD was a profound disspointment. Considering that ALEGRIA is the name of one of their shows, and this film is NOT the stage performance (like SALTIMBANCO, or QUIDAM, for example), the title is misleading. This is actually a narrative movie. A BAD narrative movie. This has an ambitious artistic drive, that reminds me of teh Andy Warhol movies of the 70s, which very very daring, but they were a mess. This mess cannot be cleaned up. It has as much to do with the stage version of ALEGRIA as DEEP THROAT has to do with Watergate. I was so angry after seeing this film, I wanted my two hours back.just...don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This was awful - not much Cirque du Soleil here. They make great shows like O, La Nouba, Saltimbanco, Quidam, Mystere, but this a lousy movie. In looking at the movie trailer, it really contains most, if not all, of the worthwhile scenes. I'd definitely recommend against getting this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled","review":"Fans of Cirque du Soleil must be warned that this is NOT a video of an actual performance. Indeed, it has almost no actual Cirque performance. It is a story \\"inspired\\" by the Cirque show Alegria, whatever that means, but it is NOT the show itself. It is, in fact, a very dark, depressing story that is far off from the uplifting experience of an actual Cirque performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and boring!","review":"I am a big fan of Cirque du Soleil, and I was VERY disappointed in this DVD. Don't buy it if you expect to see the wondrous acts and physical feats the Cirque folks are famous for. This is a genuine attempt at narrative and it fails miserably. As a movie it's painful to watch and pretentious as hell. And the few actual Cirque routines that are included are less than stellar. You want Cirque? Buy Quidam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had been waiting a long time for Alegria to be released, hoping that I would be able to see the stunning performance again. I did not know that this was not the actual show, but a movie. I was very disappointed. Will they ever release Alegria, the performance? I sure hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down !","review":"If I had a nickel for the number of yawns and eventual full blown snores we had during this abysmal production, we'd have recouped all the monies we've spent on our entire collection of Cirque Du Soleil productions, and then some. Frank Lagalla should remain in his sour and dour movie routines, and the Soleil folk should stick to what they do best, namely fabulous extravaganza productions with great music. This exercise should be filed in the 'Been there, done that' category, never to be resurrected under any circumstances, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed if you expect to see performance of Alegria","review":"This is not the usual show performance of Cirque du Soleil. It's only a film with story around Cirque. Personally, I feel boring in the first hour of the film. Less than 10 minutes of the live performance of Alegria was added to the film. Unless you are a real fan of Cirque and don't want to miss anything about the Cirque, then go for it. Otherwise, if you expect to see the show of Cirque du Soleil, watch other videos like Dralion and Quidam or even Journey of Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cirque Du Soleil - Alegria","review":"BEWARE! BEWARE! This is NOT the Cirque Du Soleil performance of Alegria that has been seen and loved around the world. It is a \\"fable\\" with some short glimpses of that performance. To make the cover on the jacket look so much like the Alegria show is extremely deceptive. Fortunatly, my DVD was bad, so I can send it back for a refund.There is a nice moral to the story, and that is that love can conquer anything. But the majority of this video is about child kidnapping and abuse. If this is what you are wishing to purchase, great, but don't think you are getting a video like Quidam, which is the actual performance.I couldn't figure out how to give it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cirque Cinema","review":"I most assuredly qualify as a Cirque du Soleil lover. Just reading the story told by this movie leads me to believe the raves are written by people unfamiliar with the story of Cirque's creation or dedication to advancing humans. When asked why there are no elephants in Cirque acts the founder replied, I could employ one elephant or three humans. The decision was obvious.The negative reviews all reflect a deeply felt betrayal by fans (yes that's short for fanatic) of what Cirque has shown itself to be.The joy & wonder of childhood, learning & adult life are missing from this story. I have no doubt this movie could be considered good to watch if there was no Cirque du Soleil. Sadly, for those of us well familiar with Cirque; their name is, and will be forever, associated with the movie Alegria: An Enchanting Fable. One dead star only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - This is NOT the circus performance - it's a movie","review":"This CD is in my trash can. It is not the circus performance. It's a bizarre movie about circus performers struggling with typical French Angst and suicidal dreams. Nothing on the CD jacket suggests that this is not the circus performance you are seeking. What a ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected; would like my money back.","review":"I expected it would be the circus Cirque du Soleil performing. But instead it is a story about shadowy people, all photographed in what appears to be a night setting. The story line does have some of the people joining Cirque du Soleil. But it is a weird story which I didn't bother watching in its entirety. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - Not Cirque du Soleil","review":"Do not buy this DVD - it is terrible. I got it because I took my 2 year old to see La Nouba where he fell in love with the performance. I bought him the video of \\"The Making of La Nouba\\" and it is all he wants to watch.This is not a Cirque Du Soleil show, but a movie about a clown and a singer who fall in love. I was SHOCKED to hear several curse words - could not even find a rating on the DVD. You get maybe a few minutes where the real Cirque Du Soleil performers are in the background. The movie was SO bad that I could not even make myself watch until the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"magical and moving","review":"this is a very touching portrait of the lives of circus performers versus the lives of 'regular'. A classic story of love and friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not Cirque du Soleil!!","review":"If you are expecting the wonder and magic of Cirque then you will be severely disappointed. This is a heavily scripted, long and unengaging story of a very common and overused genre. I really don't know what was in the mind of the people who produced this work. It really has nothing to do with the beauty and laughter that is Cirque du Soliel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alegria","review":"If you buy this expecting to see Cirque (as I did), you will be disappointed (as I was). Not bad in an emotion drenched, artsy-smartsy manner, but the Cirque over-the top presentation doesn't play well in a dramatic performance. If you display pictures of big-eyed children in your living room, you'll probably enjoy this. No edge, small plot, no suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder of love and guts.","review":"You could cut up any scene in this movie and make a poster of pure magic. I haven't seen the stage show so I am not going to compare this with it. The combination of art, colour, mime and performing skills of the people involved in this is beyond articulation. It really is something that everybody should sit down and watch when life gets a bit dull and mechanical. Great music and something I'll be showing my daughter when she gets a bit older. I think the previous negative comments are rather misleading and possibly based upon the super-fantastic memories of the live performance, which one day I hope to experience: buy it and live!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The show was cancelled and they had a play instead.","review":"I'd much rather see the tumbling, juggling and acrobatics that made the troupe famous. This release has very little of any of these. It isn't a performance but a story and if I had previewed it, I would have passed entirely. As it is, my copy will probably be donated to the local library instead of occupying space on my shelf. That way others can view for free and avoid a blind purchase. I really enjoy Cirque du Soleil's works but not this time.Sidebar: I'd also advise against Journey of Man for the same reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaper Image SR362 alarm clock","review":"This clock has been a savior for me.

I have no idea what any of it is about, but who cares? I don't know what half of the English-language music I hear is about, either. In any case, this band knew how to rock and/or roll. This is excellent punk with great melodies, powerful playing and crazy-screamy vocals. This band deserves to be as big in the U.S. as they were in Japan. They could go toe to toe with any American or UK punk band, and I say that as a huge fan of the Ramones, the Clash, Wire and all the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liner Notes for the Boxed Set","review":"I encountered this book when I ducked into a library on a sweltering day while on vacation. The title attracted me because of its association with Kirk. Lo and behold, it was about Roland Kirk! I sat down with it and was immediately pulled in. The book is mostly anecdotal which means you get to enjoy many \\"voices\\" but it does occasionally get confusing because people refer to people you haven't been introduced to and much of what is said is repeated by others throughout the book. It must have been a bear organizing the stuff. Still..Kirk was simply amazing and if you love to read liner notes on jazz albums, well this is like reading one giant liner note, worthy of a giant boxed set. Lots of fun and you have to be inspired by the man's spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The light still shines","review":"Forget the niggling, critical reviews. If it's a literary masterpiece you're looking for, read Shakespeare. Rahsaan Roland Kirk fans, however, will be grateful to John Kruth for his hard work and dedication in gathering insightful glimpses into the life of this enigmatic genius through the narratives of those who knew him best.Charges that Kruth has written a hagiography or \\"puff piece\\" are unfounded. Although he is obviously an unbridled Kirk enthusiast, he does not hide the fact that Rahsaan had an overly defensive, contentious, and often abrasive side.Yes, we want to know more about personal relationships, e.g., with his son Rory and first wife Edith. True enough, there are elements of redundancy to be found within the 400+ pages. But then again, breathing is redundant yet essential to us jazz fans...and others.Read Bright Moments while listening to your favorite Roland Kirk CDs and it will all come to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This is the worst Jazz biography that I have ever read. It's basically a collection of quotes from various individuals - some knew Kirk; others did not - whose message is, \\"Rahsaan Roland Kirk was a genius.\\" Well, duh.

So buy his recordings now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads & Deeds Indeed!","review":"To all Roland Kirk fanatics: PLEASE--ignore what Kirkus Reviews has to say!

While many of the former translations are dry and unreadable (c.f. KJV and NKJV), many of the latter are in many ways interpretations of the NT rather than translations (c.f.

Lattimore has done a fine job of spaning the gap and providing us with a translation that is both faithful to the words and spirit of the NT greek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lattimore translation: New Testament","review":"This is a New Testament Bible, translated into contemporaty English, but with a sincere effort to preserve the full sense and voice of the original. I think he has been hugely successful. Lattimore hs not done anything cute. He has not sought to change the idiom to capture some current idiom. He has given a straightforward translation in a higly readable form and format. The pages are identified by chapter and verse, but the many verses on a single page are not separately identified. There are no footnotes or references cited. The book is for reasing and not for background text for sermons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued amazement","review":"I began listening to Keb' Mo' in 1997 after purchasing his self-titled debut CD, \\"Keb' Mo'.\\" Soon after that intial sampling, I immediately purchased \\"Just Like You\\" and have been hooked since that time. I now own Keb's entire catalogue, five CDs, and hope there are many more to come. If you enjoy blues, from Chicago classics to Contemporary, you must buy this CD. I'm a voracious blues fan, from the classics (Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf) to the more current, contemporary blues offerings of Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn and now, Keb' Mo'. His skills on the slide guitar are nothing short of incredible coupled with his \\"real\\" lyrics make Keb' one of the most underrated blues artists today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly Not What I Expected...","review":"I'm truly a die hard Keb' Mo fan but this CD is certainly not what I expected.

Keb Mo is one of my favorite artists of the last 10 or so years, but this album is a big ol' disappointment. I wish Keb would put out an album of just himself and an acoustic guitar. Keep it simple and do what you do best (just a side note, added 2/24/04, perhaps Keb took my advise! His new release is entitled \\"Keep It Simple\\". It's much better, but still a little too soft for my liking). If I wanted to hear a bunch of happy hoo-ha I'd buy myself a Bobby McFerren disc.I guess Keb Mo is entitled to be happy as a clam at high tide. He's already put a nice body of work behind him and is well respected in the biz. Entitled or not though, this CD comes across as rather fluffy. Because I like him so much, I'll give Keb Mo a mulligan on this one and eagerly await his next release.If your looking for Keb Mo at his best, pick \\"Slow Down\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Family Side...","review":"Keb Mo' give us a glimpse of what family means with this release.

This one moves away from the blues, which in itself is not a problem, but the music just doesn't cut it. So you know, all his previous albums have been 4 or 5 star in my mind, and Keb is one of my favorite artists. There are a couple of good tunes here, but the album which is half \\"covers\\" ,is a hard listen. Just imagine a cover of Joni Mitchell and a drawn out version of America the Beautiful.

A departure from the Blues and far to many cover versions of songs we have already heard too many times, (Joni Mitchels Big Yellow Taxi, Stevie Wonders Isn't She lovely, the Love Train, and America the Beautiful) adds up to a very disapointing listen. Two songs are worth a listen; Everybody Be Yoself and The Flatfoot Floogie. While neither is a Keb original, they still have the trademark Keb sense of humor. If you like Keb stick to the first four disc's and you won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"pap","review":"With all the fawning reviews, I felt the need to be brutally honest. With the inclusion of family members singing on some of the songs, and references to his family, this CD comes off as incredibly self-congratulatory and self-indulgent. These songs don't just sound like they were recorded for children; they sound like they were recorded for HIS children.The songs themselves are covers, and KM does not improve on a single one. I have most of the original versions of these songs, including the great \\"Everybody By Yoself\\" from the Northern Exposure soundtrack, and I'd rather listen to any of those. KM may have a bluesy jazzy gruff sound, but he shouldn't choose songs that require a bigger range or a wider range of nuances than he is capable of (Big Yellow Taxi, for one).

I was really excited about this album when it came out but I was really dissapointed with it. I saw him in concert recently and he only played one of the songs off this album, I was glad. Reviews here seem to be split and I've read that the realease was meant for a child's album and while there have been plenty of great albums that were meant as children's albums, I don't feel like this is one of them.

Of his numerous affairs and the somewhat strange and cold person that Eleanor was. And of course there is Mama Roosevelt who controlled Franklin almost all his life. I love history so I do know more than what is shown in the movie, but it is still good. It gives the viewer just enough to make them want to know more especially the White House years which were the most interesting. I have watched it several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who this book really helps","review":"Many of the above reviews are contradictory... Here's the scoop as I see it... THIS BOOK: MULTIVARIABLE CALC is for the last several chapters (13-18)... Much of Calc III covers atleast 13 and 14... If you are in Calc I or II, use the SINGLE VARIABLE Solutions manual (Chapters 1-12)... Just straightening things out... Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned","review":"This solutions guide does not include the last third of the chapters in the text book.

It has the answers shown in a \\"how to\\" way. My suggestion: First actually attempt the problem in the text book. After trying to solve it, THEN look at the answer. Only that way will you actually learn from mistakes (or help prove you know how to do the problem!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"misunderstanding","review":"I bought this text thinking it would also have the homework problems with answers. The text contains only answers, and they didn't seem any different from the answers in the Appendix of Stewart's textbook. I had taken Calc 1 and 2 a few years previously, and had to have the current homework problems. The chapters and sections didnt exactly coincide with Stewart's text, which was confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dauntless Helldivers","review":"If you know anything about U.S. naval aviation during World War II, the title alone will grab you. \\"Dauntless Helldivers\\" is an outstanding tale, superbly written by someone who was there and did it all. It's a \\"you-can't-put-it-down\\" book, which is rare for a work of nonfiction. If you've read some of the other great naval air volumes by Walter Lord, Gordon Prange and others, you'll definitely want this one alongside them on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metaphysics made easier or explained very well.","review":"For the reader who is not a philosopher and who has hitherto not made Aristotle's acquaintance may do well to by-pass temporarily the metaphysics. It is easier to understand him talking of the usefulness of organs in animal bodies, or of the differences between a brave man and a reckless one, or of the causes of revolution in states, or of the structure of a good play, than discoursing on the causes and nature of the universe being and existence as such. However, this book makes it easier for somebody coming to metaphysics for the first time. Nevertheless I personally would recommend reading some of Aristotle's work first before going into metaphysics. This book takes the reader through step by step as any good instructor should. I recommend this book to anyone who would consider reading or coming to metaphysics for the first time. I wouldn't be surprised to see this book at any university."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality table for a reasonable price","review":"I thought that this item was too good to be true for the price. I was wrong. It's a very high quality, sturdy table with more than enough space for eight players. Many of these poker tables are flimsy and are too small and cramped for any big groups of people. However, the construction of this item is very solid. And, because it was bought through Amazon, I not only didn't have to pay sales taxes, by using Super Saver I didn't even have to pay for shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is much better than expected","review":"I ordered this for a birthday gift for a friend that loves to play cards.

It was much better than expected and quick delivery was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !","review":"We play Texas Holdem in a neighborhood poker group and this table has beena big hit. We like it better than the long oval shaped tables because everyone is facing each other and we can all see the cards. Also, it folds up and can be put away in storage until we need it again. Easy to take anywhere. We also bought folding chairs and we are set ! All our friends want one now, too !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice table","review":"This is a great folding table. Only 1 thing I find lacking and that is the chip trays are not quite the right size and when placing chips in them, if not inserted exactly correct, the chips tend to fall out on the floor.I've had two of the folding top tables and they went bad simply because the felt kept getting tugged on when opening and closing. This table being solid on the top, has not and will not have that problem.Finding a place to store the table when folded is a little bit of a problem, but thats my problem not the tables.My fellow players have all raved about this table too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good table","review":"I consider this poker table to be worth the money. The table top felt would be better if it had some extra cushion underneath it but is OK as is. When 8 players are sitting at table it is fairly snug but again OK. A recessed tray for chips would be better than the \\"slot\\" type chip holder on the table but the slot type holder is OK. The table is excellent to use in confined areas as due to size. Fold up legs and light weight make it very easy to store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poker Table","review":"We were very surprised at the quality of the table for the money.

It seems as if they've shrugged off their former 'Brit-Poppy' attitude, and adopted a more unique style. When first listened to, Damon's mumbling vocals don't appeal to you right away; it takes a few listens to really get into it. This song really signifies the departure from Blur's 'Pop' style, to more groove-oriented melodies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideal for a traveling Ten Year-Old","review":"I read Demon Seed on one uneventful flight from Edmonton to Toronto and i was terribly dissapointed. I've read many of Koontz's books in the past and he's proven to be way too inconsistent for my liking. Some of his books are very good like Watchers, Night Chills, and Sole Survivor, but this is such an obvious attempt to make a few bucks that it's embarrassing. The print is so large that if it were printed in a Stephen King format it would probably go from the 300 pages it is to about 180. The plot is very average and it seems that Koontz used the old fashioned \\"And then I woke up\\" formula to wrap up his plot in the last 10 pages. If you have a 10 year old throw this book their way they might just be be inexperienced enough in the way of fiction to enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal and disappointing. I'd give it 1/2 star if possible.","review":"As a true Koontz fan, I was so terribly disappointed in this trite, disgusting book. It really does not seem possible that this book was written by the same man who wrote Fear Nothing, Whispers and Watchers. The basic plot could have made an interesting read, but the execution was faulty, stilted, and unfunny. What happened?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a different Koontz book!","review":"A friend of mine got me into the Dean Koontz books last year and I was instantly hooked! I especially loved Watchers and Tick Tock- but Demon Seed? Did somebody else write this one? The depth, intensity, and excitement that are almost always a part of Koontz's books, just were not there. And the plot- come on! If you haven't read Koontz before, don't start with this one. If you are stuck on a plane for a three hour flight (like I was) and the only book you've got is Demon Seed- go ahead... but there are MUCH better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a normal Koontz novel...","review":"What can I say? Koontz is normally one of my favorite authors, but this book...just wasn't up to par, even after the rewrite. In fact I feel the only reason he rewrote it was to through in some current names (such as Winona Ryder and Deep Blue) and to mention the internet. The plot was weak, but not as weak as the characters. The computer (who told the story) just babbled. I could cut half the words out of the novel and still not lose the story. The other two characters in the story were not developed. I could tell that this was one of Koontz's early works, I'm just surprised it got published (twice). The only plus this story had were the themes of male attitude towards women. Now this would make a good book to analyze for an english class, but not a whole lot of enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, awful execution","review":"Dean Koontz reaches a low with this uninvolving cautionary tale of how technology can evolve on its own. Koontz has a wonderful idea here (this is the only book I know that is told from the point of view of a computer), but it turns out to be preachy with an awful ending that dissapoints to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt I wasted my time when there are so many good ones out","review":"I think the idea was good. It just didn't hold my interest and the ending was horrible. I'll give him one more chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, we know he can do better than this.","review":"I read this book about a month ago, and finished it in about two hours--not because it was a great read (because it certainly wasn't), but because it was so simply written and basic. I am a BIG Koontz fan but this was definitely one of the worst I've read from him ever. Luckily he's gotten better since he wrote this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRIBLE BOOK!","review":"I think this is the worst book ever written by Dean Koontz. The main idea of the book is really great, but the writing is so horrible. Dean Koontz uses too many movie stars' names and the it feels like Dean Koontz was in a hurry to end the book. I expected Dean Koontz to be a better writer than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A far better read than the \\" new and improved\\" version","review":"This is a review of the original 1970's version of \\" Demon Seed\\". I had the misfortune of reading the updated version and instantly disliked it. In the original, Susan is a far more engaging heroine and Proteus is a much more appealing villain. In the update, he just comes across as an egomanic, psychotic stalking ex-boyfriend type. Susan, in the update, is a cynical foul mouthed hardnose that evokes little sympathy. I much prefer this version. Though a bit shorter and more scifi, future type. It is a far better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't do it","review":"I am a huge Koontz fan. However this was one of the most painful book I have ever read. I did the Kindle version, and it was just page after page of not much print and or story.

Sorry, but i can not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF ANYONE HAS A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL LET ME KNOW!","review":"The revision was terrible and not worth reading. Out of sheer curiosity I would love to find the orignal version (circa early 70's) and compare the two. If anyone has a copy they would like to lend or sell me let me know ASAP. Or if anyone knows where I can get a copy. Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This was terrible...I just lost interest after the first hundred pages or so.

Not good for Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book","review":"After reading this book, I was overcome by a feeling of extreme outrage at how an author could so misunderstand what it is like to be a vampire. I have been a vampire for many years, and we are all misunderstood. I for example, really like children, especially for dessert. I eat one or two of them after a lite meal, and I find them really enjoyable. Everyone should become a vampire, because we are decent people, which Koontz doesn't understand.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing","review":"This is a really good book other than i am missing 19 pages of the end! I am writing this just so the rest of you can check your copy for the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time.","review":"This was my first Koontz book and I found it very disappointing. Given what I have heard about Koontz, I expected a great deal more. I will probably try one more novel to see if this was a fluke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Excluding the violence and profanity, this is on the reading level of a third grader. I was very disappointed in this book as Dean Koontz has become one of my favorite authors over the years. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, but it never did. Don't waste your time with this book unless you are looking for something that basically has no plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker!!","review":"This book really bombed big-time. I only read the first few chapters and couldn't stand anymore. If the author is out of ideas for books he should wait until he feels creative again and not push garbage like this under his reputation. I feel cheated out of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative and dull","review":"While I agree with most of the comments of other negative reviews of this novel, I would like to say in its defense that Koontz (whose work I am not very familiar with) goes out of his way to add a weird sense of humor to this book that I appreciated. It's not enough to rescue this dismal novel, but it does keep it from being completely unreadable. The computer's obsession with female movie stars got me to chuckle a few times, which is pretty much the only positive thing I would venture about this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, could have been done better","review":"This book had a wonderful idea. But, the lack of characters and the slow pace of it led to a very long read, of a short book. I have read much better from Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly dissapointing","review":"This book does not even compare to his best books like, Intensity and Strangers. If you want a great read I strongly recommend 'Strangers'. I was thinking Dean Koontz had a little too much booze before writing Demon Seed, he probably had a few drinks and wrote the whole childish book in one sitting. Come on Dean try to say sober before you write anymore thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Need I say more?","review":"For a person used to such writers as Stephen King and Robert Jordan, reading this book was a major let down. Cheesy cliches and a terrible ending make for good firewood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good social commentary","review":"This new edition of Demon Seed is an updated version of a novel that Koontz wrote in the 70's (of which a film version was made). The basic plot of the story is that a super-intelligent computer named Proteus becomes self-aware, and falls in what he thinks is love with the wife of the scientist who helped design him. He enters her fully-automated house by way of the controlling computer, and soon has her trapped inside. His aim is to impregnate the woman and inject into the foetus his own consciousness.What makes this book particularly interesting is the fact that Koontz uses Proteus to make a social comment on the male mind and how it perceives women. It really gives a fascinating insight into the male psyche, through the eyes of the computer who thinks he loves this woman and can use that as an excuse to hurt her as much as he pleases. Definitely an interesting read, and one which will make both sexes think."},{"rating":"1","title":"That Hurt","review":"I've read all but one of Dean's available books and this was the worst. I do have one left to read, but I have faith it will not eclipse this one. It Hoovered Gluteus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of Dean Koontz and have LOVED every one of his books....except this one. I found this book to be very boring and just weird, not in his normal and interesting weird way. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, Odd kind of story","review":"I read this book, along with another of Koontz' called Whispers, many years ago when I was in high school. Long before I actually knew who Dean Koontz was. I didn't realize until I had read many more of his books and was looking for another of his that I hadn't read, that I knew this story was his. I agree with the 3 star reviewer who said that the two versions of this book should be released together, because when I found it again, I thought it seemed different than before, but didn't know why - Now I do. :) It was pretty scary to me, way back when. When I read it again, it didn't seem quite as scary, but kind of creepy, sad. Still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"Having read both versions, I find the newer version to be inferior to the original. The original is much more involving, interesting, and took me in, and kept me reading until the last page. The climax of the original is more thrilling, I found this version lacking. If you are interested in the original, start shopping the used book stores, this version is inferior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book was excellent. I don't read books often, actually I don't unless I have to, but this book was just so good I couldn't stop reading it. I actually finished the book in a week (that is so good for me) I usually never finish a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book but preferred his original","review":"I have to admit that this ranks as one of his worst books, considering it was a reprint of the original 1973 book which was fantastic.I have read the original again and again and is a lot more beleivable than the reprint. For avid readers I suggest getting hold of a copy of the original - fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"_Great book_","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Its only con was that it ended too quickly. Unlike others I thought that the ending was great and it told everythig it needed to. All in all a fine work from Koontz... Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast but disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book - especially the ending. Thankfully, a friend gave it to me so I paid nothing for it. It was a fast read but I couldn't wait for it to be over. I much more enjoyed Dragon Tears and would suggest that book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual storytelling, but I still love his work.","review":"I read this book just because of who he is. I was a little disappointed by its lack of character depth. But everyone has to have a bad day and I look forward to his next book with anticipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":"I love Dean Koontz novels. Perhaps I was expecting too much after Intensity? Sorry Dean...I didn't enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Water This Seed","review":"Oh my God! Lets just say that alot of poor trees were unjustly cut down to print this book. Demon Seed should never have been written, let alone updated and re-released. If you have never read Koontz before, give him another try with Watchers or Phantoms (not the movies though). And if you have read Koontz before, you know this is not his typical great read. Bury this Demon Seed, but don't water it. It may grow back yet again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Demon Seed Editorial Review","review":"At first the book was quite confusing, the name \\"Demon Seed\\" did not match because the narrator was obsessed with the main character, Susan. As the book progressed, it was less confusing and more demented. Science has discovered how to recreate new life, but what they don't realize is how dangerous it is. As it creates a plan to take over the world, it destroys Susan's life with no care or concern towards her. The life form takes many turns and spills into the recreation of the living world. It was a good book with an on-the-edge-of-your-seat ending. I would recommend this book to anyone with a mature out look on things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Good thing it's an easy read because I was very disappointed by this book compared to others by Dean Koontz. There's especially very little action, as it's the \\"demon seed\\" doing too much talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...Yea ok...Right","review":"Ok let's get one thing straight. Dean Koontz is heck of an author. His novel Intensity was unbelievably unnerving and Ticktock was unexpectedly intriguing. Demon Seed...my, my, my. This is one book I can not say is awesome. I love to read, don't get me wrong. I liked the idea of Demon seed, it was good. The idea that is. The execution was as if he were only an amateur author trying hard to win a school writing contest. Well I hope you think twice before purchasing this...um...weird book. Later and keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO VERY DISSAPOINTED","review":"I fell in love with the excellent film version of this novel. I can't say enough good things about the movie. It is extremely frightening and the wild plot is almost believable. I searched without success for years trying to find the book. I was jubilant when I discovered that he had re-released the novel. I became weary when I realized that he had also attempted to update it. The result - a pathetic let down. His attempts to merge the internet into the story was nothing short of humourous. The mighty Proteus supercomputer, an entity that held almost godlike power and respect in the film, was reduced to a teen voyuer pervert in the novel. It was too short, too ridiculous, and very disappointing when compared with the film. I'd LOVE to get a copy of his original version. Rent the film first, then get the book and decide for yourselves - but be prepared for a letdown. Koontz took a fabulous plot idea and ran it through the sewers. I think I stick with Stephen King next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gibson Brothers-Excellent Bluegrass Harmony","review":"I have loved Bluegrass music since I was a child and this album is the best.

She's completely gorgeous, but even she can't save a disaster of a film. Buy Deathstalker instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This direct to video movie is one hour and twenty-one minutes long and was released on July 29, 1992. By no means is this a sequel; so don't confuse it with the original. The movie itself is pretty lame. The plot is short is one of the king subordinates hopes that the king died in battle so he can take over the thrown and gain the powers of the magic sword. Lana Clarkson, who is the king's daughter, does not believe that her father is dead and refuses to give up the secret of the sword or whatever it is. She is throwing into a dungeon and escapes. She leads a rebellion to reclaim her thrown and wins. The movie looks like it was film in a medieval England period. Though it gives no mention, there are a few breasts scenes, but that is about it. If you though one was bad, two is even worse. If you are a die hard Lana Clarkson fan, either rent the movie are burrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY AREN'T ZERO STARS AVAILABLE FOR RATING??????","review":"Maybe I should have known better, but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same.

The author thinks it is.All seeing enemies with perfect knowledge. Henchmen who do this stuff for what reason? This stuff went out with the yellow peril in the thirties.The main villian, who can plan this so called perfect crime, does a Robin Hood which would never get by the worst IRS auditor in the world.This thing reads like the plot of a really bad third rate action thriller movie.

I found myself disgusted and frustrated by the absolutely stupid plot and egregious acting. There isn't even enough nudity or gore to make it remotely watchable. Seriously, do NOT waste your time or money on this movie. Even if you want to see a bad movie, skip this one. It's not only bad, it's stupid and pointless.

Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger return, along with Natasha Henstridge as Sil: a clone of the half alien/half human hyrbid she played in the first film. She goes into heat when an astronaut (Justin Lazard) returns from a mission to Mars infected with alien DNA, and he has an urge to mate. What results is him fathering a bevy of creepy kids (which are delivered by their mothers in a very bloody way) as the body count rises and he and Sil prepare to meet up. Species 2 is a pure schlock fest from beginning to end, but despite it's excellent makeup and FX, it doesn't achieve the same kind of guilty pleasure feeling that the first film did. All in all, it's worth seeing for some pointless but well pulled off gore and nudity, but other than that this one's a turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I wouldn't recommand Species II to anyone. The creation of this movie is only due to the sucess of the first, there shouldn't be any reason for watching this movie except for Natasha Henstridge's boobs. What they want to make was an erotic alien movie but they simply forgot to structure a more convincing story, instead it's just a weak movie with tons of sex scenes to make up for the lame plot. You can still rent the video just for the thrill of it but to spend money on the DVD is a big no-no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eww, this is what i call a turn off....","review":"One day, I was alone with my friend in a hotel room. What other natural thing would two boys do alone other than order a movie? So we did, and our choice, Species II, was a very bad one. Species II is the story about an alien infiltration in human society. The aliens infect a human host and it is then up to the human to procreate as if litterally rebuilding the human race. In other words, this is sex that appeals to the geek. I might add that this is a very bad movie. I advies pregnant mothers not to see this film unless they want to know how a baby can graphically erupt from their stomachs. Even if you are the curious type and are only seeing this movie for the nudity, don't. No matter how horny you are, the director does a great job of flushing that feeling and your stomach as well with cold blooded gore in the movie. Avoid this movie even if you are a Natasha Henstridge fan. Being subjected to this film is not worth the pain at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very badly produced.","review":"The producers of Species and Species 2 had a great cast of actors and a good premise.And what did the producers do with that?They made soft core porn films.They could have made a good dramatic film and used the actors who really,especially in the first film,created great characters.BUT,unfortunately the producers were not up to the effort,turning what could have been a great and suspenseful fracise into a dismal and pitiful set of films.Mind you,the first one is Shakespeare compared to the really awful Species 2.That's what happens to a francise when amateurs pose aas proffessionals and the producer should go back to his day job.What a wasted set of films and an opportunity missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof Positive That Most Sequels are LOUSY!","review":"Although the original will not go down as one of the classics of the sci-fi genre, this sequel makes the first seem like \\"Citizen Kane.\\" Cheaply made with horrible special effects, the film reads like a primer for bad film making.

This movie is about as bad as it gets. The Acting is average, as Natasha Henstridge does her part well and is still very attractive, but you can see in the other actors that they are wondering what are they doing in this movie, as if they want to get it done and over with. The movie is about selling more of soft porn and cheap predictable horror shocks than being bothered by any type of coherent story.

Then forget all about it and rent something better instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie director must have had some bad days.","review":"My guess is, that the director has said, right before he started the movie; \\"Okay we have a okay budget, access to some.. sometimes okay special effects and some okay good actresses, but you have to do your job just as bad as the story is and if you have anything clever to say about making the movie good, then please leave\\".I just don't get it! It would be so easy to make a good movie out of it! Well first of all, you probably have to a get little different version of the story and another movie director...but it would be so easy!Just a thing like this! Eve want's to escape, so she jumps through the prison window. Okay Miss Eve is well powerfull, but she doesn't have to be, because it isn't made of bullet-proof Plexiglas.

However, the U.S. rangers are quick to overcome their fear of the ghost and soon turn the tables on the fabled spirit.When it's discovered that Cuffy Williams (Young) is a distant relation to the Cantervilles, it is hoped that he can lift the curse by performing a heroic deed. But, will he be hindered by the tradition of cowardice of his family or will he be the hero that so many of the U.S. rangers are?

The lyrics are meaningful, which today is so rare. It actually makes you think and feel-that is great music to me. And to the other reviewer criticizing the vocals: Scott has a sweet and tender voice- he sings and doesn't scream the lyrics. Again- meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly amateur","review":"A friend of mine recommended this Disc to me. Since he has never steered me wrong before, I was excited to get in my car and listen to it on the drive home. About 40 seconds into the first song, I surfed through the remaining ones. I could not stand his voice. The rasp and push of his voice is so terrible amateurish and unattractive that I could not hope to ever like this album. His voice is terrible.The two stars are for the music. It is the high point of the disc. With another singer, there would be real potential on this disc.The lyrics have potential, but he needs to remember that, although you have \\"memories\\" in the title of the album, you needn't repeat it 9000 times in the songs. Another amateur yet standable part of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lenox Winter Greetings Everyday 2 piece serving set","review":"I was disappointed with the quality of this product.

The 2nd disc was effectively Rarities 1, and it had only 6 tracks. The tracklist listed here is for Rarities 2. Big Country then released Rarities 2, 3, 4, 5, and soon 6. I bought this thinking it may be a different disc, but am returning it since I already have Rarities 2, and they're the same.

Amazon was great and sent a replacement. That one failed a month later. I called Seagate to learn how to clean the memory so there were no confidential work files on it, and they couldn't do it. You have to send the unit in to them to be replaced. The problem is that I have confidential financial files on it so I can't just hand it over. They won't let me destroy it before returning the unit.I treated this thing very gently, but I believe the problem is that it actually has moving parts inside and is not completely digital flash drive.I would not recommend wasting your money on this one.

I recieved the player, gave it a test drive and all appeared fine. I didn't notice the freezing as MANY others have since posted until a few weeks later when I tried to watch a DVD. This is obviously a problem with the batch of players that Amazon.com has in inventory. Now I read that I have 30 days to return it. It's July 30th, and they better take the thing back or fix the problem. Looks like everyone has this freezing issue.

I bought the XVN410BK's twin (the XVNP10S which has all the same stuff but adds multimedia card reader). It has all the same problems reported by the other reviewers. I'm guessing this is a design flaw in either the processor chip(s) or the laser/drive unit.

It's nice to relive the movie a few times, but after that, you just want to play a good c.d and with this one, you find yourself running to the stereo to skip every other track.

I had not seen such a incredible film in all my life.The actors were great (especially Jamie Bell).What came to my attention most though was that most of the songs such as \\"I love to boogie\\" was made in the 1970-80's and the film was set in the 1970-80's which made the film even better.Last Wednesday, I was on the Jamie Bell website looking to see how much the video and cd was when I was shocked to see that the video was ... and the book was ... and when I went into Woolworths the next day the video was ... and the book was ... so be aware! Also, if you don't want to pay for the cd you can download the songs on to a cd from ... and make your own version.Last of all, when my friends saw the film they thought jamie Bell was a sissy just because he does ballet but who ever thinks this I reckon they look more of a sissy."},{"rating":"1","title":"CALLING ALL MUSIC LOVERS!!!","review":"I am soooo frustrated!!

This game has a Syphon Filter feel (3rd person view) and a Metal Gear Solid look (muted colors, floating ammo/health packs). Yes, this game very much wants to be Splinter Cell (one of the characters you play looks a lot like Sam Fisher from the back) without the emphasis on stealth. At first, the controls were a bit awkward (you are constantly in 'aim' mode like SF), especially in the FPS view. What carries the game is the challenge (having to replay from the last checkpoint), the graphics (like most xbox games), and the variety (the hovercraft is cool!). This game has succeeded in getting into my head when I'm not playing it (like right now...). Definitely worth picking up a copy until the next high-profile game comes out. Fans of Splinter Cell, Killzone, and MGS should enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favourites","review":"this YSL parfum is my favourite of all, a classic of all... it has a very powerful scent who surpassed fashion... for a night use... thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one out there!","review":"I simply love this one...you can wear it in morning and it will be on you until next morning....long lasting and really seductive fragrance...Try it and you will not repent.

I did pick up the excellent soundtracks and those tracks have been in constant rotation on my playlists over the years.But now it's great to rewatch in HD. It's one thing that every frame looks like a work of art, but the extra audio touches I'm picking up in this format add just a bit more dimension; especially on the quieter scenes where it's more of the ambient environmental effects that carry weight.get this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series... well worth getting","review":"WOW...

The images are blurry, the lines are fuzzy, colors washed out, there is noticeable gradient banding, and artifacting during many scenes. If you own the DVDs, stick with them as they are the best quality available.If you want a HD version of this anime wait for the official release from the studio, not some cheap Funimation weekend project. I ended up returning this because I am not going to pay for this horrible mess of a release.I added a screenshot to the images section to show how bad this release is.

However, it appears that a filter was used to scrub the grain from the video. For example, in one scene on the DVD you can see the individual roof tiles on some buildings. In the same scene on the Blu-Ray disk, the roof is just a blurry mess.I recommend getting the DVD set over the Blu-Rays. I suppose if you hate grain that was added to the video on purpose by the animators and can stand the drop in detail, you should get this set. Since this is a true case where the DVD has more detail than the Blu-Ray set, I would go for the DVD and just use an upscale player."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you already own the DVDs, then don't bother","review":"This just arrived for me at my door not too long ago. Being that Samurai Champloo is one of my favorite animes, I was excited to pop this in my PS3. I knew beforehand that this would be an upscale, but if the upscale were anything at least like Full Metal Panic: TSR, then I would be satisfied. Unfortunately, this was not the case.Just looking at the picture was a disappointment to me. I own the DVDs as well, so I took one out as a reference and compared the two. The difference between the Blu-ray and upscaled DVD were almost negligible. There wasn't that much of a difference. The blu-ray version had a *smidge* more clarity, but nevertheless almost looked identical to the DVD version.If you own the DVDs already, then don't waste your time.

Usually, it's a finicky issue, like 1 time, they couldn't recognize my dvd IDE drives. Their tech support told me it was cuz my #2 dvd drive was LG (Asus doesn't like LG.) Then, another time, their tech support guy said, Asus didn't like my super cool best-of-them-all Antec power supply/ brand new, 550watts, modular, top of the line, Antec NeoHE 550 psu. Another time, i bought a new router by Linksys, and Asus stopped doing wireless, after half hour. Another time, the Asus AMI bios bombed altogether. Asus boasts about greatness in overclocking, but i got darn good, super good results, and 100% reliable results, from X38 Gigabyte boards. Buy a good mobo, and you will have a good time.

In addition, I borrowed a friend's copy of Barron's Pass Key To The GRE, which is a slimmed-down version of the book I am reviewing. They did their job; I amassed a composite score of 1200 (no word on my essays yet).There is a CD that accompanies this book. ***Do NOT buy this guide simply because of the CD!!*** While there are computer-adaptive tests to practice with, many of the questions/reading passages are repeated.For the price of the books that Barron's offers, they are valuable study helpers.

If anything, I am EXTREMELY more confused than I was before I opened up this book. It has been nothing but a waste of my time and energy. The only thing this book has succeeded in doing is making me feel frustrated and less confident about my Math skills.

I got more than 730 in the text of CD, but in real test I received less 550. Especially sentence completion part is not that easy going in real test.

The sample questions are also very good and represent what they will look like on the GRE. The writting section is also very good especially the tips for the analyses part. The only fault I can find n this book is that the math section can be a bit hard to understand especially if you have not done math in a long time like I haden't.

It was not *rigorous* and helpful, but very frustrating. Trying to estimate by eye only of graphs was just ridiculous. Here, I did read some of the strategy. It was somewhat helpful, but you are better off getting a purely math review book and figuring out a lot of the trick yourself.The writing section was solid.Overall, I would recommend this book, but only for verbal use.

The author of the book declares that \\"all\\" religions are the truth\\" and that no one way is the right way. He also says alot of things are acceptable that the Bible says isn't like homosexuality. This just wasn't that good of a book.

The baby quilts and Christmas projects are very warm and welcoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"false signals","review":"skip this; I get way too many false signals, it has not proven to work for me.

I did not however particularly like the layout. There were lots of basic questions that I did not think were straight out addressed that most people tend to want in an overview, but I do believed they were answered in a round about way.

However, I was so disappointed. This book was written by a Mormon for the amusement of other Mormons. It raises more questions than it answers. Williams is judgmental of other religions-- and often incorrect. The book is haphazardly organized, introducing topics without defining them. And finally, Williams'writing reflects a patriarchal, sexist perspective that confirms negative perceptions of his church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, whitewashed view of important American Religion","review":"The editors of this book really dropped the ball. The history and practices of the LDS church are glossed over in naive and sometimes patently untrue ways in this book--though the information does seem to adhere to the approved LDS version of the church (I think--I'm not certain, since I'm not LDS myself). I'm appalled, frankly. I think the editors of a reference guide have an obligation to check the accuracy of information in their books. As an informal student of religion, even *I* could spot the problems here.It's a shame too, because the history and organization of the church is complicated to an outsider and I was looking for a clear, simple guide. Mormonism is an important movement in American religious history--we deserve real history, not a chipper, whitewashed version.\\"Mormon America\\" is a better book, though it is not a quick guide in any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and full of faulty information","review":"I generally assume that \\"Dummy\\" and \\"Idiot\\" books are written objectively. I would have never imagined, though, that one would be written as an apologetic for a particular religion as this book appears to be. The author, who is a Mormon, does his best to make Mormonism look like just another Christian denomination. (One place he says it's a misnomer to say that Mormons are not Christians. Yet he never explains which \\"Christian\\" doctrines that Mormons believe.) This book might be enjoyed by Mormons who think that it supports their faith and possibly could lead the uneducated into inviting Mormon missionaries to their homes. But to those who have studied this religion, it is nothing more than a polemic attempting to make Mormonism look mainstream when, in fact, it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"You would have to be an Idiot. . .","review":"...to believe this garbage. It's a shame that the author doesn't mention Kolob - the planet where the mormon's god had celestial whoppie with his physical bride (yes, you read that correctly).

The matte finish of the titanium case and band combined with the white on black dial made for a very appealing package. When I put it on, the deal was sealed. The light weight and smooth finish of the band said - you can wear this all day in comfort. Titanium is a miracle metal - it doesn't rust, it's tough, it's hypo-allergenic, it's amazingly light and it looks cool.The watch keeps very good time. The chronograph feature is simple to use - by that I mean, it's intuitive so no manual is required. The alarm function is another matter. Crack the book or you're going to be frustrated. Like some of their other alarm watches, the value of this feature is limited. If you get up every day at 6:00 AM, you have to set the alarm every day. Silly idea.Overall, this is a bargain for what seems to be a beautiful, well made watch from one of the best names in the business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alarm is not loud enough to do any good.","review":"Great watch for the price, if you don't care much about the alarm.

It is attractive, easy to read and, as others have noted, it is light. The manual is not well written so it took some time to figure everything out. The alarm is very high pitched and most of the time I cannot hear it even when it is on my wrist. I am in my 50s and probably have some hearing loss but I am no where near needing a hearing aid. The alarm is my only complaint. Everything else has met or exceeded my expectations. And the price is very good for what you get.FOLLOW-UP: Several days after receiving the watch and writing the review, it stopped running! I've had a Seiko watch that ran flawlessly for 10 years so I didn't expect this. I had to send it to the service department (at my expense) and weight three weeks. While the watch, when it is working, is great, I was disappointed with the defect and have lowered my rating as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very sophisticated","review":"While I'm a huge fan of the Q&A; approach, this book just does a really bad job with it. The questions offer endless repitition of the same few (very basic) ideas, rather than altering the facts a little to get different results under the tax code. As a consequence, you'll do nothing but get bored trying to work through these questions, even if you're really trying to learn the material (because instead of getting hit with new ideas you'll just get question after question asking the same thing (and answer after answer that is identical, like they were written mostly just using cut-and-paste). Also, this book covers *much* less material than any law school corp. tax course.

First, the book assumes that you know how to use prior versions of Logic. Nowhere does it even attempt to describe the basics of how to start using the program. Second, nearly 70 pages are dedicated to general computer issues, not Logic. Third, the book is based on a beta version of Logic 4 (which it apologizes for). Unfortunately, this is a critical problem because the menu stucture in Logic 4 is very different that the book's examples. Last, it really needs a good proofreading.

And I was very touched by Birk and Ronia's carefulness to maintain their friendship, especially in the incident with the knife. Great contrast between the brash and the tender.

We've used it to summit 13 states so far including easy drive-ups like Florida and Arkansas as well as challenges like Colorado (second highest point in the lower-48) and New Mexico.While the book isn't a detailed hiking guide, it does contain information that is absolutely necessary to reach certain highpoints, especially those on private property.

It was assigned for an upper-level constitutional class. Trying to decipher what the authors are attempting to impart through the near total use of squibs as opposed to full opinions, and their own cryptic notes interspersed among snipets of the cases, is next to impossible to accomplish. In addition, their particular method of editing is intrusive and annoying. Some of the brightest minds in the country have written classic opinions on the very important subjects in this book.

I would highly recommend this book for anyone who desires a good relationship with another human being--whether it is a child, spouse, parent, coworker, friend or whomever. It is about much more than parenting. It is about relationships and communications between people. His concept of certain methods being \\"more helful\\" and others \\"less helpful\\" rather than calling them \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" makes it easier to make changes because there is less reason to become entrenched or defensive.An excellent book. Definitely the most clinical I have read, but with many meaningful real life examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to read...","review":"This book is an inspiring, joyfilled devotional that leaves you waiting for the next day.

Sound and video quality are good (not great) and it features Eric Clapton playing tasteful understated melodic lines on a Telecaster with a Strat neck and killer Hammond organ work from Steve Winwood. Ginger Baker is spot on and there is great bass work from Ric Grech as well. Steve strains a bit with some of the vocals but it is real \\"live\\" music and sounds great to me.

When you see it, you will be shocked as to the aural quality, the appearance of the \\"star\\" performers, the tinniness of Steve Winwood, etc. The recording was so crude and makeshift that the band, were it still together, might well have had it buried.Blind Faith was a composite band, making up all-stars from other prior bands. Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bruce, with most vocals distinctive with little \\"Stevie\\" Winwood's warbling but enjoyable voice, Clapton's consistently solid, if not always great, guitar, etc. Their magnum opus album, Blind Faith, is one of the great albums of all time. However, this DVD unravels that, making the songs sound not simply worse than the studio(a common occurence in recording) but MUCH worse to the point of being unrecognizable.Don't buy this unless you want simply an historical record of the group, to be played with the sound off..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind Faith London Hyde Park 1969","review":"I had to order this twice because the first one would not work/load properly.

Thus, you will NOT be able to order this DVD from Amazon-US unless and until any contractual problems get resolved. And that's a shame. I was so looking forward to finally, after 37 years, being able to seeing some footage of this supergroup. I may order it directly from the label and find someone able to convert formats for me.

Released in 91', this was maybe the first album to start the new wave from Sweden. It is not very good but it was very important for the genre back then. The music is not at all as advanced as it is on the next album. It sounds very dark and not as melodic as later albums. Yet it's a must have. At The Gates is a great band with many cool ideas. This Cd is not bad but unlike other bands from GBG, their debut wasn't that good. The developing proces from this to the next Cd released in 92'is enourmous.

Ultimately this book leaves one feeling unsatisfied.It is also worth commenting that the books dialouge is so silly and child like at times, it appears that the author simply is attempting her hand at some form of satire.

Unfortunately I borrowed the book from the Univ. of Richmond and it is very out of print. Secondly as a student of edged weapons I was able to see mistakes the authors made: such as showing a drawing of a halberd that they had determined was for parade purposes due to it's size, they do not mention that the halberd is either an import or copy of a Chinese weapon that was fairly common.

The film pokes fun at the genre and at itself. It's action sequences, costumes and much of its dialogue are supposed to be over-the-top. Apparently, some Amazon reviewers don't get that.The performances are, for the most part, great. Kurt Russell, the films only big-budget star, seems to be having a terrific time hamming it up as The Commander. The kids all do a fine job, as well.Some have said this film is \\"The Incredibles\\" meets \\"Harry Potter\\", and that's fair, but I found \\"Sky High\\" to be much wittier and more entertaining than those films - particularly script- and performance-wise.

An Sf fan through and true.This movie had the right balance of angst and lightheartedness to appeal to a very wide age range, and yet - it is desperately missing one thing : A sequel.The actors in this movie did a fine job, and I hope to see them in the *Sequel*. The comic book stills at the end makes me wonder if Disney won't put out comic books about these characters.Come on disney - you market everything else to death, why not this?All in all an enjoyable ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie Both for Kids and Adults","review":"My kids and I both enjoyed this film.

I loved seeing it when it came out in the summer, and not just because the main character is kinda cute... (just kidding).This movie is hillarious, cute, and lots of fun. The characters stick with you for ages. Whenever they make a bad choice, you want to yell at the T.V \\"NO\\" (which, by the way, is a good thing, it means that they are believable).I really recomend it, it's a great movie that the family will enjoy. I highly recomend it.The only reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 for me is because the girl the main character had a crush on was secretly an evil villain at the age of 40 whose body looked like a senior in high school. If that's not weird enough, she turned all the adults into children, which was really disturbing.

I figured out the entire film in about 5 minutes and for someone who likes suspense in a film, I can't say this interested me much. It's your average superhero film where the bad guy is obvious from the start and you know he's going to fall for the best friend who has feelings for him but only after he has the relationship with the pretty villain. & ugh...

I tend to judge things by how much pleasure I derive from them so my bottom line is out of the $15 I spent I have gotten about $3 worth of enjoyment out of the basil and when I'm done it will be around $5.

What a shame. The writing in this book is terrible. If it was written by a 9th grader, I might think it was amusing and passable. If the author is an adult, then I'm disappointed. One should know how to write creative sentences (instead of short ones that add nothing to the plot). This explains why the author PAID for this work to be published. No publishing company would accept this. This book has the look and feel like it should be next to the tabloids on line at the supermarket. These stories might amuse a 13 year old (or someone equivalent mentally) but that's it. By the way, the font size is huge.. so not only are you getting only 104 pages.. you are getting 104 pages of big words.

The face is deeply recessed and the numerals are very defined and easy to read. I have always admired the Breitling Navitimer, but as many have said, over $3000 for a watch is above my pay grade. For this price? In my opinion, if you want an aviation themed watch you can do no better.

For those, the general information contained in this book, while a bit old-fashioned and repetitive, could be of some use.For others, however, it will accomplish little. Almost all of the \\"special\\" kisses contained in the book are either already widely practiced or self-explanatory and useless. \\"What is a surprise kiss?\\" \\"It's when you are surprised by a kiss.\\" \\"What is a grudge kiss?\\" \\"Its when you kiss someone else after being cheated on.\\" These are not new kisses, they're simply kisses grafted on to outside circumstances.The advice tends to be constant repetition that boys should slow down, focus more on lip-only kissing, and try to be romantic.

That is rich. This is a prima facie embarrassment. But it appears recently that Catholics have become worried about their very famous proximity to diplomatic fudging of all sorts. Thus Robert George has recently come out against \\"Lying\\" as if it is a big moral deduction. All the organizations he has been involved with are founded on casuistry. Thus it is the purest falderal for him to present himself as an arbiter of proper decorum on the issue, not to even speak of morality. Those connected with him in his efforts are guilty of exactly these kind of falsehoods. Of course they think they have the higher ground, but their tactics prove otherwise.

A convoluted plot that comes together well, in the end. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read -- easy to sum up","review":"Here is the Reader's Digest version of \\"Last Car to Elysian Fields\\":Dave Robicheaux -- reformed drunk, broken man, and bourgeois-hating cop -- wanders around Louisiana in a funk, obsessing about a tragic blues artist from a bygone era, doing inexplicable things that sometimes seem to be related to police work, annoying everyone he encounters, getting people killed, and nearly getting himself killed. Finally, after most of the characters in the book kill each other off, it ends and he spends Christmas in the Florida Keys with his grown daughter who comes home from college.Burke's prose is atmospheric and well-done and everyone seems to be enamored of it. Sadly, thats not enough to save this ponderous foot-dragger. No one seemed to notice that it was a dull story that plodded on in spite of almost everything its main character did -- which wasn't much. Sorry, but I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am a huge Burke fan. I have read them all, some a couple of times. BUT, this book was horrible. I started skimming the usual plush, rich, time/mood/place descriptions. Then I started skimming the anti-Bush, Farenheit 911 stuff. Then I started skimming the dacquiry seller as satan stuff. Then I started skimming the corporation as satan stuff. Then I was done with an uninteresting book. I still love Clete though. The opera embarrassment of the mafia guy was horrible--not good. Plus, hasn't Burke written these characters and story lines at least 10 times? If I'm going to reread the same stories, I'll go back to reread the first 5 or so in the series. OUTSTANDING. Gritty, hard, evocative, moody, dark, southern and quotable. Makes you want a po boy and dirty rice. Please go back podna, this way ain't forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Burke's Best","review":"This is one of James Lee Burke's finest novels. Beautifully written as usual, with rich characterizations and descriptions of time and place. His depictions of tortured souls and the ambiguous conflict between good and evil leave the reader spiritually enriched and more thoughtful regarding the ills of society and the individual. There is no black and white. Nothing is clearcut and easily solved. And in the creation of Dave Robicheaux, the troubled and conflicted \\"hero\\" of these novels, Burke has given literature, not just the mystery genre, one of its most interesting and tragic figures. If you have never read James Lee Burke, begin with the first novel in this series and discover one our great American authors. I envy those who have the pleasure of doing so for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not his best","review":"This is a wonderful story, but not the best JLB novel I've read. This has quite a bit of introspection and psychology, but not enough action. the imagery is unbelievable. Buy this and read this but demand more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GUMBO OF A PLOT","review":"What a great crime story! Burke weaves a complex plot that not only involves current characters but has historical roots in scenes that are gritty as well as true to life. The reader is clear about the bad guys from the start but suspense builds as the exact nature of the crime is a mystery until the last chapter. The lives of many characters are intertwined in interesting connections, revealing Burke's art as a story teller. The author is also an artist, painting word pictures that are sharp and descriptive while employing economy in his words. There is no fluff, reflecting the nature of the hard hitting, no nonsense main character. The descriptions of the treatment of Black prisoners is brutal and yet there is tenderness in the writing as grief over departed loved ones is explored. My favorite character was an IRA hit man who is presented in an almost likeable portrayal as he guards the decent people and eliminates even more dastardly beasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Chapter??","review":"I started reading James Lee Burke's Robicheaux series earlier this year and have come to love both the characters and Mr Burke's deliciously descriptive prose (I live in Australia but one can almost taste the essence of Louisiana in his writing!). After having been carried along in Dave Robicheaux's life in the previous 12 novels, sharing his darkest and brightest episodes, it was a great disappointment to find so much has changed in his life in the beginning of 'Last Car to Elysian Fields'! Okay, so maybe we didn't need to share his darkest moments - the loss of his wife; the destruction of his father's house; and giving up his boat and bait shop - or perhaps Mr Burke is still writing about this part of Dave's life in a yet-to-be-released flash-back novel? Whatever the reason, I believe fans of Dave Robicheaux deserve to told this missing chapter in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the audio book version!","review":"I gave my dad the unabridged audio book version of \\"Last Car to Elysian Fields\\" for Christmas. He was excited, because James Lee Burke is one of his favorite authors. But he's given up trying to get through this book -- the Cajun accent the reader adopts is so thick it's too much of a struggle for him to understand. Dad had some trouble with the last Burke audio book, but this one (same reader) is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the book, hated the reading","review":"This review refers to the Audio-book. I'm a huge James Lee Burke fan, but I found the reading of this book to be unbearable. I have listened to Mark Hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like Elmore Leonard, but here he just sounds tired, sloppy and unconvincing as a Cajun reader. His performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety. When he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from Detroit imitating Gomer Pyle. Towards the end of the reading, it sounded like he needed to clear his throat. If you want to hear a stellar reading, try another James Lee Burke work \\"Purple Cane Road\\" read by Will Patton."},{"rating":"2","title":"ambush Valley book of the viet Nam war in 1967","review":"This a book about the Viet Nam war at the DMZ in 1967.This is mostly about the Marines and the danger that theyfaced daily.

This book is the answer . It is clear, well constructed and full of wisdom. And better than just helping you understand what you're dreams are telling you, it also tells you how to act on that information to change the things that aren't working in your life due to non-serving beliefs. This is real dream alchemy, enabling us all to find the gold in our lives through the wise and fascinating messages from our dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Let me start by saying that I rarely leave bad reviews, however I'm so unhappy about this I felt like I had to say something.I received the bar promptly, no complaints there. It looked fine. Then I weighed it. It weighs 28 lbs. For those of you inexperienced in these things, that's about 7 lbs lighter then it ordinarily should be. Naturally this led me to measure the length of the bar, which was 71.5\\" (instead of 72\\", that's not such a big deal). I have to assume that means that someone is cutting corners in the manufacturing of this bar. I haven't contacted the company regarding this, so I can't tell you how they would respond. My time is more valuable to me so I have no interest in shipping this bar back to them just to get a correct bar. I doubt I'll notice the difference anyway. Not that it makes it ok. Basically I just got ripped off, that's all, what can you do? I guess I'm doing what you can do, warn others.I strongly recommend you do not waste your money on this bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bar does weight 30.","review":"This really gets me angry.I saw the first review saying that it weighed 30 lbs. Thought maybe it could've been a simple mistake, and definitely thought it was a simple mistake after the seller (Big Fitness), said that it did in fact weigh 40 lbs.THE BAR WEIGHS 30LBS.I don't know how the company which is SELLING this can't even get a weight measurement right. I know most will say what's the big deal, but it grinds my gears that the sellers went ahead and 5 starred their product after another review gave the TRUE weight.It is a solid, well made bar, but it does weight 30 lbs, and the first guy to review is correct. I will be in contact with Big Fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversized sleeves","review":"I got this bar for my fiancee because she can't quite manage a 45-lb bar for many lifts. I wasn't expecting competition quality out of it, but I did think it reasonable to expect that standard 2\\" plates and spring clips would fit over the sleeves. About 50% of my plates that fit easily over my other three bars would not fit all the way or even fit at all. Trying to fit run-of-the-mill spring-clips was an absolute no-go. Some plates will go on, but it takes a rubber mallet to get them off, and flecks of chrome fly everywhere. We had to mark which plates will fit on this thing and had to buy Lock-Jaw collars ($$$) for it. We're hoping that over time enough metal will get scraped off the sleeves and the plates that this bar will not feel like a frustrating waste of money. Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good size and sturdy....but","review":"One problem.. the collars and sleeves have chrome that comes off when you put weight on them and remove weights from it...The sleeves scratched so easily by the 45lb weights that it is a common task to we wiping the silver dust off of the ends every time you load and unload it. It will get all over your hands... this bar would be ok if it was not covered in this cheap chrome."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!!!","review":"This is a forein made cheap bar. there is a 45 degree weld in the corner where the weight plates should sit tight against the collar.

The glowing pen and overall glow in the dark feature is a really big hit. I had fun drawing on it, too! I think the extra features you get with the glow bear are really worth the price difference.

Not only do you get a well-edited chronology of the season's key games (and plays), the the DVD takes you behind the scenes to see the other side of the story. I admit that I get emotional about our Bruins (just like the Red Sox)... and I found myself cheering plays that I'd already seen... the Bruins' 2011 season story is told that well. Even if you've memorized every play from every game, you'll still find yourself glued to your screen. We've waited a long time for this... and, like our Red Sox, the Bruins have justified our faith over the years.

Any ways, congratulations Boston, and their fans (including me), it has been a long wait, and a deserved Cup Championship.

I had to add a lot of oil to get any kind of sheeting which made the chocolate taste horrible. The second time, I spent a lot of money on professional fountain chocolate (Sephra brand) with a high cocoa butter content. The results weren't much better. It seems that there are two possible problems with the design of this fountain. Either the chocolate isn't kept hot enough or the auger doesn't \\"pump\\" fast enough. The melted chocolate seemed to be coming out of the top of the fountain very well. It looks runny enough and sheets down the top shaft nicely. But by the time it gets to the first \\"fall\\", it seems to be running way too slow to form a continuous sheet.

It is hard to level and get to flow properly (which is probably a common thing with these fountains). The biggest problem is the noise. I would compare it to about as loud as an electric mixer.

The heater doesn't keep the chocolate warm enough to keep it flowing properly. I wouldn't buy one of these again. I have just purchased a Sephra fountain. More money? Yes, about $200 EA, but they are a better grade. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The chocolate fountain came yesterday, and I am sending it back today. It looks terrific. The stainless steel finish is nice, seems very sturdy, not cheap-looking, etc. Everything was fine until I turned it on! The noise was ridiculous--a high-pitched \\"heee-aaah-heee-aaah\\" that just pulsates as the auger turns. I thought I might not have it leveled, so I fiddled with that, but no difference. I took off the auger and tower, and with just the motor turning all I got was this loud noise.

Well, it's been 10 months, and these bibs get frequent washings, and they've held up beautifully.

Anyway, I've been wanting to try some real pillow speakers and this one had pretty good reviews. Well, it works perfectly for me. Now I don't have to keep reaching under my pillow and moving the earphone every time I change position. I can hear clearly and there is no tin(niness) to the sound.

Pretty much unusuable. I opened up the pillow and discovered that the plastic coating that covers the wire to the actual speaker was worn away and the wire was getting thin-barely attached. Would cut in and out if moved even slightly. Looked like very cheap construction. Would not buy this product again. I was very careful with it at all times. Should not have worn out so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made but some difficult in use","review":"It is a good quality product. To listen thru the pillow takes a higher volume than I was comfortable with and moving your head can leave the sound behind.Under the pillow case only was better for me.

No worries about tossing and turning and pulling on the cable.Sound is fine - not high quality, but then I usually am just listening to meditation music or audio books to help me fall asleep.

This pillow speaker is unsatisfactory because it is very thick and the speakers have sharp edges,so you could never use it without the foam cover. However, the foam cover makes it even thicker and it becomes very uncomfortable to lie on under a pillow. After awhile my ears begin to hurt. I used it for a long time anyway until I found one that really works well, the C. Crane - Pillow Speaker PS2. It also comes with a soft cover on it, but it works best if you remove it from the cover as it makes the speaker much thinner instead of feeling like a lump under your pillow. Because the Crane speaker is saucer shaped and has no sharp edges you can remove the cover from the Crane version, and it is thin and smooth enough to be undetectable under a normal pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"great volume","review":"I keep this on under my pillow to listen to music without disturbing my husband.

My tinnitus gets really loud at night and I combine this device with my ipod touch, an app called Ambiance, and a guided imagery by Belleruth Naparstek called Healthful sleep.So how it works is I have the guided imagery in my ipod music library. The Ambiance app lets me pick what sounds I want to hear all night (i like crickets with LA traffic) and then the app lets me play the guided imagery over the cricket sounds. When the guided imagery is finished the crickets play on. It's perfect.So the pillowsonic is the speakers for my ipod and it goes either under my head or inside the pillow case.The volume is controlled by the ipod alone and depending how you like to sleep the volume doesn't always go loud enough. Also I'd be happy to pay more for a more comfortable padded cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Camping","review":"I purchased the Pillowsonic Stereo Pillow Speaker to use while camping, as I do not sleep well where it is too quiet.

I was able to get some decent sleep.I also used this once at home. My wife, who was only inches from me, could not hear the music.

But the speaker shouldn't have collapsed so easily, rendering that side useless. This was after the wires in the headphone jack loosened and rarely had a good connection - I used a rubberband for 3 months to keep it working and eventually had to replace the jack altogether. I loved these speakers but they just weren't as comfortable or durable as I would have wanted.I have since bought theSound Oasis Sleep Therapy Pillow Speakersand found the build quality to be superior; they're even more convenient because the left and right can be separated by as much as two feet.

They shipped and arrived very quickly but are dissapointing in their performance. After hooking the speakers up to both my computer and a portable CD player, I find that neither device can drive the speakers at sufficient volume to actually use the speakers underneath any normal pillow. If you put the speakers on top of your pillow and lay your head directly on them, then the volume would perhaps be adequate.

If I happen to wake up due to something else, I just wake him and ask him (gently) to fix his pillow. lolI bought him a new one this year because the cord got pulled out accidentally.

(The round speakers inside the pad are, of course, hard material.) When I put my ear (for comfort)in between the two hard speakers, I didn't hear much of anything.Hope it works better for you all. It probably works better with ''real'' music instead of my rain and thunder. But it's not my CD's fault either, because I can hear it very clearly with the I-pod's ear buds.

I finally attempted to try it as a waist pack but it was awkward and cumbersome to try to sit with it on- Imagine less so to get in to the car with the steering wheel and all.

While considered common in Europe, in the US, this was strongly beaten back.The book ends with speculations as to the future directions of welfare, especially under Republican administrations.

My older cars are fine since they don't have sensors in the intake lines. Mist a VERY THIN oil layer over the surface of the filter on the side that facing away from the intake then you will be fine. Also, misting the filter with too much oil will defeat the high flow feature of the filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you make $2 an hour","review":"If you make $2 an hour then it would worth to buy and use K&N; product.

Not only did it work, I would never know that this was not a brand new filter. This kit even took care of the other filter on my car which happened to be blue. The cleaner took everything off of the old material, including the old dye. Performance wise, my vehicle feels much better, similar to when I installed the fresh air intake.

The most difficult part of using it, is recoating the filter with oil, using squeeze bottle. I plan on trying to use a small atomizer spray bottle to apply it, when the time comes. You're trying to apply a light coat to the entire filter evenly. Maybe it could even be brushed on from a small disposable container."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"not too much of work as others put it. A Must have if you use their filter. One thing the instruction said at the end that both clean and dirty sides show red evenly. I dont think you would get red to show up evenly on the clean side while you only apply oil to the dirty side, unless you risk over-oil it. With the amount of recommended oil, probably can only get 20% of clean side to show up red."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item, but don't buy from D2Moto.

I don't know if I really prefer the squeeze bottle to the spray oil, as both work. The advantage is supposed to be that you are able to know how much oil your filter requires and can measure it out of the bottle. I've only used the kit once on the filter on my boat, which is the stock filter and I have no idea the amount of oil it is \\"supposed\\" to have, so I just applied it as instructed like you normally would. Good price on Amazon for the kit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This is much chepar than the one I purchased at the store. I recommend getting this item to save money. The spray works well getting into the filter and removing dirts and debris. It is absorbed into the filter so it can catch those fine dirt and contamination particles. You will spend money buing this initially but then you will save money over the long run by better performance and lifespan of your filter. You must remember to clean off the excess and you are good to continue until the next cleaning. This kit should last you a decedntly long time. If you purchase a filter by this company then this is a must have. You will at some point need to clean the filter and re-oil it so it wont leak."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"this stuff works great.

We wanted to like it but it just wasn't funny. Perhaps that had something to do with the facts this movie was based on. Prior to the film, a large number of animals had been killed by a poison gas leak nearby. Maybe that memory spoiled it.However, one local extra stole the show.

The guitarist sounds like he is playing the same song on every track of the cd. There is nothing appealing about the voice you hear from the singer. The drums are entirely unoriginal.

I got bogged down with all the poetry and prose quoted by the writer. While he brushes off the importance of the battle of Dien Bien Phu in a couple of lines; he drones on quoting (translating) obscure Vietnamese writers until the reader becomes weary. His premise seems to be that if you understand some writer (who he thinks is interesting) and attach importance to what he said then you will understand Vietnam. His annoying treatment of Yin and Yang finally caused me to put the book down and look for another way to understand Vietnam.

Despite its simplicity, it is actually a very philosophical book, raising many questions about the nature of humanity. Connla gets to see what it is like to live in a \\"perfect\\" land, but he also comes to appreciate the unique gifts that come with being human and being mortal. It also presents the best description I have ever read of what the Sidhe, or fairies, are like, how they live in the moment because their lives are so long that they have little use for memory, and how they are not really capable of feeling love as humans do.

There is no way you can keep the ice pack solid unless you travel with the portable freezer (not cooler). So by the time I got to the dog show site, the ice pack was just liquid, and I only used the fan.I have a car with a good working AC, so what is this cooling system for when it can last only 5 minutes??

Right now I am having a lot if difficulty zeroing it in, and this is not the first time in such task.My recommendation is to pay at least 10 to 15 more dollars and buy a better scope. The glass is way cheap, I mean the quality, and feels I am looking through a straw. Adjustments is too hard as well.The good thing is it is a small tactical scope, the pictures makes it look bigger.

Not to give the wrong impression, but Darren does use the \\"f\\" word once and it totally fits with the grittier style of music that he has written and recorded on \\"The Tension and The Spark\\", but this song is more like a \\"pop\\" song compared to some of his darker music on \\"The Tension and the Spark\\". This single is worth getting not only for \\"Random Blinking Light\\" (I think I've listened to it more than 10 times a day), but also for the videos that many of us never get to see on our local music station channels.When you listen, open your ears and your mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSIDE THE BOX","review":"I'm not going to say names or endorse bands, but I will say Tub Ring is one of only a few bands to really start to change music\\"as I prefer it\\" DIFFERENT!!! this is a cd for anyone that is sick of corprate air play.Just buy it already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away","review":"Ok, I go to school at the U. of Missouri in Columbia, and I was going to a show by a local band that I am friends with.

I mean, I just don't like them. I gave them a chance. I really did. But after a while I had to face the fact that I couldn't take them anymore.It's not the worst thing I've heard. There was a WSP album I had to listen to nonstop one time because I lost a bet. That was pretty bad. And I'm not comparing these guys to WSP.

It's fairly easy to get into within a couple listens and continues to grow on you. The organ and keyboard work is extremly impressive on this album, almost better than some of the stuff Mike Pattons projects have done with it.

Back then their latest album was \\"Super Sci-Fi Samauri Rock Star Ultra Turbo II ver. 3.6,\\" which is unfortunately hard to find these days. Even then they were blowing people away with their tight arrangements, schitzophrenic style, syncopated rhythms, hillarous lyrics, and pure joyous energy.This album takes all of that and accelerates it to light speed.The best example is the track \\"Numbers,\\" which starts off sounding sentimental and poppy, dropping briefly into the ... son of grindcore before floating back into sentimental and poppy. It's not an experience for the uninitiated; but if you open your mind just a little, the experience is as intense as anything you've heard before. There isn't a single track on this album that [is bad]. In fact, the only bad thing I have to say about this album is that the band doesn't tour on the West Coast.

A Great Boook for Fans of Ulys","review":"I finally bought this book of which I'd hear so much and I was not disappointed. For those of you who enjoy true romances, here is a real life romance of the highest and most passionate order. As a scholar of the Victorian era in the United States, most women of that era did not write like Julia Dent Grant, or express themselves in such tones. Her great love and attraction for her 'hero husband' is made evident throughout and in a most delightful way. The faults of the book are that she concentrates a little too much on their trip after he left the Presidency, and also I would have liked to have heard more about the Presidency itself. She rather glosses over that. Of course she is partial for her husband and makes plain they enjoyed each other thoroughly in wartime, peactime and in the bedroom.

While I'll happily give this 5-star accolades, I just want to point out that Wayne Everett (Lassie Foundation) is sorely missed on this record. There was a complex, intuitive elegance to his drumming that added an extra something to previous Starflyer albums, especially EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES, which is replaced here with a more conventional but nonetheless effectively steady beat (which maybe is what Martin was after).

Now, if this cd was done by other well-respected and established punk bands like Pennywise, Good Riddance, Strung Out, etc. this would be an interesting cd to listen to.

All the stories have a dark element of horror or creepiness. You have spirit possessed spaceships, corpses being animated and used for manual labor, aliens hosting on humans in the guise of gods, etc...This is not hard sci-fi, which is exactly why I like it.

There are other thermometers out there for about $15 that will read in 10 seconds so I wouldn't waste $39 on this Extech thing again. This is a bad, cheap knock-off that is obviously designed by Extech to appear to be the Thermapen. In reality, it's worth about $15 and they're scamming you $40 because it looks like the Thermapen.

The book is repetitive and for a topic that begs the use of graphical illustrations it falls short with only two on pages 135 and 153. The author is clearly knowledgeable about information technology but seems to try too hard to make the book funny and oversimplifies many of the analogues examples.

And the thesis about Collins' death, which is a major point of the book, is more than a little improbable.

From the simple and early dynamical theory of Ewald to how electromagnetic radiation propagates and scatters in a crystal. Then there are discussions of dynamical theory of planar-wave Bragg scattering, And further talk on more advanced theories. Like how a spherical wave might scatter.Then many examples of applications are gone into, like building out X-ray optics, to be on an equivalent functional par with conventional visible spectrum optics. Much of the X-ray optical capability, like building monochromator crystals, X-ray wave guides, multilayers and Fresnel zone plates, is of relatively recent vintage; like the last 20 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek, The Motionless Picture","review":"Star Trek The Motion Picture came out as the first new Star Trek in ten years.

While perhaps not technical enough for all applications, it's nice to finally see many of these issues discussed in one volume, instead of spread throughout many different journals and texts. The climate of such planets is covered of course, but the addition of topics such as how stellar evolution influences the habitable zone (how long is the habitable zone habitable, for instance), the implications of high planetary obliquity, and atmospheric collapse of tidally locked planets round out the presentation.

I think the slipperyness is also exaggerated. I've used it for four practices and I only slipped (and very little) in the first practice. But I sweat a lot, so that might have helped \\"condition\\" the surface.The only issue for me was that my feet skid sometimes during the ashtanga jump-through (OK every time -- I'm working on it), and at first the rubber made my feet a little raw.

My feet, forearms, etc. however, seem to be glued to it during practice, which makes jumping and balance poses so much more enjoyable. It's dense enough to practice on wooden floors without having to double it up and it doesn't get slippery when I sweat (I'm a very productive sweater...). There is a little bit of a rubber smell, but not the chemical stuff other mats have.

It's certainly bigger than other mats which will give you more space if you're practicing in class. Frankly, that's the only recommendation I have for this product.Of course, I liked the idea that it was eco-friendly; so, now I'm researching ways to recycle my old mats.
