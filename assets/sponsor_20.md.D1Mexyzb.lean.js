This book had unexpected heroes, great disasters, and even humor (the X-rated video tape scenario). The only problem I had with the story, is that I felt it would have been nice to even hint at, if not fully address, some of the issues that are left at the end. For example, how deeply is the world governmental balance changed due to the aliens' attack?

It's fairly long, involving, and complex, but that doesn't seem to be a problem here. By complex, I refer specifically to the fact that there are several different story lines, and a slew of characters that can, at times, be a bit confusing and tiresome. It's no classic, and it's not as good as other Niven-Pournelle books, but it holds its own.

The book made me stop reading Niven & Pournelle collaborations for a while though. I found the Heroic SF Writers to be way to irritating. They knew everything, more than scientists and more than the military. Basically, they knew more about anything than anyone else. There instant knowledge of all things, and their seeming ability to read each others thoughts made the protagonists too unbelievable. I thought it was very self indulgent. I liked the premise though and everything else was good. I just wished that they could have kept the gratuitous SF Writers as Omniscient Beings theme down."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultimately a let down","review":"I love the 'alien invasion' genre. I read this book waiting for all the threads and story-lines to wrap up in a nice satisfying package. I was dissapointed. As other reviewers have said, there are a lot of extraneous characters. And how the hell does Harry Red get himself insterted throughout the entire storyline? The book could have been reduced by 20 to 30% by eliminating some of the unneccessary characters and sub-plots.And then you have the elephantine aliens. The book I had included a page of art depicting the aliens. They weren't elephant-like, they were elephants! I was waiting for some point in the story for the reason or 'link' between the aliens and earth elephants. Why were they so similar in appearance? What was their link? How are they related? I waited patiently for this part of the plot to evolve. It never did. We never find out. You cannot explain this by parallel evolution, but the authors never bother to explain their relationship.And the ending just sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many carboard cutouts","review":"I closed the book half way through when I had to admit I didn't care what happened to anyone in it. I know it's the accepted way to write a novel skimming over dozens of unimportant and unlikable characters, but I, for one, prefer a few characters portrayed with depth to many cardboard cutouts shuffled about rapidly in an attempt to substitute sleight of hand for substance.

Elephant-like aliens come to conquer earth, using paragliders. Riiiiiight. This is one of the worst Niven-Pournelle books. There are no mind-stretching ideas here as in \\"The Mote in God's Eye\\" or \\"Inferno\\". The aliens are laughable. N&P politics are again a major issue - this time, pro-nuclear-testing-in-space is the theme of the day. As usual most of the characters are modeled after N&P's real-life friends, but they don't sem to have gained any new friends since they wrote \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\", so prepare yourself for the same characters with new names.For me, this is the book that turned me off Niven. I'd advise you to read his previous books - but keep away from anything written after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT FELL A LITTLE FLAT","review":"Footfall is another ambitious attempt by the team of Niven and Pournelle. The formula, previously used in Lucifer's Hammer, is an apocalyptic event with a huge cast of characters drawn on a relatively limited canvas. While Lucifer's Hammer mostly succeeded, Footfall mostly fails. While I admire the conceptions of this novel, the execution left too much to be desired. Only a handful of the dozens of characters are even somewhat compelling. The invaders mindset is brilliant, but the communication of the aliens motivations and goals is tedious and difficult to understand. Harry Red is fun up to a point but he turns into Uncle Joe from Petticoat Junction showing up in the cast of Alien. Everything in this book is either too much or not enough. Too many characters, not enough information revealed. Too much action, not enough payoff. There were several chapters where I just felt lost.In fact, after a while, I just didn't give a Fithp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, A True Original Classic","review":"FootfallWhat the writers took away from the human characters, they poured into their aliens. Cruel, dignified, clueless and cunning, utterly communal creatures changing from their exposure to the human race. I have to admit that I cringed when the aliens first make their appearance -- basically elephants using low-tech bullet rifles. But they end up becoming the best part of the book, their final decision attesting to their dignified commitment to the \\"herd.\\"I'm not a sci-fi regular, and you don't need to be one either to be moved by this outstanding study of a truly alien society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"I quit reading SF in the early 70s.

Yes, the beginning is very BORING and very hard to read - the plot jumps between 10 different characters every 2-3 pages! As a literary work, this book is a disappoitment. However, most of the SCI-FI aspect is decent (except the part where the sci-fi writers are made top advisors to the government). I wouldn't recomment it, instead read the Ringworld series, it's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not quite how I remembered it","review":"I read this book as a teenager and thought it was pretty cool. 20 years have passed and I thought I'd give it another read. And I have to say, that I really didn't like it all that much. The book doesn't really seem to be focused on an event or a character. Instead the author introduces a slew of characters that you neither care about nor are they really tracked through the story. And the few characters that recur enough to remember them, are really cardboard constructs rather than something you'd relate to.As far as the main plot goes, it got off to a very slow start. It tries to pick up a little bit in the middle and will leave you with a half-finished feeling. I'm a fan of the aliens invading earth premise but this was just a disappointment.

After skimming through the reviews of the book, especally the negitive ones I felt like writing my own review. First off, yes, the book does have it's quirks for a Sci-Fi novel - Such as the Scifi writers working as presidential advisors who spent most of book admiring the effectivness of the alien invasion and also having the earth invaded by \\"commie elephants\\" (snicker..). However, the book was still a excellent read and I felt the ending was more than worth waiting for.

Some of the various seams between the wooden pieces in the cutting board had large open gaps while others exposed wood glue that had leaked out and dried. It also appeared as though during manufacturing some gaps in the wood were filled with glue or sealant, creating an unsightly blemish on the item. Even more noticeable were 1/2-inch areas located in various spots around both sides of the cutting block that appeared to be rough or un-sanded/unfinished exposed wood.

David takes you through the different \\"data munging\\" tasks ( record oriented data ? binary data ? fixed-width data ? XML ? ) and shows you his proper ways of dealing with them ( or, at least, thinking about them ). It's not an encyclopedia of \\"data munging\\", the book is 300 pages and many of them ( too many, may be ) are detailed descriptions of useful CPAN modules ( which I wasn't reading as careful as the rest of the book, since POD was always enough ), so it covers only a usual data processing tasks letting you to go deeper by yourself for more advanced topics. After you'll finish it much less \\"data sources\\" will scare you - the solutions and references are inside.As I said, it may be good for data-processing beginners, but Perl experts will hardly find lot's of new information in it.P.S. I trust him and therefore follow his advices in every script I start to think of ( especially the one about \\"UNIX filter model\\" )."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Cross is usually funnier.","review":"David Cross, star of stage and screen, is normally hilarious. And with a title like that, I was sure that 'Munging' was some hilarious indie slang for something disturbing. Alas, page after page I turned hoping for a witty anecdote, but none came. I never even figured out who the main character 'Perl' was supposed to be. Was she some sort of computer / robot? Why does everyone want to Mung her?

I work with XML a great deal (as well as relational databases), but the author's coverage of XML is week (2 pages on the DOM)-- and no coverage of dealing with record sets. This is a good text if you have reams of old fashioned columnar data that you need to text process. Hmm, I did that 7 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference for the microarray lab","review":"The topic of microarray image analysis has always been on the backburner.

They have a whole episode with Seina shopping for lude stuff from lingerie to sex toys for NB. Needless to say not for kids. No, it's not hentai; it's just really, really funny.

The Kyrie flows as gently and caressingly as a loving whisper which culminates in a suitable outburst of pure joy. There is a terrific cushion of melody that Berlioz employs in the Gloria & Gratias. Both versions of the Resurrexit included on this disc are stellar and recall my favorite passages from the Requiem.

I gave this LP 2 stars because I expected some of the music to have energy and enthusiasm. Boy, was I wrong. This record ventures down the 'quiet storm' corridor without turning left or right, and without going up or down. Fans of smooth jazz will dig this, fans of the early Winans records may not. From 'Paradise' to 'Prone to Wander' the mood rarely peaks above mellow. Their remake of 'The Question Is', for lack of a nicer word, is just plain disappointing. Maybe the Winans were simply and reluctantly trying to fulfill a contractual obligation to their record company.

Oelze's technique is almost flawless (sometimes her pronunciation is a bit unclear - but that does not disturb the general effect), her expression enchanting (providing the listeners with sparkling, but also very tender moments).

The graphics are EXACTLY the same. The story line is also a little hard to follow because of this. You go from level to level doing something different.

The inflatable piece wouldn't blow up like it was supposed to and the legs were very wobaly. Returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for newborns","review":"We bought this tub for grandma's house and were really disappointed with it. The plus is that it folds up nicely. However, the legs kept folding under when moved after each use and needed to be fixed before using it again. Our son is 4 months old and kept sliding down the tub. I would not recommend this for a young baby, as it took two people to give a bath - one person to hold the baby in place, the other to do the bathing. I felt as though my baby was unsafe in this tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and compact","review":"We've had this tub for two and half years now, and have used it almost every day with our son (now two and a half) and our daughter (nine months). It's very durable, and quick and easy to fold once you figure out the tricks. You can fold it while it's inflated which makes it much more useful. The only problem is that it's not good for newborns, because the bottom is slick and the recline doesn't give enough support, plus it's a very large tub. Once kids can sit up with some assistance from a parent or lean against the side of the tub, it's great. My toddler (35\\" tall, 35 pounds) can fit comfortably in it and still have room to splash with his toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tub for the price!","review":"I bought this for my 2nd child. We were planning a cross-country move a few weeks after her birth so I needed a tub I could travel with. I love the fact that the back and bottom are inflatable providing a little extra cushion for baby's tushie and I also love that I can bring one end up to lay her down. It takes 2 seconds to fill up and I can empty it without fear of spilling water everywhere with the closable hole in the bottom. It dries quickly and all I need is a clorox wipe to keep it clean. My daughter is now 7.5 months old and pushing 20lbs. She has almost outgrown it and I will miss not having the convenience of a bath I can put on a counter and stand up to bath my baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easily foldable","review":"I've bought this tub thinking that I can just fold it up and store it under the sink. But that's not how it works. It take many steps to fold and unfold it, one of them ivolves inflating the seat! The mechanism for snapping it in place when it's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times. Also, the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things, probably not very pleasant for a little baby. I am returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tub blows.","review":"I must say, this was-without a doubt- the biggest waste of money. We haven't been able to inflate the tub, and it's not for lack of trying. The legs are not sturdy, our baby slides around in this tub, and it does not exactly fold easily to compact dimensions. If you're cramped for space and live say, in a box, then this tub is for you. If you have enough room to walk around in your bathroom, then just invest in a regular tub and save yourself the backache of trying to figure out where to stow this widget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Baby Tub Ever","review":"This bath tub is the absolute worst. It is hard to fold, unfold, blow up, and bathe a child in! What is it good for? Nothing! My baby slid all over the place in the tub. The \\"incline\\" for the seat is not an incline at all. It's almost the same as laying it down fully. I would not reccommend this product to anyone. I am returning it immediatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality","review":"I just purchased this tub today after my daughter outgrew her newborn tub. What a disappointment this product is. I agree with the reviewer that this is not \\"easily foldable\\" as it says on the box. There are way too many steps involved to fold and unfold the tub. Also the plastic fasteners are so cheaply made that I doubt this would last more than a month. Also, my daughter was not well contained in this tub and slid all over the place even as I was holding on tightly to her. I do not recommend this tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS TUB","review":"I bought this thinking that it would be helpful since we don't have much room in our bathroom. My daughter slides all around in it and it is very dangerous. The legs are wobbly and dangerous. The valve that is made to drain the water leaks constantly. This is the worst baby tub I have ever seen or used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water leaked everywhere!","review":"I typically don't write reviews, but I felt it necessary to do so in this case. I bathe my newborn (6 weeks old) son in this tub on the kitchen table. I've used this about 5 times, with the 5th being the last. The plug came open and leaked ALL of the water onto the table and floor. I thought maybe my son had accidentally knocked the plug out, so I tried it again. No luck, the plug came undone again and doesn't stay closed anymore. Also, this tub is not newborn/infant friendly-I had to have my husband hold my son while I washed him because he would slide around so much in the tub. It was also very difficult to inflate (unfortunately, I had to do it the old fashioned way as I don't have a pump)! I honestly don't have anything positive to say about this tub. Don't buy it! I had to rate this 1 star, I wanted to rate it 0 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for newborns","review":"I was looking for something that I could use from newborn to toddler and only found disappointment. The legs do not lock into place and a newborn (or any child) can accidentally knock the drain plug out with ease. Perhaps the legs will stay in place when you fill the basin up for a toddler or small child. Definitely not for everyday use. Considering recycling into something better rather than donating it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"If I could give this a 0 rating I would. This bathtub is completely worthless. It is a fold away tub... but in order to do so, you would have to deflate the tub. Not sure that I would want to inflate a tub every night with a 4 months old and a 2 yr old running around. So the tub ends up taking up alot of room in a bathroom where there is none. The tub is also not supportive for younger infants. I use a bear sponge; but it ends up sinking into the tub. The plug that holds the water in, never stays plugged which is really annoying. I am too cheap to go and buy another tub, so this will have to do until he is able to sit up on his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay when they are little","review":"I received this bath as a gift and was excited. However there are a few problems with it that would make me not want to purchase it. 1st, it is very slick and he is constantly sliding down the inclined side of the tub. Which just means you have to hold him the whole time, which can be very awkward because of where the sides are. 2nd, as he has gotten bigger (almost 4 months) he is too long for the tub (about 24 inches) he can no longer splash around and looks very uncomfortable. I would imagine when he masters sitting the tub will work okay again, but by then we can just use the big tub. It will help when traveling though. So to conclude it works, but I think there are better buys out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it and replaced it for a","review":"I've used this tub when my son was first born. The main reason why we bought it was to save space, but what we found is it really didn't save all that much space. I also found that is was not very sturdy to hold my son up because he kept slipping down on the tubular bottom. I found that I needed to use two hands to keep him safe in the tub, therefore had troubles washing him because I could not hold him sturdy with one hand and wash him with the other. It does not have a little compartment to hold your shampoo and soap, so you have to reach outside the tub and turn your head away from the baby. We switched to the First Years Sure Comfort Newborn to Toddler Tub and my son was better supported and has a great time splashing away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for newborns, and not great for anyone","review":"Do not buy this bathtub. Despite saying \\"newborn-to-toddler\\", it is absolutely NOT safe for a baby that cannot comfortably sit up unassisted. When reclined, it is not actually very reclined, and there is no bump for the baby to sit on to keep from sliding down. Furthermore, there is no friction between the baby and the tub.Also, it's flimsy, and the legs snap off a little too easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not stable - not recommended","review":"Both my daughter and I have tried to use this a couple of times to bathe her newborn. We are both uncomfortable with the instability of it. The legs do not lock in well and I feel like it's going to collapse under the baby. If baby would be perfectly still and I would not bump the sides at all, it would probably work - so it's useless. I am going to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe","review":"I bought this to use with my 2 month old. I tried it the first night with one side inclined but he was slipping around in it. The second night I tried it with both sides inclined, thinking maybe this would help him to stay in place, but no such luck. Not only would he slip down into the water as there is little to no support, it also tends to push him off to the side. I'll be returning this today. I have to say that I am rather disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traumatizing for baby","review":"We tried this tub once and immediately returned it. The foldaway idea is great but the product itself was terrible.- the legs don't easily snap in and out of place.- the inflatable inside would not stay level. It tilted to one side and tried to dump my baby on his face.- the plastic is cold. We poured hot water over it to warm it up but it immediately cooled down again. It was a huge shock against the baby's skin and resulted in a shrieking baby.The whole experience was a nightmare and I would not recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsafe tub for a newborn","review":"I do not recommend this product for a newborn. It is unsafe, as it is too large and slippery for a newborn. If you are not holding your infant with both hands, they will slip around in the tub too much, and potentially have their head slip into the water in the water in the tub. There is no way you could safely bathe a newborn without two people on the job using this bathtub. If you're looking for a bathtub that you can easily and safely use for newborns, I recommend one with an infant sling. The sling cradles the baby and prevents them from slipping, keeping one or both of your hands free for washing the baby. This product will be returned, and I highly caution any parents against purchasing this product, given the safety issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe product","review":"This bath was very unsafe for my newborn. It is very difficult to wash them in this tub. You almost have to hold them with 2 hands which makes it difficult to wash them. I liked the idea that you could fold it away when you were done but it was too difficult to fold so I didn't do it. There are two clips at each end in the center of the tub and it made the are where the baby lays uneven and if you don't hold them they can roll to the side. There is no support like in other tubs I have seen to keep them from slipping down either. I plan on returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"After one use a seam broke on the liner creating a large imbalance.

There are only a few stencils in the back of the book and they are all in full color with printing on both sides of the page so there would be no way to use the stencils out of the book. You could photocopy them for use but there are only about 10 pages of real stencil designs the rest are front and back fairly intricate artwork that would be not good for stenciling, but they make great little pictures for frames, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book includes beautiful designs, I love Art Nouveau and I chosed this book because I am doing a ceramic course, I found in it great ideas to make plates and vases.

This is one of the stories of Ms. Howard that you won't want to miss. The story was full of fun, adventure, danger, and a lot more. There were steamy sex scenes between the hero and heroine; gun flights between good guys and bad guys; the mysteries of the lost city, etc. It was so well written that I felt like I were the one with Ben and Jillian when I read through the chapters! Heart of Fire is a highly recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly entertaining","review":"Like most of her other books, this one conveys mystery, action, and romance. The journey of a lifetime--the discovery of love and the realization of what is trully valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRY THIS ONE, TOO","review":"I've already reviewed this book, but I notice it has just been released again. Needless to say, it's great. We are talking about Linda Howard! If you have already read this one, or read it recently and enjoyed it - try GLENNA MCREYNOLD's \\"RIVER OF EDEN.\\" You are guaranteed to love it. Promise. Check out the storyline synopsis and reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, entertaining book for a stay at home day.","review":"I believe that this book was very well written. It keep the reader coming back for more. I was not able to put this book down, and even had to go and buy my own copy. The woman in this book was so strong in everyway, i really enjoyed the banter between here and the hero. You could not have asked for a better hero, he was sexy smart and very male. Great book for anyone that enjoys romance at its best, even in the Amazon jungle (which I believe made this book even better than regular setting.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of Fire","review":"I have just recently began reading Linda Howard novel's. I've read several of her books and enjoyed them a great deal. When I first read the review for \\"Heart of Fire\\" I thought that the storyline was a little far fetched. But, I decided to read it anyhow. I was glad that I did. I couldn't put this book down. It turned out to be one of the best books that I've read by Ms. Howard thus far. Keep up the good work Linda!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at Best","review":"One of Howards earlier books ('97) this is not in the same league as her more current titles such as Now You See Her ('99).I thought both the story-line and the characters where weak, the only thing compensating the story where the infrequent references to the myths of the Amazon.This book will be heading to the second-hand store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy & funny. One of Linda Howard's best!","review":"Out of all Linda Howard books that I've read (& I've read at least 20 of her books) this in my opinion is one of her best.Jillian is smart, courageous, driven & doesn't put up with Bens crap.Ben is tough, sexy, funny & outrageous at times but always protective of Jillian whether they are getting along or not. Neither one of them holds grudges or is mean to the other even when they do fight.The sensual build up is great & when they finally get together it's hot & sexy!The snappy dialogue is great & seeing how Ben takes care of Jillian makes him even sexier. If read just one Linda Howard book make it this one or Mr Perfect"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of Fire","review":"As always I truly enjoy Linda Howard's books. Heart of Fire did not disappoint. Information regarding the Amazon was interesting and accurate which is always a plus.

A MUST HAVE MOVIE","review":"I think this is a must-have, must-watch movie. It shows what the real meaning of Christmas is and how we can show others how they can enjoy the Christmas season. I purchased 2 so I can pass them around and encourage families to watch it together and talk about what they can do to share the true meaning of Christmas. Get one - you will not be disappointed.ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"This is a movie I would recommend if you are looking for a Christmas movie with a Christian theme. I really enjoyed it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't quite make the 5 Star rating ~","review":"I liked this show and it will remain in my \\"30 days of Christmas\\" line up for the following years. It did not get the 5 stars, only due to the fact the ending felt rushed and it was not played out as much as this great storyline could have been. Saying that, it gives the viewer an excellent concept of what really is Christmas about, and if the \\"powers that be\\" do remove signs, titles, nativities, etc... from \\"Christmas\\" does this really ruin it? The movie suggests these are just traditions, but no one can take the real meaning which is the gift of love that was given to us, at His birth and sharing it thru giving of ourselves and caring for \\"people\\" more than caring for the \\"traditions\\" that we once held dear. It is the true concept of Christmas, not played out by lights, statues and \\"things\\" but in fact loving the un-lovely the \\"one sheep\\" that has gone astray and reaching out in whatever way you can to show love and ....well, \\"Christmas\\" to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"a worthwhile Christmas flick","review":"Let's admit it, good Christian films are hard to come by. Especially ones that aren't corny with awful acting. This one is a keeper! Yes, in the first half hour or so the acting is a little shaky, but it evens out. I love hearing Jesus' name spoken reverently on screen, and this one did a good job of that also. The ending maybe was a little far-fetched (where did the neighbors get all their pies and gifts if they were just sitting at a Christmas program ten minutes ago?) but aren't most Christmas movies more about the 'feel good' aspect than reality? I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean movie","review":"This is a clean movie. Not believable, but a clean Christmas movie. The scenery is great. I like the lead characters and they do a great acting job. The end is a little suprising, but nice. I would recommend it only because of the characters and even though the story is not what a Christmas story is about, Christmas with a capitol C is explained by the lead female actress. That is one thing that is great about the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Believe in Christ in Christmas!","review":"I enjoyed the movie - the plot is typical in this form of show. Good overcomes bad with Christ's love. This is a message we need to get out much more often. Christ's love and forgiveness - we need to follow His example. Good job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a believable story","review":"I enjoy movies with an unrestrained Christian message, but they need to be believable. This is not. It is a typical, independent film that is focused on the message at the expense of a believable plot. Hardly anything in it could really happen, especially in a small, tight-knit community as in the setting. Order it from Netflix if you must; it's certainly not worth purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Christmas DVD ever!","review":"First of all the DVD didn't play right it was all scrambled up, then when we did get a clear picture it had sub-titles, so I knew what they were going to say before they said it! What little I did watch of this movie I did NOT see what the other people who reviewed it saw. The main reason I purchased it was because the reviews were so good. Sorry but for me it was the worst christmas movie I've seen yet and I would NOT recommend it. The one good thing is amazon was great when I wanted to return it, so glad I purchased it from them! Thanks again amazon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY","review":"Finally, a movie that cuts through all the emotion of the church state debate. If you want to find out what Christianity really looks like, I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Okay, so we forgot and didn't watch this until well after Christmas yet that didn't matter. This is an excellent movie, pointing out the pros and cons of the current day battle over Christmas. A very engaging movie with actors who did a great job! It was great to see Brad Stine as an actor, and interject some of his humor and passion into this movie. Certainly worth your time to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"It really helped me to realize that those who are sometimes most antaganistic toward the \\"religious\\" side of Christmas are those who might be the ones who might be hurting the most and the one who call themselves Christians sometimes find themselves challengenged the most as to what and how they are living there \\"Christianity\\".This movie is an excellant example of True Christmas blended with Christ at the forefront and NOT beight antagonistic toward others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas with a Capital C","review":"Very good family movie. Showing what we can do if we all pull together in our beliefs and stick with them. Will be shareing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE","review":"The movie should be owned by everyone that believes in the true meaning of Christmas. America stands for exactly what this movie protrays. I watch this movie threw out the year and I must watch it about 25 times and that's before the Christmas season begins. My Grandchildren watch it with me because I try to instill Christianity and the real meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A riveting biography of a complex politician.","review":"Walth chronicles the life and times of Oregon's most sacred politician. Tom McCall was an outspoken conservationist who pushed his agenda with honor. Yet he had personal failings -- a drinking problem, a drug-addicted son -- that Walth didn't sidestep, but instead presented tastefully. This is a top-notch political biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oregonians Explained","review":"I am a Native Oregonian living on the east coast and this book helped me understand why I feel like a fish out of water in the midst of uncontrolled suburban sprawl, minimal recycling facilities, and chemical pollution violations are repeatedly ignored by local politicians.Mr. Walth's book was exciting to read. I recommend it to anyone seeking to understand Oregonians and why we're so proud of the place we call home. Brent Walth tells the story of how Tom McCall gave us that pride."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is small, but works well","review":"I bought one each of the 1000, 2000, and 3000 series boxes. This one is pretty small. I'm not sure I'll use it as much as the other two bigger boxes. My wallet, though slim, will not fit in here. iPhone is much too big for this case. Keys and credit cards are about all I can imagine using this for. Anything electronic will likely need to go in at least the next size up.Other than the size, this is a nice little case that is indeed waterproof. I tested this one in the sink prior to using and it held up wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"1000\\" seems like a big number","review":"I should have checked the dimensions before ordering this. It is big enough to accommodate a typical cell phone, or a voice recorder with a set of spare batteries, but that's about it.On the other hand, the durability of this case is definitely not in question. I would trust it to keep delicate electronics completely dry and undamaged. In summary, it is not going to be my last OtterBox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a little bit challenging to open","review":"Received the product prompt. Works well, waterproof but a little tricky to open. Fastens really tight but I guess that's why it waterproof. Overall, good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Look at Tarkington","review":"After Tarkington's death, his nephews gathered some of his letters that he had written between 1903 and 1904 and published them in a book. The letters detail Tarkington's impression of his first visit to Europe. Along with the letters are some crude sketches that Tarkington used to illustrate what he saw.The letters reveal the personality of Tarkington. In many ways, the characters he wrote about in his novels were similar to himself or his family members. He seemed to have a good nature about him and looked upon the adversities of traveling in Europe with an amiable mind. Most of the letters were funny, however, they also talk about historical sites, many of which have been destroyed by the two world wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the investment","review":"Ms. Aliberti, the soprano in this recording, is unsuited for the role. The voice is hard, lacking in any sense of bel canto style, and lacks flexibility. The other singers are adequate though nothing special. I would not recommend this recording, it is unsatisfying and misrepresents what is a wonderful opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound but a Disappointing Soprano","review":"I found Ms. Aliberti's voice thin and her interpretation of the role fairly inexpressive-little Bellinean passion. Caballe is still the choice for this opera- a great artist and a big beautiful voice. Callas, with mediocre sound on her CD, gives the most dramatic performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it, this is Bellini at his worst.","review":"This recording has Aliberti singing the part of Imogene, and it is not good. Listen to Caballe , Callas, or Renee Fleming and you will see.I cannot believe this was even released. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"they should have hanged this pirate","review":"alibertis'voice is beyond discription, with one exception.

It also was delivered only one week after I placed my order which I was thrilled about. My only complaint was the cost of the freight. According to this website it states the weight is 84.9Lbs, but the actual weight according to the fedex label and tracking was 41Lbs. Based on the rate listed here it is $.99/Lb and I was charged based on 84.9Lbs not 41. I sent a message to the seller which they replied to, but when I questioned again I have received no reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 AAA Batteries!!!","review":"I thought that 6 AAA batteries would give this blender some power. I suggest that you get a regular cup shaker and stick a spoon in it. The plastic wand is not very strong and you will not get anything mixed any different than if you shook the cotainer real hard. I would send it back but the cup size is a good size. My protein shake was not blended well. I had to get a spoon and shake it even after using the blender wand. It will not work if you have crushed ice in it. This product did not meet advertised expectations. Also, since batteries do not last long, I would have gone through alot of batteries to mix my shakes. This would eventually be an expensive shake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tread falls off","review":"I purchased these shoes, the Montrail Odyssey (mens) on June 22nd 2007. Today, July 6th 2007 (2 weeks later) a chunk of tread fell off under the ball of the foot. And I never even ran in these shoes, just walked. I specifically wore them lightly because after I purchased them I came home and read customer reviews stating that their tread had come off after running on trails. I'm here to tell you that those reviews, still there for viewing over at Zappos, were from a year ago (the summer of 2006) and Montrail is still selling the same defective design where the glued-on tread falls off in big chunks in as soon as two weeks of light wear.Other than that they are comfortable shoes.

I think that the simulation was basically useless because there was entirely too much guesswork involved. There is no mention of what type of product is being manufactured, only that is made out of plastic. When making decisions such as how much to invest in product quality it would have helped quite a bit to know the specific type of product being produced. For example, quality is for more important when producing laptop computer cases than when producing toy army men. I think that the lack of specific information concerning the product and the market are the downfall of this book. The simulation would have been far more enjoyable and beneficial if informed decisions could be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"I got this video used and we really liked it. It has \\"Radar\\", from Mash, (can't think of name), reciting poetry about different animals, great classical music, with the musicians shown playing their instruments and great footage of animals in the zoo, dinosaur bones in a museum, etc. Lots of real footage of kids and adults and animals. I'd recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russia's Best!","review":"This is by far the most breathtaking interpretation of the Songs and Dances of Death by Mussorgsky you will ever hear! I have seen Hvorostovsky in concert twice and always yearn for more. His voice is just as incredible live. Every single aria on this disc is a jewell. You can feel the pathos and the agony of the Demon, the heartwrenching jelousy of Aleko, and the joyous abandonment of the singer in Nero. Hvorostovsky's voice is just as outstanding as Ghiurov's in his prime.The choice of repertoire and Dmitri's interpretation makes this CD a must for those wishing to explore Russian opera. His impressive range allows him to sing at ease in both the baritone and bass tessitura. He will no doubt make an exciting Scarpia and an unforgettable Mephistophele (both Gounod's and Boito's)someday. I hope he considers these roles in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CrossFit Ready!","review":"My CrossFit trainer recommended this for me after about 6 months of training with the ones at our gym.

I even had my materials scientist husband look at them and he confirmed they were not cast iron. The reason why it is better to have cast iron is because the iron holds the heat better when you are heating the irons in the oil and when you dip them in the batter the batter will cook onto the iron because it is so hot. Because these were aluminum when dipping the iron into the batter, the batter didn't stick as well because it was not as hot. Hence, very thin pretzels.I tried these anyway. They were ok, but cast iron ones are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad bad","review":"This is my first bad review ever, this item is just horrible.

I suppose if you write on something big, like a poster, they might work, but NOT for ordinary sizes. Even on letter size they are worthless because the points are so soft that when you try to write each individual letter its like trying to write with a paint brush!

I was somewhat disappointed only because the story turned out to be somewhat predictable. The loop hole involving George was definitely to run of the mill and seems to be the pervading theme in these books. Which isn't bad I just wish there was a little more surprise going on. Also the romance between the main character and her honey definitely seemed like an afterthought to me. Like the author thought it was a requirement for the story and so decided to throw it in sometime while the story was wrapping up.That being said; the writing and humor was entertaining and the story was interesting. A very nice book for light reading. I'll definitely be picking up whatever comes next."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite!","review":"I have always been a fan of Mercedes Lackey, and was very pleased with the \\"Fairy Godmother\\" when it came out. I pre-ordered \\"One Good Knight,\\" the second in her Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms, and just finished it last night. It was very hard for me to put down, mainly because it is so cleverly written and original. I love how the author has taken 'The Tradition' and found ways to create characters who find their own happiness despite the pressure to fit into an outdated mold. I believe that this story had surprises throughout(which I will not spoil for you), an engaging heroine, and a satisfying Happily Ever After!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book!","review":"It was a cute, light-hearted fairy tale. I liked the Dragon and Princess soul-mate element. (Fellow bookworms as romantic heroines always do it for me!)P.S. After reading all the other reviews, I wanted to mention that I think Luna is marketed to younger readers. Maybe that explains some of the \\"fluffy & unfulfilling\\" comments by other reviewers who are more familiar with Lackey's other novels???"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Good night","review":"Fairy tale, fantasty, a touch of romance and very good story line wraped up in one book.

My teenage grandaugter loved it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"Although I'm not a Mercedes Lackey fan and didn't actually like this book...It's a bestiality romance novel! That's worth a few bucks just for the s**** and giggles factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good tale","review":"Since Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite authors, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series. It was a really great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, although weak in some areas","review":"Andie is a princess in a small kingdom ruled by her mother. The kingdom is relatively peaceful until the arrival of a dragon. To keep the dragon at bay, virgins must be sacrificed to him. And even then, things are not as they seem.The weakest part of the entire book is the ending; it seemed rushed to some extent, as if Misty was looking for the simplest way to get the book done. The character of Sir George could have been explored a little more.Andie was wonderfully developed as a character. Her feelings and ideas were very well articulated. I enjoyed having Godmother Elena brought into the story, and there were enough twists to keep the book interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but her other books much better","review":"I love many of this author's books, especially Fairy Godmother, and the concept of Tradition. However, in this book she seems to use the Tradition as a crutch. The story is entirely predictable and formulaic, which most readers would find annoying, at the very least, in any other novel, but it seems that because she acknowledges that weakness, it's okay. The book is well written, but essentially boring. I felt very disappointed by this novel. If you really want to know what it's about, read the inside cover. That's pretty much all you need to know about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful pocket guide, just what we were looking for!","review":"We have been volunteers for an environmental group monitoring frog populations this past Spring. This guide is great for field work such as that as well as being useful to us as we travel with our camper or just in our own area. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NPR Interviews Author","review":"I have not read the book yet but will very soon. I just heard a radio interview with the author though. One very interesting observation he had was that addiction treatment is only offered to those who are CURED. That is, they are off drugs. He does not think that this is a good thing. He also found that a very high percentage of male addicts were sexually abused as children and a staggering 70% of women addicts were sexually abused BEFORE becoming addicted. Treatment focuses exclusively on the chemical problem with no help for the underlying cause. Looks to be a must read for those in the treatment field and those of us taking it One Day At A Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked: A must-read for the curious, the professional, and the taxpayers.","review":"Hooked is a facinating story of five peoples lives and should be read for this alone. The author does a great job of telling their stories. Painlessly wrapped inside these stories is a Masters Degree on the drug treatment system.Hooked will give you an insight into drug treatment systems without the bias of the creators. Hooked will give you years of development history and terminology.Finally, if your state or county is going to start or start-over a drug treatment program Hooked will tell you the best approach. The approach selected has results that clearly make it the plan of choice.

It's a good idea, but it's just not such a great product. I heard the newer version is better.

The bug part worked but the activator wouldn't activate it. I tried buying new batteries but it did nothing. I guess these items are just made cheaply.

I tried to put him on a leash only to be looked at by passersby as the most controlling mother ever. Then I found the Giggle Bug. It is a Godsend. I clip it on my son every time we go out. The second of he takes off, I just push the button and listen for the beep. I haven't had \\"the moment of fear\\" since. Every mother of a small child should have one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, very disappointing product","review":"I thought this was a clever idea for helping me find my toddler in a department store. It was $20 wasted. First it took 4 1/2 months to get because of backorders getting pushed back. Second, it isn't loud enough in most stores because the beep can not be heard most of the time over the music. Works fine if the store is fairly empty and playes subdued music. Third, after a month it stopped beeping. It buzzed and vibrated for hours. I took the battery out hoping to reset the bug. This didn't work. The buzzing continued after replacing the battery with a new one. I don't know if I just got a dud but it's overpriced and failed me miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't hear you","review":"Good idea but does not work.

I thought it was going to be loud like the person alarms that make that high pitch sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS","review":"Companies selling safety products should care about what they produce. This product is terrible! Cheaply made, it was difficult to use and was unreliable. It work right only once, then it didn't work correctly again. Amazon has a great return policy and I returned it very quickly.Also my 2 year old son was afraid of the \\"bug\\", we bought another product that was much less frightening. That product is well made and fantastic.The Mommy I'm Here Child Locator did cost a bit more, but was well worth it.I don't normally write a review, but this was so bad, It looked like a dollar store item, honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giggle bug tracker not loud enough","review":"I took the Giggle bug with us to a stock show.

Ms. Whitson continued with her insights into family, personal growth and the importance of faith in their lives. We came to know the characters in her first book, A Garden in Paris. Her characters are real, not perfect and at times quite unloveable. A mother learns to challenge herself and think beyond her self identity as a wife and mother. How quickly she learns that life is not all black, nor is it all white. A daughter must learn to look at her motivations and believe she can still retain her sense of self by looking to her heart; to put others before her. Ms. Whitson shares the importance of faith without cramming it down the reader's throat. I was impressed and have now starting reading some of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent introduction to the names of body parts","review":"This is one of my daughter's favorite books because it's very involving in a physical and non-threatening way.

I just pick 3 exemplary issues:.) The distinction between behavioural and RTL code in the examples is only there to double the number of pages. The listings are essentially the same, they differ in typically, like, 5 lines. Moreover, most synthesis tools would accept both programs and create the same circuit..) creating Verilog code from 3 pages of C which could be done in 10 lines of Perl is not really state of the art..) Worst of all: The asynchronous fifo does not protect the pointers on the clock domain boundary, so it is unusable in the real world.Either Bob Zeidman is not really up to date with his Verilog design skills, or it's the Dogbert priciple of \\"Beware the advice of successful people; they do not seek company.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be renamed to \\"Verilog Beginner's Library\\"","review":"I am a power user of Verilog. I have \\"all\\" the books on Verilog. I bought this book just to make sure that my library is complete. Atleast 1/3rd of this book is complete waste. Who writes behavioral code for counters and adders? Behavioral code section for all the modules is unnecessary. Author should remove them and save paper (save trees too). Behavioral code is used in real life to simulate parts of design which can not be described in RTL like memories or some processor macros and not to describe simple designs.A real life designer will never keep such simple models in his library.

The video is roughly fifty minutes long, but it flies by.I would not recommend this workout for fitness newbies, but I definitely would recommend it for kick boxing newbies. Jeanette's direction and the beginner/lower impact variations of the movements really allow for quick catching-on. The workout is still great for the intermediate kick boxer (such as myself).My only gripe is the music. Ugh. Really awful, particularly during the warm up. But once you've familiarized yourself with the routine and no longer need the verbalized direction, mute the volume and listen to your own music choice. At least that's what I've done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This workout is so much fun. Jeanette Jenkins has such a fun quirky personality and makes it fun. I'm currently involved with martial arts and she really breaks things down in correct martial arts form.

I have a few Tae-bo videos and I am challenged by all of them. Although the intensity of this video is not as high as my Tae-bo, I still got a good sweat going and today my legs are sore. I really enjoy how she incorporates weights into the workout. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I didn't work up as much of a sweat as I usually do and my heart rate was not as high.

As another reviewer mentioned, it's very easy to cross-thread the lid. Thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help.It is great for sipping though, and easy enough to keep clean. But I went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it. The seal on this bottle is too flaky because it's difficult to tell if you've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it.I'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has. I don't use this any more, because it's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading.

I am a homebrewer, and have converted it to use Ball Lock kegs.PROS:Great Price (I bought it for $350)Comes with a mini CO2 tank, and regulator, so if you want to keg homebrew you can convert it for $20 or so.Fits 2 ball lock kegs and a full size CO2 tank if you want to buy oneTemperature can be controlled from the backThe front door is rounded so you can fit extra!The wheels on the bottom are great because you can move it around as neededCONS:Loud... it has a loud hum to itTakes a lot of power, which is noticeable in my apartment (the lights flicker when it switches on)The tap gets gummed up if you don't use it every day.The CO2 tank started leaking after 6 monthsOverall though, this has a high recommendation from me. Especially for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for the price","review":"Bought this kegorator from Amazon with Prime. Took a week to arrive and UPS wasn't particularly gentle with it, but everything is fine and it's working. The instructions aren't perfect (when you have a choice between a smaller or larger washer, use the larger one), but the thing works like a champ with everything up and running. The valve is a little tricky to get calibrated just right, but it works fine once it is. I'd suggest locking it in place once you've figured out the ideal setting for it. It would be nice if it had a 5 lbs CO2 canister instead of 2.5 lbs, and it would also be nice if it had dual taps. But hey, it's a great deal for the price and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it because of the good reviews.","review":"A couple of days after placing my order, Amazon stopped carrying it. I got it for 350 shipped using Amazon prime. The rubber gasket for the tower made it real difficult to assemble, but I filed down the plastic tabs to increase the clearance. I took about .25mm off each one and brute forced the sucker on. You need the rubber gasket or else cold air will leak from the top. The gasket was attached to the hole plug in the packaging. I do not recommend the casters. I put them on and it did not roll smoothly. But since you puncture part of the Styrofoam insulation installing the casters, I feel like its not a reversible decision. The unit is as loud as an old dishwasher when placed on an linoleum floor. Currently, the temp inside the empty fridge is 32 degrees with the dial set halfway between min and max. I hope to pick up my first keg today and I'll let you know how it goes.It cost me $5.99 to fill the CO2 canisters at the local liquor supply.edit: spelling"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dad gets a keg-o-rator","review":"My wife let me purchase this as my anniversary present. Assembly was easy, the keg is cold with fridge set to max, pressure adjustment was simple although I recommend starting at the min (came locked at max) setting and working your way up, as with all fridges let it sit upright/assembled for 24hours+ before plugging it in. Nothing overly fancy, but everything works and delivery was 2 days with standard shipping. I read all the reviews pro&con, and recommend paying attention to the dates. All the good reviews are post 1/1/2011 all the bad ones are before, It looks like they made some significant improvements. I bought this because it was the cheapest with dual gauge regulator, a necessity if you have ever bought/built a kegerator before. The CO2 cylinder was mounted inside (space saver, although you do lose some pressure) which refills for $11 at my local wielding supply shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia Kegerator","review":"I love this kegerator. Only thing that could be improved would be the instructions, very poor. The unit came with a lot of extra parts, but they don't tell you they are extra. Had trouble getting my first keg in also. The plastic part the keg sits on has to be pushed inside all the way or the door won't shut. Easy once you figure it out (1/2 hour screwing with it). Makes a little noise when the compressor comes on, but over all, this is a great deal for the money. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"I purchased this keg dispenser as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend despite the negative reviews I read on Amazon. Admittedly, I was nervous once it arrived and hoped it would turn out well. He had absolutely no issues in putting it together ( I was nervous because the product came with many many different pieces (washers, gaskets, o-rings etc) in different bags. I don't think I would have ever figured it out myself! However, my bf had no issues setting it up - it took him about 40-45 min. It is now running and working great! We're both extremely happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This shouldn't be a DIY project","review":"I was wary to buy this model given some of the negative reviews in the past, but I figured I'd try my luck. Easy enough to assemble, but unfortunately it doesn't work terribly well out of the box.-The CO2 line leaks at the regulator, despite all the connections being tightened with a clamp wrench. I lost a tank of CO2 in only a month due to this slow leak.-The default setting for the temperature regulator doesn't allow the fridge to get cold enough for a good pour, I had to take it apart and adjust it as suggested by others here. Finally was able to get it from 45 to 37.-Perhaps most importantly, even with these items addressed I get nothing but a glass full of foam! I can only guess that I need a longer beer line, but at this point I don't have high hopes.I strongly recommend saving yourself the heartache and buying a different model. You may get lucky with this one, but I wish I hadn't gambled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the More Expensive Model","review":"Cheap parts. The regulator failed immediately - I had to spend $70 on a replacement from Micromatic. The tower and faucet are poor quality.

Shipment was delayed because of the weather, which is completely understandable. The package was delivered to my satisfaction, but the product itself is total crap. Set up was fairly easy, but the regulator sent with this machine was a complete waste of money. We went through 2 bottles of CO2 within a week (should have lasted up to 4 kegs). So I took the regulator to a local welding supply and they tested it. Multiple leaks and failure to maintain constant pressure - which basically means it wont work. We had the option of either buying another regulator that retails anywhere from 50-200 bucks or give up. After all the hassle I was VERY ready to give up, even with a half full keg of beer to return.... ugh!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad instructions, missing parts","review":"after building as per included instructions, all i get is foam. after watching the youtube video mentioned in some of the other complaints, i realized that the gentleman in the video has parts that were not included with my kegerator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh beer on tap....AT HOME!","review":"What more can you say?

However, there are a lot of problems with this kegerator:1. Really poor quality casters. This isn't a huge deal but because they have a ridge down the center and no give, they left lines in our floor when rolled.2. Moderately loud burbling noise when on. Kind of annoying, but not a dealbreaker.3. The compressor has steadily gotten louder and louder and is now *extremely* annoying. This is the reason for the 1-star review. About 4 months after we started using this kegerator, the compressor started to get a lot more noticeable when it clicks on. This is in an adjacent room from our living room, so it was a little annoying. Now it's really loud. You can hear it throughout the first floor of our house.Unless you're keeping this thing in a garage or basement, this unit is probably too loud.

I didn't give if 5 stars because I do have 1 complaint. When the refrigerator turns on, it is a bit noisy. Most newer mini frigs are silence. This one does have a noticeable buzzing sound when it kick on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regulator doesn't work/Warm beer","review":"The regulator/gauges that come with it absolutely do not work at all. The default setting allowed for so much pressure to come off of the CO2 tank once I opened it, it shot out of the relief valve and would not stop. Once I turned down the red knob on the front, it sent CO2 to the keg without losing any. However, the gauges still do not work correctly. When it's all the way off, it reads \\"20 pounds\\". So I never truly know how much pressure is being applied. I'm not sure how much CO2/beer was wasted from having to GUESS where the gauges were at as I tweaked it. I had to order another regulator off of a keg website at a substantial cost that eliminated the \\"savings\\" I thought I was getting by purchasing this. Also, the beer isn't room temperature by any means but it could be a lot, lot colder. It's certainly not bar quality.It's better than not having a kegerator I suppose but I'm not thrilled with the performance so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"For homebrew","review":"Converted this to a dual tap system for my homebrew with no problem, would not get cold enough so I added a small computer fan and was able to turn the thermostat down a few notches.

I took a gamble and listened to the most recent reviews saying this kegorator has changed and it is a better unit then before. PLEASE DO NOT BE FOOLED. Do not put yourself in the position I'am in now. After it arrived at my door I waited 30 hours after I knew it had been upright before I plugged it in. Two days later it would not get any colder then 65 degrees. Which is not the temp you want a keg of beer being stored at. If you are thinking of buying a kegorater do not buy this one.

The beer dispenser does not securely screw into the fridge which gives it a very cheap, breakable feel. The regulator does not work and blasts C02 out until the tank I just refilled was empty. I spent hours trying to resolve these issues and eventually just gave up. I wasted 15 on C02 and 75$ on a keg I'll probably only drink 1/10 of before it goes bad. Do not buy this. Cheap product."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY POOR DESIGN","review":"Very poor design. Why does it have a shelf in it. A 1/4 barrrel of coors light does not fit. I had so prop it up in the unit so it fits. So how is a 1/2 barrel going to fit. IT WILL NOT. So why advertise it can fit ALL kegs shapes and sizes. Why does no one answer the phone at the companies headquarters. Maybe AMAZON should really review items before they let false advertising go out. I been around and worked in bars all my life and this unit is really a waste of money. Save it and buy a name brand. As well I have to keep the pressure for the co2 at 20 pounds--WOW a minimun 6-10 pounds is the standard. Some of the screw holes to put the unit together dont match up. Again why a shelf which only holds the co2 tank. I am just going to keep it instead of repacking it and going through amazons and the companies return standards. So I quess I will buy 1/4 barrels from now on and what for name brand unit to go on sale and sell this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Cooler","review":"The only thing this cooler does well is keep a keg cold. I own a bar so I had the beer companies come out and redo all of the internal draft parts. The tower is flimsy and had to glued down.

They spent their entire $5 budget on a slick looking DVD cover. The star/writer/director (Vincent Foster) resembles the offspring of a union between Bruce Campbell and Will Farrell, but he has none of their wit and charm. The strippers have no moves or sex appeal, but considering they only have a stage as big as a kitchen table to work with - and a pole that occasionally shifts due to not being anchored in any way - you can't entirely blame them. To add to the complete lack of laughs or sensuality, constant recurring gags include a 400 pound flatulent female stripper and an inexplicable pair of male crossdressers.

We're sort of living it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acts of the Prophets more like","review":"I got interested in this book for one: because I am a science fiction fan, and two: because I am a Christian. This book is indeed science fiction but has very little to do with theology, except that it does have to do with prophecy, which is still in the fine old (joke) tradition of science fiction, and that is what makes this book good. Imagine combining Noam Chomsky with Neal Stephenson (yes, there are similarities, which I highly approve of in both cases). It is realistic enough to be very scary. What would happen if Paris Hilton inherited lots more and got old and crabby? Very scary. And I really do hope Bill Gates is as kind as he appears and not another John D. Rockefeller (hows that for Christian apocalyptic imaging?). Jobs and Wozniak turned out fine. But then I am a stranger in a strange land, so what do I know. All hail Caesar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's my tinfoil hat?!","review":"This is one of the best tech-thrillers I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I was absolutely thrilled with the fact that the technicl aspects weren't limited to cool sounding buzzwords; actual *real* bio-tech and chip design facts are involved! The characters are built very well and have just the right amount of conflict. Excellent usage of languages in the book. I have even recommended this book to several of my non-tech inclined friends. Truly a good read. This book has left me even more paranoid than I already was - which is quite a remarkable feat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spot-on technology, page-turning thrills","review":"Some techno-thrillers bog down when they hit the technology parts. Not Sundman's book! He brings you into the chip-designer's world and the biochemist's lab, and never skips a beat in this fast-moving story. The comparisons to Neil Stephenson cannot be avoided, but not to worry -- he's no Stephenson clone. Sundman has a unique voice and goes places that may not be on Stephenson's map (and vice versa). Sundman has great facility with the written word, and tells a thoughful yet thrilling story. Definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paranoid Page-Turner!!","review":"This book is a far-fetched story about mad geniuses, cutting edge technology, world domination and a couple of lovable misfits (computer geeks, at that) who try to thwart them. In broad daylight, you know it can't happen, but after dark you're not so sure. I couldn't put it down. It's the book Neal Stephenson and Robert Ludlum might have written if one of the evil geniuses of this book had cloned them into one consciousness.One caveat: the first printing is full of typos. If you have the option of second printing, full price, and first printing, used, go with the second printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!","review":"I bought a copy of \\"Acts\\" a few weeks ago at the MIT student center, and just finished the book. I just wanted to say that it was one the best, creepiest, most engaging novels that I've read in the last few years. I was also delighed to see the level of technical detail and accuracy in this novel -- although I was a little horrified to read about VLSI and ALUs when I picked up the book during finals week, in a vain attempt to avoid studying that same material in my computer architecture class this term!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAJOR geek cred!","review":"In an impressive act of paraonoid narrative inspiration, _Acts of the Apostles_ tells a two-order-of-magnitude weirder version of the silicon valley whiz kid story. If you're one of us, you will see your story in Todd's and Nick's and Casey's and Bartlet's... and you will think a lot harder before signing up for one of those company-sponsored \\"flu shot clinics,\\" or sending your kid for a summer internship at one of those TLA peninsula companies. _Acts of the Apostles_ blends the demonstrably true with the just-maybe-possibly-uh-oh conspiracy theory so carefully that I can't tell where the boundary lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"scientifically accurate (mostly) nanotech thriller","review":"Ever hear of John Gilmore, Ken Olsen and Christine Peterson? ThenJohn Sundman's \\"nanoscopically famous technoparanoid thriller\\" is wellworth your attention. Acts is a plot-driven, well-paced novel thatstill manages to get most of its electrical engineering and biotechdetails right. Unlike Tom Clancy, Sundman features realisticwell-rounded characters (including many female ones) that you willstill be able to tell apart after a few hundred pages. The realism ofthe characters stems from the fact that they are almost all based onactual people, many of whom you may recognize if you've been hangingabout in Cambridge and Palo Alto for a few years. A portion of Actsis available on-line for free, but you should really be old-fashionedand buy the hardcopy. That way you'll be able to take the story withyou to the bathroom when you get to the exciting part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michaela Foster Marsh","review":"Michaela Foster Marsh is a terrific songwriter and singer.

But from her primary career singing classical music she brings a talent, a quality, and a purity to the music chosen for this album that is unparalleled. In my estimation her voice comes very close to \\"pure melody,\\" unadorned, yet clear, solid, and pure. The lack of over-produced accompanyment for this album allow for McNair's voice to shine, shine, shine, as I think it should be allowed to and does. The timelessness of the material she sings and the naked beauty of McNair's voice takes me places emotinally very very few other recordings have taken me.

I have a background in physics, so perhaps not the best for this stuff, nonetheless I feel like Wikipedia is better for learning some of this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and annoying","review":"As with many books on this sort of subject, this book starts out with the assumption everyone reading it has had calculus or higher. Not necessarily a bad assumption, but it's a poor starting place (math heavy).Most books start out with talk about resistors, Ohm's law, KCL, etc etc. which I'm sure turns off many students to the subject. Instead they should get into the functional and literal uses for each component they will encounter, describing how it works, describing how the electrons would flow in each, etc. That kind of description is lost almost everywhere (and does not even appear in this book at all)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly useless to any EE","review":"The style is pretty basic and bland.

It would have gotten one star if I didn't love it while it worked. The fact of the matter is: there are too many blocks in this memory card to provide stability.

The problem was it corrupted data from time to time and eventually the whole card got corrupted. This first party version to the best of my knowledge does not corrupt data (I know the memory card 59s don't or at least almost never do.) It can hold an enormous amount of data, and the only shortcoming in that respect is that it can only hold a total of 100 files in total (even if you don't use up all the blocks.) This seems like a strange shortcoming so it's not as big a storage unit as it appears, but it's still far larger than almost anybody will use (I'm a freak and stored rental files, screenshots and replays onto it in addition to the 20 or so games I own.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This should have come out sooner","review":"The Gamecube Memory Card (1019 blocks) should have come out sooner for the Gamecube. Before this, they released the 59 block and 251 block cards which had less space compared to this one. Fortunately, it works for all Gamecube games. I've had no problems with it and I hope to buy another one soon so I can backup my saves on my 251 block memory cards. If you had to choose one kind of memory card, go for the 1019 block memory card as it offers the largest amount of space from Nintendo.

When I did, I noticed immediately that the 'cinderella' heroine of the story had golden hair and fair skin while the evil, lazy, etc step-sisters had dark hair & skin. This was explicitly written and illustrated. This is a shame and so unnecessary. Obviously, Egypt is in northern Africa and while some tales of Cleopatra suggest that she may have been fair due to the Ptolemy's Greek lineage, I would suggest that most inhabitants of ancient egypt were of african, mediterranean, semitic, or arabic descent and dark-hued.

So what if McQueen fans and general audiences couldn't accept him as Ibsen's hero Dr. Thomas Stockman, it's still a powerful film. Although originally written in the 18th century, there are many parallels in today's world and lessons to be learned from this story if one is open enough to absorb them. McQueen heads a fine cast including Charles Durning, Bibi Andersson and Richard A. Dysart. See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve McQueen is finally allowed to act!","review":"Steve McQueen is finally allowed to act! His performancewas the best role of his acting career.

The shipping box was well packaged. The assembly of the tiles were simple and their quality is very sturdy. Two of the tiles had a cracked backing but, I contacted the company and they sent out 2 replacement tiles immediately. I would most definately buy this product and from this company again. If you are looking for floor covering that is irregular shaped or larger than a normal mat, this product is perfect. I used them to cover (fill in) a slippery shower floor area. The individual tiles allowed the overall floor covering to mimic the curvature of the shower floor toward the drain without hampering its overall stability. And it looks great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Maybe since my kid doesn't understand what it is, the placebo affect didn't work, I don't know. But these aren't for us.

There are two reasons for her novels, the first being to write excellent mysteries and the second to inform the reader of life in the Elizabethan age. This novel keeps the reader guessing until the end without any last-minute revelations that let the reader down. It shows how Lady Appleton uses her intuition and the accumulated facts to figure out the crime and perpetrator. It also places the reader in this earlier time and in a thoroughly entertaining way lets the reader learn of daily life then. I found every page of this novel to be worth reading; it's writing at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Queen Bess up a tree?","review":"...not with Lady Susanna on the case.

But the plot to me took a long time to develop and the author didn't disclose enough clues early on to keep me interested. For example, I knew the Medan Diagnostics corporation was tied to the ProLif corporation The only link I had was through Michael Eliot. The other clues linking these two corporations together were too abstract to decipher so I was lost. I thought Alex was making leaps in logic by making sense out of these incoherent clues. The insurance policy envelops and the letter openers were big clues along with the printouts. However, there wasn't enough information disclosed by the author to link them together. I am not feeble minded and I like mystery novels, but this novel is only interesting toward the end because I wanted it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty awful until 2/3 through","review":"I guess it was worth it, to read thru this book.

THE POLICY is an adult thriller in the best sense of that word. It'll hold your attention AND give you plenty to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rich and intricate tale","review":"'The Policy' is an unusual and complex story that is as much about its characters as it is about its nevertheless ingenious plot. Readers wanting gore and horror will probably be disappointed, but I found reading this an unusually rich experience. The story involves a clever - and almost too believable - conspiracy to make millions of dollars at nobody's expense (a 'perfect' crime), and one woman's search for the truth. But the most interesting thing about the story is what this money does to the people that have it, and who are also forced to hide it. It as a story about pleasure and life postponed. Witnessing what this seeming dream-come-true does to those who make it happen is wonderful. Being rich beyond your wildest dreams will never seem the same again.

Two interesting selections, \\"Baba-Yaga\\" and \\"Kikimora\\", by Anatol Liadov (1855 - 1914), a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov, are based on witches from Russian folklore and are not that well-known outside of Russia. All of the selections are performed well by Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra.I did have the impression is listening to this CD that some of the more powerful passages were played somewhat too forcefully. Perhaps this impression was due more to the sound engineering than the conductor and orchestra. For example, on Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, when the percussion imitates the boom of the cannon, it sounds almost a sonic boom coming across the speakers. With that reservation, I recommend this as a well-performed and entertaining selection of orchestral showpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"Please Please do not buy this toy, it looks like it is a good size, it is only 2 inches big.

This book was very uneven lurching from cliched platitudes to long drawn-out passages that didn't advance the plot at all. And what was the plot exactly? The Harry Brightman part could have been left out entirely as it never really moved the book in one way or another. I'm so glad Auster used his main character to expound on the 2000 election, gay couples and self-righteous Christians -- I could care less about his opinions on these issues. I would have preferred if he'd used his energy to develop some real characters that I could care about. What a silly book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, A Real Page Turner but Not the Ending I Expected","review":"I'm new to Paul Auster's brand of literature. I started with Timbuktu which I thought was brilliantly written. The Brookyn Follies takes the reader on one helluva of ride that is supposedly the main characters last hurrah in life. The story lines are fast and furious. You name the subject, this book has got it -- sex, cults, murder, homosexuals. I've gotta give Mr. Auster credit. He kept me interested until the very end. Maybe I missed it but without spoiling it -- I was disappointed with the ending. If you are looking for something different to read -- I highly recommend this book and all of Paul Austers novels. He writes no other. His creativity and imagination are unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh so good! Auster is tops.","review":"Paul Auster has done it again: written literature in the USA in the early twenty-first century, a rare occasion! This book has it all -- adventure, plots and subplots, wisdom, religion, sex, relationships -- and Auster makes it real. Glass is one of the best sketched protagonist/narrators I've ever had the pleasure of seeing in literature.I have only two, small, complaints: 1. I'm a John Deere nut, and they sure aren't red! 2. Zeno's Conscience is usually referred to as that, not The Conscience of Zeno, which would be a literal translation of its original title.Despite that, I would give this book 10 stars if Amazon had that option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Auster","review":"Paul Auster gets more mainstream but you can't fault him when he writes a great story you can't put down. I read the book over the weekend and never for once stopped seeing Jack Nicholson as the main character so maybe it's destined for Hollywood. Fine idea, that. Many characters, all beautifully drawn with the trademark Auster touches. The story rambles from one drama to the next without missing a beat. Every now and again there is an Auster quirk that you recognize if you are a fan since the triology and feel a little thrill; like running into an old friend on the street. No complaints here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo-ring","review":"After reading the first 50 pages of this book, I'm calling it quits. It's hard for me to do, as I'm all for giving books a chance and I know sometimes books with slow beginnings can end up being great by the end. But, I feel this book is a waste of my time. I've never read an Auster book before and chose this one after reading some reviews of it. Life is to shore to spend it reading books that are boring. I'm moving on to another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden Agenda","review":"Although written well, this is less about Brooklyn than it is about Austen's political agenda. How cowardly to hide behind fictional characters when spewing nonsense. I challenge Auster to write a non-fiction book about his views. Perhaps in the next book, he will disparage Jews or Muslims...but that is not as popular today. It's open season on Christians. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slice of life","review":"An excellent slice of life. Auster finds the drama in everyday situations and spreads it out like a banquet. I was sorry the book had to end. I wasn't finished eavesdropping."},{"rating":"1","title":"O Paul, Where Art Thou?","review":"How dissapointing to read the latest work from one of your favorite authors only to find that he isn't aging with grace. Auster's first few novels were so smartly written that I couldn't put them down and have reread them many times over the years. I simply couldn't wait to get through this one and put it on the shelf never to be opened again. Paul, it's time you looked to your mentor Don Delillo to learn the valuable lesson on style and editing. With every new piece of writing Delillo gets sharper and more profound, while Auster's gets more childish and mediocre. Don't waste your money on this piece of drivel. Go and reread Moon Palace or Leviathan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"I love Auster, I was turned onto him when his New York Trilogy was first coming out, thanks to a bookseller on Westwood Blvd, in LA. I'm pleased to have hardbacks of the first three books that make up the Trilogy. Since then I give him a lot of latitude, and he's often hit or miss. The last good one was \\"Book of Illusions.\\" This book plus the following \\"In the Scriptorium\\" have realy put me off him. Maybe he's got too many other plates spinning to make time for his fiction... Who knows, just hate to see a great writer lose it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant read, but way too sugary","review":"This book is a nice read; I read it in one day. My only problem with it is that it is very \\"sugary\\"; the last quater of the book is basically devoted to the happy end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Auster gone?","review":"I am still hoping that, as in this book, this is the fake manuscript and that Paul Auster will soon stand up and reveal the real one, admitting to one of the great fictional hoaxes of the 21 century.As an huge fan of Auster's narrative, plot and story writing talent, I was utterly dissapointed with this novel. Unfortunately to me, it is mere pulp fiction and a bad version of that. Auster has given in (it seems) to his critics who say his work is too intellectual and too postmodern, whereby producing something which lacks any of the normal Auster edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's mostly about a man who returns to Brooklyn from the suburbs with what he thinks is a terminal case of cancer. He goes there to die. To his surprise, he finds reasons to live. Not only that, he also has a big impact on the neighborhood.There is a taste of the picaresque in this story, involving a trip to Vermont.I have always enjoyed Auster's clear, crisp style, beginning with The Music of Chance. He has a knack of drawing characters that, even though utterly flawed in many respects, are ones you care about, and even wonder about long after you've finished reading the story.I wish Paul Auster would get more recognition, because his stories are terrific. Fortunately, he is well known in the literary community, and deservedly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follies Disappoint","review":"I agree with the N.Y.

I began to doubt Auster wrote it. Endless narration of random stories. Jejune dialogue. Lollipops for everyone at the end. I've been an Auster fan for years, loved Book of Illusions. Truly, I think someone else wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I get more excited reading the Times editorial page...","review":"After enjoying Auster's quirky and moderately satisfying Oracle Night, I was looking forward to The Brooklyn Follies. The novel has a promising beginning with interesting characters and the hint of a good story. But a little beyond the halfway point it begins to degenerate into a prototypical liberal rant against George Bush (and all other hated republicans), and that naturally flows into, of course, a condemnation of the religious reactionaries who populate the southern half of the country. If Auster had expressed his political positions in a fresh, interesting approach I may have been more receptive to them, but to rehash worn cliches really makes me question his intellectual integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unsatisfying read","review":"The characters are basically boring people just muddling, and not very successfully, through life.

If any movie had shown a male lead beating the tar out of a female character, critics and feminist groups would have cried out-and rightly so.

Paul Giamatti's a sad-sack, Haden Church is a horn-dog jerk, and both are terrific at making a mess of their lives. The California sunshine can't penetrate the gloom of their mid-life crisis, even when Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh try their best to salvage this last, week-long bender between college buddies. If there are any life-lessons here, it's that you get back what you give. The movie's logic gets a little wobbly during a madcap caper but it's in keeping with the rest of the movie's humor, which arises out of situations and not at the expense of character. \\"Sideways\\" is a movie about flawed adulthood and some admittedly flawed characters who manage to come out all right.

But on the way they encounter two females that will send their lives into an interesting turn.When it gets right down to it, there is too much Dialogue about wine. You get sick of it after a while.

Personally, I don't. It has its moments, Sandra Oh is great and should have gotten far more, but the match between the male and female leads was unlikely and strained. It really didn't seem like Miles' was strained so far out of character as to break into another person's house, and anyway, he should get whatever he deserved because he lied through his teeth and broke the law.

It had potential, with great actors, a good , but overused premise (getting married this weekend so I want to party with my buddy and get ____.) There were definitely some good spots, Stephanie pounding away with her helmet, but as a whole, very disappointing. The whole pretentious wine-geek theme got old very early on. These fellas and gals could have just as easily been sports fanatics or techno-dweebs without adding or subtracting from the tired story line. The characters lacked dimension and never actually strayed from their initial presentation, they learned nothing, overcame anything, or scored life victories over adversity, they merely cheated their way out of jams. This film has been called 'quirky' and 'smart'.

The cinematography is excellent, and the screenwriters knew their wine. There are parts of this movie that are really funny. But the movie never transcends the loathsome, reprehensible behavior of Miles and Jack, the two characters who are supposed to be our heroes. Their actions near the beginning of this movie do not make them sympathetic. Rather, they are established early on as pathetic middle-aged losers who deserve any and all of the bad things that happen to them. Even though Miles makes a stab at redemption near the end, it's too little, too late. There are some funny moments where we laugh at them, not with them, but then it's time to go back to looking at your watch and waiting for the the movie to end.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown.","review":"The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable. Basically, \\"Sideways\\" is a grown-up version of Road Trip or American Pie. Sure, there are metaphors such as the references to wine and their parallels to personalities in the movie. However, the rest of the movie is a series of epiphanies and middle age woes that have all been done before. I really appreciate the talent of Paul Giamatti, but Sideways merely tells the tale of two buddies spending one last week of bachelorhood together before Jack (Thomas Haden Church) gets married. There's nothing original here, and I was disgusted by the unnecessary full-frontal (overweight) male nudity. If you want a good movie surrounding a middle age crisis, I highly recommend \\"American Beauty\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty good if you are fascinated by wine, otherwise, not much to it","review":"Neither the story nor the characters were very interesting.

It seemed to be about a couple of jerks, one a manipulator/liar and the other a \\"friend\\" who covers for the manipulator/liar. They are spending a week in the California wine country before one of them marries, but this groom lacks a certain fidelity. Both men seemed self-centered, boorish. At first I thought \\"Who cares?\\" But the film picked up and turned into a powerful portrait of the costs of friendship and the nature of hope. I think the two friends and the women they encounter are types of people that we all know. It captures the angst generated by failure and the resultant rejection. \\"Nobody wants you when you're down and out.\\" There's an effective blend of pathos and humor. At first rather flat, it turned into a heady brew."},{"rating":"2","title":"New meaning to \\"an interest in wine\\"","review":"I sit here in my study surrounded by my Pinot and I think about how this movie shows that \\"an interest in wine\\" takes on a new and wholly significant meaning, centrally from the point of view of Maya and Miles. If you have a heart, and a palette (for wine), Sideways will do more for you than any other movie in a long while. It isn't a monster action flick. Yes it touches on depression and addiction and failed dreams. Yet it is also about finding hope in the context of middlelife despair, not all that different from finding that special bottle of wine in a sea of mediocrity (my corner wine store). And speaking for finding good wine, if you love vino and liked the \\"indie\\" feel of this movie , I also recommend Lynch's Inspiring Thirst and Oldman's Guide to Outsmarting Wine, both recent releases that are high quality excursions through the vintners art."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what to say, folkz...","review":"Comedy of the year? Puhleez. I usually give movies a chance and even surprised myself by keeping in my seat throughout the entire movie, but in the end found it crude, pointless and downright, well, pathetic. Is there any real point here except that you follow two guys, one that has a fling and goes back and marries another woman, while the other, who is more sympathetic but still a vulgar character, tastes wine and tries to publish his book (that --in the end-- never gets published)? Sideways could've been a less-than-stellar but somewhat (emphasis on \\"somewhat\\") mediocre and swallowable film if there was a valid moral point in the end, but alas there is not. Still, it's better than 2003's Lost In Translation which I didn't even sit through after about 20 minutes of absolute boredom, but that doesn't really say a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It's true, only 5% of a book is captured in a movie.

Not only is Sandra Oh the only \\"visible\\" minority in this movie, she is the only character given a minor role. The role of Oh's character as the asian sex freak is simply used to offset the \\"deep\\" character developoment of the other three major characters. The Sandra Oh role should have been the Virginia Madsen character -- but then again Hollywood seems to be bent on maintaining certain stereotypes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps I expected too much...","review":"After all the hype and awards nominations, I expected something a little different - like an ending that wasn't totally predictable, characters who weren't cliches, and a plot that went somewhere. Not in this movie. The only bright spot was Virginia Madsen, whom I found appealing despite her poorly drawn character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong and Overrated","review":"How is it that a movie about a couple of losers with no redeeming qualities and nothing interesting happening to them can recieve such acclaim? This film is basically the equivalent of \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" minus the giddy silliness and likable characters.I'm not saying this is a terrible film. I'm saying it's a bland, dull, and thoroughly unremarkable piece of cinema. The actors are all dead on, but who cares? It's dull and pointless and can't decide whether it's mature or silly or both. Lacking in grace, intelligence, or worth. I know that's harsh, but that's just the way I feel.Really, I didn't care for it one little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe 'Sideways' Needs Turned Right-Side-Up","review":"As hyped as this movie supposedly was, I found myself utterly bored throughout. I'm not even sure why this is considered a comedy, considering the only truly laughable moment came within the last quarter of the film. I came away quite disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I actually thought this would be a movie I would like. Oh, how wrong could I be? Both my wife and I had a difficult time staying awake. I felt the main characters were rather pathetic ... the pace of the movie was too slow ... and I really didn't find any humor in this movie that I thought was supposed to be a comedy. About the only good thing I can say is that I received it as a gift and didn't spend my own money on it. This is only my opinion ... yours may differ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a comedy.","review":"I rented the movie based off so many reviews stating that this movie was one of the greatest comedies - I have to wonder about these people's sense of humor. This is a movie where both men make one feel so depressed, I think the movie was attempting to make one feel for these men - the only thing I ended up feeling for both men was utter contempt. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have ever seen!","review":"Honestly, I enjoy a variety of movie genres, and I can usually find at least one thing I like about a movie - but I was absolutely stunned at how horrible this movie was. First of all, it is mostly boring and is not funny at all. Secondly, one character, Jack, is completely unlikeable and the other, Miles, is just depressing. Jack is simply displayed as an immature idiot who never shows any likeable qualities. He just keeps using women, and this is neither funny nor interesting. And Miles' pathetic situation is boring at best and depressing at worst. What a horrible plot. I kept watching it, thinking it would get better, and it simply got worse. I have absolutely no idea how anyone with a conscience could think this movie was funny. I was told it was an entertaining film, but apparently \\"entertaining\\" means very different things to different people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty-Headed and Mean Spirited","review":"My husband saw this movie on a plane, without the sex scenes, and thought it a funny movie. We rented it, and I was sickened by the way Thomas Hayden Church uses women and his best friend. This was a grown up version of a frat movie, with little on its mind but drunkeness and sex. Really awful to see a grown man act like morally bankrupt teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Excitement About?!","review":"I had looked forward to this movie with relish, liking very much past performances of the 4 leads. But this movie was so boring, ridiculous, trite, and immature I absolutely hated it. A loser teacher who can't quite get his novel together has to steal money from his mother to take his abusive so-called friend on a bachelor trip. Church's character is the worst. It was a trip back to highschool behavior for both these sorry fellows! How disgustingly sad that there are so many men in real life who behave in just that manner and still end up with a darling wife. This movie was a total waste of film. Not even the road scenes were good as an opportunity to film this gorgeous area of California was cast aside in what was (I am guessing)a pathetic attempt at 'character development.' As usual, the artsy-fartsy crowd thinks it has merit; I almost always disagree with their effete tastes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think someone played a trick on me","review":"Sorry but this was a complete waste of time for me. It came highly recommended by a freiend who previously has recommended some great movies (i.e. Sexy Beast and Cedar Rapids both get thumbs up). I am really surprised becasue it was so boring. He said I would be rolling with laughter. Now I get it - he is laughing for getting me to watch it.Looking at the reviews I guess you will either really like it or not. I kept watching waiting for something either intersting or funny to happen but it simply never does. So if your like me and are bored after the first 10 minutes, turn it off as it does not get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, no substance","review":"I could not wait to see this movie, based on the previews and hype in the media. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the publicity generated by its well-oiled hype machine! This movie is not even mediocre.The two lead characters were absolutely pathetic, boorish, selfish losers. I did not need to see a movie about them and their drunkenness. They each needed to grow up and get a life.What made anyone think that a movie about two losers spending a week getting drunk and having sex was a good idea? Stupid stupid movie. Stupid plot (if you can call it a plot). Stupid idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars was not an option - OVER-RATED MOVIE OF A LIFETIME!","review":"Sorry folks but this was the most over rated film I have seen in years. I loved Virgina Madsen and Sandra Oh - they were excellent - but who can really find it believable that they would date either of the lead actors? They are beautiful, sexy women and were portrayted as very intelligent as well - they would not date those men. Additionally, other than brief moments regarding these actresses there was nothing redeeming or important about these characters (any of them) that made you cheer or feel for any of them. You simply do not care about any of these people - oh except for the sadness you feel for the mother that gets ripped off by the son she is so proud of... SO SAD and pathetic!Overall the movie lacked in every way - I was utterly disappointed in it and the attention it got this year was unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously? I mean really, seriously???","review":"After all the hype surrounding this movie, I expected greatness. What I experienced was anything but. Exactly how does this movie merit \\"Best Picture\\"? Good acting, fairly good comedy, mediocre story line. I have never before written a negative reivew as I feel it's not really worth my time. I had to break my own rule on this one though. I suppose this movie would be appealing to someone into wine, but I just don't understand all the hype. \\"Best Picture\\", seriously???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny drivel...","review":"One lead is a cardboard cutout, the other is a whiny pushover. This movie is just 2 long torturous hours of the shallow guy getting in predictable trouble and the whiny guy reluctantly helping him get out of it. And the whiny guys whines about his pathetic life and acts miserable. Oh, and they talk about wine, in such a smarmy, aren't-we-clever-using-wine-as-a-subtext way that I wanted to punch them all in the mouth. And you will too.What a tremendous disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Given the cast and hype, I really tried hard to like this film. I even waited a month before writing a review. The best thing I can say is that these actors did an excellent job portraying some really unlikable characters, doing some truly tasteless things. Seriously: Grown-up bad boys set out for pre-wedding fling weekend, wherein boy # 1 doesn't even PRETEND to care that he's about to be married; and boy #2, still wallowing in his (sniff) \\"I can't believe I'm divorced, poor me\\" pity party after three years? Stop. The best part of this film was the wine, and the scenes filmed in wine country. Not much else lived up to the hype -- except Sandra Oh's revenge scene -- assuming you can watch that far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking dignity","review":"This is a story about two middle age men who are liars. They lie to each other and to everyone else they meet. Where the movie went really sour for me was when Miles steals from his mother. After that the rest of the movie becomes very tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"UUUURRRGH...burp.","review":"There were exactly 2 laughs for me during this movie (hence 2 stars). One was the panoramic view of the clone-houses of Oxnard, California, and the other was the pained, confused expression on the bridegroom's face as he's married in an ancient Christian ceremony. My Orthodox friend's comment on that one was, \\"There's no way he could have converted....\\"The whole movie is based on the shallow actions and verbalizations of two ghastly males. Now I like to watch a movie about ghastly males now and then, but these two made me feel rather nauseated. Eeek. How could darling girls like Stephanie and Maya even consider going to dinner with these two? Are things that bad for the single woman in California these days?? Was it the only way they could afford the great wine?? Could they not have dated each other instead?? Poor creatures...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Overrated!","review":"I was excited to see this movie. After 20 minutes, I couldn't understand why it received so much hype! I didn't like it! There were a few funny parts and itz always great to see people work their problems out in the end. But there is a lot of context that leaves you feeling BLAH. Maybe I'm not deep enough to fully enjoy this movie, but I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a let down","review":"Tolbert has it right, this film is over-hyped, over-rated and overwhelmingly dull. I give it a little credit for some occasional humor, but I could find little to care about with Giamatti's character; too little screen time for Virginia Madsen; way too much pretentiousness for the wine-ohs, Sandra included. I did manage to stay awake, just to see if it ever ends. I'll come back an add on to this if it ever does."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no!","review":"As one reveiwer already stated, don't believe the hype! This is not a good film. Both lead characters are spineless, juvenile, cheating twerps who seem to subscribe to the notion that women are worthless disposable creatures put here simply for their pleasure and nothing more. But it's a movie that happens to discuss wine in some depth so somehow all these reviewers (and California residents) are fooled into thinking that somehow redeems the fatal flaws at the core of the writing and characters. What is it, exactly, that we are supposed to appreciate about men who cheat and couldn't care less about the consequences? What's funny about lying in order to get a woman into bed?Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drunken Losers","review":"I was never more disappointed in a movie. The two main male characters are drunken losers who try and interact with women. I don't understand how this movie got so many awards. I didn't think the plot was interesting; the men were skuzzy and creepy. If you are looking for a fun romantic comedy, this is not it. If you are looking for a pretentious movie that drags along with a hell of a lot of drinking, this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"Does two guys going on a roadtrip through wine country to sample wines sound like a good premise to you? Someone thought so, but I don't agree. This movie was long and boring and for all the hype it got I'd said it doesn't deliver. There were a couple funny moments but not enough to hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only rented it","review":"I will have to stand in the minority on this film, a \\"road story\\" about a shallow loser and a superficial swine. I spent the first hour of the film wondering who was the more contemptible character, and ultimately had to go with the loser -- the superficial swine, at least, has a degree of honesty, even though this is bred primarily from his complete inability to think reflectively upon anything.Full disclosure: I gave up watching after the first hour. It quite beggars my imagination why I would want to spend even that much time with such monstrously stupid, viciously self-deceiving hypocrites. I mean, don't we get enough of that in the workplace? Anyway, this is why I'm glad I only rented it.And, I'm sorry, but in what imaginary universe does a trip to the \\"California Wine Country\\" get no further North than Santa Barbara?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What gives?","review":"I cannot for the life of me figure out why this movie has gotten all the rave reviews and praise. For one the main character (Miles)is hapless and pathetic---it was funny as George Castanza--here it is moronic and sad. Secondly his buddy Jack is a complete jackass loathsome to the point of disgust. There are a few lighthearted funny moments but they are few and far between. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth and I can only surmise that with the glut of TV shows turned movies that any original script no matter how bad it is has the potential of precieved greatness. In a nutshell this movie is borderline crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very funny","review":"I was surprised that this video got some good reviews. In my opinion it lacked humor and the occasional scene that tried to be funny was so tied up with over the top sex that the humor died."},{"rating":"2","title":"People giving this bad reviews are not movie people","review":"Wonderful, heartfelt film. Nothing new, but did new great things with universal themes: hurt, loss, depression, loose cannon friends, and most importantly--never giving up despite all these things.If you really like movies, you'll like this film. It's well-written and beautifully acted by all four main characters. The people who gave up watching half way through have no place giving bad reviews, you didn't even watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two losers visit wine country. Boring.","review":"I have not commented on a film on Amazon's site before now, but after my wife and I viewed Sideways last night, I felt compelled to advise others to save their time and money. My wife and I frequently disagree upon the quality of the movies we watch, but after fifteen minutes into this one we were in complete agreement that this was a boring piece of trash. With the hope that the film would get better, we continued watching it through its unremarkable conclusion. Our desire to find humor in this \\"comedy\\" about two morally/ethically challenged losers and their visit to the California wine country was unsatisfied. With all the good reviews this film received, I can only guess that it must have become politically incorrect to disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disappointment","review":"We were really looking forward to this movie due to all of the hype. Unfortunately, it fell flat. It was billed as one of the best comedies of the year, but there wasn't anything funny about this movie. Instead, you felt loathing or pity for the main characters - a drunken divorced loser and his morally bankrupt college roomate, an aging actor and sexaholic. This movie really had potential, but it's amazing how Hollywood writers can take a good idea and completely ruin it. I felt like I completely wasted 120 minutes of my life watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"One star is too much for this movie. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! No kidding! Don't waste your money or your time. This movie felt like one long, boring commercial for the wineries! It was marketed as a comedy...that in and of itself is hilarious...the movie wasn't funny at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"American Pie\\" for middle-aged men","review":"A neurotic loser and his boorish buddy trick women into bed on a week-long road trip to wine country. A depressing look at human ugliness all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Beyond Belief","review":"Well, here goes my review, and you probably wont like it. First of all, this movie is being pitched as a tour through wine country. Amazing how they visit about 4 wineries (the first they visit, Sanford, has produced some of the worst wines I have ever tasted. Ok, so the real story is about an ugly actor (soon to be married) trying to get laid on his vacation. And the other even uglier guy has such self esteem issues he almost cant get laid. So they go to restaurants, a couple wineries, stay at the same hotel the entire time they're there (so they couldn't have had the time to travel to different AVA's). Not a drama, not a comedy, not horror or sci-fi. Not a documentary. Not a romance, not an action movie. I guess to sum things up this movie sucks as much as his book which cant get published because it goes nowhere, just like this movie. You would need to watch it to see what I mean, but do you really want to waste 2 hours?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"This has got to be the most BORING movie I have seen. Not at all like the book. If you did not read the book, you will have a hard time getting the jokes from the film.

Watch something else - anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, indulgent waste of viewer's time","review":"This is the sort of movie that all the critics will love, and regular viewers will wonder, why did anyone feel compelled to write a screenplay and produce a movie so void of entertainment. I guess the actors may have done a great job in their roles, but who cares when the story is this lame and unattractive. I felt like I had been robbed of two hours when it was over....and some relief that I could quit watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought this was the worst movie of the year, boring. I snoozed thru it and have no clue why it get's such rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The hype for this movie didn't live up to the expectations, I turned it off in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the kids get near this...","review":"The story line is not bad, although for me it really drags and borders on depressing. The extreme nudity and explicit sex were just more than I could watch again. It's one thing to involve sex in a story line. It's quite another to have such vivid demonstrations. And don't let your kids get near the DVD...there's just a lot here that most kids just don't need to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars - what an unfunny boring over-rated whiney dog","review":"I was suckered into watching part of this crappy loser downer dog - what a waste of time. I like wine and being 73 and lived in Nor Cal for 45 years - I've tasted, drunk, tossed out - way more than my share of CA and global wines. When I find a keeper I buy 10-12 cases. This is not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comedy... or so I heard.","review":"I don't know if it's me, but I just didn't get this movie. I heard it was a buddy movie, a journey of discovery with laughs a-plenty along the way. Sorry, maybe I watched the wrong movie. I found both guys far too obnoxious to be likeable and while dislikeable characters can make a movie, they didn't in this case. As for funny? Not even a little snigger, let alone a big belly laugh anywhere in sight. I don't know what Rex Pickett's book's like, but this was very disappointing. I'm not a big fan of American Pie-style humor, but at least that did make me laugh, unlike this. Maybe I'm far less cerebral than I imagine and that's why I didn't get it. Or maybe this movie really is just garbage that people like because they've been told it's good because it ISN'T American Pie. Well, I know which I'd rather watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED!!!","review":"This has to be the most overrated film I've ever seen in my life! It's filled with great actors, but the two main characters are incredibly unlikeable. I actually was hoping for one of them (or both) to fall off a cliff or get run over by a truck. As for this film's \\"comedy\\" classification, I thought comedies were supposed to make you laugh. I don't think I'm going to listen to critics again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Depressing","review":"After suffering through the first half of this pretentious little film, I walked out. My companion, who stayed the course, later told me that it didn't get any better during the second half.Later I remembered that I have never liked Woody's Allen's movies for the same reason -- spending 123 minutes watching a neurotic whiner is not fun. On the other hand, if you like Woody Allen, you may like this.Of course, Paul Giamatti is simply playing a role in this film, and it may be that (unlike Woody Allen) the person he is in real life is markedly different than the person he portrays, as was the case with Reese Witherspoon inElection. If so, he's a great actor, because the viewer comes away despising the guy. Still, you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with either of these characters, much less two hours.Yes, the California scenery is lovely, but the endless wine talk (\\"a strong oak finish, with a hint of garlic and peanut butter\\"), as in real life, is insufferable."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing movie","review":"Movie about two losers in LA--nobody actor and loser writer who likes wine. That's the story! What this movie teaches, points out, or at least makes us laugh? There is no message, nada. But if you like losers, you will love this movie. The only thing I liked was inovative cinematography. But no cinematographer can save movie with no story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sideways","review":"Sideways is a mean-spirited, depressing, slice of life look at the human condition. I did not find it funny. I saw nothing to laugh at. It's not a comedy. In fact for me it ranks with Ishtar, and Heaven's Gate. Too bad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh... SOOOOOO disappointed!!!","review":"After all the hype and everything -- I actually FELL ASLEEP during this movie. The characters have good potential for a story, I guess, but they don't really DO anything -- it might as well be a film project for a college boy. I was very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"I turned it off after just an hour. This film did nothing for me except bore me half to death.

Well...ladies and gentlemen, exhibit A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar and practically pornographic in parts","review":"I rented this thinking it would be an intelligent comedy for adults that focused on the wine country of California. What I found was that wine is just the backdrop for a moveie that is about 2 total losers, one who steals money from his mother and is clinically depressed. The other is obsessed with sex. The whole film obsessed with sex, and has constant uses of the F word and contains a steady stream of other extremely vulgar language. It also featured 2 graphic sex scenes that were totally unnecessary to the story and practically pornographic. I watched this with my wife and 2 friends and was mortified by this movie.Please be warned. If you like vulgar references to sex and on-screen depictions of the same, then I guess this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring a pillow, some prozac, and a gun ZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"First off, I must say that Paul Giamatti is a good actor, He was amazing in Howard Sterns movie \\"Private parts\\" but after watching this movie, I only have one thing to say about your average movie goers:THERE SURE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT LIKE BORINGC R A P !!Get a life you drama-novel-midlife-crisis-cry-babies, oh and to those offended by the F word.

If there is comedy here, I did not find it; mid-life crisis? where?, superb acting? nope; clever direction? look elsewhere.That anyone could, at anytime in their dull pointless lives find this sad film even mildly amusing is quite beyond me. Not one of the 127 minutes of this dog was even remotely good.Please,people, do not waste your hard earned money on this DVD. Thank heaven I rented, and then had the joy of returning. Regretting the $4.00 I spent on a rental fee (hoping that I returned it early enough to receive the $1.00 early return credit!)If I want to be entertained I'll spend an evening with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton and view \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.\\" Trust me, it has way more laughs than \\"Sideways.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserving of its recognition","review":"A very disappointing film. Permeated with crude language and brief sexual content, the film never rises above its thin storyline and idiotic hijinks. The main actors, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church, barely have onscreen chemistry. In fact, their characters are so minimally contrived that it is surprising that anyone even finds them compelling or likable. The female characters, played by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh, come across just as naive and immature as their male counterparts. The title seems appropriate given that there is no direction or point to this film. Pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art Cinema's Downfall...","review":"The sad fact of this movie is that people adore it and the garbage of which it's comprised. While Paul Giamatti is great he really should stick to playing characters like the goofy \\"Pig Vomit\\" of Howard Stern. Essentially, this movie puts forth two things as solving all the problems of marriage and (early) middle age: 1) drink your troubles away and they'll still be there, and 2) if you don't feel like fidelity's your thing by no means should you be bound by it, impending marriage or not. Take my advice, save your money and your time and watch something of even slightly more quality. On a positive note, both actors have their funny moments, the scenery's amazing and the film is well shot, despite being mostly crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give men more credit please!","review":"This movie was so overhyped. Any one who writes a review here who says \\"I know wine and I approve this movie\\" is full of it. Those who work in the wine industry know about the meritage of the featured Pinot including Merlot, but aside from that piece of trivia the fact is, Merlot is a great varietal. It just got too popular, so this movie takes a cheap shot to make fun of it, and all of the people who enjoy it. Wine is not about being snobby and pretentious, it's about drinking wine that YOU you like.(It did a huge disservice to Merlot growers and winemakers by bashing it BTW). That's beside the point, however. The movie was just pathetic in it's interpretation of middle aged men. It had a few moments, but nothing to make up for the pain of having to watch these horrible characters for the length of the movie. Just sad and blah. It's obvious why Sandra Oh left that jerk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly satisfying low budget film for grownups.","review":"For us adventure lovers, these are the movies I pass on. But the adventure of people finding direction at mid life (no, really, this is high cool), an adventure in the wine country north of L.A., and it being FUNNY and misadventurous at the same time, I can't recommend it more. Watch it with someone you like with a couple of bottles of wine (yep, a wine adventure too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must be Missing Something","review":"I was one of the many people who were very excited to see this DVD, having not being able to see this critically-acclaimed, award-winning movie in the theater.Now, I feel like I should start a support group for people who have seen the movie.I never considered myself a prude but the last 20 minutes of the movie were just too much for me. It may be worth seeing just for the shock value.Also, if you are the type of movie goer that enjoys the \\"happily ever after\\" ending, don't even BOTHER to watch this movie, you will be disappointed.That said, all of the main actors give wonderfully believable performances and the wine country setting is very engaging.I just wish the last twenty minutes were more satisfying and less shocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly overrated.","review":"May I ask, who in Hollywood thinks it's a great idea to make \\"comedies\\" about depressed, self-centered, pasty white guys? The best scene in the movie is when Sandra Oh clobbers the philandering and--did I mention--self-centered Haden Church character. I recommend that you don't always fall for the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well constructed, but...","review":"This is a well-thought out, nicely acted, interesting movie. Unfortunately, I am about a decade too young to really enjoy this movie. I think this movie has a niche appeal - males in their late 30s/early 40s. So I give it four stars, not five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sideways or right side up, its boring","review":"Sideways is about 2 friends who take a week-long trip through California wine country before one of them gets married, and hook up with two hot women. The good things were the acting was excellent and the dialogue was written by a real writer, not some of the hacks that write most of the movies made today. The bad is it was pretty dull most of the time. I've heard this called a comedy masterpiece but I didn't see it. I don't think I laughed out loud once; I smiled and chuckled a few times. I did end up rooting for something good to happen to Paul Giamatti's character in the end, but some of his problems wouldn't have exitsed if he had a backbone. Thomas Hayden Church's character had no redeeming qualities I could see and I saw no reason why the two guys were even friends. There was also a scene that was unnecessarily vulgar. I like some of what they tried to do with Sideways, but it didn't work well enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and well done!","review":"This movie is the funniest I've seen in some time. The performances and writing are first rate. The movie is not about wine, but about the characters and their weeklong journey and experiences while in wine country. I thought it was anything but boring. The dialogue and situations throughout more than make up for the lack of shootouts and explosions. While many seem to have trouble with the characters lack of ethical behavior, this is not a reason to run down the film. Would they prefer any other film where not all characters are perfect?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going Sidesways","review":"With the hype and nominations surrounding this film, I expected more. I thought it would be a very funny, oddball comedy. Instead it rose above your average Hollywood comedy and then went sideways. It may be a case where the previews suggest this film is a pure comedy, but it's not. It's sad and thoughtful. It's very well written, but lacks a true point of view.When you see this film, and it is worth watching, just remember it's going to leave you with more than an empty laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Quality Sub-Par","review":"First and foremost; I want everybody to know that I absolutely love the movie \\"Sideways.\\" That being said, do not waste your money on the Blu-ray edition of this particular film. When I dropped the cash for Sideways Blu-ray edition I was expecting to see sharp, crisp, and beautiful scenes of the Southern California vineyards as well as better sound quality. I didn't get either. What I got instead was a lesson that \\"NOT\\" all Blu-ray DVD's are created equal. There is absolutely \\"ZERO\\" difference between my standard DVD version and the Blu-ray version of the movie.If I had to guess, it may very well go all the way back to the film equipment that was used to film the movie on set and location. Lesson learned for me :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not THAT good...","review":"From earlier reviews, you'd think this was a hilarious movie. It isn't. A few laughs, yes, but overall, a depressing film about two losers in wine (or as one reviewer wrote \\"whine\\") country. Miles' character is so self-pitying, so morose, you just want to smack him. Jack is just a womanizer. It's hard to see how these two would hang out together. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The whole scene with Cammi was just not necessary. I'd lump this one in with The French Lieutentant's Woman, Chariots of Fire and the Accidental Tourist - over-done, over-hyped and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"best film about wine drinking ever","review":"this movie is hilarious! paul giamatti and thomas hayden church are great together and just make the story that much better.

As someone whose family has been in California for seven generations now, it is always a treat to see a movie that shows off the gorgeous scenery of California, including its awesome wineries. And a bigger hoot to spot favorite wineries whose sites were shown in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"too depressing for me","review":"There was some good humor in this movie, but overall I found it to be sad and depressing. I couldn't empathize with the main characters, a failing writer who steals money from the stash in his mother's underwear drawer, and the small-time actor who sleeps around, despite the fact that he is engaged to a woman that he loves and claims to be unable to live without. While I felt some pity for them, I didn't think their plight contained much worth laughing about. There was some hope for one in the end, and several amusing situations, but these did not redeem the film in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known better","review":"I should have known better than to listen to the Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Alas, my wait was for naught. Nothing against any of the actors, they handled their characters with the professionalism expected of actors of their caliber, however, the actual plot was a lost cause. Couldn't have cared less about the plot. It was plopped down without aplomb probably hoping that someone would care about what was happening to any of the characters. Wrong. Didn't Care.

Throw in cardboard cutout womens and wonder why nobody laughs at the \\"humor.\\"(I misspelled \\"womens\\" because they're that irrelevant here.)The one-liners didn't hit their target, the plot is so familiar, and I don't care at all about the characters.

Where was the enjoyment of California wine country?Are we expected to believe that two boring, ugly, aging guys can attract two fabulous, interesting, hot women?

The two main male characters are neither charming nor funny, and the women are -- with the exception of one -- idiots who are so grateful to have the attention of these two losers that it's difficult to watch.

The premise is of a man, Hayden Church, spening his last week being single trying to have sex with anyone he can before his wedding - (his buddy Paul Giamatti goes with him to \\"vacation\\" in the california vineyard area(s))-- Each character has their flaws which the movie focuses on, whereas I was focusing on my dvd players fast-forward button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sideways DVD","review":"No stars for this bum product!

But something it bothered me like with some of the Hollywood movies lately I have watched. It makes some silly propaganda of Armenians in California, like Jewish and Greek propaganda in some of the latest Hollywood movies. It makes me to think as being an American, for these people being Armenian, Greek or Jewish is more important than being an American or being part of an American culture. It's hard to accept an American guy was begging and crying to get married with an Armenian- American girl because her family is rich and her father wasn't pleased because he wasn't of Armenian origin, I couldn't believe the story, I hope the facts were just a part of an imagination not truth.\\"There can be no fifty-fifty Americanism in this country.

I dont get it\\". I dont understand how the critics hailed this movie as one of the best of 2004. A few of the MAIN characters were hard to believe and relate to, and the whole plot of the movie just gave me a headache and and a slap in the face for being so stupid to waste my time and money for renting it.

I thought it was so dull, uninteresting and terribly boring. None of the characters was attractive to me; on the contrary, I always felt them distant and cold. And that's exactly what the movie is, a piece of ice which does not move anybody. I agree 100% in saying that it's a big waste of time and money. It was Oscar nominated? You must be kidding!

There is nothing special about it. The plot is plain. The characters are boderline annoying.

It's a pathetic, chick-flick story of a guy who should have \\"LOSER\\" tattooed on his forehead and another guy who can't keep it in his pants. The loser, a divorced school teacher/wanna be author/wine snob, and his buddy (Thomas Haden Church) head for a week of fun in California's wine country before Church's wedding. Giamatti's character is such a loser he can't get a girl while Church's gets several. Save your money and your time -- skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This movie was awful. It doesn't deserve any stars at all, frankly. First of all, it's about two losers who really should have it more together, as old as they are (stealing money from your mother? PLEASE...).But worst of all, there was the sex. Not even sexy sex. Ugly, pornographic sex, the kind only high school boys and losers would enjoy. Now I'm a big girl and I know what an \\"R\\" rating is supposed to mean, but I really didn't see full-frontal male nudity and porn-flick-style, pumping and groaning intercourse coming (no pun intended). This is the kind of movie you might pick for a date and then be horribly, profoundly embarrassed, so much so that you'd never want to see that date again.

Unfortunately, early reviews of the DVD release on a number of sites are taking the DVD transfer to task, citing a slightly soft image and modest edge halos. I guess what studios don't realize is that this type of thing is what ultimately helps customers decide between making a disc like this a rental or a purchase.

At least, that's my take on it.Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I say it's merlot and I say to hell with it!","review":"What exactly is supposed to be so witty and charming about this \\"little\\" film, which is primarily \\"little\\" in maturity?

His buddy is about to get married but decides that it's his right to go on spree of getting laid as much as possible before exchanging his vows.

But if they dry out or run out, they don't work, and their GREAT disadvantage over chalk is that you can't tell. With chalk, you can tell at a glance whether it will work - and it works equally well right up to the time at which it's too short to hold. With these and other Dry Erase markers, you can't tell at a glance whether or not they will work, and they works less well every time you use them after the first time. Add to this their high cost relative to chalk, and the relative difficulty (and higher cost) of cleaning the board. As a college instructor, I'd rather have chalk.(Does anyone know how to revitalize a dried-out marker? What solvent, if any, would get it working again?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gendron's Version of the Bach Cello Suites","review":"I found Gendron's playing superb but somewhat idiomatic. If one were to be limited to just one version of the Six Suites for Cello, this would not be it but, as a contrasting version it is quite interesting.

Boy did it blow me away. I agree in terms of emotional depth Rostropovich was peerless. But Gendron was certainly no less enjoyable because of the exuberance and his obvious love for Bach's work. He did play some pieces a tad too fast, but the overall flow, the articulateness and vitality of his performance make it an absolute stand-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gendron's artistry unsurpassed","review":"The work of Maurice Gendron on this recording effects a sound from the cello that I have not heard from any of his competitors (Yo-Yo Ma, Du Pre, and others) in the world of solo cello performance. The timbre is rich, deep, and EXTREMELY textured. The sound as a resonant quality exploits the full range of pitch capable on the cello. And what is also remarkable about this particular Bach is that this music is Bach writing for himself; this was not commissioned by any one, not written as a study, not written for his family, etc. This is HIS music, so to speak. I listen to this album more than any other in my collection. I own three: one for my home, one for the car, and one for the office!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Eloquence","review":"Numerous cellists - including Casals, Rostropovich, Fournier, Starker, Bylsma, Maisky, Wispelwey, Linden, Pergamenschikow, Schiefen, Schiff, Onczay, Gendron, and the ubiquitous Yo-Yo Ma - have recorded the complete Cello Suites.Inexplicably, only two of these performers - Rostropovich and Gendron (on the present recording) - seem able to maintain the flow of the music without constantly interrupting the rhythmic pulse with overblown rubato. Between the two, Gendron is perhaps more risk-averse in his approach, reaching fewer emotional highs but nevertheless giving a vigorous and wonderfully fluid performance across the board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sags a Bit, But Still Great","review":"The fifth season of Upstairs Downstairs runs from 1919 to 1930. It is my least favorite series, because 165 Eaton Place just doesn't seem to belong in the Roaring Twenties. Even so, there are some fine moments, but there is a pathos over the whole series. Its like everyone in the cast and crew knew this was going to be the last series and everyone was a bit depressed. Georgina is not very convincing as a flapper, especially when you realize that she'd be in her mid thirties by the time she finally gets married and settles down. The best caste members are Virginia, Lady Bellamy and incorrigible old James, who is as irresponsible as ever. The series ends with the onset of the Great Depression, and the final scenes, as Rose walks through the empty rooms, are unbearably sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upstairs Downstairs Season 5","review":"Unfortunately Amazon sent us 2 seasons 4, instead of the seasons 4 and 5.

Some of the more important topics such as exceptions, staques, and queues are just a few pages long and do not thouroughly explain the purpose of such ADT's. A significant part of the book deals with complex mathematical algorithms that are of no concern to someone just starting out in data structures.I would highly recommend looking into another book dealing with the topic of data structures, such as those by Weiss, Waite, or Main.

Sure, the algorithms are there and fine. But the code given is just an attempt from the devil to perpetuate horrible coding practices on Earth.Avoid this book at all cost, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can find much better than this...","review":"Kinda going off what other reviewers have said, the book has a lot of typos, the code samples are hideous to look at (one-character variable names everywhere, hooray). Indeed the book is similarly confusing to a poorly written Calculus textbook in that, you get the feeling that the author just likes to write a lot and not actually explain anything all that well. I had a Data Structures class based on this book and its pretty safe to say people did their learning with the instructor and tried to avoid the textbook as much as possible. If this is required for a class, I can understand buying it, but if you're doing self learning (then first of all why are you buying a paperback) you can find far better resources than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Data Structures and Algorithms in Java","review":"I am currently using this book in a course at Purdue Univ.

Everybody I talk to here thinks the book is terrible (contradicting what a previous reader from purdue thought). The code is very useless and could be implemented in much better ways. They don't even explain what they are doing in their code! I also found the explaination of induction and big O notation to be patheticly short since that is a big part of the course. A book like this should focus more heavily on this and analyzing different loops to make a determination of their running times in functions. The main point of any book in cs is to provide real programming projects and take the reader through the development of them. This book glosses over very important topics like the ones I mentioned and seems to make it a goal of trying to confuse the reader. In short, there are much better books on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I've been reading this book and find it to be quite dry, and in fact, I don't find the explanations all that enlightening, especially in light of the fact that the errata sheet for this book is probably about 10 pages long, both in Java and English syntax and errors.

I tried to access the student hint server quite a few times and always came away with nothing. I always get a message saying \\"Sorry, no hint available for this exercise\\". If you want a good book covering data structures check out Data Structures and Algorithms in Java by Mitchell Waite ISBN 1-57169-095-6. We used this book in my first-semester Data Structures course. It covers everything in detail and also gives detailed source code. It costs less than Goodrich & Tamassia's Data Structures book, is twice the size of their book, it covers everything that their book covers, and comes with a cd containing sample applets that demonstrate the concepts you are learning as well as the source code for all programs in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever written on the subject!","review":"I have taken Java programming, and feel that I have a strong understanding of the language.However, I'm currently using this book in my CS class and find this book useless for learning Data Structures and Algorithms(ADT). I have recently purchased another book to use as a cross reference to fill in the many holes this book has.While this subject tends to be abstract to begin with, this author takes abstaction to a painful level. This book is not for learning Data Structures and Algorithms, but maybe(I emphasize maybe)useful as a reference book if you know the subject already.With the poor examples and explainations, most of the problems in the book are impossible to do with out some cross reference.Some how I think the author lost sight of who his readers are and the purpose of this book, which should be to explain the subject in detail and at the level of his intended reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ostentatiously Bad","review":"This book, as many have said, is used in numerous introductory courses in computer science. It was recently dropped by my college after it was disowned by the professors who chose it -- we students threw so much scorn on the book no one wanted to admit they had anything to do with it.The book has a very idiosyncratic style. It likes to use some unnecessarily specific class and method names for its examples (e.g. The authors create a binary node class -- BTNode -- for you and then never use it, but go back to their BTPosition class) and fails nearly every time when it attempts to justify certain proofs about big-O and algorithm runtimes. In fact, the authors seem to think it adequate to make a broad statement and then give a simple example.All in all, you're best finding webpages written by random professors than purchasing this morass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for your first exposure to data structures","review":"I just completed my first course in data structures using this text. I do not recommend it if you are trying to solidify the Java you learned in your first programming course. It's very sparse on details. I recommend Main's text instead.On the other hand, I would look at this book AFTER you've completed your data structures course. I think you get the \\"big picture\\" of basic data structures. I would also recommend this book to anyone who is mathematically mature (ie comfortable with abstract thinking) and needs a quick overview of data structures.To summarize, I wouldn't use this as a required text for a course. If your instructor uses this for a course, check it out from the library and buy a copy of Main's text instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad - fairly thorough sampling of the topic - No SOURCE","review":"My only real problem with this very complete book is a the lack of source code. They offer a class library off of their web site that allows you to test some data structures, but without source code, you are left to guess what they did and why. Repeated attempts to get access to the source code to the basic data structures they describe in the book were ignored. Attempts to contact Wiley (the publisher) were also ignored. Good luck on this one. The CD-ROM comes with a scaled back version of Microsoft's Visual J++ 1.1, this is ok, but a bit out of date. There is no source code with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely written, easy to read book.","review":"This book has been used at Purdue for over a year now and the reaction from the students as well as faculty has been very positive. I like the progression of ideas and the level of detail. Most of the topics are well explained.While some readers may find ADTs such as sequences and methods such as removeAboveExternal distracting, they play a useful role in helping students work through a large set of data structures in a single unified framework. So long as the students have a perspective on what is \\"author convention\\" and what is a required concrete data structure, this framework is rather useful.The book gets an enthusiastic thumbs up from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"More faults than the Pacific Rim","review":"After being forced into purchasing this textbook for a course at my school I made a major mistake.

In others the code does the actual exact opposite from what the comments describe. This book has an errata sheet 12 pages long, and it should not be ignored.

There is apparently no code in the text which is compilable (only code fragment) and obvious errors in some of these code fragments. The writing and questions are ambiguous and unclear in many places. I don't see why any university would choose to use this text. Maybe the publisher is giving kickbacks to the department?!?

I would not recommend this book for someone in this position. It has basic descriptions of various MFC classes and what they do, but not exactly how to use them. There is a gap between explaining the classes, and the examples, as the examples are complete programs that uses many classes put together.For example, dialog boxes and control classes are described in Chapter 2, but the first example PROGRAM is in Chapter 5, after drawing, messaging, etc. I would have liked the book to say \\"Here is this drawing function, and this is how you intialize all of the MFC stuff to be able to use it.\\" In fact, the book is more like \\"here is a list of drawing functions, some are used in Example X on page Z.\\"I suspect this book would be useful for a somewhat experienced MFC programmer but I wouldn't buy it as your first foray into MFC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is Misleading","review":"Judging from this book's title I was hoping for some good examples of programming with MFC. While I found this book to be complete and thourough in its information, it was disapointing with its lack of concrete examples. This is not the book for you if you are looking for step by step instruction to learn MFC programming techniques by example. The only reason much of this book made sense to me is because I have already been using MFC on and off for a couple years. The examples provided leave the user to make too many decisions and are vague. There is no rescue if you get backed in to a corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great For Programmers Who Enjoy Wasting Time","review":"Sometimes the author shows the code you need to create a certain result and where to put it. Sometimes he does not. You have to do a lot of second-guessing when you read this book. I even tried looking through the CD to see if I could get the source code in context with the example application--na da, zip! Some of the code is outdated. If you are using Visual Studio 6 or later, forget this book. You will have tons of error messages. This is not the author's fault. This is the fault of those pointy-headed pinheads at Microsoft. They actually think changing the names of classes and functions is some sort of upgrade(lol). The book would be a lot better if it started with a simple application and expanded on that application showing where all the little code snippets go in the source files and how they work. Wouldn't that be nice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This book is very dismal in presentation. Not an interesting read at all. The author tries to cram too much stuff into the chapters haphazardly. It is very painful to grasp the thread of what the topic is trying to tell you, when poorly organized.

It could be done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Viking just loves it","review":"I am a huge fan of Alan Dean Foster and particularly the Spellsinger series. The Moment Of The Magician turned out to be a hard book to find in the secondhand shops in my hometown Cairns in Queensland, Australia. So to finally get it at Amazon at a ridiculously low price was a real boon to me. Although several reviewers seem to have some reservations about the Spellsinger series I'm not among them. Apart from the final book Chorus Skating, which suffers from an incredibly slow beginning, none of the books have really disappointed me. I enjoy the insane things the characters do in these books and I don't mind the episodic nature of them or the fact that talking animals are among the main characters. That just reminds me of storytelling time from my childhood. Good on ya, Alan! So to all those whingers out there, you don't know a good thing when you see one.

I have used several of Collins' lit plans, and without exception I have been pleased with them. They provide me with material that only needs a tweak to match my teaching style.

Mary Collins has solved that with these wonderful LitPlan units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marred by mistakes","review":"I am a high school English teacher, and I have used and been pleased with Collins's unit plan for Huck Finn. I bought this one hoping that it would be equally useful. Unfortunately, I found that it contains several mistakes. The true/false quiz for Act I, for example, contains at least two clear errors (One statement says that Abigail is Parris's daughter and another says that Tituba is Proctor's slave, and these are not meant to be false statements). I gave that quiz to my class without previewing it carefully enough, and there were several disputed answers. I had to promise them not to use the quizzes from this source again! I have found mistakes in other places, too, and I was bothered by Collins's biased tone at times.

I go to class, my head spins because I can't remember anything. There is so much thrown at you. I'd go home and review the moves at my own pace and that process has been tremendously helpful. I trained with a Machado black belt, and the techniques are near identical, which is a big plus. After 8 months of BJJ, I still find the DVD very helpful in reminding myself of the fundamentals.

The chords theyteach are simplified structures that are sometimes taught to childrenwhose hands aren't big enough to reach the proper positions. Theessence of beggining guitar is learning to stretch your hands to chordproperly and finger memory-getting to the point where your fingers hitthe chords without having to think about it.

You can quickly play a song butit doesn't sound right and you'll need to re-learn all yourchords."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"In trying the eMedia Guitar Method 1, I did not expect perfection or the highest quality production. My expectations were unpleasantly accurate, therefore. The software boasts about several songs you will easily learn. The songs, however, are simplified, dummed-down versions of the originals and anything but cool sounding. The poor sound quality (instructor only uses an acoustic, and the lyrical track is recorded much louder than the guitar) and simplicity of programming design leave the consumer unsatisfied. Although the program does present an easy way to learn a few chords and how to strum a guitar, one is better off saving the $49.95 and visiting the local public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Markers Stain the Board","review":"I just mounted my new white board and tried out the four markers in this package. Three of them work just fine, although they have a pretty strong odor. The blue one didn't work at first, and then when it did the color came out blotchy. When I went to erase it, it didn't erase; it just turned a big part of the board a watery blue. I have tried repeatedly to remove the color with white-board cleaner, but I can't get it all out.I had bought two packs of these, so I tried out the second pack just to see if the first one I got was defective. I had the same problem; black, red and green work fine, but the blue stains the board. Clearly, this is not a one-off defect.I'm amazed. Sanford Expo is the leading brand for white-board supplies.

Through her eyes we see glimpses of the growing rebellion against Britain, with the concerns and worries of a daughter for her father, and of a girl becoming a woman.I like the book, and see why it was recommended - however, I think the book would be more a better fit for the grade 6 - 8 age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth it.","review":"Rinaldi has written many wonderful books.

Ann Rinaldis writing technique of this wonderful story may be confusing at times, but it all adds up in the end.

Most of the contributors seem so in love with their own voices that they don't even listen to Ginsberg's.

The book will appeal to the same 2,000 (if that) readers who think Sven Birkerts and Carol Muske Dukes are good writers, all evidence to the contrary.

I write constantly the entire time I'm teaching, and Expo is the only brand that can keep up.However, the newer \\"low odor\\" markers can't compete with the originals. The original markers might carry a strong odor, but they last at least three times as long. I do like the bullet tip over the original chisel tip. It gives someone who's writing a lot extremely rapidly a lot less trouble. The chisel tip gets annoying because it doesn't provide a consistent line. I have to constantly erase and fix skinny lines.

I can only speculate at his methods of writing but to me the final effect was well delivered.Some commentators think this would not be a good introduction to Sharpie. I am not so sure of that.

The time is 1812. The French are retreating from Spain. The British are advancing in Northwest Spain after the Battle of Salamanca, and Sharpe is given the task of guarding a small fort on the flank of the British supply lines. All is well until the French decide to make a surprise attack. The final defense of the bridge somewhat brings to mind Harclay's defense at Boroughbridge in 1322, except Harclay had longbows.

The author paints his picture of the time in VERY broad strokes and really doesn't bother with details. It might be fine as your first reference book on the Elizabethans, but it won't due if you have more than a passing knowledge going in. At $12.95 this book would have been okay. The high price, however, raises expectations and leaves one with the impression that it is going to be a far more informative book. There are better books out there on this topic and they cost far less. Don't buy it at the full price. Don't but it if you are looking for real scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope it gets better...","review":"Like another reviewer, I too am in the SCA. Unlike that reviewer, I found this book wanting based on the first three pages alone! The author makes multiple factual errors, e.g. describing the period from the beginning of Henry VIII's reign to the English Civil War as \\"peaceful.\\" My guess is that Henry VIII's war with France, Elizabeth's persistent problems on the Scots border, and the Armada were deemed insignificant. He describes Mary Tudor's reign as undistinguished and refers to her restorattion of the Catholic church and persecution of Protestants as something of an afterthought. This demonstrates at a minimum that the author has seriously neglected an understanding of the historical reality of the period. This calls into questions anything else that may be brought forward regarding \\"Daily Life.\\" I am reluctant to \\"review\\" a book I have not read, but given the preview on Amazon, I was deeply troubled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry Erase Markers","review":"The markers are markers which write really easily, which is mice, but the spray bottle for the cleaner tends to leak.

I assumed a dry-erase marker would be judged by two criteria: does it write well on my dry-erase board and is it easily erased? Not so fast my friend (er, . . . myself). While these markers meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of odor they produce is totally disqualifying.I have a 3M 24\\"x36\\" dry erase board in my office on which I write simple reminders about what I want to do each week and each day.

There is very little \\"action\\" in the form of fighting or even clear strategizing on the part of the characters. There was a lot of talking and the plot was hard to follow with all the \\"multiverse\\" planes and spheres stuff, traveling through time, etc etc. I never really enjoyed that aspect of Moorcock's books. Some of the wording I found strange, such as the seemingly random way characters either \\"said\\" something (past tense) or \\"says\\" something (e.g. \\"let's go,\\" says Elric).

This is a must read for 70's historians, however most of the involved group (Vietnam Veterans Against The War) have been found to be not actual combat veterans, some not even veterans.

Particularly reprehensible is changing the speed of performances to fit newer recordings to try and trick viewers into thinking they are seeing something new. (The song \\"Easy Listening\\" is the one they use.) It's clear that Idle is completely out of ideas, as he relentlessly and desperately beats old jokes into the ground. The addition of the mysteriously-employed-in-showbiz Jimmy Fallon also should be a warning to everyone.Why Idle felt the need to tell the Rutles story in basically the same way, with basically the same footage, and yet package it as something new is beyond me. Surely he doesn't need grocery money.This is a beyond cynical cash-in attempt by a guy whose glory days are clearly well behind him. This disc is being sold in a very misleading way.

Unlike Spinal Tap where the documentary spends a lot of time in the present, the original Rutles takes place years after the band broke up. There's no more story to tell; there's no reason for a sequel - especially since most clips were already shown in the original.The interviews are miserably bad. Who knew you could have Robin Williams, Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, and Eric Idle and still not deliver a laugh?The more you know about the Beatles, the funnier the original Rutles is. The more you appreciate the original Rutles, the more you should avoid the sequel. This never should have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rutles - Stick with the Original!","review":"It's hard to imagine why this video was even made. It has none of the inspired genius of the original. The only plus is a little new music from Anthology, but all the Rutles footage is old and was on the first one! The only interesting bit was Ron Nasty on Saturday Night Live, and they covered it over with - you guessed it - footage from the original video! The new celebrity interviews were horrible too, and had none of the fun of the interviews in the original. There are no new interviews of the band, no information about what they're doing, either fictional or real, and only a tiny bit of unused material from the original. A great opportunity has been missed, and sorely missed at that!

Yes Eric, we've seen you have the camera run away from you before. Yes Eric, we've seen two reporters fighting over a microphone before. No Eric, it's not any funnier this time.Get the original special, and enjoy that. It's great. This stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives recycling a bad name","review":"This version takes much of the musical footage from the first special and intersperses it with less imaginative, less pertinent, unamusing interview footage. The only reasons to watch this version include (a) you've never seen the original special and can't get hold of it; (b) you care more about James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Steve Martin, Garry Shandling, Conan O'Brien, and other currently-prominent stars than you do about the narrative and parodic coherence of the original version; or (c) you're a completist whose hunger for Rutles material overrides any other consideration.However brilliant the first movie was, however transcendent Eric Idle's comic genius may be, this repackaging suggests that Idle does occasionally have some bad ideas. In this case, some very, very bad ideas. Very, very, very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"Essentially a rehash of the original \\"All You Need is Cash\\" with recycled footage and bits.

Eric Idle's writing and Neil Innes' music in the original were both masterworks. However, this program has all the hallmarks of a \\"let's gather up all the unused footage and see what we can do with it\\" feel. There is some interesting and amusing \\"new\\" (ie, old) footage in this, but that's about all I can say for it. All the good stuff was shot 30 years ago. Spend your Rutles money on Innes' \\"Rutles Archaeology\\" CD. That maintains the quality of the original work. Maybe Eric Idle needed a paycheck and got desperate - I don't know; but this just isn't anywhere near the brilliance of the original. Still, I have every other Rutles CD, album, 45, bootleg, etc., so I had to add this to the collection. Maybe someday I'll get around to watching the second half."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE...BUT, STILL, IT'S THE RUTLES!","review":"I'm dispatching this DVD to the nether reaches of my video collection.

So if you are looking for a wrestling tape this one isn't for you as there are no matches or even reasonably long clips of matches on this tape. It is also only 45 minutes long. The tape is mainly interviews from Andre's friends such as Tim White (wwf ref) and Andre's brother. The narrator was a poor selection (obviously not a wrestling fan)for he had a slightly condescending and patronizing tone that I'm sure most of you are as sick of as I am from non-wrestling fans when they discuss sports-entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but there are better books on microbial disease","review":"Perhaps I was merely spoiled by the book I read right before reading this one (Microbe Hunters by Paul de Kruif), but I found this book thoroughly mediocre both in content and style. The author constantly shifts between 3rd person narrator/teacher, man-on-the-scene, and editorializer, without spending sufficient time as any one of them. In fact, I was often disappointed by the brevity with which each of the book's subtopics was explored. It weighs in at a sparse ~225 pages, large print.Unless you have a particular interest in mosquitoes, I instead recommend Microbe Hunters, a classic (1926?) book on some of the important scientists and discoveries in the early history of microbiology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't answer my question","review":"I had only one question I wanted answered by this book -- why do mosquitos bite some people (such as me!) and not others.

That said, I've tried to read everything I can get my hands on regarding the topic. The Jane Mountain book was just awful. It was written on a fifth-grade level, way too simplified and quite pedestrian. I was surprised since Mountain is a doctor as well as a sufferer. Kay Redfield Jamison, a doctor as well, did a much better job of lending insights into the disorder with \\"An Unquiet Mind\\", a seminal work in the field. I would highly recommend her book as well as the Mondimore book. His was clinical, detailed and insightful. The Mountain book was almost demeaning, it was really dumbed-down. I can't believe the high ranking it got, which is why I bought it in the first place.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! 4 1/2 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have a BREAK-DOWN watching this film","review":"\\"The Break-UP\\" sucked,it went on FOREVER,and I can't think of one scene that was funny.Don't bother to buy this DVD.Its a waste of good money.You really start to get tired of Vince Vaughn's humor,and he wrote and produced \\"THe Break -up,and his entire family was in the movie.Just a big ego trip for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and pointless","review":"I'm a big fan of Vince Vaughn, but he could not rescue this movie.

I really thought this would be better. I understand this is called The Break-Up & we shouldn't have expected a romance. However, life alone is harsh enough, why can't the movies be a little less difficult than real life? I can't even say I feel humored by this movie at all. The previews made it look really funny but it wasn't in any way. Unless you think people hurting each other is funny. I could have dealt with the rest of the movie if the ending wouldn't have left me feeling so empty. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Audiences during that era would not take seriously a story about two immature people nearing forty who still don't have their act together. Jennifer Aniston portrays a woman who may even be too old to have children. The Vince Vaughn character plays video games. Needless to add, everything is always about their selfish pleasures. One cannot imagine either individual engaging in a serious discussion about politics or other major issues. Describing them as merely superficial is perhaps being too kind. This movie inadvertently highlights why Western Civilization may be doomed. There are simply far too many couples that behave in this manner. \\"The Break-Up\\" might compel you to ask a provocative question: Are things really this bad? Take a chance. It's worth two hours of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Reality!","review":"I've had terrible luck with love, but that doesn't mean I want to watch a movie about how much it sucks!

This seems to me to be an excuse to make a Jennifer Aniston movie and she doesn't shine in it at all. However, Vince is delightful - but, that doesn't make up for the silliness of this movie. I'm really grateful I rented it with \\"ONE BOX\\" and didn't pay to buy it, will never be interested it watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two solid actors ... one lousy script.","review":"Vince Vaughn is hilarious as a comedic actor and Jennifer Aniston is as talented as she is beautiful. One would think that this is a recipe for a landmark romantic comedy. As many have said, neither romance nor comedy exists herein. I blame this on a preachy script that is apparently written from a woman's point of view. The story is old, but seldom told: Man spots attractive woman. Woman attracted to man's clever come-on. A fun courtship commences and the relationship progresses. Couple moves in together. Domestic issues anger woman. Woman attempts to remodel man in her ideal image. Friction ensues. Ultimately, the movie culminates in a preachy tone that men need grow up and conform to the more mature domestic wishes of women or risk losing them forever. It seems a little condescending, but it is scary in its realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd break up with him too!","review":"The Break-Up starring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston is an unfunny, boring, and tepid film. The only reason I am giving this film two stars instead of one is because Aniston has never disappointed me acting wise. For me, she has never given a bad performance no matter how terrible the script was. Vaughn on the other hand is so annoying in this, he's just a bad actor - I don't understand what Aniston saw in him off-screen? He has no appeal and you just want to punch him in the face! I just hated the lame premise, there was no point to this film - such a waste of time. Bravo to Aniston for keeping me half interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you think....it's a lot better than that.","review":"This is not a date movie.It's the anti-date movie.

It's as if the writers couldn't decide what they wanted to do with the story and the director couldn't decide just when to end it. It got to the point where I kept thinking \\"okay, this is how they're going to end it\\" but then it went on for another 1/2 hour or 45 minutes. They even included scenes that could have ended up on the cutting room floor and no one would have noticed. I love Jennifer Aniston but was very disappointed with this movie.

His work is very funny and inventive for the most part...\\"Wedding Crashers\\" for example. But, though he has some bright and crazy moments in \\"The Break Up\\" his humor is muted and along with the charming Jennifer Aniston he is asked to mostly bellow and wheeze through a poorly written script.The best Romantic comedies like the recent \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" (Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant) are smart, move quickly and feature funny second bananas. There is some heat between Aniston and Vaughn, the supporting cast is mostly good but after the first hour or so \\"The Break Up\\" falls apart and the situation between Vaughn's Gary and Aniston's Brooke degenerates into cruelty and not \\"The War of the Roses\\" intelligence-based, surrealistic cruelty but cruelty based on disrespect which is simply unpleasant to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the video game Vaughn was playing","review":"Vince Vaughn plays the role he always seems to be playing, fast-talking, testosterone-loaded male stereotype, and Jennifer Aniston grims her way through yet another personality-free performance in this yawner of a comedy-drama about two Chicago lovers in the process of breaking up. It would probably have been more entertaining to watch the rats swim in the Chicago River, for the movie peaked out when Aniston stiff-walked through a nude scene. Oh well, at least there were some nice shots of Chicago, and gangbangers will be on the lookout for the video game Vaughn was playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical New Hollywood Movie","review":"Just another movie that relies on publicity and advertising in order to get people to watch a sub-par movie.

Watching this loser movie in person only confirmed my suspicions: Vince, stay with your acting, man. The question? How did your additional roles in this movie (in addition to acting that is) contribute to it?From beginning to end, it is one big self-gratification project for Vaughn and I'm sorry that Aniston lend herself to the role of Brooke. The storyline is poorly developed from the confusing beginning to the extremely anticlimactic ending. Jennifer has had much better roles, and I am very surprised that she would lower herself so much. I don't need to get into all the details, other people have done that already. But if you really want to see an incomplete story of a poorly matched couple's breakup, be my guest. Or perhaps your girlfriend (as in my case) really wants to see it and you really can't talk her out of it... Otherwise, save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing and not funny","review":"I went to the theatre to see these two great actors do a humorous theme, but was really dissapointed. The potentially humorous scenes were just thrown away into pointless arguments with no humor or redeaming qualities at all. The scenes could have really left us laughing if they were put together well, but you'll be crying, not laughing after viewing this film. Some of the lesser supporting actors got more laughs in the show than the big named stars. These actors are both favorites of mine and they both have a natural charm and humor, but this film does absolutely nothing for them and their talents were wasted in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an absolute piece of GARBAGE!","review":"Just finished watching this ghastly, awful movie!

It's like when you have to walk on eggshells around your house when your parents argue. Very tense.I watched the whole movie, waiting patiently for the \\"romantic\\" part of the movie to start. I expected the two characters to get over their differences, realize that they still loved each other, and get back together. The ending was not what I expected. It felt empty, hollow, and unfinished. Awkward. A very awkward ending; just like the meeting between the two characters at the end of the movie. Awkward.

This is one of the movies that by seeing the preview and getting expectations than watch the movie and its completely the opposite then anything you thought it would be. I was really disapointed in this movie, I wanted Jen to actually stay with the guy in the end, but instead they chose the 'easy' Hollywood way out. Just a mirror image of the lifestyle of those that don't communicate, don't work hard to keep a relationship together, and probably botch it up the most because they live together with no commitment. If you want to learn how to give up on someone, this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pointless waste of time.","review":"The Break-Up has Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston in the leading roles and their talents carry those roles well. The characters are not over the top but given realistic presentations. Unfortunately, this is where the good points of the movie stop. The story failed to carry any message, it failed to enlighten, it failed to inspire, it simply failed. The audience was merely given the opportunity to see a relationship disintegrate as though we can not see that enough in real life. Gosh, thank you so much. Even the meek attempt made to reconcile is met with a sudden change of heart, but the story fails to adequately develop the basis for this change and so the inevitable ending is reached.

It certainly wasn't a comedy and was hardly romantic. The two characters were bitter, dysfunctional, angry and totally hopeless. The back cover called it Charming and Hilareous, a great Date Movie - who wrote this stuff and what had they been drinking? If you watch this with someone they'll probably dump you.

I'm not saying there's nothing funny in the film, but the weight of the funny moments compared to the rest of the film is very small. If you buy the DVD, you will be paying to hear Vince Vaugh say GD 20-30 times. The movie leaves you with nothing to take with you. There is nothing about it that would make me reccommend it to a friend.

They didn't break up over that one thing.I was disappointed in the ending, but then had to remind myself of the title of the movie - and so it was appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Acting was Good, but the story weak and the ending was awful","review":"As the others have said, I was expecting a romantic comedy and got a drama that had some laughs. The funny parts were funny, but the dramatic story was boring and the ending was blase. The high point was Jennifer Anniston's acting. She was great and could have done wonderful things with a better script. I think the problem with the movies she's come out with is that she is not choosing the right projects for herself. Vince Vaughn was good as well, but again the story was awful, and he could not save this movie. I would still see another movie by these two if they ever make one together again because they are very good actors and could do brilliant things with a better script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not romantic. Not very funny. Not a good drama...quite depressing.","review":"This was billed as a romantic comedy yet it's everything but. Aside from a couple of laughs, the movie was upsetting. The only thing I'll say about the ending is this: Want to ruin your day? Go ahead and buy or rent this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's two hours we're not getting back","review":"While my husband and I watched this unsatisfying, loosely-strung together, boring-fest, he fell asleep. When he woke up 15 minutes later he remarked, \\"Looks like I didn't miss anything.\\"He was right. One can easily watch the first and last 10 minutes of this movie and then do something constructive with the rest of the time.This one star rating goes to the character, Marilyn Dean, who is the only character in this unemotive, string of half laughs, who displayed any type of comedic edge.Do Sukodu or something else instead of watching this time thief."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down!","review":"Another so-so movie for the lovely, talented and Oh-So-Sexy Jennifer Aniston. It's becoming obvious that Ms. Aniston has trouble choosing scripts as well as men. I had high hopes for this film, but it just never peaked. I ended up being bored and feeling sorry that JA was playing second fiddle to another B level leading man. Hell they even gave Mr. Vaughn lead billing over her. Jennifer is a bonefide A list leading lady and if she's going to keep doing romantic films she needs to insist on leading men of her own star stature or else pick a vehicle that she can run with as the solo star. Did she really date that duphus?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it??????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage I have ever seen. Aniston's character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him. That is total nonsense. I expected them to get back together in the end. Real people do not behave like this. Or maybe they do... it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy at all","review":"the description said new and never used i had view it for the first time and all it did was skip and was fuzzy. I was not pleased at all with the DVD, but i can say it came pretty fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift","review":"I bought this as a gift for someone, consequently I don't know about the movie itself. It came very quickly....the service was great as was the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure why watching a dysfunctional couple is so funny","review":"There are some hilarious moments in this movie, but overall it just reminds me of watching a dysfunctional couple, which is more irritating than funny. It seems the script just finds a bunch of frivolous reasons for Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn to fight, and then lets them yell their heads off. Think of divorced parents fighting, and you'll get the idea. The Break-Up just doesn't do a good job of drawing out the humor of the situations, and instead comes across as a bit too serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"It's not a bad idea: a movie not about how a couple meets and falls in love, but about the demise of their relationship. The problem is the execution. I just never bought that Aniston's character would fall for Vaughn's. Come on, no woman who loves art and works in an art gallery could be with a man who thinks Michelangelo painted the \\"sixteenth Chapel.\\" And let's not even mention the fact that his character is a fat slob and that Vaughn looks like a mailman. I spent most of the movie hoping she'd get as far away from Vaughn as possible, and the ending (both versions) left me absolutely cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Break-Up (Full Screen Edition)","review":"In Chicago, the art dealer Brooke Meyers feels not appreciated and neglected by her immature boyfriend Gary Grobowski, who is partner of his two brothers in a tourism business, and decides to break-up with him to make Gary misses her. Gary misunderstands her true intention, both follows the wrong advices of family members and friends, beginning a war of sexes with no winner. The movie definitely has its funny moments. This movie is convincing and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking up is hard to do","review":"Jennifer Anniston and Vince Vaughn star in this movie which is labeled a romantic comedy. Neither the word \\"romantic\\" nor \\"comedy\\" can easily be applied to this film. It is the anatomy of the breakup of a relationship. She feels that she does everything for him and he doesn't appreciate it and he wants more freedom and space to do his own thing. What starts out as a simple squabble becomes frought with past baggage from the relationship and each of the partners does his/her best to hurt and ignore the other one. They continue to share their condo since neither one wants to move out, and this movie becomes drearier as it goes on. Don't rent it if your looking for a light and enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be misled","review":"This is a terrible movie, totally misrepresented on the package as a good date movie. If your idea of a good date movie is to watch people tearing into each other and addicted to the pain, by all means go for it! The whole premise was absurd from the beginning and I couldn't bear to watch the middle of the film. I did watch the ending, just to see how it came out and was sadly disappointed that it sort of trailed off and left me as unsatisfied as the beginning did. No real resolution. I like closure in a movie, and this one simply did not satisfy on any point. A real waste of Jennifer Aniston, and a totally mismatched cast. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More chemistry in a Microbiology lab","review":"What an unsatisfying movie; kept wondering every 15 minutes of the movie whether it would get any better. What a waste of Jennifer Aniston's talents (though this movie proves that she is infinitely better-looking than Angelina Jolie!). No chemistry between Aniston and Vince Vaughn whatsoever. NOT a romantic comedy because it lacks both: romance and comic. If you like Aniston, watch 'Rumor Has It' instead; it is infinitely better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Terrible movie- had to force myself to sit through the hole thing. Don't waste your time..or your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Hated It","review":"Wow. This movie has a place on my all time worst movies list.Which characters are likable? None. Not even the side characters. OK I enjoyed seeing the man from CSI act in his usually, goofy way.A horrid movie that tries to make light of a couple breaking up. It could have been funny. The concept has potential. Instead we see them make fools of themselves in ways that aren't humorous. They take turns trying to 'stick it' to the other person. Let's see how badly we can hurt the other person's feelings and make them regret that they are broken up. I didn't laugh once during any of their attempts.What did they learn? How did they change? (He improved a smidge) What was the point of this awful train wreck?I begged for it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie","review":"Enjoyed movie. There was never a dull moment and every scene makes you laugh. This is a movie I will watch several times. Everyone should enjoy it from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I wasted my time!","review":"This wasn't a very entertaining movie at all. I guess I am one that likes to be happily entertained when I actually find the time to spend ~2 hrs in front of a movie and this just didn't do it. I was annoyed most of the time I watched it. The ending stunk too. Like another reviewer pointed out, Jennifer A.'s character had all these things she wanted him to learn, and then, when he 'goes there', she still walks away. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Movie","review":"They do nothing but fight, bicker and and finally break up. What a waste of film, time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"god awful...","review":"With such a good cast, you would think this movie would be good, But its just plain terrible. It's more drama /dark comedy that a regular comedy. There is a funny part about every 25 minutes but overall this is almost painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPIDLY BORING","review":"This was the biggest waste of my time and money. You keep sitting through the movie thinking, \\"ok, it is going to get better. They are actually going to work it out.\\" And then, the disappointing end comes and you wonder what was the story supposed to be about anyway: How people can hurt each other? How well people can fight and nag each other? How expressing your true feelings in the end doesn't get you anywhere? What a waste of talent for these actors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This was a pretty funny movie, and it was kind of a drama to, but more of a comedy. this was a pretty good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips gives the listener buried treasure in this release.","review":"This recording is buried treasure for two reasons. First, for the person that may be unfamiliar with Gorecki, this piece is a good introduction. The multi-layered, fugal texture of the first movement with lush strings is wonderful. The second reason for this recording being buried treasure is the ensemble itself. I recently attended a concert in Warsaw and heard Maestro Kord conduct the Warsaw Philharmonic. My opinion is that they are perhaps one of the most underrated orchestras in Europe. My choice of recordings did not dissapoint. Kord's ensemble plays with conviction,the tone of the strings is second to none. The soprano,Joanna Kozlowska sings beautifully, the voice is strong from top to bottom. One could only hope that Philips would record more the this great orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compassionate companioning","review":"In this easy to read little book Dr Wolfelt, an incredibly empathic thanantologist, gives us down to earth ideas on how to survive the grieving process.

It had been recommended to me by the educational coordinator of the SANE course I took."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"That was my wife's initial reaction to this book. It was recommended by SANE-A and SANE-P instructors. A great learning tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A second helping of puzzles","review":"I need to thank my friend, Vivian Lee, who sent me as gifts both books, Kakuro Challenge 1 and Kakuro Challenge 2. I have already reviewed Kakuro Challenge 1, and Kakuro Challenge 2 is very similar . Once again one gets a generous helping of 200 kakuro puzzles, ranked in four categories of difficulty. The layouts and difficulty are about the same as in Challenge 1. As you follow your way through the puzzles you will soon find yourself back in old familiar places, such as the intersection of 7-in-3 block with a 4-in-2 block and the friendly attraction of an 11-in-4 block intersecting a 14-in-2 block.When Alastair comes out with a third kakuro challenge, let us hope that he corrects the last paragraph in the introduction, adds some more advanced hints about using subsets of numbers, and widens the range of puzzle layouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kakuro Challenge 2","review":"If Sudoku is boring you, this is the game you should try. I would advise you try an easier version before buying this one. Puzzles are clear, easy to read, large squares. One drawback in this book, however, is that there is either too little a margin or too much print on the edges, hampering writing notes. A minor problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a challenge","review":"This is a disappointing puzzle book. The puzzles are small - easy to complete in a short sitting.

While I give credit to Mr. Sullivan for his intent, this is a poorly written and illustrated book. It lacks depth, has a profound bias, and many other serious shortcomings. For example, the chapter on \\"Child Protection Software\\" fails to even mention any of the top software packages available to parents, i.e., Surf Watch, Net Nanny, or Cybersitter among others. It has all the appearance of a serious case of \\"selling out\\" to the few software companies mentioned. In addition, the \\"Further Resources\\" section at the end of the book is a wasteland. It contains few useful \\"resources\\", and many of those it does have are geared toward law enforcement, not parents. This is just not a very good book and I strongly recommend you look elsewhere. If you are still interested, wait for it to come to your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too big!","review":"It's got any term you need in computer and electrical engineering, but it also has an extra 50,000 terms!

The editor obviously has a feeble grasp of terminology concepts and of computers themselves, so the entries are not really terms, but words picked up somewhere, god knows where.

I read half the book, and it was still kind of slow so I thought, I'm only half way through it so it will probably get better... Well let me tell you, It DIDN'T!

This book dealt with family issues and as a reader i enjoy a historical book or a thrilling novel.

It rings loudly and never really tune in to each component of the sound system.My advice is that if you are looking for a wireless microphone that you will be using quite a few times, invest into something better.

The 9V battery is very hard to get into it compartment for the remote unit, and even harder to get cover on the same. Needed to replace it the 2nd week and couldn't find any 9V battery to fit in compartment. The unit is noisy during use and the audio is distorted and hollow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend these!","review":"I purchased these for use on a stand alone 500W Pyle PA system and they induced noise and had horrible voice quality. I did purchase two units and received both the red and the green led units and they worked together fine but the quality of the produce is just poor and then static which was produce from the units which made them very undesirable for me. I repacked them and returned them the same day I received them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk is cheap.","review":"I was never really able to get this to work properly aside from squealing and crackled feedback.

Thankfully Amazon has a good return policy. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance","review":"Didn't function well. Poor transmission.

I had an issue at first that I was getting feedback when I was too far away from the sound system. However, the antenna was laying on the floor.

I also like the fact that it is not a headset. I would highly recommend this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk","review":"This mike doesn't even work well a Pyle amplified PA system. Battery covers will not stay on.

In fact if you're expecting it to be a bit good you're in for a disappointment. But still there's enough action for it to pass as worthy of its main character being Superman. Plus I don't like magic very much. If you have magic powers why don't you make a spell that kills Superman.

At this point they are still within the days that they promise but have not shipped from what I can tell.Terrible customer service in my opinion. I wonder if we will ever get the book. Everyone knows these text books are being used for school so why would they take so long to ship. I ordered 6 books using amazon and have been thrilled with all execpt this one.

As my husband has cholesterol problems with a bad family history, I was eager to read it. I thought it was fascinating and so did my husband. I never understood insulin resistance before. He shared it with his doctor and now his whole approach to cholesterol control has changed. I appreciated the fact that this is not a trendy book. It's solid and filled with facts and research while being clear and readable. I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with high cholesterol or anyone with a family history of heart problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise, GREAT BOOK","review":"I am very impressed with Dr. Reaven's book about Syndrome X. Finally, a book that makes sense. With all of the diet fads and contradictory information available, its wonderful to get a smart, well-researched opinion on healthy eating and heart disease."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"There is something wrong with this book. My wife and I know something about nutrition. Reaven's book recommends a diet high in \\"good fats,\\" but he fails to distinguish between good omega-3 fats and bad omega-6 fats. He also recommends a diet with an astronomically high 45% carbohydrate, but he doesn't explain the difference between refined and unrefined carbohydrates. Reaven may have done a lot of research on Syndrome X, but I don't think he has any idea how to treat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tough Read","review":"The literary style made this very difficult to read; I was constantly drifting off. Also, despite all the explanations, this diet is basically the Mediterranean Diet. If you're interested in that, Low-Fat Lies: High Fat Frauds and the Healthiest Diet in the World by Kevin Vigilante and Mary Flynn is MUCH easier to read and use. Also they stress using heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, since polyunsaturated fats have been linked to colon cancer, something Reaven seems to have overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough read and a bad plan","review":"I found this book hard to get through. It reads more like a medical textbook than a consumer book. Reaven's \\"Syndrome X Diet\\" also doesn't make much sense, but I decided to give it a fair try. I ended up hungry virtually all the time and actually gained several pounds. If I would have kept on the diet, I'm certain my weight problem would have gotten even worse. Reaven may have coined the term \\"Syndrome X,\\" but as far as I'm concerned he's just another doctor who doesn't know much about nutrition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulin Resistance should cause weight loss?","review":"Dr Reaven believes insulin resistance does not cause obesity. In fact he believes if anything insulin resistance should cause weight loss. His diet is a low calorie diet, consisting of 15% protein, 45% carbohydrates, and 40% fat (of which only 5%-10% should be saturated fat). Anybody that gets the first part so wrong, how can the rest be trusted?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, but frustrating","review":"This book is the real thing. It's scientifically based, definitely not faddish information. I knew I had Syndrome X when I read the first few pages of it.However the diet is hard to follow. You have to constantly eat in the percentages he recommends, even when snacking, and that's not easy to do. I would also appreciate some tips on how to plan meals using the right percentages. Also as others have said, Dr. Reaven doesn't emphasize the importance of Omega 6 fatty acids enough. The book is a terrific summation of the research, but the dietary advice is frustrating to try and follow. I hope that soon some registered dietician will write a book on how to plan menus and adapt my own recipes meeting these guidelines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself now!!","review":"Do not buy this book! It was terrible. I got a headache trying to decipher what the jumbled letters and punctuation marks were intended to be. There is little original thought, and that small amount is Omoike's opinion on an issue. I wish I could give it zero stars. I bought this book for a college paper and I'm not sure if I can find any usuable quotes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this was published!","review":"If you are looking for a thoughtful analysis of the Columbine tragedy, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.

I can't believe someone was paid to write this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Dear! This is dreadful!","review":"What can I say about Isaac Omoike's book on the Columbine High School massacre? It is the most amatuerish effort at a serious treatment of a serious subject that I have ever seen. Full of grammatical and spelling errors,reading it will drive anybody that graduated from the third grade or higher nuts. Mr. Omoike only takes until page 9 to begin sermonizing about the REAL cause of society's ills: too many guns! It is so simple! Why didn't I think of that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Problem With Inexpensive Publishing...","review":"...is that junk like this ends up on the shelves and there are few ways for consumers to know beforehand that they're wasting their money. I'm a public school teacher who would have refused to grade this had one of my students turned it in. This book was unedited, full of incorrect facts, missing pages, and more. Don't waste your money or your time trying to plow through a book that should never have been published.School violence is a huge problem in the US and I know that many people are looking for books that dive into the topic. Find one that's worth it...this one is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"What a colossal waste of paper, time, and money! This book, if you can call it a book, was the most poorly written and edited document that I have ever had the misfortune to order. It offers absolutely nothing new to understanding the events of Columbine and the two people who carried out the violence. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding detective work again and double exposure","review":"Again contrary to expectations and to those who want to hide the truth, Omoike does it again. With outstanding detective work and analysis, he throughly exposes the real cause of violence in our schools. It is time some of these readers start being truthful to themselves and deal with teaching our kids real value. Ironic most of Omoike's analysis was research based on excerpted (quotations) from Denver Post and I had little time to look at low budget typographical errors. I was focused on the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE RICH GIRLS","review":"I loved Rich Girls on MTV with Ally Hilfiger and Jamie Gleicher. I actually met Jamie and I will tell you that no matter what you hear, she is SUCH A SWEET person. She even left me a voicemail and gave me an autograph. She told me that her and Ally are still Best Friends and not to believe what you read in the magazines. But I do think that people should buy this DVD, it is a great show and the theme song is so catchy!! haha I would also recommend POPULAR season 1!! GREAT SHOW also, Rich Girls, Friends and Popular are the best shows. ANYWAY rich girls is great and you will love the show. Even though they are Rich they are such nice people! Enjoy. Thanks amazon.com for putting out such great STUFF!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RICH GIRLS","review":"I like the rest of you, found my way to this page looking for the MTV reality series \\"Rich Girls\\" on DVD. I must say its refreshing to know there are so many others out there that want the show to come out on DVD as I've been hoping for for years.

I mean COME ON, I'm sad to know that I'm among a group of such ditzes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Girls Rules!!!","review":"Hola hola coca-colas! Where do we begin? First of all, we would argue that this was the best show of the Fall 2003 season, and surprisingly it was on MTV. Jaime and Ally represent an ideal friendship. The show was very realistic, when you set aside the fact that they are extremely rich, because it showed the ups and downs of friendship and teenage life. Even though they are of higher class, they're still good people and the show really proves it. We recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for good laughs and an insight to teenage life from the perspective of rich girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"I NEED TO GET RICH GIRLS I LOVE IT!!!!","review":"I LOVE Rich Girls! Even though i can't get it yet since it is out of stock, i am hoping that AMAZON.COM will re-stock it. I know they will since it is such a big hit.

I love Ally too but I have never met her, I hope to some day!! Rich Girls was amazing, and i LOVE it!!! I LOVE JAMIE AND ALLY!!

The characters were ordinary types, and I found it tobe accessible in a way that a lot of books with heavy mystical contentaren't. It's a fast-paced read and the author's a great writer--prettyperceptive in her descriptions of the other characters, and often herself. II thought it was a fortifying read overall, and a fair portrait of theexcitement and problems that go along with the spiritual path. The ending'ssignificant, but I won't say more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too New Age for Pagans, Too Pagan for New Age","review":"I purchased this book after reading the first few pages and perhaps I should have read further. The author asks much from the reader concerning her experiences with the supernatural,she seems to be trying to be a Casteneda without the trippy medicines. I found the writing to be quite good, but could not follow her ideas as well as I would have liked.Everyone she hangs out with is given a significance in her private pantheon, being replaced as they move on. Re-kindling the Celtic mysteries with your friends while looking down on neopaganism makes me wonder exactly who this book was meant for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling for Arianrhod!","review":"I was recommended this book by my spiritual mentor, because my Patron Goddess is the Welsh Moon Goddess Arianrhod.

Thrilling! Are the first 3 words that come to my mind in just a few seconds. I enjoyed the graphics and the pace of the game, its not slow and it is not too fast. And I like the fact that there is a combination of different adventures, challenges and themes. The different amazingly colorfull worlds are all unique and beautiful. You have got to try this game out, its worth it to the last penny. I am glad that some developers still create games such as Rayman 2, with no violence and rage, but colorful, nice, warm and adventurous fun where the whole family and their friends can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Graphics, Good Story, Better than Mario 64","review":"First, the graphics are the best I've seen. There is actual mist above the water in the marshes and waterfalls. The ponds ebb and flow, the clouds roll by with a distinct realism, and the streams flow realistically, as do the bubbles and splashes. Shadows are realistically placed. The con to this game, if any, is the sometimes uncooperative camera, and the predetermined save points. Although, playing the levels more than once is enjoyable. I have 128mb ram, a tnt2 video card, a 40x cd rom, and digital sound card, with pIII 500mhz processor. runs perfect, no glitches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great gameplay, but lousy structure","review":"This is a great game on many levels - but has a terrible structure for all but the most hardcore of time-losing gamers. The big problem with this game is that you can only save at the end of levels - and some are massive. So your only options are to either play through the entire level (some take hours), or quit part of the way through and start over at a later date. If you don't have lots of time to dedicate to this game, then you should steer clear. The sanctuary of lava, for example, requires at least 2 hours to clear properly - and remember NO SAVING! It's too bad that such a wonderful game has such a fatal flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Solution","review":"This bicycle seat cover is the perfect answer to my problems.

It is nothing like the true military (I served, I know) and most of the episodes have little or nothing to do with military law or the kinds of things that JAG officers actually do.

Suffice it to say that it has rapidly become my favorite set of 20th century symphonies (a lofty statement, but I really love this music). The symphonies are lyrical but tautly constructed, easy on the ear but intellectually challenging. Rubbra's symphonies don't really sound like anybody else's, but I'd portray them as a cross between Walter Piston's intelligence and Vaughan Williams's lyricism. Not much dissonance, but enough ear-tickling sonorites to make it interesting from the start of #1 to the end of #11. Great performances, great recording. All in all, a set to treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"the elusive republic","review":"The book was assigned by my history professor. The book is very hard to understand.

Because she uses mostly traditional acoustic instruments , Ginger maintains a soothing style which reminds me somewhat of soundtrack selections from the film \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou.\\" My favorite tune is \\"Sipsey,\\" a beautifully performed song that should become a classic. Ginger's unique, bluesy vocals add real soul to the effort. \\"Angelina Baker\\" also infuses some great bluegrass into this wonderful CD.

Who better to ask about God, love, evil, and suffering than Leonard Cohen, Nick Cave, David Lynch, Werner Herzog, or Tom Waits?

Not.","review":"In my opinion, the authors should introduce evidence in The Evidence rather than making bold, uncorroborated statements in Questions to Consider (thus tainting the evidence with bias); however the authors are prone to guiding the reader to a pre-chosen conclusion. This, to me, is unconscionable in a book purported to help students become critical thinkers. The authors apparently use a different definition for \\"critical thinker\\" than I am familiar with. In truth, the book intends to be censor morum, teaching the student to become a politically-correct thinker.I loved reading The Evidence but I can really do without the editorializing in the other sections of each chapter. Allow the student to come to his own conclusions, I say. Unfortunately (or fortunately, rather) not all textbooks are equal.Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I have had this windlass on my 26' Crownline for part of last season and most of this one and it has caused me to cuss. As you notice it is rated for a boat up to 29ft. Most of the time the rope slips in the gear (someone has to put their foot or hand on the black lever to help the gear grip the rope) When it gets to the chain you can forget it grabbing at all! Yesterday I had to pull the anchor in by hand ( not the first time )and then use the windlass to feed the rope and chain into the anchor locker. I am using the 3 strand 1/2\\" rope and 1/4\\" chain like it calls for. I have only kept it on my boat this long because I haven't wanted to drop a $1,000.00 on a better windlass.

Talk about being a captive audience! The premise appears to be this: a ditsy blonde goes to Washington to pass legislation against animal-testing. All well and good, but the perkiness and bubblyness and blondness and all the pink, pink, pink outfits -- including her dog's! -- really start to get tiresome, FAST! I shut off my headset, thereby eliminating 50% of the irritation. But there's still all that PINK...! Yikes! The other annoying thing about this film is, it seems to go on darn near as long as the international flight. I actually found Aeroflot's destination maps and altitude/airspeed info more entertaining than this inane in-flight movie offering.

Reese Witherspoon gives an outstanding performance again of Elle Woods, the Delta-Nu sorority queen turned Harvard Law graduate. The movie features an all-star cast including Sally Field, Regina King, Luke Wilson, and an outstandingly quirky performance by Bob Newhart. It also features less known names but still familiar faces like Jessica Cauffiel and Alanna Ubach. This movie brings about the serious issue of laboratory animal testing but yet the movie is light, breezy and fun. Sally Field brings her wonderful acting ability to the movie and you will not be disappointed in it. The movie is not just for animal lovers (as Bruiser the chihuahua along with other dogs are featured throughout)but to people who love happy endings, comedy, love stories, women accomplishment, and for standing up for what you believe in against opposition. Add in very smart coloring and lighting, location, and a great music accompaniment and the movie is a worth 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst movie I have seen, but its close","review":"I am writing this to save people some money. I liked the first movie and found it cute and funny and purchased the DVD for my sisters. This movie is terrible. I think they started shooting it before they had a script. My wife and I saw it because we figured that Reese Witherspoon would not damage her credibility with an awful product. We had typically low expectations for a sequel going into it, but even those reduced hopes were let down. ... Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Stupid Movie","review":"I couldn't even finish this movie. Just too stupid.

I guess PETA members could like it but for the rest of us, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE OUTTA BE A LAW...","review":"...against bad sequels, and this one is bad, despite the comedic deftness of Reese Witherspoon. Not even she can save a screenplay that is this bad. It lacks the snappy dialogue and clever madcap situations that elevated the prequel into the ranks of successful screwball comedies. This sequel simply tanks, in spite of Ms. Witherspoon's ever present, personal winsomeness. Despite her, this film falls flatter than a pancake, which is a shame, since the original Legally Blonde movie had been so charmingly funny.Unfortunately, this film is quite disappointing and simply not in the same league, despite the casting of the original star and some of the original supporting cast. Not even the addition of Sally Fields and Robert Newhart elevates this drivel to a film worth watching. Moreover, if you are not a fan of Reese Witherspoon, you should deduct one star from my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reese & Sally: What were you thinking?!?!","review":"Awful! How could you assemble the original cast and still come up with such a turd? Who wrote this thing? It is awful!

AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I purchased this DVD a few years ago and still have not watched it all. I really enjoyed the first Legally Blonde movie. I am a fan of Reece Witherspoon and have several of her movies in my DVD collection.I found her performance as Elle totally over the top! Who ever wrote this script turned Elle into some kind of superhuman. Elle has the ability to change how Washington operates just by being Elle. (complete with the stupid snap cup congress voting routine)Although the cast was great, the script and the directing was sub-par. The director added a pink glow above Elle's head whenever she was in a scene.This was pointed out by the director in the DVD extra segment.Did he get this idea from Touched by an Angel? Thank goodness they never made Legally Blonde 3.Although Elle Woods' movie career maybe over,Reece Witherspoon's career continues to shine!I believe she has totally outgrown her Legally Blonde chararcter."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE FIRST MOVIE WAS BETTER!!","review":"I was very excited about there being a 2nd movie in the Legally Blonde series. Oh boy, this movie was not only sick but a little insulting. I watched about 5 min. of this movie it seamed all right till I finally realized the plot!! Elle Woods trying to save her dogs mom from being put to sleep. I thought all right it's gought to get better. NOPE!!, She finally finds out that her dog is gay. I really wouldn't recommend this movie to you only because of very unrealistic cornier than the first movie!!

The story plot was based on dogs,and the movie was very unbelieveable.The best characters in the movie were dogs and I'm not even sure If I like dogs. This movie has failed to become humorus. Inless you you want to be tortured and have a life full of misery, don't touch this cruel worthless item. The movie lacked a good cast, a decint story,Humore,and likingness.

I went to see this at the theater, psyched that it was going to be a repeat of the first. I was wrong. The first one is so much better than this. The only thing they are doing here is trying to pass the 'bruiser bill', which is not a very interesting subject for this sequel.

However, the attempt to revive vivacious Elle Woods highly disappointed me. Reese Witherspoon is an extremely talented actress and played her role well, but not even Reese's infectious Elle could hold up the plot. Her performance is the reasoning behing my two-star rating--without her it would have been a one! The script lacked the humour so evident in the first LB installment and quite frankly I don't remember laughing once. I found this movie so disappointing because I know it could have been so much better. Buy the first one instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully stupid!","review":"Being a fan of the first 'Legally Blonde' I was excited to see 'Legally Blond 2 Red, White & Blonde'. Oh, my...the movie actually hurt me! It was painfully stupid...not cute and quirky as the first one. I have to say, I didn't watch the entire movie, I had to give up on it when Elle's pretty little puppy's real sexually came out.The movie was already overboard when Elle went looking for Bruiser's 'real mom,' but it went WAY too far when Bruiser 'came out'!This should teach Hollywood a lesson...you can't build an entire story around an orphaned, gay dog! Give us credit for a little sense, PLEASE! This movie is an insult! I really don't know HOW they got such talented actors and Reese Witherspoon and Luke Wilson to go along with this...I hear Luke was luckier than Reese as he's only in the thing once or twice!If you want a good, sick feeling, spend your hard earned money on this movie! Its so bad it makes me sick at the first one that I actually liked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ILLegally BLAND","review":"A real disappointment. I found the original to be funny because it played \\"silly\\" off of serious/tense situations (Harvard Law School, a murder trial, shattered relationships, etc.) All these serious situations provided enough material to sustain a full-length movie.Legally Blonde 2 plays silly off of silly situations. The result of silly on top of silly ends up being just plain stupid. The story would have been more suited for a short skit on a comedy show such as SNL. It was agonizing to continue watching, and hoping the movie would pick up and justify my having rented it. I'm appalled that Ms. Witherspoon would bring herself down to this level after such a successful swing in her career.If you're considering watching this movie for the first time, do yourself a favor and retain the magic by watching the first film again."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I could rate it ZERO stars - I would!","review":"I found the first Legally Blonde movie silly but fun.

I won't bore you with a long review - but, trust me - rent or buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that underestimates it's audience","review":"This was one of those movies where you wonder, who thinks this is funny? Gay dogs and hiring a private investigator to find a dog's mother is just a few of the far-fetched plot lines in this movie. I did not like the story, it was really stupid ( I know stupid is a strong word to use, but I really think it is). As far as the acting, I've always liked Reese Witherspoon, she was great in Election, Cruel Intentions and Legally blond 1 as well as some other movies. But in this movie her acting skills were overshadowed by the story. It went on too long and at the end I just didn't care anymore.Do not rent this movie and expect it to be on par with Legally blond 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN, LIGHTHEARTED MOVIE!","review":"Three generations of our family attended this movie and each of us walked away smiling! Reese Witherspoon stayed true to her \\"Legally Blonde\\" character and was absolutely charming! I think it's wonderful, in an age where sex, profanity and violence rule the screen, to have a movie that you can walk away from without blushing, feeling grossed-out or feeling that you'd had too big a dose of *REALITY* ... we all left the theater with a great feeling of happiness!Though this movie was lighthearted and fun, it was not without its \\"life lessons\\" ... it's main point (presented in several ways throughout the movie) is \\"have the courage to remain true to yourself\\"! It's pretty gutsy, these days, for a star to perform in a clean-cut movie ... which makes it very clear that Reese Witherspoon is \\"walking the walk\\", not just \\"talking the talk\\"! We are definitely a family that appreciates her efforts! Looking forward to Legally Blonde 3 ... hint, hint :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Legally Blonde 2-Red White & Blonde","review":"I was so looking forward to this movie as I loved the first one. I was sorely disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is adorable and always entertaining as Elle Woods, but the story lines were lame excuses for, well, story lines. Ends up bruiser is gay, and the wonderful \\"perm climax\\" from the first movie is sadly attempted as the climax of this movie as Elle compares making your voice heard to a bad haircut. There is hintings at the end that there will be a third. Please don't disgrace yourselves further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been Titled Really Dumb and Dumberer","review":"Ok, I will admit it, I truly enjoyed Legally Blonde, and was looking forward to the sequel, but having just left the theater, I feel dissapointed. The mindless world of El Woods was original and funny in the first movie, but this movie tries to be funny by repeating the same old jokes. There in lies the problem, this movie does not provide the laughs of the first film. And the part about gay dogs was a little over the top. This movie will be a set back for Reece Witherspoon, and her 15 million dollar per movie days are probably a thing of the past. Some movies just don't make good sequels, and unfortunately this is the perfect example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it if you wanna study law, not if you wanna have fun!","review":"This movie wasn't a good sequel to the 2001 first part, which was much, much better. In this movie she forgets about the whole Beverly Hills girl who reads Cosmo and makes up 6 times a day...this time she became more serious and this isn't a movie funny as the first one, besides, the whole gay dog thing was so out of place!The story should have been about some Elle's problem, not her dog's. Plus, it was so obvious that she was going to save her and all the dogs and stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Legally stupid","review":"Lackluster follow up to Legally Blonde finds our hero trying to save Buster's (Her dog) Family from being experimented on. So she goes to the capital to fight the good fight for tasted and class, and to change the system as well.

It's a decent rental thanks to Reese Witherspoon but it needed more to hold its own with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neh.","review":"Usually I don't expect sequels to overpower the originals. I was especially right with Legally Blonde 2. The first one was a lot funnier and had a better plot. Even the DVD extras were weak. Jesus. the Gag Reels weren't funny at all.

I was wrong.While there are a few genuinely funny moments, this movie was in large part unfunny and boring. I love Reese and Sally Field (and they both put in fine performances), but I left feeling amazed that either would sign on to the project. I can't put my finger on exactly what was missing, but this movie simply did not have the charm of the first one.It could just be the plot and the setting. In the first movie, it was hysterical that someone could just simply decide to go to Harvard law school, snag a top internship in their first year, and win a major criminal case. In the sequel, it doesn't work anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"I don't see how people could give 5 stars review for this flick.

I'm glad to see alot of the original cast in this one...all of them in fact except for the characters Warner and Vivian whom are not in this film. Jennifer Coolidge is also very funny and full of wit again in her role as Paulette...such a great movie! Reese plays Elle once again, and this time, when Elle finds that her dog Bruiser's mother is locked up and being used for cosmetics testing, takes the fight against animal testing all the way to Washington DC!

Elle Woods takes on the Washington insiders and keeps coming out on top through a combination of sheer luck, connections, and by blondely working out the problems based on her earlier sorority experience.Somewhat dippy, but fun anyway. I thought the grand speech didn't really have what it took to bring about the happy ending, but hey, you have to suspend your brain a bit with this story anyway.Enjoy it for what it is and don't expect great literature, just a fun little film.The DVD included some interesting interviews with the actors and director."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small step down from the original, but you still feel good","review":"Maybe not the best sequel ever made, but it still shines as a feel good movie! In this installment, Elle travels to Washington DC to take on the political machine. She finds herself up against deception, ultra-conservatism and many sticks-in-the-mud, but she uses her Delta Nu charm (and sisters) to win the day.This was not as fresh as the original, but still kept my attention and kept me smiling. I was most impressed by the final speech in front of the Houses, where she cited a bad day at the hair salon, but the moral of the story hit a homerun!! Reese continues to play the character superbly. Sally Field played an excellent villain and Luke Wilson's role, although small, made this a pretty seamless movie.Did you notice at the end, when Luke Wilson asked where she wanted to live; she glanced over at the White House and a sparkle appeared in her eye?!? Legally Blonde 3?? Who knows!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Reese, but this movie is yucky.","review":"I felt embarassed watching it. It's like a movie for little kiddies, who are charmed my bright colors, glitter, lot's of smiles and really bad acting.I loved the first Legally Blonde movie, but this one is very hard to watch.

I enjoy watching Reese Witherspoon as an actress in many movies, but Legally Blonde 2 was like watching a trainwreck. Although, the story was horribly contrived and way over the top...one who starts watching it, cannot help but see it to the end. From the moment that Elle went to a private detective to find brusier's mother...I felt like banging my head against the wall--from there it only got worse.If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and rent it. It is not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shallow and Pointless Sequal","review":"Having recently seen \\"Legally Blonde\\" I was thrilled to hear that the sequel, \\"Legally Blonde 2\\" was coming out. Yet upon seeing what I had hoped to be a funny, witty and charming film I found only a rediculous, humorless, and ultimately shallow film. The acting ranged from average to bad, but honestly I did not expect much in this department. The jokes, which using politics as a platform, should have been histarical but they were only a rehashing of the first film. What litte new material was used in this film was pratically pointless and gained more sighs and groans then anything else. \\"Legally Blonde 2\\" is in short, since to even mention the inane plot would be a waste of everyone's time, a lackluster summer sequel. If you have not seen the first film watch it, it is a very charming movie. Those whom have seen the original, as well as those whom have not, are just a well to save your money and avoid this trash. Rated PG-13 for adult lanugage and sexual humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compare it to the first one","review":"I was very disappointed by the movie - it doesn't even come close to the wit and fun of the first Legally Blonde. Granted, I did have a screaming boy who loved to kick seats behind me for most of the movie, so I may have missed a couple of good lines, but still the characters seemed more annoying than charming and fun.

There is nothing clever, engaging or entertaining in this ridiculous piece of garbage and it really is a sin to waste time watching it.I am not going to say more, because that would stop you moving on to reviews of another film possibly worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sequel","review":"For those of you who enjoyed the first Legally Blonde, don't ruin the image by seeing the sequel to it. The second Legally Blonde's plot is so ridiculous it is at times painful to watch. While Reese Witherspoon still plays Elle Woods to perfection, other actors are less than desirable. This includes Sally Fields who plays a role on Capitol Hill.

The first Legally Blonde movie was great, but I would not recommend this sequel. The script and storyline are weak and the film just does not have the charm, the wit and the freshness of the original. Legally Blonde 2 is a blatant propaganda piece representing a specific political viewpoint that may not necessarily be embraced by the whole audience. It's a free country, and political films are fine, but they usually do better in a documentary format rather than passed off as popular entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the humanity","review":"This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in years, especially in comparison to its predecessor.

I love the original so much but the this one is slow, boring, has a stupid premise, and Reese looks like she hated filming this movie. All the magic is gone, people still treat Elle like she is an idiot. Sally Field's character is heartless and cold as well, Luke Wilson makes a brief apparance as Elle's boyfriend and yes they do get married in the end. This sequel focuses on Animal Rights in Washington D.C. Elle worries about the safety of her dog, the adorable Bruiser but I just couldn't get in to the story or new characters. Poor Reese, she is a wonderful actress, but maybe she should have read the script again before she agreed to take this sequel head on.

It was hilarious and the story was great. With the sequel, the plot became ridiculous. I know it's different writers this time but I didn't imagine they would create a story this bad. The entire Bruiser situation and Delta Nu things was way too much silliness. Reese does a great job as Elle. She's still the same upbeat, strong and positive girl but the story....I can't explain how dissapointed I was. Also, even though Elle pretty much does everything she wants, Emmett (Luke Wilson) doesn't even try to convince Elle how ridiculous it is to find Bruiser's mom. It just doesn't seem real. The trailer is funny. It makes it as though it's going to have the same elements as the original but it lacks just that really bad. PLEASE consider hard about whether you should watch this. I don't even reccommend people renting it because that's still a waste of money. Stick w/ the original.

The movie drags on and by the end, you really just want to return the stupid movie to your local rental store.The \\"bonus\\" material is a joke: you get the music video (who cares) and outtakes (aren't those standard on every DVD now)?Simply put, leave this on rental shelf and grab a different movie.

Elaborating on the script's many ludicrous lapses eaps in logic is ultimately pointless; the plot is an afterthought. Many, though not all, of the performers are undone by the poor material. Jennifer Coolidge has maybe one good line (unfortunately, it's not about soup). Luke Wilson is even stiffer than usual. Alanna Ubach now looks about 10 years too old for her part. Bob Newhart is a train wreck. And someone should tell Regina King she walks like a football player. As one of the executive producers, Reese Witherspoon has no one but herself to blame for this mess, but it's her charm and her still-sharp instincts as an actress that keep this movie from being a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Red White and Blonde.\\"","review":"Reese Witherspoon is pack as Elle Woods, with Emmit and of course her little dog too. This movie is not very good and is no where near as good as the first. Elle is there to stop animal testing and reunite her dog with his mother. Elle goes to Washington and is pretty in pink. Its not a good idea, they could have done something MUCH better. I love Reese Witherspoon and was looking forward to this movie coming out but when I saw it I was VERY dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"My wife and I have gone to the theater about once a month for the past three years. Let's just say this is the first time we have left about 1 hour into the film and asked for a refund. The manager was kind enough to give us free passes for the next movie we attend. At first I thought it was me, but I looked over at my wife and she was yawning and said she was bored. After a few more minutes of torture while waiting to laugh at least once, we decided to get up and leave. Your money will be far better spent on popcorn and soda or anything else other than the ticket price for this movie. I only give it one star as there is no option for zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumb Blondes no more!","review":"The meaning of a dumb blonde has raised a few inches with the opening of this movie.

But hey it's a movie with Reese Witherspoooon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag!","review":"This movie is definately not as good as the first one. The plot wasn't very believeable and that whole thing with the dog was just messed up. What I also don't like about this one is that they made Paulette really ditsy and that's not her character, or at least I thought it wasn't from what I got from the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing.","review":"Don't get me wrong. I didn't see the first \\"Legally Blonde\\" for substance! It's not like I was looking for deep meanings or intellectual stimulation. I saw it because it looked funny and clever.When I saw this movie, I was shocked and let down due to its poor quality. It seemed to me that they were trying to leech off the funniest parts of the last movie and reincarnate them into the second. Plus, the new characters really don't add anything to the movie...at its core this sequel is a modified version of the original.There's also stuff in there that, besides being disgusting, really adds NO value whatsoever to the film. Like Bruiser being gay??? Do we need to hear about dogs humping eachother??? NO! Each moment that went by of this movie, I felt a little more ripped off and cheated out of my money.Don't see this or buy it. That's my advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh to You Pee in Your Paints Funny!!!","review":"The sequel is BETTER than the original. I haven't seen a movie THIS FUNNY in a very long time!

After having positively loved the first one, I was downright shocked to see such a mess made of the second. But after 15 minutes it started to improve, and so much that by the end of the movie we were all howling with laughter and really enjoying ourselves. Silly beginning but incredible improvement. So to make a long story short: quite a good sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"Legally Blonde is one of my favorite movies, but this sequel is a bit of a disappointment. The story is very contrived, and the acting too exaggerated. Also, while it gives me a few chuckles, on the whole it's not that funny. In contrast, the first episode has a much more believable story line, is more clever and thoughtful, and much much funnier. Legally Blonde 1 is a \\"must see\\", but LB2 is forgettable. I enjoyed seeing Mary Lynn Rajskub though; I think she is more talented and attractive than people give her credit for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I do not understand why this movie was made. It is terrible. I seriously regret asking for this DVD. I did really enjoy the first Legally Blonde because she eventually bettered herself and seemed to have matured and grown but in the second movie she is very annoying and seems to have been dropped on the head several times because she's so stupid. On the DVD extras (I did not manage to watch them all) they said they had tried to make her appear more mature but I think they need a dictionary as she appeared the furthest thing from a Harvard graduate that I have ever seen. I did not laugh once in the movie - it was painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another chance to hit your wallet","review":"Witherspoon is absolutely wonderful, so I watched the first \\"Legally Blonde\\" movie just because I enjoy her.

In all seriousness I cannot think of a movie that I loathe more than this one. To be fair, I hated the first one also, and walked out in the middle of it because I had better things to do than assault my eyes with pink, and assault my ears with Reese Witherspoon's annoying voice. This one I actually sat all the way through, because I just didn't have anything better to do... and I was only semi paying attention to it. It was terrible though, there were several parts of the movie where I felt physically sick at the stupidity of the plot and the shallowness of the actresses. This movie was just terrible. Give it to somebody you hate as a present."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORDERING ON ABSURDITY","review":"First off, I did enjoy the first LEGALLY BLONDE. I found it to be fun and somewhat originally. So when I discovered that a sequel was in the making I was naturally excited. My excitement, however, faded shortly after the movie started. While Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as Elle Woods in her crusade to pass a Congressional Bill prohibiting animal testing I found the unfolding of the plot a disappointment. This film has all the predictable characters (i.e. the supportive husband and jealous co-worker who aims to foul your plans) and outcomes. Despite these flaws, I was especially offended by the portrayal...dog sub-plot that had no importance to the plot itself. Overall, I was very disappointed in LEGALLY BLONDE 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legally BAD","review":"ICK. I really wanted to like this movie. But the sad sorry truth is that i don't. the first one was great, it delivered fast, fun comedic jokes. this one not so much. it's going a bit far and deaperate when america needs entertainment at the expense of the sexual orientation of DOGS. as a film student, i also noticed freqeuent shaky camera shots and a weak story line. not to mention how fast everything goes in the movie that is's so hard to keep up. there are too many sub plots and paralell episodes, that i can't keep track of what is what and which is which."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy...","review":"I saw this movie in the theater and I thought it was horrible. I didn't laugh once and this movie just bored me to death. It wasnt entertaining, funny, nor did it hold my attention. Then I had the misfortune of having to watch it again on a roadtrip (my car has a DVD player in it) and I just could not take it. THIS MOVIE SUCKS SO BAD! Stay away at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I loved the first one, and it seemed from some reviews that this one was at least as good. No such luck. Basically, it was lame, lacking the charme, style, and well balanced humor that Legally Blonde had.As for Reese, I could eat her witherspoon, but she is not enough without help from a good script and good co-actors. (Who are those two rejects playing her best friends? They are not even pretty, which must be hard to find in Hollywood.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequelitis","review":"This movie disappoints. In the first movie, Elle had untapped potential. She moved beyond being an airhead. In this movie, she takes several steps back. Her naivete (or is it stupidity?) is beyond unbelievable. The rest, except for a few nice moments is pure drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legally Dumb","review":"30 minutes into this movie I thought \\"Somebody shoot this bimbo!\\" I'm referring to Reese Witherspoon's character, who, not having matured at all from her original role, seems to have gone way overboard in presenting herself as so absolutey, horribly stupid that it hurt to see this otherwise good actress in such a droll role. Halfway through the movie I thought \\"Somebody please shoot me. A friend who was with me did like it, ... I won't bother discussing the plot because there wasn't much of a plot of which to speak and those horrid moments I do remember have been touched upon in earlier reviews here and it hurts do discuss them further. Please - don't reward this shamelessly bad bit of drivel by buying a ticket to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I was so looking forward to this movie when it came out. Legally Blond was a fantastic, funny movie with witty dialog and a quirky cast.The only thing Legally Blond 2 got right is bringing back the original actors to play their characters.In the first Legally Blond, Elle is intelligent, if not a bit naive. She may come across as a little ditzy but she isn't, and it's apparent in many scenes. In Legally Blond 2 she is completely stupid. Like OMG Animal Rights for our gay dogs and stuff.This movie could have been amazing. The potential to make a movie with a \\"girly\\" but still ridiculously intelligent woman, was huge, but in the end this movie fell hard. I wouldn't recommend this movie under normal circumstances, but if you are having a dumb movie night and it's free, you might just try it to see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the FIRST!","review":"The storyline is completely different this time, and I found it just as funny and enjoyable as the first!

I would definately recommend this seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE OUGHTA BE A LAW...","review":"...against bad sequels, and this one is bad, despite the comedic deftness of Reese Witherspoon. Not even she can save a screenplay that is this bad. It lacks the snappy dialogue and clever madcap situations that elevated the prequel into the ranks of successful screwball comedies. This sequel simply tanks, in spite of Ms. Witherspoon's ever present, personal winsomeness. Despite her, this film falls flatter than a pancake, which is a shame, since the original Legally Blonde movie had been so charmingly funny.Unfortunately, this film is quite disappointing and simply not in the same league, despite the casting of the original star and some of the original supporting cast. Not even the addition of Sally Fields and Robert Newhart elevates this drivel to a film worth watching. Moreover, if you are not a fan of Reese Witherspoon, you should deduct one star from my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but","review":"It's a good brush cleanser but Don't pay more than 15$.

And now this, Outside the Box, book is for sale on Amazon...and I bought it...How to rate this book? If I had to sum it up in one line, it would be that all of the stories make one think. The stories in the book subtly or overtly introduce concepts and ideas that leave the reader wondering if the writer is either brilliant, living in an alternate universe, or both. Perfect.My parting thought is that for true afficianados of the writen word, this anthology is not unlike a jackson pollack painting -- where often the process of creation could be just as exciting and engaging as the outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed bag?

So for the same price as a Jansport bag, you're getting SO much more quality- just go and buy it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made for heavy items","review":"I am a student and bought this bag at the beginning of September. By December the stitching on one of the straps started coming out and one of the plastic pieces holding the strap snapped. I think this would be a great backpack for airport travel or lighter loads because of its great features. It was not able to handle 3 textbooks, a binder and a laptop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Information!","review":"I bought this book expecting a few simple exercises and questionnaires that would help me identify and refine my personal design taste. What I got was a lengthy, in depth, and rather confusing series of tests put together in seeming random order. I can see how this book would be helpful for those willing to invest more than a few hours in exploring various design genres, but I would not recommend it to the amateur or casual decorator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"I have had this book for a few months now, so I have given it a fair try.But I still don't like it. It's difficult to use, to act on. It looked interesting, and I like the idea of learning more about my own tastes and why I like what I do. It's just that the book didn't fulfill its promise. In searching for help in this area, I came across The New Decorating Book, which has made it easier for me to understand my own tastes and also has taught me the design basics I need to decorate my own home. The book even has a quiz which helps people to understand their decorating personalities. My daughter's home ec class was using The New Decorating Book, which is how I found it. I also like Real Life Decorating, because that book gives me ideas and talks about understanding how my personality and lifestyle affect how I decorate my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"The book looked good and sounded interesting, so I bought it. Mistake. The idea of learning about and expressing your own taste is covered so much better in so many other decorating books. This is very hard to use, as an earlier reviewer said. And the tiny pictures do not help that situation at all. Again, there are many better books on the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The journey home.","review":"Not only is this book intelligent, but it calls on the reader to find her own creativity. So often we are told what to like and where to buy it. While these things can be helpful, if what you really want is to express yourself in your surroundings, then Yes/No Design will lead you within to uncover and create.Living in a consumer culture, it is easy to get out of touch with our own expressive sides, and I really like how Ms. Love encourages us to take that journey back to our most original selves. If you are willing to complete the exercises and look at them as a whole, what you can find is nothing short of your self.I think Yes/No Design is a text on how to distill out the essence of design as an act of personal creation. Rather than paying Ms. Love to tell us what to like, we are gaining something far more valuable with the purchase of this book -- a guide to our own creativity which we can then use to decorate our homes and every other area of our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - 0 rating","review":"Very large slip joint pliers were required in order to move the top of the watch and make visible the digital time. The time is running but the time itself is incorrect. There is no apparent way to change the time or if needed to put in a battery. The band is plastic but the clasp to hold the band on the wrist is so loose and thin that I estimate the four year old will have it broken in short order.To add insult to the ongoing list of poor Chinese products this was made in China. All of the apparent instructions are in Chinese.On one positive note the watch does look like the advertised picture once the pliers freed up the digital time. And oh yes, it is probably made out of molded plastic so perhaps there is less likelihood that there is any lead paint.In fairness the rating on the Amazon site was low and retrospectively I should have heeded that evaluation. This is a bad choice if you are looking for a functional watch for a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game hurts","review":"If your expecting Seven Kingdoms II to be bigger and better than the original than you will be sadly dissapointed. The new Frythan kingdoms leave you with little to do but build lots of Frythans and go attack.

All in all a poorly put together game that lacks any real improvements over the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst game ever","review":"When I bought Seven Kingdoms two I thought I would be buying a real time civiltion.

I was able to set up and create a database within hours after buying the book, with only minimal prior exposure to MySQL. Plus, it's a great quick reference for some of the standard MySQL commands that you may not need to use on a super-regular basis. The majority of the teaching is done through diagrams and examples, which allows the user to see what's supposed to happen, and have a gauge of how their performing. The text is just over half of the meat of the book, and really just fills in the blank spots that the diagrams leave out. I highly recommend this book for anyone just getting started with MySQL, but it as you get more proficient, you might want to pass it on to another MySQL newbie, as it may just gather dust on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staffordshire Bull Terriers","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

What it doesn't say is that you cannot use this item on a cage with a bottom and plastic sides. When you attach the crock to a guinea pig cage, they can't reach it to use it. I think they should specify that it can only be used for animals that can use full cages (like rabbits) but a cage with a wire bottom cannot be used for guinea pigs because it would damage their feet.

The truth about executions being used only on the poor is a travesty of American justice. Following this is a study of examples where the execution itself was not performed correctly and thus easily fell into the definition of cruel and unusual punishment. The coup de grace are the convictions of blacks who were murdered by the state only to discover later on that they were innocent. Their deaths were more the result of racism than criminal acts. It is great to see that our political leaders have picked up the call and repeat the examples cited in this as reasons for the abolition of the death penalty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased.","review":"I bought these shorts sight unseen from Amazon because they were the cheapest around.

Season 4 was not one of my favorite years for the show, although the cast almost stayed the same, with the exeption of a few new one's, it built up to Season 5, the last year for the series. It is still a good show to watch, and a splendid period piece as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episodes all mixed up","review":"This review is about Amazon's hosting of the fourth season, not about the season itself. The fourth season is a great one, but the way Amazon has bungled this makes it hard to enjoy it.It is really annoying that they have messed up the episodes by putting them in the wrong order and mislabeling them. Half the tension in the episode they list as first is confusing if you haven't watched the THREE episodes that predate it. The occasional mislabeled episode in the previous seasons was easy to overlook, but in this case, its flat out unprofessional.Also, I bought the season, and yet still had to purchase two of the episodes separately.If Amazon really wants to make their video streaming the place to go, they'll have to avoid these things in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Production, Poor DVD","review":"This is a wonderful classic. I have purchased each season as it has become available on DVD. I am usually very happy with A&E's DVD's, but I am not sure what went wrong with, \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\". Season Four had some very long periods where the picture was so blurred that it bothered my eyes to watch it. Overall, I am quite disappointed with the results on DVD. I know I will continue to purchase each season, because I really enjoyed the series when it was on television, but I wish the quality was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Adventures of the Great Lakes","review":"Dwight Boyer writes about tales of the great lakes and fills in things which may have happened.

If you are trying to familiarize with Chopin music this is a nice begining. Also if you are already familiarized, you will found a very highly performance. The Nocturnes are play with great sense, color and balance (just two of the set [stinks]: the 3 and 14.. I can't understand why Harasiewicz give us such a bad performance of this two). The Best set is Arrau's, and this fallow very close. About the Prélues, they're just great. The less satisfactory is the 24th, but even in this Prélude he made a great things. Harasiewicz is very poetical and in control here too. Great Set and Great Price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good EY","review":"this is just one of those shows that is great to watch marathon-style on a rainy day.

The HOW though, is not thoroughly addressed, but has some basic principles to apply. The video is well produced, is loaded with examples from scripture and history, and has many interview clips with respected theologians from today. Sadly, this resource and the emphasis of evangelism is lost on the Western Church. Though not all are called to preach publicly, we are all called to evangelize, and this video is a must have resource for any Christian seeking to fulfill the great commission (Mark 16:15)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misled","review":"I wanted to learn how to open air preach.

I've also done extensive research online - about migraines and the drugs I've been prescribed. I did not feel like this book told me anything new.

Be wary of the HRT types in this book too....look for natural alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best Approach","review":"Getting off drugs should be a migraine sufferers goal, not taking more drugs. \\"Heal Your Headache\\" by David Buchholz worked for me after 18 years of being pumped full of every drug known to man. Sure, the first few weeks of no drugs and following the diet plan were difficult, but living a pain free life is a small price to pay! His book is worth its weight in gold. Be VERY WARY of any doctor who wants to continually \\"try this drug\\" over and over and over. I have followed Dr. Buchholz' plan for 7 years with amazing success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, repetitive...","review":"I'll get to the point quickly and without repetition, unlike the book itself: Jon Katz makes some good (but often obvious) points; unfortunately, he feels it necessary to repeat them ad infinitum.

In contrast with other Phonetics books, this book does not assume that the reader is Linguistics students; it will probably appeal to you if you are one though. Having received no prior formal education in the fields of Phonetics or Phonology, it helped me build a good (initial) understanding of notions around the topic and feel comfortable when approaching more phonologically orientated texts. A final point I liked was the fact that paradigms are coming from a variety of world's languages.I definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to explore Phonetics and/or is in need of a good up-to-date reference and overview of the area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, But The Same","review":"I enjoyed this tape but was disappointed when I discovered thatit was the same as the video tape entitled Rodeo Bloopers.

This is a tribute CD. and we already established that Perry has a one of a kind voice so then why are we listening to it and expecting it to sound like Perry? I actually appreciate this album for what it is.. a tribute to a historical band.my personal faves are Hansen's covers. His voice is great and he seems to be a chameleon which if you listen to his cover of Rock You Like A Hurricane on the Scorpions tribute album.I also like Kip Winger's cover and a few others. I think they were trying to pay tribute so lets appreciate it for what it is"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack job of covering Journey","review":"Yikes! I expected better than this.For the most part feels second rate. The only vocalist who really impressed me here is Kelly Hansen from Hurricane/Foreigner.

I'll be picking up Kevin Chalfont's (The Storm/Two Fires) tribute to Journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"Don't even think about buying this CD, especially if you own Journey's Greatest Hits. No one compares to Steve Perry's vocals, especially on Separate Ways and Wheel in the Sky. Tommy Shaw and Kip Winger did OK on their songs, that's why I gave the album 1 star. Otherwise I was diappointed with the remaining assembled talent. I'm still ticked off that I wasted good money on this attempt of a tribute to a great band. They deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave the journey songs to be sung by the Steve's","review":"Its nice that folks want to do a tribute to Journey but this cd is bad. Mickey Thomas from Starship did ok on his song but being a Journey fan since 1980, you just can't top Steve Perry or Steve Augeri (Journey's current frontman).

The wire is very slight and the protective cover was easily damaged. Also it pinched easily and was impossible to push straight through a drilled hole in the wall. I had to put it in a rod first and then push the rod through the wall to get the wire through. It was a big pain to get done. I had given up trying to get it through the drilled hole in the wall when I came up with the plan to put it in a curtain rod, which was the only way it would have worked. Trust me: you get what you paid for! This is cheap stuff in every sense of the word!In the end it did connect the modem and the DVR. So I admit it worked, but I wish I had paid a little more and gotten the heavier wire, which would have made the installation much easier and would likely last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!

The connection dropped often and then altogether stopped within just over one month which means that I have to pay to return it and will only receive a partial refund if I do which defeats the purpose of the return. I have never had trouble with an order from Amazon before but you get what you pay for. DO NOT BUY THIS. Stick with the better brands. Pay more at Best Buy or Target and get better cables.

Not in the case of this product. For the price of a 10ft. run of cable at Best Buy, I received 100ft. of quality Ethernet cable. I tested against a more expensive much shorter cable. There was no loss of speed or performance in comparison. The cable was somewhat smaller in diameter but absolutely performed as well as the more expensive cables. This run is used for Xbox live and Netflix. Works flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome quality","review":"I've been using this for 3 months now. My xbox is about 50 feet from my router and although I get a signal most of the time, I hate those moments when you're watching Netflix and it immediately signs you out of xbl because you barely lost a wireless signal for a second. This cable allows for the best possible connection with games and streaming. I've never been disconnected even once. It allows for discrete wiring along your wall despite your destination being over 50ft away. You can't go wrong with this ethernet cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cables, Cheap Price","review":"The cables work just like any quality CAT5e cable should work.

The title \\"weihnachtliche\\" on the CD is a bit of a marketing ploy, although at least \\"Ein Kind ist uns geboren\\" has a Christmas theme.

It was boring, and quite frankly was filled with errors of logic. The attempts to make similarities with Rabbinic Jewish doctrines seemed forced. I think a more honest approach would have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair Answers to Honest Questions","review":"Dr. Michael Brown has offered Jews and non-Jews alike a thorough overview of the reasons most Jewish people have not become, and are not now followers of Jesus. He has fairly answered and thoroughly referenced his responses to those objections. While some might object to his motivation, which is obviously to encourage his readers to seriously consider the possibility that Scripture does indeed back his belief system, he is upfront in motivation and the book is substantial in content.In my opinion, the first section, titled \\"Jews don't believe in the Trinity. We believe in one G-d, not three\\" is the most valuable discussion in the book. It is the most thorough and honest look at the nature of G-d that I have read, and will clear up gross misunderstandings of who it is that Christians worship. The book is a valuable resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Resource","review":"Dr. Michael Brown's Answering Jewish Objections Trilogy needs to be on the bookshelf of every Messianic Jew, every Christian, every apologist and I highly recommend that even all non-believing Jews read this Trilogy, that they may see a comprehensive response to anti-missionaries, and Messianic beliefs accurately represented, that they may see who Yeshua (Jesus) truly is.The extensive research, scholarship, and conversational style of writing in this book makes it perfect for the scholar to the lay-person.The Answering Jewish Objections Trilogy is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Book","review":"This is a powerful and excellent book.

This volume centers on theological objections. It can either be read as a reference source (looking up different objections in the book is not hard using the index) or read all the way through. I have chosen the former method, so I haven't read every page...but they're on my shelf whenever a question on Judaism arises. The thing about Judaism is it is so different moving from Orthodox all the way to Reformed. But the general ideas in this book cover all the branches. Every Christian should be able to talk to their Jewish believer friends, family, and co-workers, because the topic is of utmost importance."},{"rating":"1","title":"has a defect- unbearable noise","review":"Installed this product, I have suffered from unbearable noise.

It has been 2 days since it replaced the old one. I was worried about the motor noise because a review complained it. Fortunately the one delivered to me has almost no noise from motor except blower fan sound which is natural. Yet, it would be perfect if the patch(gasket) of glassfiber was included. My furnace needs new one because it is very old and easily torn into pieces when disassembled. That is why graded 4 of 5. The inducer itself is great!

But it didn't come with a new gasket and the old gasket tore up when I removed the old blower. Another reviewer gave me the idea of buying a gasket maker from the auto parts store so that's what I did. It comes in a tube and you just squeeze out some to make a line around the blower. Make sure you scrap off the old gasket completely and make sure you buy the RED gasket maker stuff. I bought Permatex High-Temp Red RTV Silicone Gasket Maker and I only needed a little. Installation only took a few minutes.

The Grande Armee term was \\"Les Goddans\\" and meant in no way more respectfully than for example the Austrians \\"Les Kaiserlicks\\" or any of their other sundry enemies, to the repeated slaughter of the enemy with practically no loss to our protagonists...I think Sharpe and Cornwell reached a peak in the early days of Sharpe's Eagle/Gold/Enemy etc-before our hero exchanged the rookery of St Giles, London, for the Yorkshire of Sean Bean and the world of cheap TV mini-series and of course became the template for Starbuck and Thomas of Hookton...Anyone interested in a good Bernard Cornwell book should read Redcoat, which has an original plot-line, good characterisation and a thoroughly believable cast..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Sharpe's series, so this is a cute little story not only for the holiday but for all year long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting short stories in the Sharpe canon","review":"I purchased this to complete my collection of the Sharpe stories.

However, the one page synopses of various styles seem to be too brief to offer any kind of detailed analysis of what a particular style has to offer. The book probably should have been longer. In addition, we learn much more about what Baker does not like rather than what he likes. The references to classical architecture, including the diagrams, lack clarity. The book may be a good starting point to learn about American residential architecture, but it is by no means a Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too concise? ...maybe, but it serves a purpose.","review":"Baker's book covers the basics on the history of the house style in America. It is concise, and easy reading. Those looking for an in-depth and specific guide to the architectural purity and detail of the many individual residential styles have several other excellent books to chose from that would serve that purpose better. Baker is opinionated, but the novel \\"common plan\\" he creates to simplify the comparisons is an excellent method to help the novice in understanding the architecture of the house. I'm sure you will have your own opinions of what styles you like and dislike. This book won't answer all of your questions, however, it will give you a jump start on understanding the basics. This book would be helpful for anyone looking to purchase an older home if you are confused by the often misleading real estate agent's description on home styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reply to K.

The simple fact of the matter is this: Barnes' HUNGRY FOR THE WORLD is a work of literature, and F-M approaches it like a specimen in a petri-dish. Nevertheless, it is a fact of Amazonian democracy that even show-off, wooden-ears can write their ersatz reviews. I'll wager that we never see a book by Ms. F-M listed in Amazon, unless it is some sort of big-eyed but soulless self-help dreck or, worse, some sort of academic blather. It won't be literature, as HUNGRY FOR THE WORLD so triumphantly is. Fifty or a hundred years from now, readers will be reading Barnes' work and knowing more about what it means to be human.

The cord is long, soft and flexible--I've had cords that were stiff and ended up cracking and then breaking. The sound is great, not muffled, but also doesn't disturb my husband.

It is hard palstic with a cushion around it. Place it directly under your ear (or under the top layer of the pillow case) and it feels like sleeping on a rock. Place it under the pillow and it's not audible. At high levels it sent out an amazingly annoying high pitched whine. At moderate levels there was so much static I could not hear the dialogue. I was really unimpressed. My strong suggestion is keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best choice","review":"I have been using these pillow speakers for years. There are many reasons I keep getting this brand. 1) the sound quality is very good. 2) the cord is soft and flexible 3) the fuzzy cover is really nice, and actually feels good against my ear.Yes, the cord can break after a year or two. That is the price you pay for having a flexible wire that does not feel disruptive. Personally, I think that the trade off is worth it.

Time will tell if the connections inside will start breaking, but the cord itself is much more flexible than others I have used and it is virtually undectable under my pillow. The actual speaker is super-thin and then there is a squishy cover over the whole thing (which is removable and probably not even necessary given the thinness of the speaker). I have tried many of these and most fail within a year :( Hopefully this one will last longer; it is going strong so far! FYI, I also purchased the Pillowsonic pillow speaker.

If I had known what this DVD was really about--his talk show--I would have skipped it. You watch the Bio channel to learn about the person--their childhood, how they got into acting, what their colleagues think about them, their acting career.

Much more flavorful than some of its competitors, it's nonetheless very agreeable to modification and I like to make my own improvements, usually by replacing water with any type of fish or shell fish liquid--clam juice, shrimp broth, etc. But I have to start with the basic Vigo Paella, and I don't object to using it straight out of the box.For any packaged paella, plan on adding some fresh fish and/or shellfish and vegetables of your own. The package label shows a few mussels, peas and red peppers and that's a good beginning. Maybe add some additional clams, fresh or canned, too, along with more shrimp. White fish goes well; as I recall, salmon was not a good choice.If it had more shellfish included, I'd rate it five stars rather than four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paella needs additions","review":"The Vigo paella does not lack in taste, but in order to be substantial it needs some added ingredients, to wit, a can of boiled baby clams, frozen peas (per taste) and shrimp.

It is similar to SimCity, the child designs their own zoo. This is a rather brainy game and the child learns about the interaction between the animals needs to thrive, the financial needs of the zoo to provide for the animals, and the needs of the visitors to encourage their return trips. Our son loves it, when he realizes that his design is failing he sometimes lets the dinosaurs loose! That definitely adds excitement!

We own EVERY Zoo Tycoon product there is! My son is obsessed with animals so this game is great for him. More importantly as a parent, I'm not crazy with my child being on a computer for long periods of time, but this game is very educational. He learns all about building different types of exhibits, what the animals eat, the natural habitat they live in - all good stuff and he just can't seem to get enough of these games.

Buyer beware - buy software from reputable sellers...this is the second item we bought on Amazon in the last month that was an issue.

Several sections of Peter Allen talking to the audience, explaining songs or just demonstrating his charming personality, have been mysteriously deleted. The songs are brilliant and deserve a good listen, because Peter Allen remains a sorely underrated musician.

Plus, there were many different encounters that added a lot to our knowlege of what kind of whale behaviour can be expected.Humorously, at the end of the program there are these whale sounds. So, if you leave your DVD player on longer than the recording, it continually plays whale sounds!

From not liking your parents to your parents not liking the guy you're dating to your feelings changing about the friends you hang out with. Because it takes place in England the language is different and takes a minute to figure out what the author means (i.e. snogging=making out). It's basically about a girl who is overweight and struggles to fit in. The only way she knows how to be accepted is to let guys have their way with her. Then she meets an older guy and starts dating him. He's abusive but it doesn't bother her. I really wanted to scream at the main character for being so stupid and staying with the guy but it's true for a lot of young relationships.

First, it doesn't react 100% to turpentine for thinning....bottle said to use something else I couldn't find, so that was a bit of a problem. It did tend to muck up pretty quickly on my brush, which was a bit annoying.Secondly, it is very susceptible to any kind of wear....I had to put several coats of varnish over it, to protect it from any stain or mark. It is very sensitive to dirt, oil, etc.Otherwise it really is great for a copper \\"look,\\" to be sure, for decorative projects.Oh, and order in advance of your needs if you are paying standard shipping.

We used it as a tool to learn colors and learn the concept of matching. Now, I cannot tell what lid goes with what marker unless I draw with it first.

Very interesting how polarized our society has become and how a simple little song can bring out the venom in people.Basically, it's not one of her best songs but it is a good one, with words expressing support for those who put their lives at risk to preserve the freedoms we usually take for granted. You don't have to be in favor of war to respect the men and women in the armed service. That is, of course, what the lyrics are saying. I also respect Ms Wright since she walks the talk.

I'm a sewer and always seem to drag threads all over the house. No problem when you have a Roomba. Roomba picks up threads, hair, dirt, dust, etc. It goes in places other vacuums could never (under the bed & entertainment center) I have 90% rug (short pile), 10% hard wood in my home, but it works great on both. I set up the virtual walls, so I can keep Roomba in the area I wish to clean, press the button, it plays a song and goes to town. When it's done, it plays another song and shuts itself off. I empty the bin and plug it back in to recharge the battery. That's it... I still use my upright once in a while to get that deep down dirt, but not as often as I used to. It would get the fifth star if I never had to see my upright again.Roomba Pro Elite is worth the extra money. You need two virtual walls and the spot cleaner. The remote is handy too."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked for a month","review":"This is truly a great idea, but after a month of use, the battery stopped holding a charge. I brought back to the store, and got a new battery with an attachment to prevent this battery from breaking, but it did not fix the problem. I have not returned the second time. My sister has one as well, which broke after the 4th month, and Roomba replaced it. That was about a year ago, and she is on her 4th Roomba. Each time she goes in, gets a replacement, and it breaks. She is fine with this, as she feels that going to the store for a new one every so often is less effort than vacuuming. It does seem that the more she uses it, the longer it lasts. Just be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Broke It Broke It Broke","review":"I love this thing! I have three dogs and lots of dog hair. To have a 'Bot clean the house while I cook breakfast is a wondeful concept. And the concept worked when it worked. When the concept did not work was when it did not work. The Roomba broke within two months of purchase. They were great and replaced it. The new one broke again. And now the third one broke. They all seem to have the same problem. After a month or so of usage, they buzz around like a scattered and confused droid. Backs up and backs up and backs up. Starts. Stops. Turns. Turns off again. Maybe the 'Bot is not up to the task of dog hair - I dont know. All I know is I have now had three, each one broke, and I am shopping for a new vacuum.

There's been no problems with my unit so far. I can't even begin to think how I kept the dog hair under control before I got this thing.

Sometimes it gets stuck under really low furniture, but mostly it zooms under the beds and stuff to regions that I never even considered vacuuming. I would definitely buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Warranty Service by iRobot","review":"Bought a new Pro Elite which would not properly charge & contacted iRobot.

Through these stories, we were able to discuss a number of benefits and costs related to different technologies, like the internet, weapons of mass construction, and simple verbal communication. I enjoy reading science fiction regularly, so i was happy to learn that we would be using such a book in class.Well, to be brief, some stories were good, and some were pointless. My favorite must be \\"Speech Sounds\\" by Octavia Butler, which explores the fears of a society robbed of communication skills. Some other stories were fair, but some were not worth reading after the first couple sentences. Doris Lessing's contribution falls under this category. Even the best stories in this selection were not that great. There's plenty of better collections out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Book","review":"The main idea of the book is to narrate a scientist who studied and carried out about twister through out her life.

I felt that they were very great and brave because analyzing twister was not an easy job. It must spend a lot of time and it was very dangerous. They knew that there were many difficulties but they stilled sacrifice their lives to approach the danger.After reading this book, I knew that how powerful the twister is.

This book just didn't do it for me. There's hardly any dialogue between the two characters, the story is primarily told by the depressing thoughts of Page and Iain. Page is one of the most depressing characters I've ever read. The entire book is spent hearing her negative perception of herself and feeling she has to act \\"tough\\".

Especially when the co-worker seems to have seen her on the screen in bed. Plus the picture on the wall says Insanity is a Matter of Opinion. That would have made you really wonder about what was actually happening. Thankfully this was a free movie on Prime. It moves too slow to keep me riveted, but it is good enough if you are just bored and in the need of a movie you haven't seen. So much more could have been done with this.

The drawn narrative is a varied as the stories. Some pictures, like the whole-page birth scene, are entire stories in themselves. Not many people can put as much into black and white a Vess, as this book demonstrates.I wish I could give this book five stars, but this isn't the greatest presentation of his work. His best work has a very delicate line. Maybe it was just the printing process, but this book came through in a coarser style. His black and white work is outstanding, but I like his color work too - this book was not able to show any of Vess' skill as a colorist.These short stories fit nicely with Vess' renderings of operas and other long pieces. I recommend this book to anyone who already like his art. If you're a newcomer, though, other books give a better idea of why his work is so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference","review":"This is a fine copy of an excellent reference book on quotations.

It had a black marker slash across the back, sticky residue from an old sticker that had been removed, and all sorts of dirty soil marks on both sides of the cover. I feel tricked. I could be wrong but it looks like a book that should have an outside sleeve that wasn't included. Basically it's a really old book as well, not exactly hot off the press. I told the seller about the condition that this book was in, and he was not helpful at all. He offered me a 50% refund. The book was 42 dollars. If I accepted it, I would be out 21 dollars and have no book. I was very disappointed that they were not willing to either give me a full refund or offer a discounted price.

Having been involved in several large software efforts and in process improvement, I found the book to be very antiseptic and clean -- without any of the real messiness of real software development.Addtionally, the cases presented were slanted totally towards straight business and did not address anything related to embedded or real-time development practices.

Andrew's struggle to overcome her ego and learn the power of essence are timeless themes, and the teaching has never been more needed in the world than it is now.

As my yellow lab grew larger he started jumping on it with his front paws and popping the panel out of its grooves and entering the house when he wasn't supposed to. This Havahart aluminum pet door solved my issue. It comes with a steel locking panel and an aluminum frame. No dog can pop this one open. The door has a white finish and was very easy to install in the previous door cut-out I had. It is a quality door that I would highly recommend for people with larger dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Havahart Doggie Door","review":"I had never heard of this brand before. I purposely ordered an aluminum door because 1) it was going in a metal door; 2) the cold weather, etc., is hard on plastic .. period!! The door was easily installed, even without decent directions. There was one screw missing.. but 3 out of 4 still managed to ensure a good seal. The price was decent, compared to the other available products. The time it took to receive the product was very good. (And the fact the S&H was free made a huge difference in the total purchase price!!) I thought I was getting one with 2 flaps, but that was probably my mistake. I do like the fact it has a metal fitting to slide into the opening and fasten securely, ensuring no one comes in uninvited!! I got a LG because I have a 70 lb border collie mix. The size is just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flap not replaceable & doesn't last","review":"The frame is very solid, but that's about it. The latch on the security plate broke off day 1. The flap lasted several months before it started to come apart at the top \\"hinge\\". I slowed this down by duct taping it, but eventually the flap completely detached. The lame thing is the flap is not replaceable - you have to buy the whole pet door. So now I'm stuck with a big hole in my door. Either I can buy this again and have it rip again in a few months, try in vain to find another brand pet door that fits the same hole in my door or buy a whole new door and a new pet door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flap broke weeks after","review":"The flap tore right off the door within weeks of installing it.

I called Havahart who told me to buy their replacement flap. When I got it I found it didn't work for the aluminum door, only for the cheaper plastic door. Havahart customer service was rude and unsympathetic to their error. I was told I have to buy a whole new aluminum door which cost over twice as much as the replacement flap. If you are going to buy one of these, get the cheaper plastic door, and don't expect Havahart customer service to do you any favors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for a cold climate","review":"This door appears to be decently made. I thought I had made a good purchase; but in no time the flap had completely failed at the hinge line. The flap is not replaceable. This thing MIGHT (I say might) work in a warm climate, but when cold, the flap becomes rigid and breaks off at what should have been a flexible hinge line. I would definitely not purchase another for use in a climate where it gets cold enough to snow - - and maybe not anywhere. It's one of those products that make you wonder why manufacturers do this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flap tore and isn't fixable","review":"After 6 months, the flap on the door tore off. Havahart tells me the flap is integral to the assembly of the door and is non-replaceable on this aluminum frame version. They've offered to replace the entire door with the plastic frame version and an extra flap.This door only deserves one star, but because the company has addressed the issue, I've given an extra star for customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flap is junk","review":"I have 2 dogs that are about 65# and are very gentle at walking through their doggie door.

For years, Fulci lazily shadowed and plagiarised Romero step by step, and upped the gore quotient whilst simultaneously lowering the production values and narrative coherency of the genre. Fulci's best work, The Beyond, delivers a vague but disturbing moral about the folly of immortality, and nothing at all about contemporary society. Let's face it, Fulci was a dirty old man who was more interested in nubile young women being eaten by rotting corpses than delivering wry commentaries on Post-War consumerism, and his films are all the more enjoyable for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compact and functional unit","review":"I've had this cordless phone system for three years now.

The authors provide explanations for some terms/concepts that are incredibly basic (like what is a hormone). But when they get into to meat of the subject, they neglect to provide the \\"big picture\\" and instead start laying out the plumbing of girls and boys.

Some of the older tracks such as \\"Head Like A Hole\\" and \\"Gave Up\\" actually surpass their studio versions. Especially \\"Sin\\", the album's highlight, which has even more menace than the original. Many tracks from the Fragile, particularly \\"The Wretched\\"\\" are superior to the album versions. However, many of The Fragile's more forgettable tunes take up time, and a few songs like \\"Wish\\" are ruined by a lack of clarity. The setlist has some nice touches with \\"Suck\\", and classics like \\"Piggy\\", \\"March of the Pigs\\", \\"Closer\\", \\"Terrible Lie\\" and Hurt\\" are presented with a fresh energy. A damn good live outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Name Says It","review":"And all that nine inch nails could have been is captured on this cd. songs like terrible lie, sin, head like a hole and even suck are more complete and amazing.

I, myself became a hardcore nine inch nails fan, after seeing the live dvd, then going off to buy this album the next day.

The ads said it was about highschool. It was more about watching people walk around in a home movie. Their was no point to it; no life to it; and I too would rather watch paint dry. The shooting scene was not disturbing at all to watch - because there was nothing to watch - it was boys shooting at things unseen. Everything in this movie was plain, drab and sterile.I gues when a movie is strange and pointless, the award givers think there must be some hidden wonderful thing about it and so they offer them a prize. This film should be advertised for cures for insomniacs.

The shower scene is best and awaking up scene of all! One boy went in the shower minutes before shooting, with his murder-mate joining him saying a dum sentence like \\"I never kissed before..\\" and then the two of them kissing for a few seconds.. that's it.I won't even mention the shooting scene which is the worst part.This is a boring movie. If you really interested in the columbine massacre - watch \\"bowling to columbine\\" which is much interesting, especially the part with Marilyn Manson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to everyone.","review":"Gus Van Sant's latest insult to the viewing public is a classic indie con job. It's a film, obviously inspired by the Columbine High School shootings, in which people walk around an anonymous high school all day long, going through their daily routines for an excruciating 70 minutes of celluloid before two kids dressed in camouflage clothing come in and shoot the place up. It is anti-climactic, pointless, fervently anti-Hollywood, and incredibly boring.But it uses long tracking shots, is technically adept, \\"offers no answers\\" and \\"makes us think,\\" uses bleak classical piano pieces for a soundtrack, has an obtuse name (stemming from the \\"elephant in the living room\\" phrase, that, in retrospect, really has nothing to do with the film at all), and begins and ends with artsy shots of the sky. So it's brilliant. Automatically. Don't you dare dissent, because you're wrong, and an idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and cold","review":"Elephant is a beautifully filmed movie that almost makes you feel like a little fly, following the characters of this disturbing tale around. People who like traditional Hollywood shiny-happy movies will probably hate this, but for those of us who see beauty in different ways, this hard-to-swallow film is a must-see. I call it \\"cold\\" in the title of this review because you aren't treated to the drama that would typically unfold as you watch the murder and mayhem unfold...it's told in the same cold, calculating way these 2 boys walked up and down the halls shooting people as nonchalantly as they would in a video game. Elephant is an eye-opener to the rise of school shootings and teenage angst. And just like that, it offers absolutely no explanation and shows no consequences for these atrocious actions, and that is where the very beauty of this film truly lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Buy Guns Like That!!!","review":"I have a feeling Sarah Brady was behind this lying peice of filth. While you can order firearms online, they can not be shipped to a private residence. This film is downright lying in that regard, as the boys order their guns online and fedex just shows up at the door and gives them their guns. Mrs. Brady, you should be ashamed of yourself.You can order and purchase a firearm online, but it will only be shipped to a lisenced Federal Firearms Dealer. You have to email, fax, or plain old mail the lisence in with your order, so the site can confirm the address they are shipping the gun to is actually a gun deal with a legit license. Then they ship it to the dealer, you go in and pass the background checks, pay a fee for having them get the gun, and then it's yours.This is my big beef with this movie, it's lying to uneducated people and making them think that it's just that easy for a kid to get a gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time lost can never be retrieved","review":"At best Elephant is bland and clinched, at worst gratuitously violent and disturbing.Gus Van Sant paints the human experience as a painful, monotonous, flavorless, waste of time.

While most movies do this, and good ones do not, this movie did neither.No emotion was every really developed. Every single murder is bluntly unemotional, and the movie becomes as unemotional as the murders. But, this may be Van Sant's point: that acts of violence are pointless under the conditions in which they take place. But because Van Sant never discusses these conditions, the movie is pointless. It isn't perceptive or insightful, it just bears an unbiased witness. Which is confusing when Van Sant has the two killers share a naked, homosexual kiss in attempt to add emotion where there is none. This movie lacks emotion and ultimately becomes forgettable. 2 1/2 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME","review":"This movie was a joke, a waste of 80 min. of my life. It was SO SLOW. Basically, it's the same few kids walking up and down halls with minimal action, until the end. Hmmm...interesting how it's a school day and only a handful of kids are to be seen in school. Unrealistic & stupid, it's a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have had a script","review":"Expecting the teenage actors to come up with interesting relevant dialog on their own without a script was a huge mistake in this film. That supposedly made it more realistic but, no - they knew they were being filmed. The conversations were fake, contrived and uninteresting. It made the kids thoughts seem so trivial and put-on and made the viewers generally bored. \\"Like she's all like this and so I'm like like I'm that...\\" Please! What this movie needed was a writer. There was no depth to any of the characters so we didn't care about them. And, as others have said, why did we have to follow and follow and follow these kids through endless halls? This movie could have cut out all the boring parts and been about 8 minutes long."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, people, you're reaching too much for this crap.","review":"Simply put, because this does not deserve anything more than brevity, this is the biggest waste of money and time all year. I would rather have bashed myself in the face with a hammer for an hour and ten minutes than have ever experienced this boring, ridiculous attempt at poignancy. There is absolutely not one ounce of emotion in the entire film, even after kids start SHOOTING UP THE JOINT. No panicking. No nothing. Bam, boom, splatter. Not even interestingly presented. This is one long, droning crapheap that should never have received any of this praise.

This has the makings of a very good story, and Gus Van Sant is successful in showing us how thier everyday lives interact, ending in tragedy. Of course, this isn't for the kiddies (we don't want them getting any ideas), but for adults we get to see what might force some kids off the edge.Highest rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not the forum.","review":"Elephant is a film. It is a provoking and intelligent version of events that potentally can happen at any high school, anywhere in the world. It took balls to fly in the face of public conservitism and Van Sant did it well.What annoy's me is the fact that people all over the world are abolishing a great film simply because it deals with a tragic event. This is not the forum for a moralistic or political debate, however, something has to be said about the power of film making if a single film generates such a barrage of disruption in a rather mundane socity."},{"rating":"1","title":"jason","review":"i bought this movie and after watching it i realised that it was the worst movie i had ever seen. how it ever got a screen release i will never know.do not even consider viewing it or buying it. it is NOT a movie in any sense or form"},{"rating":"1","title":"c'est impossible","review":"I don't know if this was supposed to be thought provoking or deep but it comes off being disorganized, uninteresting and pretentious. By illustrating how tragedy can emerge rapidly from an otherwise mundane, lacklustre tedium, perhaps the viewer is supposed to see this as \\"real life\\", but it was more total crap and a waste of time.

It seems to drag everything out but school is a 6 hr day that is endured by teenagers 5 days a week. It's a normal part of the week for them. No student went there anticipating a shooting. The point of the film was to show that no one had a clue what was ahead of them. The director was trying to make the auidence feel like a high schooler by following around 5 or 6 them during the movie. You, the viewer, goes to school for a day in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy was I bored","review":"This movie tries to show us how something like the Columbine shooting happens unexpectedly when we are dealing with our daily routine. OK we get it. I just don't agree that the life of a high school student can be as boring as these characters in the movie. I'm sure the Columbine students who lost their lives, bullies or not, had a lot more to look forward in their future. They do not deserve to be represented like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Not recommended.This movie didnt pull itself off. The only sub story with any sort of impact was Johns, as I feared for his father and brother. Every other substory was weak and just didnt work in my opinion.Its pretty obvious what the desired effect of scenes of clouds passing and relentless corridor walking was in aid of, but it made the characters and impact of the film weak weak weak in the final analysis.However, I knew when I searched this film up that some would love it, and sure enough alot do. So maybe its worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"For 108 minutes nothing happens in this whole movie. Then bam the school shooting begins. I fast fowarded 99 percent of this film and watched til the end. Super boring and pointless. Don't waste your time watching this film because there's no substance to it what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good? Are you serious?","review":"Elephant was hyped as a triumphant achievement at Cannes, a film that captures the reality behind the trend of school shootings in America. Maybe they were watching a different movie. Van Sant constructs a largely improvised and mangled plot of a film. The movie drags on and on, the only thing that keeps it quasi-interesting is that you are waiting for the shooting to begin. Static shots that lose people as they walk beyond the view of the seem ubiquitous and endless. There is no character development in the film, the teenagers are really just stereotypes of the typical high school (jock, outcast, arty kids, etc.). Once the shooting starts, it turns into a B-horror movie where characters of course turn the wrong corners and make decisions as if they were caught in some sort of tractor beam drawing them directly to the killers. By the end of the film, I felt as though I was the victim of a cruel joke. Elephant is a self-indulgent mess of a movie. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elephant","review":"This is the worst movie ever made and a true disappointment from Gus Van Sant. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE AND DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE. Do not watch this movie if it is free and you have nothing else to do. Cleaning your toilet on a Saturday night would be more enjoyable. I assume Gus Van Sant thought he was being artistic with his long camera views of kids walking down the halls but instead it was irritating beyond words. There was no character development, a lack of interesting dialogue and by the time you realize two kids were being portrayed as the Columbine killers, you almost wish for the shooting to begin to end the misery of watching this horrible film. And then to add insult to injury, the killing scenes were unemotional and poorly captured. Obviously the the killers were meant to be cold and disengaged, but shouldn't the viewers and victims be feeling something? I cannot figure out why Gus Van Sant wanted his audience to die along side of his movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"The movie was too real. It was empty, and though it may be creepy, it was also rather boring. The movie dragged on, and some scenes were just out of place. even worse, the same boring scenes were repeated a couple of times? The only interesting part was in the showers the day they were going to die. They admit that they have never been kissed, and kiss each other. It was heartbreaking. But there should have been more scenes like that. Instead it was emptyness. SO i give it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you remember high school?","review":"As a high school student, I found this movie very powerful as well as truthful. When I walk through the halls, I don't know everyones life story, their personalities, their \\"character\\" isn't developed to me. The audience's relationship with the characters in \\"elephant\\" is the same as the people you see everyday but don't bother to get to know. Did the killers know the people they murdered? The character development in this movie is not important because in high school knowing people outside of your group isn't important.People don't realize the affect they have on others. I feel that some of the reviewers misinterpreted the meaning of this movie. I don't feel it was meant to explain school shootings or relive Columbine, but to give an honest look at how oblivious we are of one another.Never have I been so disturbed from a film soley because of the truth behind it. And frankly, I'm not looking forward to going to school on monday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie and haunting nightmare","review":"This film gives no explanation, no backstory, and no judgment as it presents a Columbine-esque tragedy at a high school: two boys plan to shoot as many people as they can on a regular afternoon when everyone is going about their business and nobody sees it coming. Here's an example of tracking shots that actually work in their extended form. You focus entirely on one person as that person goes through the mundane high school life: cafeteria, classroom, library, photo development, gossip, and the emotionless planning of the massacre too. Also an intriguing example of multiple versions of the same scenes as the focus shifts from one character to another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that stays with you","review":"I've seen this movie three times now, and each time it makes me think ---about my high school days back in he late 1950s, about Columbine, and senseless violence at the local and international level.In a DVD feature, the young person playing one of the shooters says \\"High School was Hell.\\" And that is real life.As other reviewers have noted, the movie lets you the viewer work on the elements and work things out.Too many movies these days wind up in a flurry of high-tech violence, car chases and the like. Very little room for individual analysis.So see it, and see it again. Let's hope we can develop a society where senseless violence is replaced with something more humane. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCHOOL VIOLENCE","review":"When i saw this movie at a local theatre two kids walked out completely dissapointed, one kid turned over to other and said it wasn't even cool. I thought to myself thats the point, hey if your into violent movies and have a hard on for kids killing each other on screen let me make a recommedation to you 'Battle Royale' its a great movie of its own accord, but Van Saint's Elephant has a completly differnet agenda-its a movie about all the little moments that make up our lives-ones we would think are way to boring to ever be in movie-and then an expolison happens and it seems like it came out of F***ing nowhere, its a smart movie because it never says okay this is a film about how acts of violence come from nowhere-it just presents a situation and lets it unfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too generous","review":"I'll be honest. I've seen many artistic movies whose plot/pacing/cinematography were questionable. All of them deserved at least two stars. I won't waste your time explaining in detail just how poorly done Elephant was, like this movie wasted mine. The most tragic thing that this movie portrayed was how sad it is that a topic which could easily have been immensely compelling and thought-provoking was instead turned into the worst movie I have seen in years. One of the three people watching the movie fell asleep, and I envy her. Simply put, the attempts at characterization and background story-building were absolutely a waste of film. The film showed the same boring scene of walking down a hall three different ways, none of which added anything to what the audience got out of the movie. If you watch this movie, don't say I didn't warn you, and if you manage to enjoy it, I feel sorry for you. Remember: walking is NOT a plot device!"},{"rating":"1","title":"watcheable on 8x speed only, if at all (zero stars)","review":"anyone giving this movie more than 1 star is attempting to fascade their poor taste in movies. absolutely horrible. get the G.

I've read, watched and heard anything that it remotely close to it. So naturally when I heard about \\"Elephant\\", I was very excited. I got the movie from the library, popped it in the DVD player and was disappointed after the first 10 minutes. You don't kow much about the characters except that one has a drunken father, one is a photographer, two are in love and three girls have eating disorders. The walking and the piano playing gets old fast. I was just yearning for the shootings to start so I can have something to watch. But when they finally do start, it's very unemotional. You hear a few screams and that's it. You would think that the students would be more upset if someone was shooting up the school. I have to admit the very end of the movie gave me chills because you don't know what happens. But other than that it was very stupid. This was a waste of my time. Don't buy this crap. It is not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly dissapointing and offensive.","review":"I went into this thinking that to make a movie about such a tragic event, the director must have had some great insight, i left wondering how anyone could possibly consider this worth making. The characters were shallow and were not at all believable, which makes the claim that this movie just shows reality without judging it laughable, and even if that were not the case, i don't buy the lack of a message being a message in itself nonsense. This is a case of someone who didn't have anything to say, and should have kept quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't enough","review":"At only 80 minutes of movie, the one thing we didn't need were those drawn out walking and cloud scenes which just seemed pointless. I got so annoyed with it, I just started skipping those parts. Towards the beginning of the movie there is like a ten minute scene of just a kid walking. It's just pointless.But between all those long,drawn out, and pointless scenes is a good film...just not alot of it. Kind of like ordering a soda at the movies where what you really want is soda with some ice but instead it's alot of ice with some soda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking","review":"This movie, for the first 40 minutes or so, does nothing but follow high school students walking through halls, across campus, classrooms and a lunchroom at a SNAIL's PACE!

When the Columbine tragedy occurred in 1999, my wife and I visited the high school shortly after the shootings. There were countless memorials. Flowers, pictures, drawings. The cars of the victims were still in the parking lot. Elephant brought those memories back to me.I now have two daughters of my own. Watching a film like Elephant reminds you that life is fragile. Immediately after watching it, all I wanted to do was be with my children. I wanted them to be safe. Perhaps that is the real purpose of a film like this. Get involved with your children's lives. Talk with them. Be there for them. Be the difference in their lives.I think this is a movie everyone should see - especially if you have children."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"Boring, insensitive, pointless movie, that wants to be a slow, artsy movie...it is just senseless. completely waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE EVER","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no character developmet, no interesting dialog, no plot, nothing. It just plain sucks. It is filled with 10 minute long shots of people just walking. I know people walk. I don't want to pay to see them do it. Then, I see 2 guys with lots of guns named Eric and Alex, just like the Columbine shooters, and I figure, 'Oh, this is about Columbine'.

It just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Boring (even for regular life)","review":"I have read the reviews and seen the movie all the way through. It was a very boring way to say something that could be summed up in 30 minutes. Yes, life isn't always exciting, life isn't always amazing, but life isn't always so pointless. Even in high school (I'm 27 now) which I still have nightmares about having to go back to, things were never so bleak and mundane. I guess this perspective isn't shared by all, but I was a dork: Never changed in front of other guys, had geeks for friends, was 5' 5\\" at most, got picked on, etc.... and I never thought it was pointless. I was into music, still am. I also started taking drugs, thank GOD! Maybe if I hadn't I'd like this movie more. I just thought this sentiment could be made better, that's all, and I don't reccommend this movie for anyone, really. I guess the moral to this review is: let your kid do drugs or they may try to kill people. Just kidding... Really though, let your kids do drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waist Your Time!","review":"I found that this movie was totally BORING! You couldn't understand anything untill the last 15 minutes of the movie. To make a movie about a school bombing/shooting they could have at least introduced the characters better but they didn't. They also did not have an interesting line about what was going on!! You didn't know that they were planing the bombing untill the last 15 minutes of the show and before then it was a bunch of non since. The whole hour and something was totally boring and a waist of time to watch, it does make you think though at the end of it when the bombing took place. They could have did a lot better with this one in introducing characters and family and having better scenes.

Having studied Columbine extensively for a term paper, the film was too similar to the events at Columbine to be a coincidence and not factual enough to be accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC VAN SANT.........","review":"Van Sant once again takes you on a virtual reality tour of the minds of young adults. This film should NOT be taken as a documentary, but as a journey into the thought process of our young people. As he did in My Own Private Idaho, Van Sant lets us see into the mindset that our current culture is inflicting onto our youth. If you're 14 to 19 years old, you understood this film whereas most adults probably won't.

The movie actually takes you back to this particularly \\"tragic\\" day in history.

During most parts of the movie you truly wonder why you are watching someone walking down the hall for 10 minutes.The movie is also quite stereotypical:The smart, and homosexual boy who gets made fun of= a killerThe jock = the cute, popular boy.The 3 \\"pretty\\" girls = Are bulimicThough the ending is harrowing and fascinating, the rest of the movie, to me is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"oeneric surreal dreamscape","review":"It is no wonder most the people writing reviews here just don't get this film...it seems they've been raised on seizure-inducing VFX and Hollywood swill most of their lives.This is one of the most amazing films to come out of the US in a long time. I also recommend Van Sant's other two in the triptych: Gerry, and Last Days. All three are very, very good films.The sound design by Leslie Schatz is also exceptional and lends to the dreamy, surreal violence in Elephant.The use of repeat/refrain suggests a song structure and the slow-motion effects help induce a dreamy distance from the action taking place. This is masterful and sophisticated filmmaking.Headsup: If you liked this style of filmmaking I also recommend checking out Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr whose work influenced Van Sant in the making of Gerry, Elephant and Last Days."},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHH","review":"WARNING STAY AWAY, HORRIBLE MOVIE.

The story evolves around two gay teens who order guns over the internet and then go shoot the kids at their school. One of them plays piano and the other plays a fake FPS on his laptop as if to insinuate that that is the reason for their outlandish behavior. About 60 minutes of the movie is very weak character development that has no relevance to anything in the conclusion. There really was no point in making this movie at all, the actors were terrible and the script was bland. If you have an hour to waste I still wouldn't recommend seeing this film. On a similar level of comparison to.....Gigli?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some well-done footage but an empty shell of a movie.","review":"What a stupid movie. Yes, it shocked, horrified, and disgusted me. Bravo, director. But then, I am easily shocked and I was making up character emotion and dialogue in my head to fill in all the silences - giving the kids more depth than you (the director) would have us believe they possessed.Ultimately it was a movie devoid of hope - and you expect us to believe that was the way it really went down. Bleak realism at its most soul-destroying.But...1) Those two movie killers shot down a hell of a lot more kids than the real ones did.

The movie doesn't bother to explain one way or another - you will take whatever you desire as an explanation for the senseless violence of the film. For me, this was just simply not enough. For a movie loosely based on the Columbine shooting, I want perspective, a view which will provoke discussion, an actual interpretation of the event itself. But merely a protrayal, and an utterly hollow one at that? The movie just left me feeling empty. Not sad, angry, or frusterated - just empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Post-Columbine Film","review":"This movie was so simple, and so incredibly mind-blowing. Some may think the opposite, but whatever they say isn't true. I'd see this film again in a heartbeat. It follows the story of a typical day in high school- gone awry when two loners decide they've had enough. It's a sort of post-Columbine film, and is really heartfelt and emotional at times. I loved the simple and eye-catching cinematography of this movie, and the acting was superb. Well done. This probably wasn't helpful, but you really ought to see Elephant anyways.

Had higher expectations from Gus van Sant. The driving idea behind this movie hits home about 10 minutes into the film and it plateaus from there. Lots of scenes with high school teens walking around and talking about shallow stuff that teens do. We get it, Gus, you're offering a microscopic look into the simplicity of teen life, as they unknowingly await tragedy that is just around the corner. A lot of people will tell you that if you don't like this film, you were just looking for action, and violence, and that you aren't cerebral enough to appreciate a good, slow-moving, film. Let me tell you, this is not the case. Just because it's slow, doesn't make it good.

I was left with a feeling of pointlessness. I understand that the movie was trying to depict the occurrences as a real life event that is very anti-climatic due to the distance one places between themselves and the world around them. However, if van Sant was not going for shock value there are a few discrepancies I have with this movie. If the goal of this movie was not to shock then why the pointless scenes such as the girls going into the bathroom and regurgitating or the two boys making out in the shower? These scenes, I believe were not necessary to the plot of the movie and seemed as lame attempts to \\"rawly\\" portray a sensitive issue just to do it.

I felt that Van Sant used the Columbine tragedy as a dramatic device to add weight to what would otherwise be a blend of homoerotic scenes between neophytes and existential meditations on the banality of adolescence (starring particularly attractive adolescents). I found the vignettes of the perpetrators that offered potential explanations as to the motivations and environmental factors that led to this massacre particularly distasteful, and as vapid as the mainstream media discussion following the real life events this story is loosely based on. Were they desensitized due to violent video games? Was the access to guns too easy? Were they misunderstood by their peers? Were they gay?

There are the bullied kids. The \\"in\\" girls (they vomit in unison after eating in the cafeteria). The shy girl who works in the library. Etc. Van Sant doesn't seem to care enough to attach any depth to his characters, and he allots them only such prefuntory moments on screen so that we know who they are when they get gunned down. A film like this makes a viewer reconsider the director's entire career. Was there anything there at all, to begin with? Or were we just giving him the benefit of the doubt? What is his exulted reputation based on? Drugstore Cowboy? This film, and his other recent work, for certain, is vacant, and feels like an exercise rather than a fully-realized piece of art.

I have to say, with other Gus Van Sant masterpieces like Good Will Hunting and Gerry, this is by far my favorite film he's ever directed. Not only did it show various students in different cliques in high school, but he let we, the viewers, relate to them in our own way. We get the notion that today is a typical day in high school, but as soon as the two students in black arrive, our hearts sink, and we know it's going to be chaotic. The thing I love most about this film is the rare talent shown by Alex Frost; he was subtle enough to keep me involved and afraid of him, and fragile enough to let me sympathize with him. Right on, Van Sant. Here's to tons more."},{"rating":"2","title":"No explanation's the best explanation","review":"This is the closest thing to poetry that any movie has every achieved. After the Columbine tragedy, any movie to do with school shootings that gives an explanation for the killings would be juvenile and insulting. But what Gus Van Sant does is create a similar situation with false leads that essentially creates an environment where a horrible thing like this can happen for no reason (or no reason that we know of). The beauty of this movie is in the irony. The hauntingly accurate depictions of a normal high school that delves into hell for a single day but then politely takes its seat again with the rest of the world.

The author gives you the feeling that the Germans could have succeded with such an endeavor, which is contrary to all the research I've done on the subject.

They can carry my weight (134 lbs). I guess they will be functional for many years.One issue that I found negative is that somehow they hurt my hands while pushing up. Despite having a foam cover on the handle parts, somehow the plastic bar manages to hurt my hand (usually my right hand).

And what REALLY makes me mad is that these DVD companies just keep re-releasing and re-releasing and re-releasing the SAME episodes over and over and over again. I believe that someone has the rights to the rest of the series, and refuses to let the go for release on DVD. And if I knew who that person was, I would love to slap them across the face.

Gore flies, the camera zooms and twists and the story goes into some new and exciting places. To tell more would be to give too much away. Things heat up in this one and the pacing increases to a really great finish that had me on the edge of my seat. Great care seems to have been taken on the look of the film because I was really impressed with the atmosphere and the lighting. Sure, some of the acting is poor in spots, but othet acting is incredible (the guy in the wheelchair!) and the effects are very realistic and sick. I give it a 4 and a half.

It's such a sweet story because Ian struggles so hard against loving Olivia, but ends up falling deeper in love than he'd ever dreamed of.

This book and others by the author are a great solution for connecting with young readers and those not reading yet. Gail Gibbons provides a succinct step-by-step discussion of the process of house building without oversimplified or complicated information. Her other books are just as concise and inviting. I find so many other non-fiction children's books too wordy and too confusing to follow. Such books detract from their original purpose, and my daughter is easily distracted. However, she chooses Gibbon's books over and over and gets excited about being able to explain the process back to me in her own way-- that's the ultimate test.

We can't wait till Zenz comes out with another book (which is actually why I came to the website to see if he has). If you read all the reviews it will be clear that his sense of humor translates to all ages.You'll also find someone's suggestion for a cure for the hiccups. Well I'd like to add to that a cure that is scientificly verified. A teaspoon of sugar, with a bit of water to wash it down. As soon as the sugar hits the tummy, it passes through the stomach wall, and corrects the spasm in the diaphram.

Yes, clouds. There are clouds and a magic carpet. As the carpet floats in a calm sky of fluffy clouds, Michelle LeMay returns you to the world of peace.Where other instructors teach you to stretch and then hold the stretch, Michelle LeMay rocks and nourishes the body. You move from side to side in some of the leg stretches and I enjoyed the spinal rolls, bird of paradise and careful pacing. Her cueing is more like guidance and her energy is subtle and healing. If you have been looking for a 30-minute stretch routine, I can recommend this highly.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace is only 30 minutes away...","review":"I love that in just 30 minutes, I can be incredibly calm and peaceful.

After a long introduction, the \\"exercise\\" starts with 2 minutes of standing and breathing and ends with 2 minutes of sitting and breathing. The 20 minutes in between covers maybe 8 types of stretches. That's it. The pacing is EXTREMELY SLOW. If you are a senior citizen or are recovering from an injury, I can see how this pacing would be helpful. Or if you want meditation as part of your routine. I wanted to get a stretching work-out, not a nap.

The only fault I could find was the omission of \\"Two Magicians\\". Many of the songs are centuries old and still have the feel of ancient celtic music. The inclusion of modern songs was a mistake, but it is still a must for people who like to experience a variety of music. This is not for people who only like one type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to a premier British folk band.","review":"Spanning the Years is an excellent introduction to one of the premier British folk bands. While not of the same caliber as the Sandy Denny-Richard Thompson Fairport Convention, the band stuck more closely to their roots than FC. The novice listener will find all of Steeleye Span's best-known (if not their best) tunes on this compilation. The reason why I gave this only 4 stars is the album does not hold together as well as one might like. This is a problem I have with most \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections. These best of anthologies sound like somebody threw an artist's material together at random, sprinkling the chartbusters in with some decent cuts from the albums. If you're not that familiar with their work, buy this cd and if you like it search out the other albums. Some recommendations: \\"Hark! The Village Wait,\\" \\"Commoner's Crown,\\" and \\"Now We are Six.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and mysterious","review":"I've just started listening to Steeleye Span.

This book is worthless. There is no plot. The characters are not developed and nothing they do or say makes any sense. It appears to me, after wasting my time reading this book, that the author's sole purpose is to pass her own depression and melancholy on to others. You know, misery loves company. Well, you will be absolutely miserable if you try to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book although I was confused at times with the switching of stories of Bhima and Sera. Poignant, believable characters living tragic, intertwined lives. It has motivated me to learn more about India and its culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predicatable","review":"I thought this story was predictable. The imagery used felt contrived at times, where it took me out of the story. I knew who the father was as soon as I found out that Ashok Mahotra was not the father. I think that was the only surprise in the book. It was disappointing given all the good reviews it got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable, shallow plot .","review":"Figured out the crux of the plot on page 16, without even trying.

I wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremitting Gloom","review":"The book shows the terrible slum conditions in India where a maid lives in one room with her granddaughter & uses public bathroom where people defecate on the floor. A far cry from the US slums who have flush toilets and running water. The book tells her sad story and her employers story of a wife beater husband. This book is unremitting gloom. Read it if you want to be depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Predictable Space Between Us","review":"This book came highly recommended, and unfortunately it disappointed me. The plot was highly predictable, after the first 35 pages or so. In the end it turned out to be more of a soap opera than an intelligent insight into the characters that I was looking forward to. The book does not even come close to Rohinton Mistri's depiction of the Parsi community in Bombay and is more melodramatic than thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful prose","review":"being a poet, I wanted to literally consume some of the author's prose. This book pulled at every emotion I own, and I loved every second of it. I read this book in 3 days, only because I had to put it down to truly absorb what was going on in Bhima and Sera's world. All of the characters were fleshed out well, Gopal's courtship of Bhima was my favorite part of the book, also I was not disappointed with the ending, instead i was very encouraged by it, and I wanted to keep reading. Hats off to this Ms. Thrity, I will definitely read more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"A beautiful book about two families of women in India. One is a servant, living in the slums, whose orphan granddaughter becomes pregnant. The other is the family she works for - led by Sera, whose daughter is married and pregnant. We discover much about the women's pasts and how they ended up where they are and what has shaped them in their lives.It's a really wonderful story - it's unceasingly interesting and full of twists (the big twist I had not expected at all). You really begin to feel compassion for both the lead female characters. One has suffered through an abusive marriage and the other has lost husband, children, and her life to servitude. Beautifully written and completely enthralling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bookschlepper Recommends","review":"A Parsi Indian woman and her cleaning lady are alternate protagonists as they explore their long-term relationship, pregnancy and abortion, abusive husbands, and their different places in society. Perhaps most stunning are the explanations of why a slum-dweller does not rebel and does not question, and why there is little valuation of women, even among women, in India."},{"rating":"2","title":"the space between us","review":"One of the best books I have read in the last couple of years. I learned a lot about India, and humanity in general. I was sorry when it ended because I totally attached myself to the fascinating characters of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Story","review":"The Space Between Us is one of the most compelling novels I have ever read. It is the story of the relationship between a middle class Bombay widow and her lower-caste servant whose lives intertwine in many ways, some of them quite unexpected. Both characters are very sympathetically protrayed as the author takes us back and forth in time into the depth of each of their stories. It was one of those books that I just couldn't put down yet really didn't want to finish. Hauntingly beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While it is a well written book, the story is worthless. The characters are pathetic, hateful, and vicious each in their own way. As I read on, I learned to hate each and every one of them and grown unsympathetic to their misery. The women are portrayed as weak and wretched and the men even worse...If this is our glimpse into the Indian culture, their portrayal isn't that flattering.Don't waste your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Men are pigs, life's not fair","review":"Did I read the same book as many of the other reviewers read? I found the writing bland, dialog horribly boring, disjointed and the plot was missing. The characters were not developed. It was a fast read because I skimmed. The book was not horrid but I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"why education is important","review":"The book, Space between us, is disjointed, character has no hidden spark, beaten by surroundings and life circumstanses. Eastern indian maids are slaves. the women are beaten for almost any reason and without education, living in the slums, one becomes a drone. i just do not get why books portray these women as mean, ruthless to the wives of the sons and cold hearted to the daughters. Read The Help for a better written portrayal of maids/cooks and their employers. the author spent a lot of time talking of the slums-very little words about the fancy house the maid worked in. would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no hope, there are no good people!","review":"The characters are pathetic. The women downtrodden and victimized. People are so consistently mean, devious, and self-absorbed that reading it was painful.There is no redemption, no hope, no moment of peace or forgiveness. I am not sure what the author's intent was.I do not recommend this book and only gave it one star - because you have to give it at least one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad","review":"This book captured me immediatley. The stories of each ladies life is very interesting, but the more I read, the more depressing and predictable it became."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent character study -- although sad","review":"This was a book club choice and I didn't know what to expect. Beautifully written, evocative, the writing made me see and experience Bombay -- in its richness and depressing poverty. You come to know and appreciate the women in this story -- even as you grieve for their character flaws. We have not discussed this book yet but I expect it will be a rich discussion as the book is both deep and wide.I am not sure I enjoyed the book but I certainly appreciated it and it made me really think -- and that, I believe, is what good literature should do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, sad book... but a good read","review":"I thought this book was gripping. When I read this, I was living in India on an expatriate work assignment. There are so many different cultures and stories in India, and this book provides a pretty interesting look at slum culture, domestic servant culture, and Parsi culture. It is a sad book, so don't read it if you're feeling depressed. However, it's pretty realistic I fear, and helped me feel more immersed in Indian culture. I didn't look at my servants the same way again! (honestly, servants are an uncomfortable concept for an American in the first place, but this book helped me see how important it is for people so close to destitution to have jobs they can rely on... that made me feel very grateful for their help)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the book and will miss the characters.","review":"I enjoyed this book, I really liked the way she developed the characters and the writing was beautiful!! If you want to learn a little about what it would be like to live in India this would be a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully evocative read","review":"The story of two women of vastly different backgrounds who share many years of close contact as servant and mistress, yet remain widely separated by social convention. The language is evocative and the story compelling. A wonderful, thoughtful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book!","review":"Colorful prose that went on and on, as well as two unlike able main characters, made this a miserable read. The plot twist was surprising, but led to an obvious conclusion. I had to force myself to finish the book.My advice - skip it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Too Short...","review":"Thrity Umrigar's writing in The Space Between Us is richly evocative of the sights, sounds and smells of modern day urban India, and of the thoughts and feelings of the characters that are its inhabitants. She sensitively reveals the depth of the understanding and concern, as well as of the underlying mistrust, that exists between two women of different castes who have spent decades as employer and employee. That, ultimately, mistrust must prove to be the overpowering force in their relationship leaves any reader waiting and hoping for a happy ending disappointed, yet the ending is ultimately liberating. Deserves a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories like this-- the reason I read","review":"This is a beautifully told story with complicated, flawed and compelling characters and impossible dilemmas. I was lost in the world the author created.... I finished the book a couple weeks ago and still find myself wondering, what will Sera do next? What is Bhima's life like now? Stories like this-- they are why I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A twist of fate ...","review":"In The Space Between Us, Ms. Umrigar takes us to the world of modern-day India, a land with many internal differences and conflicts. What she presents us with is the basic class divisions between two worlds: namely, the upper middle-class and the poor. These divisions are depicted through the everyday interactions of the two main female characters, Sera and Bhima, respectively. Ms. Umrigar has deftly created two wonderfully complex women and has given them life. You will identify with and feel compassion for each woman as she struggles in life and ultimately, decides her own fate. You will come to see that there are some bonds that outweigh class and/or culture divisions - that kindness and mercy know no divisions.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and found it to be beautifully written. I recommend it to those looking for a taste of India, interested in great character development or anyone else who wants a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My comments on this book","review":"This book is very close to reality of the society and the issue that it potrays. Throughout the book the author follows the characters of Sera and Bhima very closely.

Kept me involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I read in 2007","review":"From the first page, I was hooked and couldn't put it down. The story is so well written, you fall in love with certain characters and grow to hate others, the plot takes turns you don't see coming and the language is filled with incredible depth. At one point towards the end, I put the book down and yelled out loud. It was a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"harsh critic","review":"It is one of my favorite books of the year. Well written, great setting, and a good read from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Space Between us","review":"I found this book one of the most evocative books I have read in a long time. Though I did see it as an East Indian cultural book, I saw it more so as a book of humanities. We are just the same in the West. There are people are servants to the more rich , they are judged by money and status... we are all judged by education and money. I enjoyed the way Thrity drew us into her characters and perhaps like me, others could see how so alike all of our cultures are.What is so different for a woman in the west to be deceived and have her life ruined in much the same way? Very little I think - though perhaps the poverty is less.Please read this book. It is empowering, emotional and exceptionally evocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balloon seller motif","review":"How wonderful to have discovered a new author ( new to me) who writes so beautifully and so in depth about her characters. I loved the baloon seller motif which appears from time to time a symbol of hope for Bhima. \\" He had the secret see? The secret of loneliness. How to live with it, how to wrap it around your body and still be able to make beautiful colourful things like he did of those ballons\\" ( of the dignified Afghani balloon seller.)I found the intricate weaving of the Bhima and Sera's stories skilful and appreciated the insights into the diverse worlds they came from.

It tells the story of the Jews and their wanderings and persecutions pretty thoroughly. While there might be some bias on Mr. Potok's part, there is no way to argue that these things did not happen.

The author explains early on his notion of innocent, but I would hardly call a middle-aged man who picks up a young chambermaid an innocent. (Also, is this guy middle-aged, as the cover photo would indicate, or he is considerably older? He looks about 70 in the flap photo.) Moralizing aside, the author seems only vaguely interested in his plan to follow H.V. Morton's route, and he tends to skip from one subject to another in the space of a single paragraph. Though he makes attempts to explain the look of a thing, person or place, his prose isn't very visual. I also agree with another reviewer that there should have been photographs included.

In issue after issue.--including the flood, transitional forms, the geological column, and others-- Strahler annihilates the positions of people like Duane Gish of the Creation Research Institute. The only issue I think he could have treated more effectively is the \\"astronomical odds\\" argument against evolution that creationists use. Richard Dawkins addressed that more effectively in his book \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" (though I detest his militant atheism).

After cleaning it up a bit and installing it into a rack, the drawer does not open and close smoothly. For 120.00 you would expect something a little bit better considering you can buy a very high precision steel drawer for just a bit more money.

The fate of the last pair to attempt this feat, George Leigh Mallory and Andrew Irvine, has remained a mystery for seventy-five years as both ascended into a mist from which they were never seen again. This video captures the first moments of an historic day in 1999 when climbers found the remains of Mallory, perfectly preserved in its trans-alpine resting place. Despite the frequency of its conquest life on Everest is tenuous at best. Curiously, when life is at its most fragile, men of selfless heroism walk the razors edge when the safer path beckons. This video is a fitting requiem to two of Everest's early explorers and chronicles an age when achievements were less a public acclamation of the self than a personal celebration of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swingline 545 Stapler is inferior plastic (not metal).","review":"The Swingline 545 broke within a week.

In my old stapler, the plate that forms the staple is completely recessed into the base where it is held solidly in place. On the new stapler, the plate is only party recessed into the base.

The cost plus freight came to $26.70 for 6 socks .... that's roughly $4.50 per pair - OUCH! Twenty bucks was bad enough but to add more than 30% more to the overall cost??? Ok, so I did not think it through completely & wanted socks for my Yeti sized feet - shoot me.To add to my disappointment while waiting for these (should be) solid gold socks to be shipped, I was in Costco & found socks of equal quality & size (size 14 shoe) for just $9.95. Hmmm, lets do a little math - 16 pairs for the same overall price as 6 from this seller .... time to hit the control/alt/return keys on my laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good socks by any criterion","review":"These would be perfect if they lasted forever.These are pretty comfortable, they wash well, they're neither too \\"dressy\\" nor too \\"athletic,\\" and they have just the right amount of friction for playing Dance Dance Revolution on a soft pad.

A few of these (two dozen pairs) and I'm set for a few more years. Plus, as you'd expect from a company willing to put a brand-marking like gold-threaded toes, they stand out, and their quality is worth of a good impression.

I've been buying men's socks for quite a while as they are less expensive, thicker than ladies' socks and perfect for gym shoes and boots. I bought these in white a few years ago and after repeated wearing and washing are still like new.These black ones must have a lot of polyester or another cheap component not stated on the packaging. They pilled after only wearing and washing once (!), feel \\"slippery\\" and generate a lot of lint. Had I not thrown out the packaging I would have returned them. I will say the fit is good; although who knows what will happen after repeated washing?I thought I was buying good quality cotton socks. I wish I had read the other reviews before ordering.

A brand I once trusted is no more, and gone the way of the cheap manufacturing. These are comfortable, and they stay up, but like others have said, one or two washings, and they'll pit and look old and shabby. I'll still wear them, but only as long as they're covered in the gym. As a reference, I compared them to a pair I had for over ten years (back of the drawer, didn't wear them anymore because they had worn through the toe) and the old socks still looked great (except for the hole). I don't expect them to last more than a year or so, but they were cheap. I don't know if the more expensive ones were better because Gold Toe provides no description differentiating them. If you want a cheap sock with a short lifespan, get these, otherwise look elsewhere. Maybe the retail store socks are of better quality, but again, how are we to tell? Shame on you Gold Toe, what happened to your QC?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these socks","review":"I use these socks both for work and with tennis shoes on the weekend since they are basically sport crew socks just black instead of classic white.

Fools, but I guess you can count me in that group because I bought them here despite the warning posted here on Amazon. I found some Burlington socks that will do for now but they don't stay up the way the old Gold Toes did. Pitty.If you buy these you don't have anyone to blame but yourself (at least that is how I feel). I guess I just couldn't bring myself to understand what type of business decision would be involved in ruining a product that had such a great reputation. If it was a money thing, many of us would have gladly payed more for quality.

They have always held up well, looked great and are reasonably priced. I've read some reviews that they have changed the quality of the sock recently. I have to agree, yes, these are different then some older pairs I have laying around. However, I don't feel these are inferior to the older versions. It seems there is less cotton in the new versions which at first concerned me, however after extended use I have noticed that they retain their shape much longer then before. I have yet to find a \\"quitter\\" (sock that no longer stays up). Also there is less beading/pilling (those little fuzzy pills that appear on wear spots) then the older models. Because of this I feel these socks will look better and last longer then the older models. However, that being said I do miss the breathability of having more cotton and the slight increase in comfort. But for the price you really cant beat gold toe socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"I bought these because I wanted some cotton socks as they are cooler for the warm weather we have been having.

I buy him some every holiday season. Well, some time between last Christmas and this Christmas they must have decided to cheap out on the quality.

This work is anthropocentric at its core. The text is more about humanity and the human condition than it is about the divine. If this book were classified as a book of religious anthropology, I may rate it 4 stars. I simply cannot call it (the whole book) theology in the classical sense.

Well it was funny, the joke was on myself for buying this trashy piece of garbage. They showed no kills, no mating, not even animals eating their kill. To call this THE ULTIMATE SAFARI is misleading.

He did not sell me as a man in authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely engaging","review":"At this point I am far more familiar with Lewis than with its parent series Morse, so Morse fans should take that into account. Lewis features one of the most purely likable characters I've ever seen on television; Inspector Robbie Lewis is a shrewd detective but also a kind, decent, and gentle man. Against a rich background of Oxford landscapes and Oxford academic intrigues, Lewis's relationships with his sergeant, the intellectual Catholic Hathaway, his superintendent, Jean Innocent, and the coroner, Lara Hobson, provide a steady counterpoint to the tangled and unhappy relationships that result in murder. Lewis's relationships with his \\"guv'nor\\", Morse, and his wife, Val, both deceased, also play an important role in the show. Like all the best mysteries, Lewis is really about some people and their place in the world, not about the murders. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect team!","review":"The dry humor that both detectives have made this a very entertaining show!

It was a complete mess. Simply, the story was about a woman (Pheobe) who inherited an NFL team and her relationship with the head coach (Dan). Pheobe's character was a bimbo in every sense of the word, while Dan's character was hot-headed, disrespectful, and seemingly bi-polar. The story was so poorly written that if you skipped one paragraph, three weeks of time might have elapsed. It was as though the author skipped around in order to make things happen, it was cheesy!When I read a romance I look for witty dialogue, charm, steamy love scenes and scenarios that keep me turning the pages. This book did not have any of that. It is barely worth the time it takes me to write a review, but I felt compelled to warn people about how awful it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This was a great book from cover to cover, a feel good book that tells you to read more of Phillips books"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite!","review":"I use this book as an 'ambassador of romance', giving copies to friends to introduce them to what great romance books are all about.

Yes! it has some plots that are not great, but overall, I LOVE DAN...OMG! what a character..I am a sucker for alpha male but this one uff! He is MY KIND OF GUY...and I really like Phoebe, very strong personality as well; both of them have flaws, are not perfect like we all are. it reminded me of the movie \\"War of the Roses\\", two lyons with kitten's heart.Besides, the characters did not cry all the time. to me this is a plus, because i really dislike men crying and upsets me when females cries for everything. Not my kind of story.Also, I love it when women thrive within men's world and on top of it are the BOSSES! I LOVE WOMEN WITH COJONES!Very happy i came across with this book. This is one, I WILL MOST DEFINETLY READ ONCE AGAIN!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's almost corny, but I loved it.","review":"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book.

Sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacularly Funny, Great Characters and Plot","review":"This was my first SEP book. I'm hooked. Today I went out bought all of her books in print.Rarely do you read books where the characters are so wonderfully crafted. Characters you want to embrace. She doesn't force feed you, but drops wonderful samples for the readers throughout the whole book. Great timing and storytelling.How wonderful to see a female lead using her sexuality is such a savvy way. The story is full of information on football, but it doesn't overpower you.Some of the scenes were wicked in the most wonderful ways. I love this feeling of discovering another favorite author.Any book which makes me laugh out loud is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!","review":"The cover and plot scared me off from this book for a long time.

Read MORE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Sweet or Nice","review":"This is a romantic comedy with a mainstream touch that was shockingly coarse for its day (originally published in 1994) but is nothing compared to the language and behavior in today's paranormals. I skimmed all the football details. I skimmed much of the sex. I did not skim the interpersonal relationship scenes between the main good guy characters, which were both lively and interesting. For all I know, the football and the sex were lively and interesting, too, but not to me when I don't like the characters much.And that was the problem. I don't like a male lead who is such an alpha that anger is his only emotion. I don't like men who are bullies. I don't think they are funny, because they are not. The story did have its funny moments, and it was deftly written. And it had a happy ending. But I doubt I'll be reading any more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst romances ever","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a hopeless romantic that will go along with even impossible scenarios for a good story. \\"It had to be You,\\" isn't one of them. I was surprised how many people wrote good reviews for the book on Amazon.Here's the thing. Phoebe is a bit of bimbo(she has a smart side - that makes a cameo once in a while) and Dan is a jerk. There is lots of sex...but it's very strange awkward sex. The worst of which (and the least romantic) is when Dan and Phoebe have amazing sex (it seemed a little degrading to me, but still)...and Dan asks her about STDs right after. It's disturbing.I frequently wonder what coupled woulds stay together, after the romance novel ends. I don't this Phoebe and Dan would make it very far -- especially with Dan's abusive nature and Phoebe's insecurities. SEP has even thrown in an Epilogue -- that implies a Happily ever After -- after the ending.Overall, it's just not a story that makes you feel good and giddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty depressing, unless you don't mind rape as the focus","review":"I almost stopped reading when I read about rape, parental abuse and sex with minors. I continued reading because I needed a good ending to remove the bad images from my brain. In the end the victim kind of has a new beginning in life but it was not enough to compensate for the awful story. If I want to feel depressed I'll turn on the news."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not even finished","review":"...so predictable.We don't care for a millionaires any longer, give us a billionaires, from New York, of course.He is certainly falling for a simple, troubled woman and will perhaps get her out of her troubles...why else he is having his billions for?Good touch that he is a good son and tender and caring with his mother.Other than that - not much of excitement.Unless you have too much of a free time to kill, I wont advise to take it in to your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"I picked up It Had to Be You a few weeks ago and finally got a chance to start in on it the other day.

Anyway, I sat down for a good reading jag last night at about 8pm and read until I finished it at about 6am this morning (thank goodness it's Spring Break!). This book had funny moments, heart wrenching moments and moments that made you cheer. I appreciated the buildup of not only the romance between Phoebe and Dan but I also really enjoyed the buildup of the subplots. If you're trying to figure out if you want to get this book or not, GET IT!

I thought it was not possible to love a book more then that one UNTIL I BOUGHT \\"IT HAD TO BE YOU\\" This was what I have been craving. SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I love that the H/H are flawed and GOD BLESS SEP for not insulting our intelligence with couples falling head over heels in love after knowing each other 14 days!

The first time I used it, I HATED it... I was slipping everywhere and had to keep leaving my mat during the class. After class, the instructor came over and asked me if the mat was new and then told me to wipe it down with white distilled vinegar once or twice to remove any residue from the manufacturing process - that it wouldn't be slippery if I did that. I went home and did it right away and it worked. No more slipping at all. Now, I LOVE this mat. BTW, she told me this is true for most mats and that it is a common for her to see first time mat owners slipping in class:) The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I really think they should include this piece of information with the mat for customer service purposes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Well, it is just a flat mat so there is not much to comment on.

My hands tend to get sweaty and slip while in certain yoga positions (down dog, etc.), and I had hoped this mat would alleviate that, but it doesn't. My hands and bare feet slip on this too. I wear weight lifting gloves now to prevent slipping. I still use the mat as it helps to somewhat cushion my body and my lower back, but would not purchase another like it.

The author attempts to use pieces of the book of Revelation (and other parts of the Bible) to draw the simple conclusion that those that don't practice the Sabbath on Saturday are in sin and promoting the cause of the anti-christ. Not only that but the big revelation that is put forth is that the anti-christ is in fact the Pope. Not a particular Pope mind you, but any one who holds the office.If you are a 7th Day Adventist, I recommend you study the New Testament a bit more and listen to what Jesus said. Is it a coincidence that Jesus reiterated/restated 9 of the 10 commandments?

If you have a question about the bible or Christianity, you must always go back to the written word, The Holy Bible, for the answers to your questions. It is the FINAL WORD of GOD.

If ye seek a solid, dependable, inexpensive stapler that can be used to staple in a variety of ways and can also be brandished as a means of convincing subordinates to leave your office, look no farther.The Swingline Commercial Desk Stapler (S7044401A) has a name and- ID number?- literally longer than that of the USS West Virginia. It is the most solid stapler I've ever encountered, being made almost entirely of metal. It holds... a lotta staples. Don't know how many. But jams are infrequent and the design works superbly. Sitting on a desk, it does its job well. But the bottom can be swung out, allowing one to staple things to a wall or ceiling as well. It isn't the flashiest of staplers- just as the Ford Mondeo is not the flashiest of cars- but like the Mondeo it is a proven design that always, always gets the job done. If you're a manager, there's no better or more handy a device to wield when seeking to motivate subordinate employees."},{"rating":"1","title":"So BAD. please listen to all the reviews","review":"Okay, I never review but I just want the next person to know that you need to listen to the more recent reviews. something is very wrong with the current supply of this product.

I am now in college and was looking back into my earlier reading and remembered reading \\"The Vanishing.\\" I decided it was time to get the last two books. It was incredible. I could not put them down.

The book is an attack against Indian sovereignty and against the existence of tribal cultures. Bordewich argues that Native peoples should just assimilate into mainstream American culture and forget about their own. Any Indian who dresses in suit and tie and embraces Bordewich's very conservative political agenda is portrayed in this book as a \\"good Indian\\". Anyone else is portrayed as a romantic blinded by stereotypes. Bordewich, however, does not have the decency to be honest about his political agenda, but tries to make his conclusions appear as the work of an impartial observer. In order to beef up his argument, he quotes many scholars out of context and completely twists their statements in an effort to give legitimacy to his conclusions.

This box, the jaws of life couldn't open it. That's a good thing. I used a scalpel to slice thru.

Reasonably priced, too. My other favorite olive oil is Bariani."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great retailer","review":"Since reading the other reviews, I decided to try this extra virgin olive oil.

This compilation provides a nice overview of what I did like about the 90s, especially some of the more alternative songs and bands. For starters, there's my favorite 90s group, the Gin Blossoms, featured here with their biggest hit \\"Hey Jealousy\\" (I would have preferred the less-played, more soulful \\"Found Out About You\\"). In other radio hits, you have Cracker's \\"Low,\\" a gritty tune I found surprisingly appealing. A bit more off-beat but still-familiar tunes include \\"Dreams\\" by The Cranberries and \\"There She Goes\\" by The La's. The remaining tracks, a mix of hits and songs I'd never heard of, varied from upbeat and dancey to more garish and grating. However, most people will find something they like here, and if you're looking for an eclectic 90s collection, this might just fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"Whoops - i just reread my review and I have to say I missed the mark on one item: there IS some top-40 junk on here, namely the overproduced one-hit wonder \\"Everything About You\\", though that track is still amusingly subversive. There are also a few others that got way too much radio play as another reviewer noted. But overall still a great disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting \\"Laid\\"","review":"There are a number of solid tracks on this disc, although some of these are still too fresh in our minds as having been overplayed on the radio.

Having to stack and re-stack the transfirmer is a little bit annoying, but the leg work on the extra tall box is so effective, it's worth it. I like really long cardio videos, and if you do, too - get this one! Keep in mind that you need their special step-box thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeats the Whole Time!!","review":"This video is just the same moves over and over again. I actually got annoyed doing the video and fast forwarded through some of the repeating moves.

There are enough new moves to keep each segment interesting, including two separate tall-box climbs plus the incline box towards the end. If you like Stephanie's other dvds, you will not be disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"least favorite","review":"I particularly didn't like the portion using the incline with fast paced steps. It feels slightly dangerous and I kept worrying I was going to topple off the darn thing. Love The Firm for weightlifting but I think I'll get my cardio elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Firm DVD I've Ever Done","review":"I have a lot of Firm videos and this is the worst DVD I have ever done. Stephanie Huckabee is the absolute worst at cueing you for the next move and the transitions are horrible. I have tried this DVD at least 5 times and it's so frustrating, I have decided to give it to goodwill. I do love the instructors Allie DelRio, Pam Meriwether, and Allison Davis. Allie and Pam's DVDs with the Transformer series is awesome. I also want to rave about Alison Davis's Boot Camp DVD. It is one of the best cardio/strength training DVDs I've ever done and doesn't get boring. I'm also in awe at how graceful Alison moves throughout the DVD during all the moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid workout.","review":"This is a good solid cardio workout. While yes, there is a change of moves constantly, the cuing is good. Once you've done this workout 2-3 times, you will catch on. The workout flows smoothly from one segment to another, and does make some good use of the incline. If you are an intermediate exerciser, this is a good one to use. I actually look forward to this workout, as it does push me (I would consider myself advanced), but is pleasant to do. I find the constant change in moves challenging, and what keeps it from being boring. I am a believer in The Firm Super Cardio, but it does get wearing after awhile, as you know what is coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh.","review":"This DVD came with \\"The TransFirmer\\". I was really dissapointed with this one. It felt more like a dance video than anything else (and I hate dancing). They didn't use the step as much as I wanted, and there wasn't enough weight lifting. The moves were very complicated, I have never had trouble with a workout dvd before. I'd reccomend the other 2 DVD's that go with the trasfirmer, especially the one with the skinny blonde on the cover. There was a lot of weight lifting in that one if thats what you are looking for like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!!!!!","review":"I hate this video so much. I have tried to do it so many times and today I gave up and threw it in the garbage. It's not hard enough exercise at all and impossible to keep up with. She changes moves every 2 seconds. The camera doesn't stay on anyone in a shot where you can try to follow the moves. I can almost swear I've even seen the other ladies in the video trip up a couple of times. And, I just find myself tripping over my own feet and unable to keep up. I would take jogging or kickboxing over this any day. Too much effort with not enough reward. I want to burn calories, not learn how to be the ultimate step aerobicizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"no help at all","review":"I have worked in electronic for 15 yrs, and still couldn't understand what he tried to explain about PIC. but he wrote a lot of books about PIC..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relevent to robotics!!","review":"This guy should stick to writing about microcontrollers because there isn't much about robotics in this book!!

To flash an LED??? The C code is junior at best - obfuscated spaghetti code and his patronizing egotistical comments drive us crazy. And again, I just love all of the author written drivel reviews with 5 stars - predkos cramped writting style is recognizable anywhere.

This was my choice for 2006, and it really is a wonderful little book. The authors provide us with accounts from Appalachia's older folks who recall the Christmasses of their childhoods. It is almost like listening to them speak as we are told of a more innocent time in America, and the simplicity of their Christmas, which focused on the Lord. We learn about their gifts, which aren't much compared to today, their meals which sound delicious, games they played, church, and social gatherings. Recipes are included, as well. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to incorporate more peace and simplicity into their Christmas season.

Several of the CDs in the set I received have serious flaws both in sound quality and the technical recording itself. I have a good stereo system, not a boom box, and I bought the set from amazon.com not some Chinese knock-off. The pianist is fantastic; I am very disappointed in the technical production of this set. I am returning the set to amazon.com for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance, terrible sound","review":"Don't be mistaken, I am a big fan of Kemff myself.

Not knowing what exactly i was getting i had no expectations. I began reading it that night and finished it the next day. I enjoyed it so much that went back to the book store to pick up the rest of the trilogy. All in all it was an entertaining, fascinating read. Andrews is a good story teller, she manages to write detailed yet straight to the point accounts of events, keeping the book short and sweet. Being a woman i could really appreciate reading about shamanism from a female perspective, a subject i often find is writen by men. The characters are likable and her adventures mystical.

I wanted to believe in a love so strong that Genny helped her lover die a death with dignity, not a revenge so evil that murder was not only possible, but probable. Even as the jury reaches their own verdict, the reader doesn't.Plot, characters and twists all written in layers.

These are insightful, vibrant interpretations replete with the Berlin Philharmonic's charismatic warm and brilliant playing. I am very impressed with Ozawa's ability to lead the Berliners in a series of commanding performances of Prokofiev's scores. All of these are memorable, yet the strongest are undoubtedly the 1st, 5th and 7th symphonies. The tempi don't sound sluggish, but instead, tend to be slightly brisk. The warm, rich sound is aided by the fact that most of these recordings were made in the Jesus Christ Kirche studio used by Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic in many of their classic 1960's and 1970's Deutsche Grammophon recordings. Although this may not be the definitive set of Prokofiev's symphonies, it is nonetheless a collection of admirable performances and one worth acquiring at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy and entertaining read","review":"Not a substitute for an ASA105 class, but a good introduction.

Simon and James are spies but they both (mostly Simon though) seemed really stupid. There were so many moments where neither Simon nor James figured out what was going on. It made me wonder how are they spies if they are so dumb? I don't mind Simon making a mistake but when he doesn't figure out anything it's more than just a mistake it's stupid.

I also bought the sequel at the same time. I jumped the gun on that one. The heroine was annoying and feeble. The hero was dull as dirt. For the life of me I cannot figure out the appeal of Celeste Bradley's writing. I am on the verge of despair because I feel as if I have read all of the 'good' romance novelists and there is nothing left. Julia Quinn, Lisa Kleypas, Susan Elizabeth Phillips are at the top, followed by Julie Garwood, Christina Dodd, and sometimes Judith McNaught. Who else is as good as these ladies???

The writing was so weak, where the reader had to be constantly reminded what a viper one of the characters was because the dialogue and descriptions couldn't actually convey that. While Simon was interesting, Agatha was totally annoying--hardly the intelligent, witty, and spirited heroine other reviewers have described. If you want truly intelligent and feisty heroines, read Suzanne Enoch's \\"The Rake\\" or Mary Balogh's \\"Slightly Scandalous\\" or \\"Slightly Tempted.\\" Enoch's Georgiana and Balogh's Bedwyns would strike back at someone who insulted them rather than \\"projecting monumental idiocy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure!","review":"This is my first time reading Celeste Bradley and she's a keeper.

The socks are too large and too loose(my shoes's size is 8). In addition, after the first wash, these stretch a lot. I have Nike , Puma, CK socks and have never had this problem.

So this looked perfect.They are a nice sock. Good seams, good fit, big enough, but they just don't last. In 6 months, I have already thrown away five for having holes develop rapidly with them.Gold Toe can do better.

I have size 13 feet, and they are just large enough for me after washing.

Robyn Landis explains clearly and rationally why diets don't work, how the body uses food, and why it stores fat. She outlines a balanced, common-sense approach that involves eating small meals at regular intervals (every 3-4 hours). I appreciated the author's emphasis on becoming lean (as opposed to \\"losing weight\\"), and her emphasis on personal responsibility when it comes to health. Readers are encouraged to trust their own instincts and body signals when it comes to hunger and food.It is possible to adapt meals to accommodate vegetarian preferences.

It's easier for my child to put the shapes in through the top latch so he doesn't attempt to put them in the sides. Also, since the boat has holes in the sides, it will not float for very long as the water fills up in it. The little squirter animal is the only good thing about this toy. It's cute and small for little hands. As far as durability, it is very tough. It has been thrown many times and has held up perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales from Life","review":"Good yarns, not just about biking, but about life.

'Salon Pitzelberger' is Offenbach's 'Monsieur Choufleuri Restera Chez Lui Le' only in German.It is sung very well, the sound here is crystal clear and the singing very good. The slight information included with the CD is only in German. The orchestra is minimal but manages to sound very large and delightful. This is worth owning for two reasons. One, the qulaity is superb and two, if you are a Offenbachanite, it's a rare chance to own a rare Offenbach opera.To finish though, the EMI version is better. Offenbach always comes off better in French. To hear the rousing part where the host and his daughter and her lover pretend to be famous opera singers sing in German really is subpar to the original french. I'm the sure the Duc de Morny would agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paganini must have been THE GREATEST MUSICAL GENIUS of all time","review":"Mr Accardo does Him a great service in these recordings.

I started the Firm series w/ VHS tapes that use the box step but they dont work as well and now I use the Transfirmer w/ those workouts as well. They are very stable, fit together well and dont allow slippage- very important.Their unique uses (high, low, side-by-side, and incline) work a variety of muscles and keep boredom from stepping in.I wish there were more videos to go with it but its worth the buy. I use it as my main step platform for all my DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"TransFIRMer","review":"The positive things about this vs the fanny lifter is the range of exercises and positions that can be obtained, it does make the firm videos seem much more intensive and they are able to work target areas that the fanny lifter couldn't, such as the inner thighs.The only negative thing, I found, about the TransFirmer is how bulky it is, the fanny lifter was a lot more easy to maneuver while you are doing the videos, this seems so much bulkier and heavier, storage for it is slightly more considerable too than the fanny lifter.Over all it does totally fulfill the claims it makes about being wider, able to handle more pressure, the work out routines are more varied because of this new model too but the clumsiness of the size makes it a little bit of a challenge to switch positions while doing the video.That aside it does help you get the results you are after!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transfirmer","review":"I am a 64 year old woman and I needed to work out my legs and this is a great product, gives you so many different levels to work up to.

I've called Firm and they said they cannot replace it unless I bought it from their site.Also there was absolutely no packaging when shipped. It was shipped in its original thin cardboard box without even a strip of tape on the opening of the box.Poor quality and service.

Are you kidding me... the instructor was like Tony Little after 5 double espressos, moving from one complicated set of moves to another with absolutely NO time to familiarize yourself with the steps. About 30 minutes into this completely frustrating exercise frenzy, I turned it off and now I'm too discouraged and disgusted to even try the other two c.d.s that came with the system. So much for feeling good about myself or breaking an exercise plateau. All I did was waste money and become horribly frustrated and angry.

This series is no exception. The moves are good, and the music is great. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the new TransFIRMer is large and somewhat difficult to move into new positions. That said, it's by no means a reason to not buy the system. The new box allows for new moves that stretch and tone parts that the other boxes weren't able to get to. Overall, it's a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a workout!","review":"This TransFirmer really gives you a great workout.

I like \\"Was mein Gott will\\" which uses trombones and string bass masterfully (one of my favorite instrumental textures).

Their antics are somewhat reminiscent of Dr. Seuss's \\"The Cat in the Hat\\". Creative, wild, and crazy, the cure is worse than the curl. As illustrated in the following text, Harriet's siblings are determined: \\"Harriet's sister plopped a colandar on Harriet's head, and her brother pulled the curls through the holes.\\" Ms. Stewart's amusingly phonetic text will please all children, and Michael P.

The only reason why I give it a 4 is because very few albums on my list score a 5. I've recommended this album to all my friends and I still haven't received any complaints. It's hard to choose a favorite song. The vocals, programming and production are top notch. A synth-pop classic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Freshman Synthpop Release!!!","review":"Although I call them freshman, Iris has been around for quite some time now under the name Forgiving Iris. With a few singles dwelling throughout this release it's a sure winner for music lovers in general, particularly those interested in synth-pop or the general dance scene. A sure win for anyone and a great buy all-around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveal Reusable Cover","review":"I have the 6\\" x 9\\" reusable cover and I love it!

But I would warn you to be very careful when making your purchases on Amazon. I still do not know what I did wrong, but I ended up ordering some books twice. I desperately tried to stop the shipment, but Amazon does not list a phone number and the online cancelation was in a loop that did not work! Because the shipment ultimatelly ended up in Kingston, Jamaica the cost to return the double ordered books is more than the cost of the books. So I am now left with three books I had NO INTENSION of ordering nor any use for and I can not find a buyer here in Jamaica. I am going to be VERY angry when my credit card bill arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't handle the wattage it was supposed to","review":"I purchased this converter to go with a 150 watt appliance I had given a friend for Christmas.

This safe didn't have a review, it was a little more expensive, so I hoped they would package it better for shipping. They didn't. It came in with two big dents on the side. The shipping center only had packing on the bottom and the front. The sides were left unprotected and the right side was dented. The safe looked sturdy overall, but I'm sending it back. I'll go to a store instead where I can see the safes myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for honesty, 0 for inspiration","review":"I bought Ray's book seeking insight into business and the personal qualities of a business man. The book contains little business insight, but is a complete autobiography of one of the most successful enterpreneirs of the century.Ray Kroc told his story with honesty and enthusiasm, but I am not richer for it. This surprised me, since I deeply believe in the virtues of individual opportunity, and Mr. Kroc lived his life by this creed.I was left cold by Mr. Kroc's single minded dedication to business during his entire life. Maybe that is what it takes to succeed on the scale that he did, but it isn't something I would wish on somebody I cared about.Ray's story taught me to make sure that my search for wealth and success does not consume me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Very Satisfying Meal!","review":"This book is like McDonald's - not very nourishing or satisfying! While I loved reading about Mr. Kroc's upbeat attitude and how he became so successful, I don't think the book was very well-written. (I couldn't believe it was written by a former journalist for the Chicago Tribune!) Nevertheless, I found many inspirational quotes in the book, such as the homily that Mr. Kroc recites ... that not even education and talent can make you a success. You need persistence, for the world is full of people who had the other two but never went too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ray Croc, a great businessman, not a great man or author","review":"Ray Kroc's autobiography provides an interesting glimpse of the McDonald's system and it's development. The book is well written and interesting to read. Despite this, I do not recommend the book. It offers no wisdom or lessons learned to take away from the book besides Kroc's greatness. (Kroc never suffered from an excess of humility.) In addition, I found it difficult to like Kroc. He rarely found fault with himself and blamed others for his and his businesses problems. Particularly galling to me was when Kroc had the opportunity to invest in McDonalds and another earlier business opportunity, his wife of 30 years was unconvinced of the plans wisdom. Rather than spend the time to bring her aboard, he tossed her aside continued with his business plans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just factual for 1970","review":"it is a overblown story, You can get same info on You tube, buy a burger you will be ahead of the game,"},{"rating":"2","title":"good start to a great story","review":"The history of fast food and how it developed are among the best stories in business. Ray Kroc adds his perspective in this biography. This is actually a very fair biography and Kroc tells the story from his perspective. The discovery of McDonald's from his milkshake business and the ineptitude of his friends in diluting the brand name are among the high points of the early years. He takes us pretty far into the history and the only thing you want to hear more about are the aboard prospects. While I prefer behind the arches this book is an excellent start to a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Whether you agree whether McDonalds is a 'great' company or not - after reading this, I'm sure that you will agree that Ray Kroc was a genius businessman way ahead of his time in many ways. The fact that he didn't even stumble across the original McDonald brothers restaurant until his mid-40s makes this book even more compelling. One of the best business autobiographies I've read and well worth getting in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book by a great entreprenuer","review":"This book is an easy read and gives a new appreciation for the McDonalds brand as well as perspective on the ups and downs of business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book really caught me. Just great. It shows how Mc evolved to be the company we know today!I read some negative reviews from some people that said that this book didn't inspire them... come on! Inspiration comes from inside yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is an excellent book that provides insight into the beginning of McDonald's and more importantly, Ray Kroc. I believe any entrepreneur or small business owner would definitely appreciate Ray Kroc's account/history of McDonald's and all that he put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorganized and bloated","review":"I bought this book in hopes that it would help guide me on the path to learn Java programming. Numbering over 1000 pages by several different authors, this book does not have a very consistent feel to it, and jumps around to various subjects about Java and various networking principles. The first 200 pages would be good for a university networking class, but as for being a decent tutorial, it is horrible. This book gives little code snippets here and there, but never fully combines them into one large, solid, and useful application.If you are looking for a book to act as a Java tutorial to networking, this is not the book for you. It is very comprehensive in some areas, and much more than many people are willing to spend in getting through sections of this book. However, if you are looking for a little more general purpose Java networking Bible, then this book might be more suited for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got 2 wrong products","review":"I ordered these sheets for my son's room.

Although her target audience may ultimately be students of psychoanalysis, Luepnitz describes the process of the \\"talking cure\\" without pretensions. Even the reader without a background in psychology will find her stories compelling and her analysis easy to understand.There is something in each of the five case studies that most readers will be able to identify with.

I know many people have a problem with the religious aspect of this book but I didn't find it to be a problem. There are sections dedicated to that topic but you can just choose not to read them, I am not a religious person so I chose to skip the chapters dealing with that and focus only on the NFP charting and rules. I am about to complete my first month using this book and I couldn't be happier; I have learned more about my own body and cycle in the last month through this book than ever before. The explanations are extremely clear and understandable and because of that I feel very confident in using the NFP method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book! Natural Effective Eco-Friendly Birth Control","review":"This book is a detailed manual for learning the sympto-thermal method of Natural Family Planning.The sympto-thermal method is a highly effective method of birth control, that involves only a thermometer, personal observation, and patience to make it work.The method has been throughly studied and has numerous examples and scientific references to back up the information in the book.There is a good section in the back containing reference books and resources for nursing, nutrition, and men's and women's health.This book is geared towards a Christian religious tradition (primarily Catholic), but the information inside is very valuable for it's own merits.If you are looking for a completely natural form of birth control or pregnancy planning, that involves no drugs and is non-invasive, This book is what you are looking for. It is useful and very effective. I would and do recommend it very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"This book provides thorough, easy-to-understand information about a much-maligned but wonderful means of planning a family. Unfortunately, I hesitate to recommend it to others because of its strident tone. The Kippleys' insistence on doing things their way is frustrating at times. (How many times do they say co-sleeping families should buy a king-sized bed with no headboard? Is that a moral imperative? I don't think so.) The book is frequently pharisaical and smug. And there is a section on maintaining a happy marriage by freshening up before hubby comes home and acting like you care about his political views that makes me cringe.I hope that in the next edition of this book they'll stick to the facts about the method and the theology that informs their work, and leave the editorializing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource!","review":"I found this book extremely helpful and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to use NFP as a means of either pregnancy prevention or pregnancy achievment. The book is very descriptive and leaves no question unanswered when it comes to this method. Definitely an excellent resource!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Wonderful!!!!","review":"I first heard about this book and NFP at our parish's marriage preparation classes so I went home & ordered it. I have almost finished it and I must say that the information in this book is very valuable. I thought I knew alot about the female reproductive system, but I learned so much from this book I was so impressed! I always thought the Catholic church only approved the Rhythm Method for family planning which I've heard is not very reliable. NFP is so easy and can be just as accurate as taking the pill but without any harmful side effects. Some people might object to this book because of the strong religious morals of the author, but if you are a religious person like myself then you will probably learn a thing or two about sex, birth corntrol, marriage, family and the church that you didn't know before. All in all I highly recommend this book to all married couples, especially newlyweds, it will really bring you closer together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, life changing","review":"This has been very helpful to my husband and I in our quest to learn NFP. As practicing Catholics', we find the information extremely valuable and encouraging. Thankful that this product even exists for couples--it is a great way to bring the focus of your marriage back to what God intended and it definitly brings you closer as a couple if you practice this together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I found this book overly preachy and borderline offensive. The NFP instruction is helpful, but hard to stomach the morality statements in between. Instead try Toni Weschler's \\"Taking Charge of Your Fertility\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, if you can get by the catholic theology","review":"This book book gives some good information about NFP. Unfourtnatley it also includes a great deal of the authors moral point of view that will attempt to make you feel guilty to force you to use NFP. It also is very critical of other forms of NFP and makes unsubstantiated claims of other NFP method effictivness rates."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book","review":"I bought The Art of Natural Family Planning because I want to learn the symto-thermal family planning technique. This book is textbook sized and way more than I needed to get the hang of things. It has a VERY strange Christian focus, which I was not prepared for. (An entire section of the book is called \\"Does God care about birth control?), and they use terminology such as \\"fornicating\\" to describe un-married sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overbearing","review":"The authors' religious beliefs really get in the way of what could be helpful information in this book. Unfortunately, I could not stomach the anti-birth control propaganda, the inference that the only reason to use any type of birth control is to space children properly, or the admonition to \\"say my morning prayers\\" while taking my temperature. I was interested in learning about my body, not the Catholic view of birth control.Maybe because the introduction and section on coming off the pill turned meoff so much, I didn't find it very useful. I found it disorganized, highly technical, and somewhat annoying. I would only recommend this book to Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for women!","review":"The Couple to Couple League and the Kippley's truly respect women!Plus NFP costs only a thermometer, some charts, the book and love.It's wonderful to have such respect from my cooperating husband.Anyone who is searching for a boost to their marriage should learn NFP!I love the information in this book, and especially the faithfulness to the Magisterium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to understand and use!","review":"This is a wonderfully comprehensive book on NFP. I would recommend this to anyone checking out alternate forms of NFP because of the reliability and effectiveness of the sympto-thermal method taught here. Great \\"marriage insurance\\" too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NFP with ease","review":"The Art of Natural Family Planning gives wonderful instructions on how to use the sympto-thermal method to deterimine when a woman is in the fertile or non-fertile stage of her cycle. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is concerned with using chemical or barrier contraceptive methods and wants a natural alternative. My husband and I have been practicing NFP for 2 years now and feel blessed by the openess it has brought to our marriage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most complete book about Natural Family Planning.","review":"I read the 4th edition of Natural Family Planning and enjoyed every word I read. I have always practiced natural family planning, but this was the most extensive and well written book on the subject that I have read. Using my natural fertility signs I have been able to get pregnant three times without any intervention. This book will appeal to you if you are looking for more than natural family family as well. It inlcudes chapters on breastfeeding, natural child spacing, scriptures from the Bible, health and nutrition, menopause, pregnancy and marital relationships. The method is Biblically based and is written by two authors who have practiced this method. This book really opens your eyes to what the other Doctor's and experts fail to tell you. I highly recommend reading the Natural Family Planning book even if you haven't even gotten married yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"I got this book on a recommendation from a friend of a friend. I'm interested in NFP, and a lot of the information in the book that I've read so far is good (haven't come close to finishing it!). However... I am a Christian, but not Catholic -- and the Catholic influence is major. Much more content relating to specific Catholic beliefs than I was expecting...and more than I care for, honestly.Guess I should have looked a bit more closely before purchasing it, and I don't have an alternative to suggest, but I wanted to extend fair warning to anyone else looking for something NFP-related with a spiritual element... I don't believe this is the book for everyone, so you might want to look closely before purchasing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect way to learn properly!!","review":"If you want to learn Natural Family Planning, this is the best book out there!!!

It comes complete with the research to back the method up, and the citations include the empirical evidence proving NFP's 99% effectiveness rating.However, there is a newer course and book out that simplifies much in this book, making it more accessible.The Art of Natural Family Planning Student GuideStill, this is the definitive guide, and to my mind, it is indispensable to those seeking to practice Natural Family Planning.This book is an excellent resource.I do strongly recommend that couples take the CCLI course from a certified teaching couple.
