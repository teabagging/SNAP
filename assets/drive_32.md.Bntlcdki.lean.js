Big mistake; she is attractive but by no means capable of \\"carrying\\" a picture. The film is a confused mess, the type of film they often create in Europe when they have funding, a cast, a producer, but no plotline, theme, or plausible dialogue.

Her 5th grade chorus had sung some songs from it, but she had never seen the movie or heard all the songs. The ones she sang made her curious about the rest. It's as much a \\"visit from the past\\" for me as it is a new experience for her. In a high school concert I sang \\"These Are a Few of My Favorite Things\\" (and even wore a white dress with a blue satin sash!) The clarity of both video and audio is very good.

Even if you've seen this movie hundreds of times, this version of the film will amaze you. The mountain, the blades of grass, the reflection on the stream - everything - are absolutely and perfectly crystal clear. It is amazing, and carries through the rest of the film with the same power. It literally blew me away, and convinced me of the power of BluRay in the presentation of classic films in a new and wonderful way. Though I do not purchase many BluRay movies, I can honestly say this one is worth having in the collection. It makes the masterpiece even more masterful. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice package","review":"This edition comes with a Blu-ray disc of the movie (which looks awesome), as well as a DVD edition, a Mucic CD, and a special features Disc.

The clarity of the picture is incredible.It seems in the widescreen format that one sees a lot more than the typical pan and scan. Richard Rodgers immortal score sounds wonderful. I really enjoy the feature that allows one to hear the score without dialogue. None of the heartwarming and touching qualities are lost in this version. No matter how many times I see it, I still get misty eyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'must have' for the collection","review":"The Sound of Music was an annual event in my family because it aired on TV once a year while I was growing up. Even though I've seen the movie many times, I just watched the DVD version and was amazed that I had either forgotten or never \\"heard\\" some of the dialog before.The film transfer and the re-done sound in dolby 4.1 is awesome (especially when you consider I've seen the movie mostly on TV in mono!). I haven't had a chance to review the second DVD with all the extras yet, but you can bet I will.What surprises me is that they've never re-done and re-released The Sound of Music in the theatre. I'm sure is would do well. The wide screen format onthe DVD is really great, so you can really see things that were cut off in TV broadcasts.Buy it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"Got this at a really good price through a website notice that it was $9.99.

The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film.The film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps. Was it perfect? No. I did think there were too many songs in here, some of them done twice. That's too much. There were a few other things, but it's nit-picking. Overall, a film which lives up to its lofty reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative Sound of Music","review":"Very prompt service - within days of order.

Quite a complement to our library of favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"I never tire of this movie! I was delighted when I heard that this beloved classic would be released on DVD in widescreen and Dolby Digital and with THX certification to boot!This movie has always been a favorite of my family and I was delighted to see it for the first time in widescreen never having seen the movie in a theater. The grandeur of the scenery can be enjoyed much more fully in this format. Every song is a classic that you'll love to hear again and again. The picture and sound quality is so superb, you won't believe it was released 35 years ago. The bonus disc with a making of documentary, musical outtakes and other goodies is a welcome bonus especially considering the low price!For the price of a single DVD, why not own The Sound of Music and a bonus DVD for your family to enjoy for years to come? You won't want to see it full-screen with marginal sound once you've been spoiled by this wonderful set.Highly recommended!

I love this movie but anyone thinking of purchasing the DVD needs to be aware that this DVD plays in Widescreen format ONLY! If your not familar with DVD aspect ratio that means that this movie plays in a window that runs across the middle of a standard TV screen. The top 1/3 and the bottom 1/3 of the TV screen is just black bars. On my 19\\" that means this movie plays in about a 10\\" high bar. I have to sit one foot from the TV to watch it. For me this totally destroys the viewing enjoyment of one of the best films ever made. Without a widescreen TV this DVD is just a... frizbee (OK it's 2 frizbees). Most manufactures double side the DVD's so that standard format is on one side and widescreen format is on the other side but 20th Century Fox does not do this for some unknown reason. I recommend that until it is released in standard format just keep watching it on your VHS tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU HAVE TO SEE (AND HEAR) IT TO BELIVE IT!","review":"Listening to the soundtrack right now sends chills down my back just hearing Julie Andrews' delightful crooning.

Said young woman spontaneously bursts into song, the children adore her, and the captain finds joy again until the Nazi's put an end to their fun at which point they escape Austria.

Don't get me wrong I like Juile Andrews, but I find her more attractive now. I could watch Princess Diaries over and over and never get bored with her. But in this movie she looked more like Sandy Dunncen, the women from Hogen Family. She was the woman that replaced Valerie Harper after there was a problem with production. I did like Valerie better then Sandy, but I find Sandy more attactive then Valerie, but I like Julie Andrews more then both of them, but I especially like the modern Julie Andrews more now then in this movie. The only person that did a good job was James Cann. He was able to provide substance to an otherwise slow moving movie. You might remember James Cann from Roolerball and the comedy Godfather. He was good as the comic relief in that movie. I hope that he can put this movie behind him and get to more productive movies like his part in Back to the Future or Alien Nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sound of Mucus","review":"This movie should be called the Sound of Mucus.

No. Top ten? No. Top thousand? Nope. But I always enjoy watching it when I come across it. Robert Wise was no slouch; this is expert family filmmaking, funny and uplifting and even suspenseful. Sure, it's supposedly based on fact even while we know that no family with this many kids of this many ages could possibly get along this well. And sure, you can't expect complex moral dilemmas in a movie that posits, \\"Nuns, singing, and children are good; Nazis are bad.\\" But no one approaches this movie without knowing what he or she is in for, and therefore I'd be amazed to find anyone who was genuinely disappointed by it.

The Sound of Music, the Blu-ray format, the superb sound, the two-disc combo, and it goes on and on. For anyone who desires a 45-year trip back into movie history, this is the DVD for them. I toured Salzburg in 1986, and at the time I only took still photographs of my journey through the streets and climbs on the mountains. With the 45th Anniversary Edition of The Sound of Music, the hills were alive for me once again, and the special features included with the disc combo, provided a special video memory for me to keep as well. And the bonus DVD can be shared with friends and family who do not have the Blu-ray technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!!!!!","review":"This movie is so corny yet beautiful!!!

We look forward to watching the other Blue Ray movies we have purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Musical BY FAR","review":"I saw this marvelous movie in a theater in San Diego in 1965. The Blu-Ray edition brings back the original sound and video with a vengeance. It is beyond belief what the techies did to this musical. If you have a Blu-Ray DVD Player, buy this version. You will not regret it. Teamed with HDTV it is sumptuous. To answer one reviewers complaint, no you cannot play Blu-Ray on a conventional DVD player. You are missing out. Sorry. Also, Amazon was quick with free shipping and they had best price I could find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! My first time watching this movie, and I really love it!!!!!!!!","review":"Forget you modern day, cheesy dance flick, American Idol starring crap musical movies! Wow! That's all I can say about this movie in one word. I love this movie! This seriously is an amazing story, based on a freakin' true story might I add! Loved it! Had everything: children in their innocent youth, a young woman becoming a lady, a sad man who didn't know what he had, and to top it off, a war! For those who have never seen this movie before, I say to you: What the f--- are you waiting for? Seriously, this movie will move you, if not, become your top 10 movies of all time. Don't be ratchet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great price!","review":"I finally own this movie and I got it for an amazing price from amazon! I'm very happy customer. I Highly recommend this movie and amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacharrine, but Totally Irresistable...","review":"Look forward to the Blu-Ray - saw it in Todd-AO (curved screen, quasi-Cinerama) in Hollywood, 1965, can't remember which theatre, was in the navy, stationed in Long Beach, just remember the visuals were absolutely overwhelming (saw 2 other classics there - \\"Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf?\\" & \\"Lord Love A Duck\\") - the most inspired shot is the very beginning - as the film starts, you just hear a \\"whoosh\\" of air, against a totally white screen...(for a few seconds, you wonder, what's happening?...) then you realize the camera's moving through clouds.....that shot, along with numerous others, created an intense \\"involvement\\" that few films can achieve...I loved the movie, & from what the other reviewers have said, this must be the ideal release..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unforgettable Musical","review":"Certain scenes from this movie stick in one's mind forever. Who could forget the scene where the father says, \\"You delivered your message. Now get out of here!\\" to the guy (the future boyfriend of his daughter) who has just given the Heil [...] salute? Or the scene where the father tears down the German [...] flag soon after the Anschluss? The music is always lively and upbeat, especially for such a sad and tragic time in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Memories","review":"THE SOUND OF MUSIC holds many happy memories for me, first when I saw many years ago at the movie theater and then as a perennial classic around Thanksgiving. It is a happy film, very uplifting, with a happy ending. The ending is so moving that it makes me cry every time I see it and the Von Trapp family walking along the hilltop in beautiful bright sunshine into freedom and happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PURCHASE!!!","review":"Great purchase for price I paid of $28!!!!!!

The songs have always stuck in my head. I even did the Sound of Music Tour when I was in Austria. But now I've got my daughter introduced to this beautiful music. This and the Wizard of Oz are her favorites.I bought the easy piano scores for her to play the songs on the piano, and singing lessons on CD \\"Voice Lessons TO GO\\", by Vaccarino (They're great and a lot cheaper than private voice lessons!) for her, (even though I use them when she's at school). So she is confident to sing along while she plays her Edelweis and Do a Dear. We love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie never changes...it's a winner!","review":"No matter how sad I feel, I can watch this movie and remember that God is still around, as evidenced by the naturally beautiful scenery in this movie. The hills are alive...so is my heart when I watch this magnificent scenery unfold before me.Sister Maria is funny. She makes me laugh whenever she answers so childishly casually but so brutally frankly. She is so kind who could dislike her?I first saw this movie in 1966 when I was ten years old. I was very impressed by everything in the movie then, and I am as impressed now at the age of 50. I guarantee that this movie is still a winner after 40 years! That is a fact that will never change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"No matter how many times I have seen this movie it is great it makes you laugh and happy and even sad.

It was a bonus that it was the 40th Anniversary set. If you have seen it on the T.V. it is never as good as watching this as a full length movie. Cost and shipping were Great. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, but PLEASE don't watch on DVD--it's awful","review":"I was so excited to get the 5 star collection of \\"The Sound of Music\\". When I did, I popped it in expecting that warm feeling but instead I found it cold and vaguely creepy. In the opening scenes, showing the Austrian hills, the scenes look so fake and cartoonish...like a video game. These scenes were actually filmed on location to get the true feeling of being there. Now, they look computer generated--in fact, I can tell some differences that have been thrown in to make everything look even more glistening. It isn't higher resolution, it's fake stuff. The warm feeling of film is gone and is replaced with harsh sound and even the faces of the characters look plastic, like robots. This is a movie best seen on VHS in Widescreen format. If they digitalized it anymore, it would look like \\"The Matrix\\"...it almost does. I love the DVD format for most movies but this one overdoes it bigtime. It looks like a cartoon or video game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound of Music, Love it or hate it.","review":"I never really watched the sound of music all the way through. There is a wanabe nun and a family that need a Nanny if you will. They are thrown together And everything in some sort of way connect. Where the captian and maria end up marrying and the kids and maria love or have a good understanding of each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound of Music-40th Anniversary Double Disc Edition","review":"A must have for all Sound of Music fans!

The acting, music, directing...all genius. It is timeless and a great family film. Julie Andrews has a beautiful voice, as does Christopher Plummer. I have read books on the real Von Trapp family, and certainly, Hollywood took some liberties, however, because it's such a wonderful film, we can forgive them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie moves slowly at first but keeps you interested. You quickly get tied into the characters. Great acting by most of the cast. At times the music tends to slow down the pace of the film. Great intrigue at some points toward the end. Definitely a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is THE SOUND OF AMERICAN MUSIC hosted by Mary Martin?","review":"The amazon.com product description indicated the documentary, THE SOUND OF AMERICAN MUSIC hosted by Martin, is included in the package.

But not so Pristine...","review":"I used to own the Two - Disc R3 version of this film and decided to get the R1 Digipack release for distinctive packaging and to re-view this classic this coming Xmas (a tradition of some sort). to my surprise, the R1 transfer is the same with R3 release. the only noticeable difference is the transition of menus which in R1 is animated. the audio-video transfer is average for this classic. Read DD4.0 and not so pristine video presentation.nevertheless, this is an interesting addition to one's collection... a film about challenging traditional family values in a \\"discomforting\\" environment.. in a two disc digipak.still hoping for a better transfer this year..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound of Music","review":"The Splendid family movie , I have watched since I was 10 till Present, its greatest is still the same whenever I watche it."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful blu ray edition","review":"I already own the DVD with specials - have for a few years. And I thought that looked amazing. But to see this blu-ray transfer - oh, my....i don't remember it ever looking this good. And it truly makes you feel like it's a new film. It's nearly unsettling how you feel like you are actually flying over the lakes and trees in the opening. Excellent job - and made it worth going out and buying the same flick again....remarkable job - bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of MY FAVORITE THINGS.","review":"I have loved this movie ever since I saw it in 1965. When I saw this as a Gold Box Deal I went for it and so very happy I did. I was blown away when I opened the box at the quality of the set. It looks like it should cost over a hundred dollars. The music box is the very same color and print of the drapes in Maria's room that she makes the children's play clothes from. I am enjoying the books and learning more about the real Von Trapp Family.Now for the Blu-ray oh my goodness. It is like being right there. It is full HD viewing pleasure. I already had the DVD which was really good but when you look at one then the other there is a BIG difference for sure. The sound is amazing also. This set is so worth the investment if this is a favorite of yours. I also have the Wizzard of Oz set my other favorite of all time.Highly Recommend it is worth the few extra dollars if you want a beautiful keepsake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun!","review":"\\"The Sound of Music\\" is one of the best family movies!

It was cheesy, slow in spots, and way too much singing. It was hard to see what the whole point of it was. I did like the nuns, though. They were great. I really didn't care anything about the characters and the movie was off the scale in terms of realism. I know this is based on a true story, but the whole singing just ruined any shred of hope and realism for this movie. I must have made my wife mad to have her torture me with this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wide screen - hardly seen","review":"The Wide Screen format ruins the movie - makes it hard to see unless you have a HUGE television. For the price of the DVD, it should allow you the option of full screen if you prefer that over the wide screen format. I started watching it, and gave up. Rather see the VHS version without having to use binnoculars."},{"rating":"1","title":"7.1 is an awful system","review":"STOP this 7.1 crap it is awful quality no one needs it and no one can use it.5.1 works for both stereo and multi users."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. The story,although not always factual to the Von Trapp family, is still wonderful. A lot of literary license was used to make the movie what it was, but that does not detract from it for me. If one wants to know the real story of the Von Trapp's, they can always research it. Julie Andrews is always wonderful to watch, and this is one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound of Music","review":"My son was very happy that I bought him this as a gift. The only problem I had was that the collectible box that came with it was broken.

My mother insisted I see it as a teenager and I wanted no part of it. As an adult with girls 3 and 6, we are enchanted with this movie and watch it any chance we get. It is always the first request on movie night for my girls. Everytime I watch this film I appreciate it in a new way.The story is lovely and apparently real. The dialog is witty and meaningful.The songs are catchy and the scenery will mesmerize you. It has all the elements and twists in our own lives. This film is poetry in motion-picture!-And the sound track! It is just a must for any personal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Classic to have","review":"It's a Movie that you have to have at home.

We make popcorn with M&M;'s, get under the comforters on the sofa and settle in.We recently went to the Trapp Family Lodge in Vermont where we went cross country skiing and took a horse drawn sleigh ride. My kids will never forget it.There is so much junk available to divert kids.....in the movies, television, video games, etc. It's great to have a family tradition that we all love and that involves such a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casting my vote","review":"A childhood favorite, I once had this precious movie in my possession.

IT HAS IT ALL-- HUMOR, ADVENTURE, AND ROMANCE. I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is what Blu-ray was meant for!","review":"I was blown away by how the image looked and how it sounded. There's not only a lot of detail in the image, but Fox kept the grain structure of the film - no scrubbing it clean like other movies (or worse, adding back in fake grain afterwards). It still looks like film, but without any instability issues. There is nothing to distract you from the story and from just singing along! If you have an HDTV set, but are only able to watch the DVD, you should try to upgrade to Blu-ray since this is what HD was meant to show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound of Music Anniversary Edition","review":"What a wonderful classic, that was beautifully restored. Since this is not \\"Time Compressed\\" to run in the time alloted that you typically see on network and even cable providers you get to see the whole movie. There were scenes that if I had seen before I had long since forgotten. That made the movie doubly enjoyable...for the re-discovery. Watch it with family and you will hear people singing the songs for the next few days. Enjoy...we did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the perfect picture, but......","review":"Yes, I do need to put in a BUT. I was so pleased to finally see this movie fully restored to pristine condition. This big box set (yes I went all out and bought the big boxed set)was missing just one thing to make it PERFECT. The 45th Anniv. soundtrack included in the set is just the soundtrack as originally released. All the extra tracks that came with the last CD of the soundtrack are gone.Wow, they came SO CLOSE to perfection.Still, an amazing set and the picture is stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Release of The Film To Date!","review":"The 40th anniversarry DVD Release of the film is absolutely spectacular.

Stopped after viewing the blu ray for the first 10 minutes. Regret to have purchased this collection's set.The blu ray is less than high resolution. Most of the screens of landscape show many flickering points which are rare in blu ray. Horizontal lines all over the screen are obvious which are common only on VCDs and not normally found on DVDs, and the first time seen in blu ray.The music CD is contained in a plain paper CD holder without the track listing anywhere.The music box sounds less than 8 seconds even with a full wind and can hardly be heard if the cover was not removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Livestream Ever!","review":"Absolutely horrendous quality of a purchased movie ever.

I would not hesitate to do it again. The product was in excellent condition and it arrived as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite classic","review":"You simply can't go wrong with this movie. Mind you, this is not an accurate biography of the Von Trapp family - the real Maria was nowhere near as lovely or sweet as Julie Andrews, but this movie is a entertaining story nonetheless with some pretty awesome musical numbers.Julie Andrews really shines in her role as young Maria as she goes to become a governess for the Von Trapps. Her sweet asnd steadfast personality allow her to remain cool under the pranks that the Von Trapp children play jokes on her (they even feel bad for it!) and how she eventually gets through to the patriarch of the Von Trapps himself. Set amidst pre World-War Europe (namely Austria), this is a lovely if somewhat fictionalized account of the Von Trapps. The music and dancing numbers themselves make this movie worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Movies","review":"The movie quality is really good.

This movie is great for kids as well as grown ups.Now Julie Andrews is one of my most favorite people. The End."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest musical !","review":"The Sound of Music is appealing to adults and children alike whether the year is 1965 or 2065. The musical score is excellent and Julie Andrews is clearly the best. I doubt if there will be ever a film made such as The Sound of Music. I would recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound of Music","review":"Was extremely happy to see this item on Amazon with a special price.

The quality is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu Ray Sound of Music stunning picture","review":"Seeing is believing, this Blu Ray is breathtaking in so many scenes. The scenes in the Abbey were so crisp I felt like I was 10 again seeing the film for the first time on the big screen in an early 70s revival. Salzburg has never looked this good. You can even see the delicate patterns in the tweed jackets.The audio is music to the ears (don't shoot me for the bad pun please). The 5:1 sounds studio quality again.Did anyone else have a crush on Christopher Plummer the first time you saw the movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The enhanced Blue Ray/DVD combo is an excellent value. The movie is a timeless classic and the digitally remastered product makes this even more enjoyable. Would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I Movie...I Could Watch It Again and Again","review":"It's no secret that the real story of the Von Trapp family has altered for the screen. But who cares is there was no Rolf or that the Von Trapps didn't escape from Saltzburg on foot. You still get a classic movie chock full of rich and flavorful Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, a winesome performance by the great Julie Andrews, a happy ending and breaktaking shots of Austria. I strongly urge people to buy this DVD and throw their VHS copies away. On VHS, you lose most of the 70mm format. That means you get three Von Trapps vs. seven in a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic...","review":"A classic movie that is worth every penny! The scenery are enhanced beautifully on the Blu-Ray, not to mention the sound quality. The commentaries are very enlightening. I LOVE this movie and never gets tired of it.

When the puppet show comes on, they get really excited."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless film!","review":"This movie combined a very captivating and multi dimensional story . Indeed , this movie is much more than a simple love story , but it is much more than a sad chapter in the middle of the war . This film reached and developed its own profile due precisely its kinetic flexibility and brilliant engaging charm , keeping in mind several fundamental factors.Obviously the personal charisma of Julie Andrews who somehow was the british answer of the lovely Audrey Hepburn . Andrews owned her own charm : radiance , sweetness and beauty in the purest british mood .The absorbing and magnetic presence of Christopher Plummer , a very gifted actor who actually is giving a towering and recognized performance in Broadway .The rest of the cast was a goldness triumph . Who can forget those lovely kids ?The admirable direction and the spectacular landscapes were too undeniable elements who added its contribution for this eternal picture .A film to enjoy over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"watch it with your family!","review":"Great movie, wonderful songs, gorgeous scenery, romance, reverance, drama, life lessons, values like courage - loyalty - friendship, the list goes on...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't everyone love this movie?!","review":"It is one of the best \\"classics\\" of all time.

Of course I preordered this item.But what a disappointment! Sometimes picture is grainy, sometimes picture is out of focus, sometimes picture is not sharp. Ladies and Gentlemen this movie was made in the 60's not in the 20's. This movie deserves the better transfer possible in these days. The sound is pretty good, but I would like (and I hope I not alone) much much better instead DTS MA two channels stereo LPCM 192Khz/24bits to enjoy the full splendor of the music.I already have 2 DVD releases and this Blu-ray release.

Most impressed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breahtaking","review":"Well, it is finally here.....the ultimate edition of this great film. It never looked or sounded better. However could someone explain to me the 7.1 DTS sound? I have the capabilities but it doesn't sound any different than 5.1 digital. Regardless, I can watch this film over and over again. It is masterfully produced, directed, cast, edited...It is just stunning; a work of art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My FAVORITE movie of ALL TIME!!","review":"If I could give this 6 stars, I would. Bear in mind, I'm an adult, pretty cynical, and a native New Yorker. However, if there's one movie that can bring me to happy nostalgic tears, it's this one. In minutes my cynicism is reduced to a grown adult bouncing around on the couch, singing along word for word. It's the film that is most remniscent of my childhood, and I couldn't imagine growing up without it. If you're a parent, or if you just want some happy, untainted idealism in your life, watch this movie. It's still my favorite of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hills are alive..and they allways will be","review":"For me the sound of music is one of the most beloved movies of all time. Beautiful music..wonderful cast...everlasting love. What more can you expect from a movie?. I'm so glad that this movie is finally release on DVD because is a gem. For me the sound of music is the sound of love, the sound of better times,the sound of innocence and most of all this movie has the sweetest sound of all the voice of Julie Andrews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I was so excited at the prospect of this item, which includes a rubber ball that you put a solid ball of detergent into. It promises that the detergent ball will last 25+ loads. Um, no. Try maybe 5 before it is shrunken to the size it tells you is too small. It worked fine for those 5 loads in terms of getting the laundry clean, but that's a little pricy for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat concept, great for small washers","review":"I actually like this item very much. I think it does a decent job cleaning my clothes without being too harsh. I have a portable washer only and have to air dry everything, and my clothes smell fresh and clean when I have used this.The main trick is to use this with cold water mostly and don't add bleach- bleach seems to shrink the ball a lot(at least it looks that way to me). Hot water tends to use up the ball the most though. Because my washer is small and I use mostly cold water, the ball actually lasts about 20 washes.It does loose a point however for the difficulty of putting the ball into the rubber holder and also the holder ripping at the opening after 5 balls(roughly 100 washes or so)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept - lousy performance","review":"This is a great concept, providing the convenience of not having to measure detergent for every load. Too bad:* Clothes come out as dirty as they go in* Ball seems to be getting used up much faster than expected* Product is very difficult to get into the rubber ball, a problem for normal people which I would expect would make it impossible for people with arthritis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't work!!!","review":"I tried the ball a couple times, did not clean at all, clothes came out smelling and looking dirty, Waste of my money!!! In the other hand it could be this cleaner is not intended for High Efficiency washers, Who knows, could not find any information in the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap","review":"It was supposed to last for 25 washing cycles, it lasted for barely 2 even though I used cold water and ran a short program on the washing machine. Will not buy again and this product does not exist on Church and Dwights homepage so I guess they know it was crap and removed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but Good!","review":"Montana Christmas was pretty good book it was a little short but it was an enjoyable read and if you don't mind a short story than I recommend this romance book which is about a guy named Hank and a lady named Jeanne. I personally think this is the perfect length for people who maybe are busy and don't have time to read a long book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting....","review":"I am not a \\"political person\\", in fact the book was given to me. I started reading it because it was there and to my surprise I became totally engrossed. A lot of unanswered questions and half truths were confronted and answered. When I checked out the information from this book I was skeptical; then I was shocked-it was as accurate as it was disturbing. I would encourage anyone really interested in the facts to read this book and take the time to check out the facts and references-it's time consuming but very sobering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truthful Look Inside","review":"With increasingly concentrated media ownership, the right wing now controls the megaphone. Hate radio and cable news have effectively manipulated public opinion over the past 15 years. The good news is that it seems that people are now finding their voices and with the writing of some brave authors armed with the truth, public opinion is beginning to shift.Sidney Blumenthal's beautifully written account of his experiences dealing with the deep pocketed attempts of the right to bring down our last legally elected president is both chilling and enlighting.With the publishing of David Brock's Blinded By The Right, and others like Michael Moore, Joe Conason, Eric Alterman, Hillary Clinton and Al Franken's soon to be released book, a much clear picture is beginning to emerge of the nefarious plans of the power elite and the lies they tell to fool those not paying attention.Well done Sidney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is facinating","review":"Pathtic how the right had it out for clinton when he was a big time centrist to begin with. Blumenthal is honest and tells it like it was. A very good read although I still do not know why the clintons were so hated even today. Sad, but true....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncovers the secret vast rightwing conspiracy !","review":"You want to know why Clinton got impeached over a personal matter while Bush and GOP are getting a free ride even while it's obvious that they are indeed guilty as sin for dragging this country into a nazi-like war in Iraq resulting in oil for blood and in the process killing thousands of US troops and hundred thousands Iraqis? Then read this book and defeat the TALIBAN RIGHTWING MEDIA !!! And yes, we need to purge the centrist Democrats and put real Democrats in their place to WIN !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Sid's story, not Clinton's.","review":"An inside account of what it's like to be in the cross-hairs of the right wing gun sights. From the media assault on his family on his first day at the White House, to the unjustified interrogations, Blumenthal somehow survived a prolonged attack from all sides. The book is interesting because Blumenthal is able to view it broadly--as a political war--and not simply as the personal ordeal that it must have been. It appeals as a classic survival story where Blumenthal, as the smart kid with the glasses, beats the bullies who gang up on him. Of course, the scary part is that if the American people hadn't figured it out, the bullies might have won."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important piece","review":"Blumenthal writes passionately about the Clinton presidency as you would expect.The first 200 pages or so are comments on the first term where he did not work for Clinton, and I only skimmed through those as it was mostly references to other sources.The next 500 pages are much more personal and although nothing new and surprising comes out, Blumenthal still writes a fairly balanced account of the events and shows his brilliant polical and intellectual mind on many occassions.An important part of the history writing of the Clinton presidency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother...","review":"Blumenthal -- like most political operatives with a book deal -- has churned out an indifferently written and profoundly humourless blend of hagiography, self-justification and character assassination. (Newsflash: Sid and Hitch are not going to kiss and make up any time this century.) And like the work of most political operatives with a book deal, this will have limited appeal to anyone isn't already in the choir or researching a term paper. Three stars for partisan Democrats and those who waste their Sunday mornings watching cable talking heads. Everyone else might want to give this tome a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased, but Valuable and Insightful","review":"I have been amused by those on both the political left and the right when it comes to their views of the Clinton years. Here the author shares some first hand experiences which are both enlightening and fascinating. His bias is obvious throughout this long book, but most of the readers tackling this work will benefit despite that. In fact I would have been disappointed if he had not been passionate about the ideas that he believes in. Overall it is a good first-hand account of the Clinton years from an insider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why would ANYone value ANYthing MR. Blumethal has to say? He has been discredited so many times, I'm surprised he got published. Somebody said he was a journalist? Maybe in the eyes of those like Mr. Blair at the NY Times, but not to anyone with a brain.The book reads like one big apology and excuse. Bottom line is if you like Clinton, you'll like the book.What a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sid sheds no light on Clinton & Bin Laden","review":"Sid's new book of drivel does not tell us why Bill Clinton failed to arrest Bin Laden after the Sudan offered Bin Laden on a platter 3 times. Clinton & the CIA new Osama was bombing and killing Americans after SIX bombings and one ambush.Sid sheds no light on why the Clinton Admin did nothing about Bin Laden which caused the death of 3,000 + innocent people on 9-11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeze","review":"Right wing - left wing - who cares? The point is Dear Sidney couldn't tell fact from fiction. He's all too hasty to elevate his boss to the point where your jaw simply drops and you go: \\"say what?\\" This has nothing to do with partisanship, but simply facts. I guess I'm not ready to worship at the Clinton altar unreservedly. Sidney is. And he can do it without those pesky little facts. For me, I'm a little more discerning. I need a couple facts to help me out. Sidney is scant on those. Give this one a big pass. It doesn't satisfy anyone even with the most modest curiosity of the behind-the-scenes peek at the Clinton Whitehouse. I was hoping for a story without hype and hoop-la. But hype, hoop-la and hero worship is all I got, here. It was pretty boring because it became so predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Best a Silly Book for Whiners, At Worst a Misleading Tome","review":"The irony in this book will make you laugh, at least if you're not bothered by misleading information. Is it plausible to suggest that Clinton would have done a better job hunting for terrorists if he hadn't been busy defending himself in Monica-related investigations? Perhaps if Clinton hadn't been hunting for Monica, he would have had more time for hunting for terrorists. Another misleading aspect of the book is that the press is controlled by conservatives. This is truly odd. The leftward tilt of the press is highly documented in numerous studies. I recommend this book for people who want to live in a pretend world."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Said / She Said","review":"I purchased this book with the hope it would be an interesting and detailed study of the inner workings of the White House in formulating policy. I was also hoping to learn more about Mr. Blumenthal, who he is and how he had become an adviser to the President. These most interesting topics were largely relegated to one chapter. The bulk of the book simply rehashed every bad thing a conservative writer, pundit, operative or politician had said about Mr. Clinton. The clincher was the Chapter on how George W. Bush stole the election. Coming from a very independent minded largely apolitical person this book wound it self up with a hugh negative in that regard. An upside to this book is that it is well written and definitely expanded my vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"800 Pages and Not One Word of Wisdom","review":"Every time I think someone is going to give an honest evaluation of the Clinton Administration, you get a book like 'The Clinton Wars'. Clinton must have something on Mr. Blumental because I wouldn't make career lying for a friend who made a habit of lying to me. This book is not a book worth buying. It's not even worth wasting the gas or time to go to the library. Please end the Clinton rehab tour, no one is buying tickets to the show. It's like revisiting Nixon all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring and one sided portrayal","review":"Even though I am a conservative Republican, I enjoy reading inside accounts of the Clinton administration. I found George Stephanopoulos' book \\"All Too Human\\" to be very interesting reading. Even though it was pro-Clinton for the most part, the author did provide criticism when he felt it was deserved. Blumenthal's account on the other hand, finds absolutely no fault with the former president. He parrots the infamous \\"right wing conspiracy\\" theory originated by the former first lady.In addition, the book is way too long at over 800 pages...I gave up after forcing my way through over 500. I recommend the Stephanopoulos book or Michael Waldman's \\"POTUS Speaks\\" as much more interesting and balanced reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing crap","review":"Since Sid was an insider, any reader expecting an objective account of Slick Willie's tenure will be sorely dissapointed. Despite the meaty heft of the tome, Sid flails about weakly attempting to castigate Clinton opponents (and often on hearsay)but failing to explain the processes going on at the time that resulted in: a) the biggest economic bubble and corporate pilaging of the 20th century (sorry kiddies, you can't blame Bush for that one); and worse b) allowing al-Queda to stage smaller terror attacks relatively unpunished that led directly to 9-11. I could care less about Ken Starr and the McDougals, as they don't matter compared to what happened in NYC that very ugly day, and his boy Clinton had a major hand in allowing it to occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texacana at it's best","review":"Great book on the Texas Rangers. The book is easy reading and tells the story of McNelly's rangers throught the eyes of a Young Ranger named Ed Durhm. Would make a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Every Texan","review":"If you grew up in South Texas, you probably wondered about the history of YOUR part of the state. Everyone knows about Sam Houston, Davy Crockett and all the heros that finalize the trip...but if you want to know how you got to the point where heros were relevant, you need to read about \\"the Strip\\", what made Rangers so important to the history of, not just Texas, but the nation as well. This is the best book I've read...of course, I'm a little jaded...I grew up in the middle of the strip, I've known every Ranger from 1955 until I left the state to go off to war...and never came back.Try the book ...you'll learn more about how our country developed than you could ever imagins. And once you've finished it...come back to Amazon for any of the other 25-30 South Texas history books they carry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm at best","review":"High production values, as always, but otherwise very lukewarm. The twins are attractive, but the best thing about them is their centrefold shot. There is no spark here, and no erotic tension that is really required for the twin and sister thing to work.

Period.","review":"I grabbed this movie while I was deployed in Iraq from a vendor on the street, and once I finished watching it, I had to check online to make sure it was actually made in the US. This was by far and away to most HORRIBLE sub movie I have ever seen---and I have seen most of them. The acting was completely flat, the plot was non-existant, and whoever they hired as a technical advisor should be shot. The uniforms were either wrong or poorly cared for, the verbiage and pronounciation of sub jargon and medical terms was off, and the appearance of the crew was nothing like what you would find in the real world----a sumbariner with a BEARD?---Ummm---NO!If you enjoy sub movies, this is one to stay far away from-----very far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Submarines","review":"This movie is trash... it is an insult to the Submarine Service with so many errors it would be hard to count them all.

There are no real instruments. It's VERY authentic stuff. Recording quality is good, but if you're looking for a toe-tapper ---this isn't it. It sounds like noise to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended - Don't Buy","review":"Horrible cover photo. The stereotypical \\"NobleSavage\\". I bought this CD primarily out of curiosity because it was so cheap. I think I understand why it's such a bargain. The music itself is okay, all traditional songs of various nations (this is not the type of music usually heard at powwows. Those looking for that will be greatly disappointed). I suppose the title is accurate: \\"Authentic Native Amer. Music\\" since the songs are definitely \\"Native Amer.\\" However, my main complaint is the lack of liner notes. The song list is exactly as noted above, no names of groups or individuals or even when the recordings were made. It makes me question if the songs are correctly identified by tribal affiliation. The quality of the CD is poor. Most likely these songs were \\"reproduced\\" from old recordings with the intention of making a fast buck. Don't waste your money on this. Use it to buy the many other high quality CD's produced by Native Amer. artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be worth the money...","review":"Poor sound quality on many tracks, but for the price, ok as a very general introduction to traditional American Indian music.

The save of this movie was Woody Harrleson and Don Cheadle who is great as the bad guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"After Sunset","review":"I like all three stars. The mix of adventure, comedy and romance was good. I thought the shark scene was hilarious. Bought a copy for a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dissapointment","review":"The concept is a good one: What happens after a thief's last big score and subsequent retirement to an island? But it's botched. Director Brett Ratner, who's 'Red Dragon' was so brutal and intelligent, seems mostly concerned with the best ways to shoot Selma Hayek's, um, assets. The plot is clumsy, the jokes are juevenile, and the relationship between Brosnan and Harrelson lacks humor, despite the actors' best efforts, because it is completely implausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"DECENT CAPER MOVIE","review":"two retired theives match wits with an FBI agent who for some odd reason doesn't believe they have given up crime.DVD includes deleted scenes, bloopers, commentary with director brett ratner, \\"interview with a jewel thief\\" featurette, and more.woody harrelson is great in this film and along with the rest of the cast you will rarely experience a dull moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"If you enjoy a movie where you always know what's going to happen before it does, this one is for you. The screenplay is predicatable. Hayek is beautiful, but she plays a caracature. Brosnan tries to look sophisticated and sexy by never shaving, but he can't pull off the look. He just looks old and haggard, especially in contrast to Hayek's vigor. Woody Harrelson wastes our time. Don't watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Light-hearted Comedy","review":"It was just a good solid comedy. Nothing epic, but fun and cute. I didn't expect to be entertained but completely was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strange Pairing of Woody and Pierce Works!","review":"Now \\"After the Sunset\\" is what I would call a really cool and funny movie. You can well expect something fun and interesting if a movie has both Woody and Pierce Brosnan in a movie together, and you get it in this film. The movie doesn't take itself so seriously since this isn't a serious heist film. There are little small jokes thrown in here and there that keep you watching and really keep you entertained. There is even a twist at the end of the movie that I never really saw coming. Throughout the film, you see two enemies that eventually grow to have respect for each other and even become friends. If you want a serious action flick like off of a James Bond movie, this movie probably wouldn't appeal to you. But if you like \\"good cop bad cop\\" comedies that keep you entertained the entire time, this is it. Not a blockbuster movie, but entertaining none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selma Shows Off Her Assets","review":"This movie gets high marks for five things and low marks for three, so overall it's a keeper.THE GOOD - (1) A very colorful film, with wonderful bright colors from the Bahamas scenery; (2) an interesting story right from the get-go; (3) originality in the story; and (4) yes, to be honest, Hayak's figure, which is seen in abundance throughout the film. She knows it's good and isn't shy about showing it, and (5) overall a good mixture of crime, comedy, romance and suspense and just right amount of time at just under 100 minutes.THE BAD - (1) Insulting gratuitous sex and really stupid sexual dialog at times; (2) once again subversive Hollywood making the FBI character a moron, for the most part; (3) some Rambo mentality (bad guys miss from close range, good guys never miss, etc.).It's an outlandish story but don't analyze it for credibility or you'd be turned off and quit after 10 minutes. Just go along for the ride and enjoy the entertainment....and entertaining it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"There are one or two comic moments that makes me smile, but on the whole it is boring. The technology is lame. The heist is lame. The twist at the end is lame. There is a camaraderie between Brosnan and Harrelson that works in spite of the material. However, it actually hurts the movie in some ways. It makes it hard to believe the level of antagonism that is needed to exist between them. Hayek is beautiful and likeable, but her revealing wardrobe does not redeem her one dimensional character. I kept expecting the movie to soar a little, but it maintains a very low key, mediocre level through out. Very disappointing. I like the actors and the location so I am giving it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"After Sunset","review":"This was a fantastic movie... great acting, great story line, perfect pace, great twists.

If you click on \\"Smile\\" it plays the \\"Birthday of a King\\" sample. Like the reviewer said, \\"hauntingly beautiful\\". On this basis, and because the tracks and the sample links do sometimes get mixed up within a tracks lists (not from 'way outside!), I ordered this CD from overseas. Well, \\"Birthday of a King\\" is not on this CD at all. Any other Judy Garland CDs that the song is listed on are all \\"Unavailable\\". So:a) Amazon/CDNow, fix this sample errorb) fix the review referring to \\"Birthday of a King\\"In the meantime, I got a CD with this very special song by Judy Garland from CDUniverse. When you order from overseas, and pay the extra shipping cost, and wait expectantly, the disappointment at poor quality is great. I have ordered many CDs from CDNow over the years, but after this experience it will most likely be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I haven't even taken the CD out of the cellophane and I am already disappointed. As another reviewer has already stated (something I did not read before ordering), \\"The Birthday of a King\\" IS NOT on this CD even though it is on the sample for this CD. The only reason I purchased this CD is for the song \\"The Birthday of a King\\" as it seems that no one else has recorded this beautiful song. Judy Garland was a fabulous artist and I am sure that the rest of this CD will deserve more than a one star rating. I guess the one star is not really for the CD but for the false listing of songs available on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"This is kind of like when Elvis went Vegas-y....The voice is still decent, the music's just sort of too Vegas-yDefinitely not Mr. B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. B is out of his element","review":"\\"Stormy/Feel the Warm\\" is the album by this great artist to avoid.

This album showcases the talents of not only KRS-One, but of D Nice and Scott la Rock. The cuts Poetry, South Bronx, The Bridge is over, and Criminal Minded are classic cuts.

Cool J (who was also \\"hard\\" but different from BDP of course) etc. but Criminal Minded made me a little more open minded, suddenly I had the feeling that I could understand a philosophy in it. KRS One never disappointed me up to this day with any of his albums. Tracks like \\"THE BRIDGE IS OVER\\", \\"SOUTH BRONX\\" etc. are still getting me freaked out today but the one that changed my mind already was \\"POETRY\\". It has the most powerful beats and lyrics on the album. The most truest defining of what a rapper should be and say. Buy it and keep it - it's a treasure since 1987.

We watched the film over 2 days, and each day the children were stone silent, glued to their seats. I recommend watching it after you study the American Revolution as the students will get a great deal more out if it.

Now, fifty years later, I see it as sort of a kids' movie that doesn't have a lot of depth. I'm glad I saw it again, but I can understand why Hal Stalmaster decided to give up acting. However, I would love to know what happened to him.

The second half of the movie was full of adventure. My favorite part was when the Minutemen fought and chased the British back to Boston. I am in 5th grade and I had to read the book for school, and afterwards we watched the movie. Most of the kids liked the movie more than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate, I think not!","review":"As a Disney movie of the 1950's, Johnny Tremain is alright, that is if you don't mind the incredible number of mistakes and errors litter throughout the film. Based on an exceptional book by Esther Forbes, the Disney film essentially rewrites key elements in the book, makes pointless changes in the plot development, cuts out the more interesting supporting characters and leaves you with a santitized verison of the months leading up to the Revolutionary War. My advice, read the book and gain an authentic view of the courageous men and women who risked all they had to bring about America's independence from Great Britain. The film is best considered as a piece of Disney nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment after reading the book","review":"My daughters and I looked forward to watching the movie after reading the novel but we very disappointed. WHile reading the book, we had great conversations on the committment to change and the beginnings of revolution which were so profoundly expressed in the novel. The movie seemed to trivialize and negate the emotions involved in both the Boston Tea Party and the beginning of the Revolutionary War. Many of the great characters of the book were completely left out or not touched on, as in the case of Rab.On a good note, though, it was a good Disney movie with no foul language and a good happy ending.

Some history is changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another favorite book Disneyfied out of existence:(","review":"I just can't figure out why the folks at Disney have always and continue to deem themselves entitled to change what ain't broke. They have done the same thing to Alice in Wonderland, Peter and the Wolf and (gag) Narnia, and countless other beloved stories. They take a classic that is very well known, cherished by millions, deem it imperfect somehow and then presume to \\"improve\\" it! Here is yet another Disney \\"improvement\\" that isn't. This is a different and not better story, darn it! Could have been great but instead destroyed! I am heartbroken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Fashioned Patriotic Fun","review":"This is a classic. I remember seeing it in elementary school for class. I don't know that we learned much except that history can be fun.This is not \\"history\\" in any meaningful sense. It is a historical drama set at the time of the beginning of the American Revolution in the city of Boston. The title character is a young apprentice silversmith who becomes caught up in the \\"Sons of Liberty\\" patriotic organization. He takes part in the Boston Tea Party, the signaling from the Old North Church and the running fight from Concord back to Boston. Along the way he carries himself in a responsible and honorable manner. So too are the British (mostly) depicted as honorable people. The teaching value of this film is not in the teaching of historical facts but in the depiction of attitudes and conditions and some of the political causes of the war. Even so, don't watch this for the lesson. Watch it for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!!! But READ the BOOK!!!!!","review":"This was a wonderful movie!!!!

The movie is an adaptation of the Newbery Award winning historical novel Johnny Tremain which is set during the American Revolution. The movie is okay but not at the exceptional level one generally thinks of for a Disney movie. The highlight of the DVD is Walt Disney talking about human freedom in the Special Feature The Making of Johnny Tremain and Introduction to the movie. As a possible alternative around Independence day would recommend the PBS documentary American Experience John and Abigail Adams which also covers this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Tremain - DVD","review":"This DVD covered a lot of the material mentioned in our school's Socical Studies curriculum. I used it as a supplement my curriculum because it provides a great visual of this time of history. I felt the themes of the importance of religion in peoples' lives, apprenticeship, rise of patriotism, and the means the minute men used to fight the war were explained well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney can't do anything right","review":"This is an awful... simply awful... film adaptation of a great novel. Johnny Tremain has the reputation for being a \\"children's story\\", but as the book's original subtitle states, it is \\"a novel for young and old.\\" It is an intelligent novel for intelligent people of all ages. But, typically, Disney, the great mythic purveyor of \\"family entertainment\\", got its filthy mouse mits on the book and dumbed it down... way down... to the point where there is hardly any resemblence with the book. If you loved the book avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Justice done to the book","review":"The book was alot better than the book.

(My own crush was the character Rab, played by Richard Beymer, whom I also liked quite a lot a few years later in West Side Story.) Now an interpreter at the Nathan Hale Homestead museum in Coventry, CT, I helped run a Revolutionary War film festival this past summer, and Johnny T. was the hit of the series. An audience of 65, mostly adults, sat under the stars for this entire movie. Though cleaned up and made pretty the way the Disney company is wont to do, JT presents a simplified but engaging version of the impact of early revolutionary events on the lives of three teenaged friends. The drama is believable and the remastering excellent. If you saw the film years ago, it's fun to revisit. If it's new to you, I'm sure you, and the children in your life, will enjoy it.

The best track is \\"this could be a start of something new\\" Greens takes chorus after chorus,and digs deeper and deeper into the groove, and his solo is one of his very best ever,it is not easy for Young to do his solo right after Green but he handles it well.It is amazing how much Larry Young must have influenced another of my favourite players, namely Larry Goldings, I think that is very obvious on this CD.

I am also now convinced that 9/11 would have never even happened if Al Gore had become president as he should have, the same goes for Iraq.It is worth buying this book just to read about this alone. Some that read this review may question my loyalty to the GOP. The truth is I'm done with parties. They have all had their blunders. From now on it's about values and reality.

In fact, if the movie would have had some nudity, it would have had all the ingredients of a classic Troma movie. It starts out a little show, but this is one of those movies that gets better as it goes along.Toward the end, Slime City becomes a gory, funny splatterfest. They just don't make them like this anymore. Actually they do, but not on a regular basis like they did in the 80's.

One of Scorpions' best. Its surprisingly good for the first one missing Uli Jon Roth. I have a place in my heart for the man but I still love this album. His Teutonic metal twin Michael Schenker is on here anyway. A three guitar attack with Mathias, Rudi and Michael. Highly worth it but I wonder what could've been if they let Michael in on the songwriting more and gave him more solos. \\"Another Piece of Meat\\" an awesome (ironic title if you read the lyrics) blazing tune. \\"Coast to Coast\\" UFO style crunchy instrumental. Lovedrive- practically a Scorpions rewrite of \\"Lights Out\\" by UFO. Intense singing from Klaus Meine. Get it now, its one of their best post Roth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak effort by a band in transition","review":"With the departure of Ulrich Roth, the Scorpions underwent a dramatic and obvious change of style - from unique and non-commercial to blatantly commercial. Nothing wrong with commercial (if it's good), but clearly the guys had not yet found the refined sound of such albums as Blackout and Love at First Sting. The only good songs on this album are the title track and Loving You Sunday Morning; the rest are either sleepy ballads or run of the mill \\"rockers\\", all noise with no melody. Simply put, LOVEDRIVE is a lousy effort except for two songs. The previous album Taken by Force presents a far more interesting format with less obvious commercialism. Don't waste your time with this one - you're not missing much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Scorpions","review":"My sister used to play this album while getting ready for school.I had never heard of the Scorpions in 1980, but I'll forever be gratefull to her. This is the first of a fantastic trilogy of Scorpion albums that I would purchase; the other two being, Animal Magnetism and Black Out. Over the years, I've managed to purchase all their albums, but this one is special. The instrumental, Coast to Coast is the purest form of rock and roll. There is no other song I've ever heard that tug at my soul as this song does. Always Somewhere and Holiday are incredible ballads, and Loving You Sunday Morning and Lovedrive are equally incredible rockers. Every song on this album is awesome. This is 35 minutes of pure rock and roll energy that puts most 70 minute modern day rock CDs to absolute shame. My hat off to Matthias, Rudolf, Michael, Klaus, Herman and Francis. This is an absolute must have!...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very articulated","review":"Wow. I thought this was simply going to be a rehash of the Ree-Yees figure. It isn't.

Ask Aak is perhaps the most articulated Star Wars figure I've ever seen. The head, hands, and feet move very realistically in several directions.

I have been searching for another copy and am glad to have found one. I remember thumbing through the passenger list at the end of the book, and the chill of realizm.

Now it's obvious where lots of information came from that appears in later Titanic books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book about the Titanic","review":"I would have to say that A Night To Remember is just about the best book that I have read about the Titanic. Considering the time the book was written, 1955, I think that you would agree that it is extremely factual. I would like to read an updated version of this book, one that also contains information discovered up until today. This book focuses on the Titanic's last few days before it's sinking. The book tells you what is happening from day-to-day encounters and, as the book draws closer to the end, you are told of events from hour-to-hour. I would recommend this book to all of those out there who have questions about what really happened to the Titanic and to those of you who just like a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent summary of the events of that night...","review":"If you are looking for a well-researched summary of the events of April 14-15 1912, you can't go wrong with Walter Lord's authoritative book, A Night to Remember. Mr. Lord presents the events chronologically, but rather than reading like a stale history book, this reads more like an adventure story.A Night to Remember was written in the 1950s so obviously there is no \\"post-discovery\\" information about the wreck itself. The fact that the author was able to interview many survivors of the Titanic sinking more than makes up for this, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book Well touch your heart like it touched mine","review":"A Nght to Remember is the most emotional story you well come across in your life .

The book was about the sinking of the grand ship the Titanic. It had excellent factual information, that I must have to say got a little boring at times, but still was very interesting to hear. I really loved how the book was a true minute-by-minute story. It really made you feel like you were one of the passengers on the ship just watching everything that was occurring. Even though the book was good, when you finished it filled your mind with many \\"what ifs?\\" What if ice conditions had been normal, or what if she had seen the iceberg 15 seconds sooner? Even though the book had some things I didn't really like, overall it was pretty good. I would definitely recommend the book to someone who has never read a book about Titanic before"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable and Frightening","review":"I am one of the many who, drawn by the hundredth anniversary of the Titanic tragedy, felt compelled to reread Walter Lord's excellent book. I have also just seen the film version and it is amazing how close to the book the film is. There are no sub-plots here as in James Cameron's film of the tragedy, just simple, straight-foward and often frightening reporting. Written when some of the ship's survivors were still alive, Lord used their memories and recollections well. It is beyond sadness to see how the class-disntinctions of the time even effected people in a tragedy but it is also encouraging to see acts of bravery and selflessness. For anyone interested in the story of the \\"unsinkable\\" Titanic, I must recommened this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean journalistic reporting","review":"When I read it in my youth, it was the German translation, ('Die letzte Nacht der Titanic') and I found it so compelling, that felt I was part of the action. Now, many years later, I reread it in English. No matter in what language, it is still the classic account of what happened that night: No overblown hype, no laboured speculations, just a skillful collage of what the author learned from survivors and from his own research about the ship and tragedy, all written in a fresh journalistic style that draws you into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you thought you knew a lot about the Titanic...","review":"I bought A Night to Remember on a whim after seeing some recent undersea images of the wreck. Maybe, like myself, you think you know the story from what has been portrayed in the theaters. Of course, we all know how it ends but to read first hand accounts of the tragedy as it unfolds is quite riveting.

I just finished rereading it (as a Master's student) and find its emotional impact just as strong as I first did.

He prefered not to create dialogues nor try to figure out what was going through people's minds. But, read a book with one thousand characters and not one of them being special is sometimes hard work. The narrative ( a kind of journalistic style ) is dry, typical of that age. The facts pile one after another with no time to sink into the reader's brain. All in all, I don't think it is a good book, but just a good attempt to write a good book about the TITANIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never could download","review":"I have a Mac computer and never could download the book.

It has it's moments where it's good but most of it is pretty bad! Most of the book is peoples quotes. You don't get a feel of what really happened. There also wasn't enough emotion. They made it seem like it wasn't a big deal. When they did express the action in in this book it wasn't exciting. On a scale from 1-10 I would give this book a 4. The reason why I wouldn't rate it any less is because I have read much worse books and compared to the other books I have read this is about in the middle of the rating system."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was ok","review":"I thought that the book was ok. I liked how Lord gave details about what individual people were doing during certain events. But, then again, it was really dragged out and was boring at times.

Entire families perished; babies drowned in their mother's arms; young women with their lives ahead of them froze to death in the icy waters.Walter Lord writes of these people, describing with eloquence their lives and what led them to board the doomed liner. And although we've learned more about the disaster than was known at the time this book was written, Lord's sympathy for the dead and his judgment of the guilty are far from out of date.And that's the tragedy of Titanic; not some silly teenage-girl romance gone awry, but the deaths of so many innocents with their lives ahead of them and the realization that it was completely and totally preventable.This book is worth every penny. I highly recommend it -- and its sequel, The Night Lives On."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic","review":"This is a fairly comprehensive book detailing the passengers on board the Titanic. It describes events from multiple points of view, including staff and steerage. I thought that the book was well and very factual.

Then someone recommended \\"A Night to Remember,\\" and I read it. It was wonderful. The whole book is about the events that took place on that clear night. It is based on real interviews from survivors, and the remaining crew. It really takes an effect on you. It grabs you by the shoulders and makes you think, \\"What would I have done?

It's obvious that the item I received was previously opened or used, because 1) the twist-ties that secure some of the items have clearly been untied and tied again, and 2) the exterior plastic pieces on the breadmaker have lots of little scratches in them, a telltale sign that they've been cleaned. I resent the fact that Amazon is representing this item as new (or that they're dealing with such a questionable supplier), especially now that I see other reviewers have received this breadmaker in used condition as well. Perhaps I still would have purchased the item knowing it was \\"open box,\\" but certainly not for $90. I'm now awaiting word from headquarters as to how to proceed.

I have never used a bread machine nor made bread. I read the reviews for the Breadman and discovered the Hodgson Mill, referenced by a Breadman reviewer. While my Breadman was being prepared for shipment, I ordered a case of 9-Grain. They both arrived the same day and I spent the evening discovering the Breadman. The next morning with trepidation I ventured forth to make my first loaf of bread, and posted a picture here and for Hodgson Mill 9-Grain Bread Mix. I cut the heel and had soon eaten almost half the loaf. It is fabulous. The way that bread is intended by Mother Nature. Today I just completed making the other five loaves. Every loaf was perfection - Six of Six. Everything was so simple, with a little research. A TEXAS-SIZE thank you Breadman. I am one proud novice; soon to be considered a professional. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great breadmaker","review":"My wife and I researched several breadmakers and settled on the Breadman TR875.

In warranty period, I had two replacements of the whole machine, the first replacement from Amazon, the second from the manufacture. I probably should not complain here since with the money I paid, I used three units. The processes of getting replacements with Amazon and the manufacture were smooth though. The machines all worked fine at first. Then after some time, the first two units had dirty stuff coming out from the paddle. This third unit had wearing at the spinning part and caused a lot of noise. I use the machine once or twice a week. None of the unit lasted more than 6 months.This brand is my first experience with bread machine. No experience with other products made by other manufacturers. But I had enough with this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This machine is truly awesome. You can't make a bad loaf of bread. No mistakes, each loaf comes out perfectly.

It takes a few tries to adjust the ingredients to get the bread you want. The easiest bread to start with is the French bread. If you want the bread to be fluffy and soft, add a touch more (like a pinch) of yeast than what the recipe calls for. The timer function works great, though I would have prefer it had a clock and allowed me to enter the exact time I'd like the bread to be done. Instead, I have to substract the time when I like it to be done from the moment I put the ingredients in.Overall, this is an excellent breadmaker. As I get more comfortable, I'll venture into sweet breads and making pizza doughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful, high quality bread. A bit slower than other brands.

One was under baked, one did not raise, and the last one was hard as a rock. Are they any suggestions?Gluten free flours tent to be a bit dry but come on I was under the impression that the machine could deliverdecent quality. We follow the bag instructions, measuring and leaving the egg at room temperature, we usedoil instead of butter looking for a semi-soft loaf of bread, added the liquid first and the dry last, stillcan not understand what we are doing wrong.

The results are completely satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"Got this a about a month ago and have used it quite a lot. Because my wife can not have glutten, we opted for this bread maker. It has a setting for glutten free bread. There is one thing about the glutten free setting, you can only set it for 1 1/2 lb loaf. The manual says you can set it for 2 lb but you can not. I called the company and the tech rep says the problem had never been reported in the past. There is good news, there is a work around. The rapid cycle is exactly what the glutten cycle is but you can set it for 2 lb.If you are looking for a good reasonably priced bread maker, this is it.

After hearing a friend extol the advantages of her breadmaker and how much weight she had lost making whole wheat bread, I researched and purchased another one. She owned a Zojirushi. I liked this particular Breadman breadmaker because of the stainless steel exterior, price, and the smaller footprint. I have only used the basic cycle, so far, but the machine performs well. I have made both the 1 1/2 and 2 pound loaf. The bread rises well and the baking cycle browns the bread according to your desired color.

It's very easy to use - just push the buttons on the front for the type of bread (white, wheat, dough only, etc.), darkness of crust, size of loaf. The machine does the rest. The only thing I don't love is that, when you remove the loaf, the kneader paddle pulls out a small chunk of the bread right in the middle of the loaf. This may be because I am using low sodium recipes, which have a different texture. Otherwise I am very pleased. It works well, is easy, and looks good on my counter. The 2-lb loaf looks more like a \\"normal\\" loaf of bread than the 1 1/2 lb. loaf. The 2-lb loaf is taller.

I could hear the motor switch operating, but the paddle wouldn't spin at all. This thing is JUNK!

I may get lazy someday and let the machine bake it, but doubt I will do that often. Amazon's price seems to vary, so watch for a good one ($59.99) and grab it.

I prefer whole wheat breads, made with no white flour so it makes it more difficult to get a good-not-too-dense loaf at any altitude. The machine is very easy to use. My only complaint could be the size because it's pretty big, but I know there are much bigger ones out there and not many smaller ones, especially those that would make a 2 lb loaf.

While it works, I've had one problem after another with it. The bottom of the pan dented around the stem very early on and I have to pull out the dent once in a while. The rectangular pan tends to catch dry ingredients in the corners -- I either have to be there to scrape them out with a spatula or I end up with half-mixed dough on the corners of the finished bread. The mixing paddle appears to be made of nonstick stuff but the bread inevitably sticks to it and I lose a big chunk out of the loaf getting it out. The paddle is also hard to get out and hard to get clean. In the last few months, the display has started to go out while the bread bakes so I can't tell how much time is left. I would not buy this machine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought new, but received a refurbished item.","review":"The negative reviews are spot on.

No one from the company responded by name when dealing with them, just a generic email. I had to send the first one back, only to find that the second one also did not have the kneading attachment.

Easy to clean and the non stick surface in the bread pan is MUCH BETTER than cheaper priced machines. Another plus is that this machine does not take up a lot of counter space.

Finally, while I can't speak to other bread machines and their paddling, having the paddle get lodged in the bread when you pull out the bread is kind of an odd inconvenience...One other note: many users who gave negative reviews because they received a used bread machine noted that there was no clear plastic covering over the buttons when they received their item, though others reported that that should be there. Mine also did not have this. I wonder if mine was used/returned also?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"I use this at least twice a week. It's my first bread machine and it's great.

We bought two new breakmakers one of which is a gift. One is missing the bag of parts including the paddle! There are also some rough marks at the base of the unit where the pan could possibly rub. Makes me worry that we were given a refurbished unit or a returned unit although it looks new.I will update this inconvenience later but for now we will wait for the the parts that should have been included. This unit came from Amazon directly and not a vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer DIS-service","review":"Wow, should have listened to the other low reviews on this unit- so heed my advice. Avoid this machine and this COMPANY at all costs. Bought this as a gift for the wife. Her first loaf never baked. So I attempted a loaf in case it was user error. I had a reading of E01 come onto the screen. I tried to call customer service and had to wait at least 20 mins. to talk to an actual human being. This person told me I would have to cut the cord and send it in with a copy of my receipt with $7.50 to have a new unit shipped. I thought it was ridiculous that I should have to pay to have a new unit shipped when they sold me a piece of crap. This has been a headache. I'm returning it to Amazon and buying a new unit from a better company. Don't be a fool as I was, avoid this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breadman","review":"The item seems very good, since we've only used it one time, a better review can be made at a later date.The only thing I wish it had was a metal beater blade, instead of plastic.Is there a metal blade available?Otherwise , it appears to be a decent machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!","review":"I purchased this breadmaker. It was listed as new when I purchased it. Upon recieving it, it was clearly a refurbished bread maker.

NEVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my second machine in a month...not new plus defective","review":"I liked this machine cause it looked good in my kitchen and made pretty good bread. Problem is, I had to return the first one because it 1) was a refurbished with dents...not new as advertised from Target and 2)the bread pan only came out with extreme difficulty. So I returned the first unit, bought the second unit and it is also refurbished (not new) and this time I can't even get the bread pan out no matter how hard I try! So I'm sending it back and going with a Zojirushi...I need something that actually works. Those who got a breadmachine that works are probably the lucky one's. BEWARE when you buy this unit. The quality control is definitely lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breadman TR875","review":"I haven't used it yet, simply because it has such an odor to it. When I opened it up, it smelled like it had been sprayed by a skunk. I washed the pan and have tried to wipe down the inside, but it still stinks. I don't want to make anything in it - because who knows if the smell will transfer and make stuff taste skunky. Anyone else have that issue? If so, what can you do to make the horrid smell go away?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BREADMAN DOES THE JOB","review":"Just replaced my old (5 years) Breadman because the pan lining wore out after a few hundred loaves of bread.

After only 10 loaves of bread run thru it, it ceased to bake When you manually tell it to bake, it starts then stops baking.

Great for Gluten- Free Breads","review":"I have a dad that is gluten intolerent and I like to be able to treat him on occasion by making him a fresh loaf of gluten-free bread. I have had trouble in the past with other bread machines and gluten-free recipies but this one is a winner. My only issue is when it is done its a little hard to pull out the bread pan. Other than that it is fantastic!!

This is much to soon for this machine to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one","review":"I've been getting poorly shaped loaves since I started with this machine except for one loaf which was a one pounder. Anything larger reaches the top of the machine and becomes almost impossible to remove from the pan. Perhaps it's me but I had much better results from a $35 machine I bought many years ago. I'll keep trying.A year or so later, the shapes have been better but the paddle causes the loaf to stick and when trying to remove it from the machine, takes a great chunk out of it. Asked the company for help but no response at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Received 1st machine & was reconditioned not new called and Amazon promptly shipped a new one. I have had and used a breadmaker for many years so am not new to using one - made wheat bread it came out uneven and the texture was terrible.

There are obvious scratches inside and outside. The plastic seal on the control panel (which according to the user manual should be taken off carefully before first use) is missing. The non-sticky container has a very weird smell and there is some sort of grease on the bottom. Anyway, I am disappointed and returned the product. I would strongly recommend reading all reviews before you make decision.Go to your B&M; store and pick one, don't buy from amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Be warned that though it looks nice in the picture, this item is cheaply made with a flimsy plastic door with plastic hinges which will probably snap off quickly. I can't tell you how quick, because my supposedly new item was shipped with the hinges completely snapped off on one side & stress marks in the plastic showing on the other. To be fair, I am rating this unit harshly to reflect my irritation with the fact that this is a replacement item for the defective Breadman Ultimate Pro which I received from Amazon in April. At least the nearby post office is located in a grocery store, so I can buy bread as I am dropping this unit off for return. PS - 0 stars should be a rating option"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refurb & Damaged Box","review":"Not only did I receive a refurbished unit, but it also came in a damaged box (large hole punctured in side and broken styro packing).Getting a replacement, will hopefully have a better experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up to 1 year to replace!","review":"This machine has a computer problem. Sometimes it starts properly and other times it doesn't. It also occassionaly skips a step in the baking process. Also, the breadpan is held in the machine by thin metal clips which bend easily, making it hard to properly position the pan. We followed the manufacturer's proceedure for replacement under warranty. That was over 4 months ago. When I called to find out where the replacement was, I was told that they are back-ordered and that, per their warranty, they have up to 1 year to replace the machine! I've replaced this with a Sunbeam model 5891 for less than half the cost. It works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Little Bread Machine Ever","review":"This is my first bread machine. All I have to say is that it's great looking, nicely sized and works like a dream. Also easy to clean. This is the best bread we've ever eaten & I don't have to do anything to get it except measure out the ingredients and put them in the bread machine, then watch it go!

It is SOOO not worth that price. Cleaned and turned on the rapid cycle as instructions said. Plugged it in to use hours later and kept getting ERROR message. Of course, the booklet did not state what the error code was. After fooling with the buttons, it finally started. The bread was very hard and dark for the medium setting. I assumed it was due to the rapid cycle. I add all my ingredients today and had to push buttons, unplug, push buttons, and unplug for the machine to start. This time I pressed the basic cycle. Bread came out like a hard piece of dough. Bread was not brown on the top or sides only the bottom.Going back tomorrow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I love this bread maker.

Went to use it to make whole wheat bread (with all ingredients in bread pan)...and nothing. Threw out the ingredients. Not happy.I called the company and was told to hold down the stop/start button to clear the computer, then wait 24(!!) hours and see if it would work. It did not. When I was talking to the company rep I was told that this model has a problem with the computer in them. Also was told they had none on hand to send me a replacement.1. Why 24 hours for it to reset??2. Why no machines in stock to replace defective ones? Or even to sell?3. Why sell machines they know to have problems??I did like the design of this machine so that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just one.I am going to order another bread machine - but it will *not* be a Breadman."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Resealed box\\" apparently meant \\"broken machine\\"","review":"I should've known that paying half-price for the machine meant more of a problem than just a \\"resealed box.\\" When I opened the manufacturer's box, I found a return slip from the person who previously bought it from Amazon and returned it, and it clearly stated that the machine was defective. I plugged it in and gave it a shot, but it's definitely defective. The control panel display is messed up and the machine randomly turned on and tried to run, and I could only stop it by unplugging it. Also, it had no manual.On top of that, Amazon said that since I bought it through one of their subsidiaries, that I would only be able to return it & wait for my refund rather than have a replacement shipped out to me quickly.So, I don't have an opinion on the general operation of a working model, but just warning others to watch out for the \\"resealed\\" or \\"refurbished\\" models, unless you want a 13# paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product","review":"I received the bread machine three days ago and have tried to make bread but it will not start.

Then the bread pan would not stay put. It wouild ride up on the mixes and the punch down, so no mixing would take palce and the required constant manual holding of the bread pan in place. Zip in the instruction book on this. I called, emailed and write wrote twice only to get from letter that they were going to send a new breadpan, but never did. That was two months ago. I am not an engineer, but the design to hold the breadpan in place looks off. The metal clips will keep the pan from lateral movement, but there is no fastening to keep the pan from vertical movement and rising off of the agitator at the bottom. With this problem in its first year, I'd invest in a more expensive machine, I guess. This one is just sitting on my counter now."},{"rating":"1","title":"died on second loaf, expect 3 months for replacement","review":"1st loaf was ok but machine began malfunctioning on second loaf.

I'm certain I got a brand new unit. I was able to get a few months of baking out of it, and I was very pleased, then the computer started to only work sporadically. Soon after I noticed that the lining was scraping off inside the pan. Well, life got busy and it wound up sitting in the box waiting to be returned which sadly never happened (although after reading the recent reviews here, it seems I may not have been able to get any real service anyway).Now I find myself needing to go gluten free, and thinking, \\"I've got a breadmaker with a gluten free option, maybe I can salvage it!\\" You can imagine how disappointed I am to learn that I can't get any replacement parts or repairs.

It bakes a tall loaf that slices into nice, sandwich-size pieces. My picky toddlers have loved every loaf...even the whole wheat. The only trouble I had was baking a herb bread on the super-rapid cycle. This came out a little small. But it still tasted great. I honestly did not think I would like this machine as much as I do.

I think that one of the buttons was installed improperly, causing it to go haywire. What I have to do before every use is plug & unplug it up to 4 times, and make sure it accepts my input before inserting the bread pan. It works fine after that.Had I known this would happen I would have kept my much cheaper Sunbeam bread machine - it has lower ratings & didn't work well for me, simply because it came with bad recipes.

It is also perfect for making dough, which can be shaped into whatever you choose. The pizza dough is perfect for a meal the kids can help with and makes great stromboli and calozones as well(though I recommend adding Italian seasonings to the mix for a great flavor).

Straight out of the box, after a cleaning cycle, this machine has been a workhorse. White, wheat, rye, french, nut, fruit breads... all perfectly made and delicious. Dough for pizza Fridays is better than the pizzaria. I have not had a bad bread yet. I'm at 6000 feet above sea level and haven't had to adjust any recipes yet either. Waking up to hot, fresh bread is such a treat and Sundays we use the french bread for french toast, straight out the bread maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful machine","review":"Tha bread machine solved many problems for me since I live alone . It makes a small loaf that is great for scenting the apt & tasting wonderful. the directions are simple ,the machine is fast ,and my friends want one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stopped working on the second loaf","review":"After buying on the deal of the day and thinking I was giving myself a Christmas present I could really like, I baked my first loaf on Christmas Day. It turned out perfectly , a very tasty 5 grain made from a Hogsden Mill bread mix. I was happy until I tried the second loaf 5 days later. The machine came on but showed it was in the kneading mode already. I wasted two of my mixes trying to make it knead the dough,,, although it did go on to the the baking mode and stucke all the flour and unmixed liquid to the pan. I have returned it and ordered a second different brand machine because I had invested in two different bread mix assortments. Now it has cost me the added price of the better bread machine and wasted two of the mixes. Not to mention the trouble of returning the machine. Seems the electronic part of the mechanism is broken ."},{"rating":"2","title":"all right except for the manual","review":"I am over-all satisfied with this machine. It is very convenient for bread making, easy to use. The complain is about the manual. The only useful information there is add milk first. If I fully followed the manual to make bread, I would return it since I thought it is a waste of materials. Be aware of the recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy-duty, easy to use","review":"I really like this bread machine. It does well with a variety of recipes, and even gluten-free bread emerges in tasty shape! It's big and takes up some space, but it is so versatile and self-productive, you can just add ingredients and let it do the work while you are at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but hand-made tastes better","review":"This machine is nice for the convenience of not having to be around once it is started to manipulate the dough but bread machines just don't make bread as good as hand-made.

The KitchenAid stand mixer dough hook is great for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful machine!","review":"I have been using this machine for over two years now.

My first concern was that it looked as if the original box had been retaped. 2nd concern was the electrical cord was hanging loose and the twist wire ties were laying in the bottom of the box. 3rd concern was the instruction manual that stated \\"there is a clear, thin plastic cover adhered over the control panel and this must be carefully removed\\" There was no clear thin plastic cover over the control panel. There was pieces of plastic that suggest the cover had been previously removed. And there was a horrible order within the machine that I can't describe. The machine was obviously a return being sold as new. I have repacked it, printed out Amazon's return address label. I will be sending it back tomorrow morning.Vin5/1/09"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for money","review":"This is our first ever bread machine and bought it to mix the dough for hot cross buns. It was reasonably priced and it does a great job but the machine buttons like like cardboard has been placed behind the plastic coverings making it look cheap and nasty.

It ran through a cycle empty (which they tell you to do anyhow before you use the machine). The machine overheated and it is completely fried. Dead, dead, and dead.After doing a bit of research, I see that my issue isn't uncommon.

Obviously, I was out of a lot of money for a broken machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes great bread until it breaks","review":"I used this machine for less than a year before the mixing shaft in the breadpan froze. I emailed the company 5 months ago to get a replacement and was told that it was on backorder. Today when I called, they were willing to sell me a breadpan for $43 (since I couldn't find the receipt from 10 months prior), but there's no telling when I'm going to get it. The bread it makes is great, as long as it is working and you don't need new parts. Also, I was told by customer service that the mixing paddle was discontinued and can't be ordered.UPDATE: (3/21/2010)I just received the replacement breadpan. Unfortunately, it took them over a year from when it broke to get me the new pan, so I have already gotten rid of this bread machine.

But my second loaf of french bread(using the dough cycle only)the machine wasn't quite strong enough to get to the end of the cycle. Since then, even with the regular loaves of bread, the machine just doesn't have the power to get through the entire cycle.I waited a couple weeks before attempting the dough cycle for french bread again and the machine cut off 15 min before cycle was over. I am assuming the motor just isn't powerful enough. You could smell the motor running hot! Enough already!

I would have still brought at $79.00 today but I will not buy it at the new price from Amazon. I have owned a Breadman TR875 for a year and half and used it every week to make bread. It was great machine until the pan needing paddle froze up, I check on a replacement part and it was over $40.00 and not in stock. I tried a another brand from Wal-Mart but return it after two bad loaves of breads. I believed I found the Breadman TR875 else wheres on the internet for $79.00, I will try that site again.

The recipe book that comes with it is basic (just buy a bread machine book) but the machine itself is top notch. I have had it for a while now and have not been disappointed. Just throw the ingredients (fresh) in the pan and the machine does the rest...and does it well. How much easier can that be? Piping hot bread. I have experimented and made a few mistakes, but learned quickly a little more liquid does the trick. At least, for me. I did some research before deciding on Breadman and I couldn't be more satisfied. I really don't get into the stars rating because the experience outweighs \\"seal\\". And a quick tip: a few minutes before the baking begins just take out the dough, remove the paddle and put the dough right back in the pan. Voila! No paddle baked in the bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat lovers will die laughing.","review":"I've been a cat lover all my life, and this tops some of the crazy stuff our cats have done.

This is NOT a children's book. I say this because there is a book entitled \\"Bad Cat\\" that is a popular children's book and I would hate to have someone buy this for their child by mistake.

In fact, I bought two. One was a gift for my sister, but it was such a good gift idea that she already had a copy.It's a shame you can't really pick it up and flip through it online. The photos are hilarious, but what really makes them stand out is the short one-line zingers for each cat.Some of the humour is very low brow like toilet humour. However, the book is brilliant because Jim Edgar seamlessly mixes in sophisticated references throughout the text, making it even funnier. He'll use references to \\"cleavage\\" and \\"Krispy Kreme\\", but then throw in some phrases about \\"Yeltsin\\" and \\"glucosamine\\".It's got a nice bold graphic style that makes it suitable for both men and women.

I have to compliment the author for a brilliant idea!By the way, my boyfriend, who is NOT a cat lover and used to dislike my two pets with passion, seems to have changed his attitude towards my cats after having a lot of fun with \\"Bad Cat\\". What's even more interesting, he gave me for my birthday another book with a BEAUTIFUL cover, titledWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 2.

We've had ours for a while and still use it. That said, the plastic mortise-and-tenon joints have nearly all broken on ours (the tenon breaks off inside the mortise), and it has fallen over more than a few times, and only stands straight if supported.

Don't waste your money; it's a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this shoe rack","review":"With this shoe rack, the problems started right out of the box. Assembly was supposed to involve simply snapping the pieces into place, but everything is so poorly fitted that it required getting a hammer and beating them into place.

The voice acting is at times goofy and I'm not sure the dubbing reflects what was originally said. A Cantonnese version with English subtitles would have been welcomed.

No wonder it was this book doesnt teach much. it has alot of random colored in pages thrown in. the Art isnt even that great compared to Chris Hart's magical girl book. If your shopping for a how to draw book dont buy this one unless your like me and bought it just because."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I do not recommend this book, even for children, because it will only discourage them and frustrate them. The images look like they were done by a child, proportions are often off and miscalculated, the line which are extremely important in manga/anime, look horrible, and the explanations are not thorough.You are basically told \\"copy this drawing\\" ratter then being though proper technics to be able to draw what you might want to draw.In short, this book was made by someone who knows very little about manga and anime style.For adults, i would recommend the 'how to draw manga' Series. There are numerous books covering just about any subject you may need help on, the art's quality is that of professionals, and the technics to drawing mangas are actually there.I recommend it to serious younger artists, too, with a slight warning as some subjects may contain some more mature content then others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is really helpful!","review":"I just started using this book but I am alredy learning much more about shoujo manga.

And the images are very pretty. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This has got to be one of the worst how-to-manga books i have ever read in my life.

The style shown through out the book is not MANGA. There is a difference between MANGA and ANIME styled drawings. 2. Shojo/Shoujo, is the girl romance type stories. This book in no way shows you how to draw in EITHER way. I would not even recommend this to my nephew who is interested in drawing manga/anime.The figures are rigid and childlike. Thick lines and stiff poses. Awful color choices that show no attention to coloring detail which can be important to learning an art form. Manga is also about lines. Line strokes, line weight, emotion and illustration. This book lacks it completely. I would not recommend this at all, beginner or advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER RATHER INSPIRATIONAL AND HELPFUL WORK.","review":"While this book was quite helpful in my case, I suspect that it would not be suitable for the absolute beginner. A bit of expierence is probably needed to glean the full benefits of this work. Now that being said, I feel there is a great amount that can be learned from this books. As with all of Christopher Hart's book, it is quite detailed and their is an abundance of text to go along with the actual drawing and coloring. The techniques Hart illustrates actually work. I like to work on individual aspects of figures, isolating different areas such as eyes, mouth, nose, etc. This works well for me and with this work, the author has given us plenty of information. No one book can do it all and the serious student of this art form will want many. This is just another valuable work to add to your collection. I find that young folk, in particular, like this one and actually do quite well with it. I do highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Poe Accessible","review":"I teach English to Speakers of Other Languages, and like to use graphic novels to help clarify more difficult writing and themes. We started with \\"The Black Cat,\\" which was great. the pictures very expressive, but not overly gory. \\"The Raven\\" graphics were more abstract and were difficult to follow, but it is well done. It did give a great visual for the concept of internal conflict. I showed a video of Price reciting the poem as he went through the motions, and my students have decided to draw their own graphics, which is outstanding. I recommend this book, and graphic novels for making the text accessible and motivating people to read classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"It was nice to read a poe's work.

It appears that someone, perhaps a high school student, has attempted to make a typed copy of the original book, and the publisher had it printed. There is no original publication information or even date, typos abound, some including insertions of words into other words. This is in general a very shoddy piece of work. I bought a few weeks ago on Amazon, and my copy visually resembles that shown here, but publisher is identified differently. Anyway, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conservatism","review":"Being a conservative is something a person should be proud of. It gives you a perspective of one's ideology.

This is not an original but a copy made and very poorly bound duplicate. It was sold as a used copy but this did not mean a duplicate copy. This was a new copy. The price was high for a duplicate. It missed all normal identification of publisher etc that would be carried in an original. The content is that of the Goldwater, not great, but what I wanted.

This book was written in the 1960's; many of the problems that we are seeing today were in their beginning stages when this book was written. Barry warned us of the ramifications of a country which vests too much power into the federal government, and which abandons its constitutional roots.

However, the authors did a fairly good job in general.The advantage of this book is that it is written a few years ago and contains a lot of information regarding the developments, innovations and new techniques of surface science. The schemes and charts are well-drawn and well-presented. The photographs of some instruments and experimental results are especially useful and make this book better in some sense. The image qualities and resolutions are very fine.There is a good balance between theoretical and experimental discussions. The references are very beneficial for detailed studies.

What they couldn't foresee were the hardships, strokes of luck and unknown adventures that awaited them - from near starvation when the money ran out to the strokes of luck that come their way. Luckily, Dori DeCamillis managed to chronicle it all in vivid, impossible-to-put-down language, making the whole trip come alive for the reader.

Martin Lawrence proved he could hold his own without \\"GINA\\"!Big Momma's House was a rip roaring flick. I would measurize this movie 4 out of 5 stars! Martin's supporting cast really held this movie up and made it complete. The storyline was good because it was a little unpredictable at times.

Martin Lawrence does a good job as two characters and being funny. Camera work is great as is editing. The only bad part is a few plot holes at the end. It's nice that about 15 minutes of the movie takes place in a church since you don't really see that often these days..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please avoid this","review":"This sub-\`Mrs Doubtfire' rubbish is simply dire. It's contrived set-up has Martin Lawrence dressing up as Big Momma, the grandmother of a bank robber's girlfriend, in an attempt to get closer to the girl and find out where the robber is. So along comes the girl with kid in tow and \`Big Momma' quickly falls for her.Yes this is one of those movies that is not only heavily reliant on fat jokes and toilet humour but almost revels in them. The humour is tacky and dull whilst the romantic subtext is tired. The only real point of recommendation is the character of a security guard desperate to become a police officer and is always ready to shoot down anyone who looks like they pose a threat. However, one character alone doesn't save the movie, and even Martin Lawrence looks bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aweseome","review":"This movie is one of my all time favorites.

It's time to see women disguising themselves as men. Oh sure, there was that bit in CHARLIE'S ANGELS (a movie I enjoyed 10 million times more than this) where Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore put on makeup to look like two of the UGLIEST men ever.That's another thing wrong with MOMMA. The makeup Martin Lawrence wears doesn't make him look like a fat, old granny. It makes him look like Martin Lawrence in a fat, old granny suit.Trust me, don't waste your time watching this \\"movie\\".

I am not even a fan of Martin Lawrence. I did like Blue Streak, but only because the charming Luke Wilson was in it. I don't think Lawrence has alot of comedic talent. I have to admit there are a few, very few rare momments of Martin Lawrence that I actually consider funny. And maybe one of them was in this film. Blue Streak was a much better movie and story. I am a fan of some of the older, much more funny comedies that involve men dressing up like women for whatever reason. SOME LIKE IT HOT & TOOTSIE are probably the best of the bunch. Plus, how many times can bathroom humor be funny? It's getting old. This waste of time has maybe two or three funny parts, and the rest is just totally stupid. The ending was totally predictable.

And the rest of the movie is thereafter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flabby Humor","review":"Martin Lawrence's take on Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor movies (but without the refined tone and impeccable taste), this one has Lawrence as an undercover FBI agent who impersonates a fat old woman (with diarrhea) in order to nab a bad guy. Most of the humor is gross, toilet-level stuff, presented with lousy timing, but this essentially one-joke, dress-up movie does pack a few laughs. Lawrence does have some funny moves. Still, it's not Tootsie or or even Mrs.Doubtfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T MISS IT!","review":"This film is a slapstick classic. It is like a cross between Mrs. Doubtfire and Eddie Murphy's The Nutty Professor. This film is not intended for \\"mature audiences\\" or for people sensitive about jokes about weight, but it is not as crude as many comedies today. Martin Lawrence gives an outstanding comedic performance as an FBI agent gone undercover as Big Momma. When you see Martin Lawrence as Big Momma dunking the basketball on the court, singing gospel hymns at church, or doing Karate moves, you will laugh until you wheeze. Incidentally, this film is much better than The Nutty Professor II, which came out at about the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Lame.

A Lame Script, Bad Direction and Actors who constantly look like they've just woken up, give this film a very \\"Couldn't be Bothered\\" feeling.Take a Pinch of \\"Mrs Doubtfire\\", a Dash of \\"Stakeout\\" and filter out the Action and Comedy. That'll give a Pretty Good Estimation of the Entertainment in store for the Unlucky Viewer.The One Saving Grace (and the reason for 2 stars instead of 1) is Anthony Anderson, who plays a Wannabe Cop who helps Lawrence out.

I laughed only once. The coffee filter breathing mask was the only real laugh I had during the whole movie. What a total waste of time. Martin Lawrence was just not funny. Maybe I missed something but it appears to me that the whole movie was made based on Martin's name and comedic potential. He totally missed the mark.I would reccomend that you rent this movie first but I can't even do that. This is one of those movies that should be totally ignored. Even if you are a Martin Lawrence fan I think you should wait and get this one from the reduced or clearence bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I did not expect very much but was surprised!","review":"When I read the comment at this site about the film, I spontaneously decided to add mine. We saw the film in a lesson of Business English - which seems quite odd - but I really enjoyed it. It was not as flat as I expected, actually it was really funny and romantic. I had not seen a film with Martin Lawrence before and found him really cude. Also his girlfriend \\"Sherry\\" is very sexy... And at last, the music was really good: The soundtrack met my favour and the gospel song \\"happy day\\": I could not sit quiet any longer... So my opinion about the film is much more positive: I think it's the right film to pass a nice video session with some chips and laughter!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing pool is one of my interests.","review":"I retired in 2006 and about a year later I purchased a pool table for recreation.

Finally the list of books which the authors have suggested we read will almost certainly enrich our knowledge of the ancient Greek world without our having to acheive a doctorate to do it: this is a great book to buy and read right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart people can be pretty dumb.","review":"I cannot understand why the authors of this book, like so many other \\"conservatives,\\" feel the need to condemn non-western cultures as a means of celebrating Classical civilization. The authors' disdain for multiculturalism notwithstanding, we DO like in a multicultural world, and that must be part of our educational system. There is no good reason to say that this or that culture was less than adequate just because we prefer (as I do) the Classical world. Also, the authors' position that fifth-century Athens represented some sort of spontaneous generation completely contradicts all the good work of M.L. West and others who have shown the important linkages between Classical Greece and the Near East. I wish someone could present a coherent argument in favor of a traditional approach to education (like Great Books) without coming off sounding like Aristophanes, Allen Bloom, Rush Limbaugh, Jerry Fallwell, and this book's authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decline of Culture and Knowledge","review":"There used to be a time when philologists had an intimate knowledge of world literature. For instance, if you read Erich Auerbach's classic \\"Mimesis\\" you enjoy the book of an grand old man of letters who like a souvereign displays his careful and passionate readings of the classics, and gives you thoughtful reasons why Homer could not survive. Compared to this grand old tradition Victor Hanson's book is thin-lipped and merely offers cheap polemics. One misses refinement and culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antisemitic Silence","review":"In a typical neoclassicist's manner Mr. Hanson avoids talking about the Jewish-Christian basis of western culture. This is a problem because the actual reason for the decay of the Greek and Roman classics is not that they have been made unattractive by classics departments but that already in antiquity people found something more challenging in Jewish and Christian culture. The 'death of Homer' is not a modern phenomenon. The following books are a few examples of the vast literature on the subject: Michael Walzer, Exodus and Revolution; Walter Wink, Engaging the Powers; Ramsay MacMullen, Christianizing the Roman Empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Killed Higher Education?","review":"An immensely amusing critique of higher education in general and classical eduction in particular. The authors are classics professors and this tome is a flaying of modern academia. From professors who can't or won't teach to academic articles written in an unreadable gibberish, their targets will be familiar to all who have had the misfortune to waste, at incredible cost, several years of their lives being miseducated at many of our elite universities.The authors write with considerable verve and anger: no dry example of \\"collegese\\" in this book except as satire. I recommend this book to all parents before they take out a third mortgage to send Jack or Jill off to Ivy League U only to have them emerge five years later no wiser than before, and any enthusiasm for true intellectual achievement beaten out of them by the pretentious mediocrities who infest the professoriate.My ultimate accolade for this work: Juvenal couldn't have said it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD.

This, third in the Niccolo series is a wonderful book that depicts the unsettledness of the Island of Cyprus. We learn that this tempestuous island has always been an important one because of its strategic location. I enjoyed this book, because we actually got to see some of the mask come off Nicolo in his encounter with his Katelina. In true Dunnett fashion, this encounter did not take place in a private and safe bedchamber, but in a place where nature abounded, as well as danger. The history that we find out in this book is also equally interesting and true to what actually happened. This is certainly another great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This author never fails..","review":"..to deliver a beautifully crafted and engrossing book.

The main character was of necessity kept out of the fore front of what action was taking place.Still despite this minor detraction A Brother's Price is an excellent book and a good read.I'd recomend buying a copy, if you go to the book store without something specific in mind, then this would be a good book to pick up.The Deposed King"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Page Turner","review":"I read mostly alternate universe stories, and a fantasy book every now and then. I found this one to be quite thought provoking. It really felt strange reading about dominant characters, and finding out every single one was a woman. Every single time, a soldier, a guard, or a messenger was mentioned, my brain kept substituting a male image, only to be told WRONG! It made me wonder, if the reason women don't read sci-fi/fantasy, is because they feel marginalized the way I felt reading this novel.Another positive aspect of the story, is that it is not padded - the pace is very brisk, and there is always something going on.

I don't speak Norwiegian, so I can't understand a word. I am sure I would enjoy it more if I understood what the singer's lyrics meant. Interestingly enough, the producer on the album is Sylvia Massy. She also produced Tool's first LP, Undertow. I can hear the similarities in the production of the two albums. I am not saying Seigmen sounds like Tool. The engineering and overall audio production are similar (to my ears). I still listen to this album at least once a week.

Recomiendo este disco, no se lo pierdan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I was so excited to see a new book by Elizabeth Berg at the library. But what a letdown! This book was awful! The characters were cartoons. Patty was so obsessively in love w/ Ethan and so fixated on having a baby it made my skin crawl. How did her so-called perfect family produce such a pathetic creature? Nothing rang true in the book--nothing. And Berg's books usually knock my socks off with their emotional truth. I do advise those of you for whom this was the first Berg book to try others before you give up on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother especially if you've already read Open House","review":"After reading Open House which I enjoyed, I immediately got several of Berg's other books. This book is a disappointment. The main character is weak and stuck feeling sorry for herself, and many of the other characters (Elaine and Mark) are not well developed. This book feels like it's from another era where women didn't know how to deal with their problems and get what they really wanted in life. Yes, Patty gets her baby, but what about dealing with all the relationship and career issues in her life?? While Berg generally promotes close female friendships, I had problems with Elaine's lack of loyalty. Aren't some bonds more sacred than getting the man? Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired story with a silly lead character.","review":"This book didn't do much for me. The plot is old news - single woman with biological clock syndrome and her gay best friend decide to have a baby together. Personally, I couldn't relate to Patty, the primary character. She wants to get married and have a home life, but she can't get over her fixation with her gay former fiance. Sorry, I can't believe that any woman with an ounce of self respect would act this way. The secondary characters offered some promise, but they were never developed enough to carry the story. The mother's issues were the most interesting part of the book. If they had been more fully developed they could have added the emotional tension this story lacked. Despite my complaints about this book, I did like Berg's writing style. The dialogue is witty, and she has a nice ability to set a scene. I will probably try some of her other books because the consensus seems to be that this was below par for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ticking clock...","review":"UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG is about Patty Murphy and her need to have a baby.

In fact, she starts dating Mark, a very eligible bachelor who meets her via a blind date set up by her best friend and ex fiance Ethan (who also happens to be gay). She tries to like Mark. And she does! But there is something missing - he's not Ethan.Half way through the book Patty and Ethan decide that it is time for them to have a baby. Patty is ecstatic!

While the premise of the story was somewhat interesting, the story itself was lacking. In fact, it was so unchallenging and uninteresting that I flipped through it, missing pages at a time, and I finished the book in 15 minutes. As the mother of an active 2 year old, who stays at home, reading is the only thing that stimulates my intellect. Therefore, I can't afford to waste time on a lousy book. Needless to say, I was glad this book only comsumed 15 minutes of my time. If you want a good book, read \\" Sister of My Heart\\". It is intelligent, well written, and thought provoking. Look it up and enjoy a truly good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berg bashes women","review":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along is a first-time and last-time Berg read for me! I found this ridiculous litany of whining nothing less than a total insult to women. Berg portrays her leading lady as a pathetic, incompetent, dependent dreamer of the coming of Mr. Right. I don't think there was a paragraph in the piece that didn't contain a needful rumination of Patty's empty self. And, her inaccurate description and depiction of alzheimers disease is a further insult.

I couldn't get into any of this girl's motivations (or non-motivations as it turns out, there isn't much she really wants to do except fantasize about having the perfect marriage and kids).

Patty, the main character, wants a home, a husband and a baby. When given the opportunity to have all of these, she continually passes up the chance. The reader is never really clear WHY that is- the character's motivation is really weak. And why she is stuck on Ethan, her now gay, once boyfriend other than the fact that he's beautiful- who knows? Why wouldn't she want to move on? Too much dialogue, not enough character development, very sappy (did she have to throw in the Mother with Alzheimers? What was up with that?). Pass on this Berg.

It astonishes me that this writer has won awards!I don't consider myself a feminist, however, I found the main character's complete obsession with finding a man and having a baby insulting to me as a woman, and insulting to men as well. Furthermore, her \\"love\\" for gay-Ethan had promise at first, but come on -- I do remember learning in my first writing class that a writer much \\"show and not tell\\" and I could not help but think of that as I read this book.As if you could not tell, I do not recommend this book if you normally enjoy good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I love most of Berg's books, but this one had no depth and was a waste of time.

A 36 year old single woman, whose biological clock is running, wise cracks her way through bad dates and life while wasting her time being in love with a gorgeous gay man.

She had no respect for herself and decided to have a child with a man who would never love her the way she wanted to be loved. She settled.

They seem to put it in the same category as 1984 and brave new world and books like that. Fro me this book was closer to The catcher in the ryre or lor dof the flies than it was to those books. I actually dont see this as a political novel at all so much as a novel about youth and growing older and how adults will want to change you when your a teenager. Thats what it was about to me. Aside from that, this book has alot of symbolism i think the entire novel could also be seen as a metaphor for how christian missionaries used to convert indians to christianity and then send them back to theyre country,changed forever.

The ridiculous slang that he creates makes it almost impossible to enjoy the story in any sense.The story is predictable and not very entertaining. If someone was wanting to read a book on gang rape and the evils of mis spent youth then I am sure that there are other books out there there are at least written in such a way that you don't need an interpreter for all the fabricated words in this little book.I find it hard to believe that so many give this book a 5 star review. It scares me a bit to find out what my fellow human beings find as a quality piece of work.I was expecting more and was terribly disappointed. Certainly won't be reading this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and disturbing","review":"After twenty pages I threw this book against the wall. I have never read a more frustrating and disturbing book. All the dialogue is gibberish. In the first twenty pages, Alex and his lackies beat a guy senseless and rob him; they steal a car and trash it, they get into a vicious gang fight; they attack a couple at their home, destroy the husband's life work (his book \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") beat him and his wife senseless and rape the wife. This really ticked me off. I read this expecting a great story because it's a \\"classic\\", but I was severly disappointed.

The biggest problem that I felt it had was that if the same content would have been written by another author, it would have been called pornogrophy but because it was by Burgess it is called classic literature. Beating helpless people, raping women, and drinking some kind of spiked milk should not be something that is glamorized, but it should be something hidden with the rest of the works such as this trash. If a woman is raped and purposefully hurt now in a work of literature, it is seen as some kind of foul scene, but here, because the youths in the book seem to have no sense of right and wrong it is seen as alright. There is something wrong with this. I only gave it one star because I had to for the form to post.

Most of the horror out there is just a mix of gore and violence - but A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is something else. The horror I found in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is the subtle, disturbing thought that humans can be programmed to the point where all free will is lost. The violent antics of the central character are inexcusable but stripping him of what little humanity he had to begin with is far worse.

Anthony Burgess's masterpiece of a novel is deeply intriguing, insightful, and enlightening on matters of free will and human rights. Through the first person view and acts of violence on behalf of the central character, Alex, we gain insights into the moral issues of what the persuit of happiness can begin to mean; at what point does your pursuit of happiness begin to violate somone elses rights as a human?

Hidden within the richness of the language and violent images there is a deep and hard hitting message in which Burgess tells us that the possession of free will is ultimately more important than what we use it to accomplish.The book is a modern classic and which everyone must read.

From the beginning to the end of this horrific and, at the same time, humorous tale, Burgess recounts the adolescent happenings of a young nadsat named Alex. Using the first-person, Alex tells his teenage story of being institutionalized, and the accounts that follow his early release. The language in this book is incredible; no other author holds rank with Burgess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindblowing","review":"After reading all of the other reviews, I'll probably sound redundant if I were to write my own.

Suitibly creepy, the world this takes place in is not that implausible. A semi-totalitarian government rules the day, adolescent street gangs rule the night, the cops are recruited from the street gangs, so as redirect their violence into \\"constructive\\" activities, and the prisons are so overflowing with political prisoners that there is barely any room for actual criminals. The central plot centers on a governemnt experiment to eliminate crime through mind control, and leaves the reader asking, \\"Is it better to be evil by one's own choice than to be good without a choice?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Before reading this novel I saw the movie, and I do not reccondmend doing so. By watching the movie I was unable to capture the imagery in this wonderful, wonderful book. The nadast language that is used throughout the novel was easy to pick up on after about the second chapter. At first I thought the book was just all fun and games but after Alex got sent jail I started noticing deep insite. The book is talking about choice, and how if you cannot choose what you want, then you are nothing. Sure, Alex was \\"cured alright\\" but he was still as sick and demented as he was before getting treated. I'm sure you have all heard this before but why not say it again, eh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is a drug","review":"This book is crazy.

The tratment is a sort of brainwashing that makes Alex ill everytime he encounters violence.Alex is let out of prison and finds it very difficult to find his way in the world.

Them I decided to read the book. I just couldn't stop reading it, i finished it in two days, and I also loved it. Both the book and the movie are really good, but the movie doesn't have the last chapter, so now after reading the book I'll feel like there's something missing. But it's still a very good movie, and a real horrorshow book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely different","review":"I bought the book on a suggestion from a friend.

The first three chapters were hard due to the new language the author uses. (recommendation: get the dictionary from the web and print it so you can look up the new words). After a while you can read with no trouble. At the beginning I was astound by the violence and couldn't understand how this book got good reviews. But as I got to the middle part it changed pace and the depth a in which the author goes to show us how society deals with violence or differences was mind blowing. I just hope my daughter can understand what was able to appreciate at her age. It is written well. The violent parts are really strong you feel like you are there. The other sections really make you think about life, society, laws and our behavior. I really recommend the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark coming of age tale of lawless youth","review":"i have read this book many times and as always it is a gut wrenching sadistic coming of age tale that takes place in a society that breeds awfulness, I love this book and I would recommend reading it, I would also recommend never watching the movie because it just completely missed the bus on capturing the essence and the moral of this grim tale.A Clockwork Orange"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic book, set an example for many to come!!!","review":"This book was way ahead of it's time. A story of Alex and his gang who was set forth on a mission of ultraviolence. The book painted a picture of what could happen to kids in a world where violence is toned down to the point where it becomes \\"daily activity\\". It also gives descent insight into the mind of an Antisocial. Using a conglomeration of Russian, German, and made up words, Burgess even created a slang talk that enhances the uniquness of this story. Very cool book, one must pick it up, quick and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book.","review":"I won't go into detail about this book, 577 people have beat me to it.

This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic","review":"What a wonderful book, if you like reading about violent and graphic rapes, beatings, and the inner destruction of man- which I do like reading about. Only Burgess could conjure up a story so incredible, so vivid and disturbing that one could actually enjoy reading it. The language, by far, is the best since Shakespeare picked up a quill. Read this awesome book and it'll make you think twice the next time you think about methods of being nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and somehow disturbing","review":"This is because it\`s slowly creeping up to be prothetic. It is a wonderful, well written book, with an abunance of scenes which are moving and engrosssing. Its language gives it a certain edge, it is both extremely funny and enlightning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brutal, But Excellent Novel","review":"\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is a great read in numerous ways. First off, Burgess did a brilliant job with creating an invented language of the teens in the future-set society. At first, it is hard to follow and might be a little frustrating to some, but if you are patient, you will get used to it and realize how incredible it is. The novel also has a very important theme to it, which displays the importance of moral choice. The central character, Alex, is nothing but a clockwork orange (I'll leave it to you to figure out what that is by the end of the book). There are some that might argue that the novel is too violent, but the high level of violence is actually needed to strengthen both the setting (a future society filled with crime) and the theme. The movie was also good, but I enjoyed the book more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was disturbing and enthralling at the same time!","review":"I loved A Clockwork Orange. It was definitely different from any book I have ever read. The storyline was unique and the characters were well developed. Although parts of it were disturbing, they were necessary to emphasize the plot. The book gave me a new understanding of violence and I recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting disutopic sci-fi book","review":"An interesting disutopic sci-fi book on alienation, violence and misogyny. It was even more interesting when I read that it had been published with different endings.I wasn't as impressed with Burgess' using non-English words, because I speak Russian and that's all the \\"slang\\" really was. (Example, the Russian word for Friend is Droog; Hand is Ryka; Milk is Moloko). Therefore it was immediately apparent to me though I liked the mixing of the two languages it reminded me of how I talk at home using both languages interchangeably. In a way I wish I could've read the book as most people did (who didn't use the glossary) and try to figure out the words through context."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cruel novel","review":"It was really difficult to read for me.I think the novel told me a wonderful story that could never exist in reality, because all young men were brutal and killed people. It was thrilling. First little Alex was a cruel and crazy young man and he learnt nothing until he was in custody and when he was a victim of his state, he became an adult. This was a wonderful turning of his life at the end.There were serious moral problems in this book about free will. Should all people have a perfect and well-mannered characters or it's better to live in a world with some villains and criminals of their own making?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest thing you could ever read","review":"Only a complete fool could write this off as an excuse to write about rape and ultraviolence. This is at heart a genuine attempt at black [and sometimes subtle slapstick] comedy. The film is a terrible interpretation of this excellent book, and just to correct one reviewer, it was not banned for copycat crimes or anything of the sort. It was *WITHDRAWN* by Kubrick himself after his family received death threats. The book is an essential read and the Nadsat language is easy to decode; you must read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and confused","review":"A Clockwork orange is a good choice for reading material if you have a lot of time and you feel like reading a book twice. I was very confused all through this book. It is not something that I would read again. I didn't care for the language, I found that it made it very difficult to understand and follow. The message of the book is sort of good. The people really want to help Alex but the way they go about it can be debated. Some people i'm sure will love this book, but I have found that this book wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this book","review":"This book was excellent i found it very exciting and the plot was excellent.Dedicated to Mr. Norling"},{"rating":"1","title":"A solitary disclaimer","review":"I have read quite a few of the reviews on 'Amazon' and everyone of them praises the book highly. They talk about the inventiveness and energy of the language, the sympathy they have for the major character Alex, especially when his Nature is forcibly changed, and he loses the ability to be himself , including the ability to enjoy Beethoven's music. They speak about the skill in depicting the main character's alienation, and the dreary world of an imagined future technical dystopia.They speak about a vision Burgess presents, and the fact that in spite of the language containing many at first non- understandable slang terms, that the work is nonetheless really understandable.I didn't like the book. I read quite a bit of it. I just could not get into it. I do not like violence even fictional violence. I simply could not find any of this entertaining or amusing, however I know the great gifts Burgess has as writer.I may be wrong, but I simply do not like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorifies thuggery.

As for me, I think I'll just rent the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delghtful to viddy.","review":"This book is a modern classic. At first, it was almost imossible to understand because of the made up language of \\"nadsat\\" used by the narrator (Alex.) Once you got past this barrior (on the second read for me) it became a major plus for the book, giving you a sense of belonging to the futuristic, yet all to similar (if extreme) society. It also explores the dangers of conditioning, reminiscant to Aldolis Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" and it shows one possibility for our society in the not so distant future"},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend this one to all my droogs","review":"One of the best books I have read in a long time, A Clockwork Orange is incredibly direct, and disturbing.At the beginning, a tad bit confusing, due to the \\"nadsat\\" language, but this element of the book only increases it's worth.A book i could not put down, so poignant was it. It made me imagine the future and all it will bring. Excellent.Oh, and one more thing : if possible, get the edition which has 21 chapters (as opposed to 20).I read the 21st chapter off the internet, and found that it really changed my impression of the book in general"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I can see how people would find this book to be neat. It's defintely unique. I didn't enjoy it, though. I am a reader who likes to get swept onto the page and become the protagonist's shadow, and with this book's inventive language I found that impossible. I could never get into a flow because too often (every paragraph for at least the first seven chapters) I had to stop and figure out what the protagonist was trying to say. I nearly put it down for good when I got about halfway through it. I'm glad I pushed on, though, because the last third of the book--the point in which I had finally figured out enough of the protagonist's language to not have to work so hard--was pretty good.If you like Shakespeare, you'll probably like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best!","review":"The most fabulous book i have seen. I have read it so many times and I cant stop amaze myself with the way Burgess writes! I am from Bulgaria, my language is close to the Russian (and i know some russian myself) and the book is translated brilliantly and it becomes a magic composition of Bulgarian, English and Russian. I'm sure the book does not sound so perfect and \\"tricky\\" in English (I noticed one should use some dictionary). I dont read many books, but this one is XXXL. I would be happy if someone writes me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Violent and Disturbing Story","review":"A Clockwork Orange is without a doubt the most vicious book I have ever read. The brutality practiced by all the characters is ungodly. The book itself is written in a strange form of schoolboy speak that makes the plot difficult at first. Eventually (as with Shakespeare), the language helps to draw the reader further into the minds and activities of the characters. As for the writing, it is wonderfully imaginative and certainly very different. This book is not for the faint of heart but should be read by anyone with the slightest interest in the animal nature of man."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made grade 12 English bearable","review":"Between Macbeth and a pile of sleepy Can-Lit, getting to read \\"Clockwork Orange\\" was a complete break from the rest of the stodgy curriculum. As a 16 year old girl, I loved this book at the time, though I'm sure now years later, the misogyny might irk me. Nonetheless, this book raised so many interesting debates about free will and human morality, I would urge everyone to read it.

My native language is Russian, and itwas real fun to be able to understand the meaning of the russian wordswithout referring to the last page. I was impressed with the author's ability to use foreign words and make them the part of the futuristic slang. Some of the puns are great. For instance, \\"horroshow\\" which means \\"good\\" in russian or \\"Korova Milk Bar\\". The main character, Alex, is unforgettable. Coldblooded cynical murderer who appreciates great classical music and who is definetely much more intelligent and educated that his \\"drugies\\" will stay in your memory long after you finished the book. I would recommend the movie. Made by Stanley Kubrick with Malcolm MacDowell as Alex it is very successful screen adaptation which was nominated for several Oscars in 1971."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version cheats you","review":"Just so you know, the Kindle version of the Norton edition is just the novel and Burgess' intro. It doesn't contain the supplementary materials that make a Norton edition valuable to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"Anyone who thinks Stanley Kubrick's film version of this is any good should definitely read the book, because it is much better. Many people talk about how hard the slang is to understand but I first read this when I was about 16 and I had no trouble at all. Being from a small town in the U.S. with no real exposure to Slavic languages it only took me reading the first chapter to get used to the slang. So don't let the language discourage you from enjoying this masterpiece of literature. It is a bit graphic and quite violent but (unlike the movie) there is a purpose to it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Anthony Burgess has written a classic here. The book brings you into Alex's Mind by using teenage (NADSAT) British slang and all. This is by far the best book I've read; Brave New World running a close 2nd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant little book","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a conceptually simple but potent allegory bringing up questions of free will and the nature of good and evil. Two things about the book may be stumbling-blocks to some readers: its extensive use of invented slang (based mostly on Russian), and the violent content necessary to portray Alex's depravity. The former actually tends to suppress the latter. Philosophically ACO seems to be a parable praising free will, but the book raises more questions than it answers. So do many great books. This edition fortunately includes the controversial last chapter, which I agree with the author is essential to the work. But whether this is really so, along with the social lessons to be gleaned by this effective story, is for the individual reader to decide. After all, as Burgess said, \\"you are free\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"The evident uniqueness of the book, of course, is Burgess' invention of a youthful futurespeak for his Humble Narrator. Never again will I viddy the ptitsas nor tolchoch a droog in the same light.

This \\"book\\" was the worst of all of these statements. The slang was difficult for difficulties sake. The message of the government was heavy handed. The pity for the protagonist was feeble. The overall message was poorly crafted and framed more as a statement than a thought provoking question. I can't remember ever rating something 1 star, but I want the time i spent reading this back.

It took me only 5-10 pages of this book to master Nadsat - I never had to use the glossary at the back. Once you grasp the language in which the book is written, the rest of the book is extremely absorbing. In a compact plot and a short novel, the author elucidates the issues of moral determinism vs moral choice better than the volumes of philosophical treatises written in last few hundred years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"I got this as a present for my son, & he was really surprised I found the one with the 21st chapter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll get a horrorshow veck out of this book","review":"Certainly the most violent book I've ever read, there is statutory rape, multiple armed robberies and assaults, and forced rape within the first few chapters. However, don't let that discourage you from reading this book. Burgess artfully crafts a unique slang which starts out confusing, but the book is so engrossing that you'll find yourself using the terms he creates in your own mind. This printing includes the final chapter that was omitted from the movie. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it definitely adds to the book, and you can choose to ignore it if you so choose. This book most certainly deserves to be called a classic, as it is really quite excellent, though not quite as impactful in the long run, I think, as other similar books such as 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Still, if you're looking for an entertaining read that has more substance than your average modern novel, this is a good book to turn to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"Although the condition of the book was a little iffy for its price, it was a great buy and a great book.

He invents a language and manages to translate it brilliantly without destroying the story. The book is perfect. It describes a horrifying moral society when the children take over at night.

A Clockwork Orange draws in the simple reader with its raw brutality and violence and leaves them greatly affected with the social implications of this literary masterpiece.Regarding the Russian-English slang spoken by the protagonist, Alex, and his fellow hoodlums; it's initially hard to comprehend, but after the first chapter, one should have no problem reading it.This book is more than just a thriller - it also touches on the psychological and social aspects that are prevalent in today's society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a must read","review":"I read this book my senior year of high school (now a good bit of time in the past) and it's impression still resonates to this day now 8 years later. I found it to be particularly interesting that the author of this book was christian and that the story had religious undertones regarding the importance of consent to goodness. I think literature can tend to take on new interpretive qualities apart from what the author intends, but that bit definitely is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Beauty of Joyous Brutality","review":"A Clockwork Orange is not only a suspenseful and enjoyed book, but a solid support in my theory that there is no such thing as right and wrong. It is a masterful fable that teaches us the same part of us that feeds on destruction, plants the yearning to create. I am little surprised that in most of the other reviews this idea has gone largely unnoticed. (i.e. I don't believe the point is that he and everyone else just came around and decided not to be bad anymore because of their experience.) Anyway, I really loved this book because it helped me in polishing my ideas of life, which I think it will do for many who read it. It is beautiful, simply beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This has to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. It is violent in a few places but I have no problem with it. And Burgess's \\"Nadsat\\" language is what makes the book. Without it I doubt it would have been all that great. I didn't understand the words at first but after awhile I started learning it and by the end of the book I barely noticed it. Some people are saying the last chapter is sort of a let down. I don't. The last chapter was what made the book great. It showed that people are capable of changing and not being Clockwork Oranges all their life. I strongly recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Clockwork again","review":"I just moved and happened across my copy of CO. I sat down and read it again only to be mesmerized by Burgess once again. In his introduction, he is very self-deprecating, but this is one fine work.Holden Caulfield, this is what teenage angst is really all about. The use of language (nadsat talk) is truly an amazing literary feat.Read it again or read it a first time...it is so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Boy, that Burgess has some nerve! First, he gets us to like this ultraviolent teenager due to the fun narration, then he encourages us to feel sorry for him when Big Government intervenes and prevents him from acting as he would wish! Outstanding story and language...just one thing, couldn't Burgess have left the final chapter out, as Stanley Kubrick did in the film? I love how the final made me wonder about Alex, where the novel tried to make amends."},{"rating":"2","title":"O my Brothers, Read This","review":"This is what literature is all about. Good storytelling, good characters, good everything. I will not overlook the violence at all, but you must realize that that must be included for this to make any sense at all.

Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre voyage into a fantastic world","review":"I have read the book, and have seen the movie. Both were excellent, but I am more fond of the movie which supplies supurb visuals where the book could not. The story is still one of the best in literature. I do not think that the book induces violence. Just as the title suggests, humans are \\"clockwork oranges,\\" wound up beyond their own ability; we will run our courses no matter what is said or shown to us. Violent people are born violent, there are no defenses. So, if someone wears boots, white pants with suspenders, a bowler hat, and fake eyelashes while they commit violent acts; well, then they were already missing a can or two from their six pack. All in all, the book is great, and don't miss the movie. \\"Viddy well, my brother, viddy well.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"Found this hard to read because of the slang words used.

For a person who is supposed to be an 'Orientalist' he sure does hate his subject. Under cover of being a scholar Lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning. This ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the Middle East today. Powerful people listen to Lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the Muslim world. Unfortunately this advice comes from a person who has made it a lifelong mission to destroy and defame the very subject he claims to be an expert of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what you would expect","review":"This book covers the history of the Arabic world since pre Mohammed times to date. Of course, given the length of the book, you cannot expect a very detailed treatment nor an in depth analysis (the same author seems to offer them in other works). But as a concise and first-approach History is very useful. If you just need to get the facts, a road map and a sense of what has been the History of the Middle East, this is a very useful book. It is short, fast to read and opens up your appetite for more. It does not answer questions but it does something more important: it makes you ask lots of questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done on a very very low budget","review":"NOT worth what the asking price is, a good message, but the video is just terrilbe.... seems like they just videoed a night a prayer meeting or something, low low budget.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Cosby has never really grown up...","review":"...and that is a good thing. In this book, his fourth, Cosby again collects some of his material from his comic routines to compare and contrast his childhood with that of his children. I have alway found Cosby at his funniest whenever he shares the misadventures of his youth in the projects. The book also has a warm, nostalgic feel for a time long past. Sadly some of my favorite routines (i.e. \\"Chicken Heart\\" and the one where he and Weird Harold stay far longer at a horror movie than they should have) are absent, something that keeps the book from getting five stars.

Like many new users I was mystified - and frustrated - by various aspects of Windows and looked to the index for help on specifics. Nearly every time, this book failed to address my question. Now that I'm fairly competent this book is useful, but would not recommend for the Mac user new to Windows. The author has not adequately anticipated the most common new-user emergencies, and the \\"Troubleshooting\\" sections - that you turn to in a bit of a panic - are quite meager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerky characters","review":"Somewhere there is a story struggling to get out, but this book just didn't work for me. The main reason is I did not like the main characters Ryan and Cass. Just when things seem to be settling down into a rhythm one or both of them would go ballistic.Basing a plot on government conspiracies is fine. There is plenty of material out there to work with, but this book begins with an intriguing Ludlum like premise that started to morph into somethign akin to the Fugitive then drives right over a cliff.I stuck with most of the way, but finally gave up around page 300 and the upteenth inane character drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's LOUSY!!!!","review":"I met David Kent at a book signing.

Honestly, I can't imagine who Kent is sleeping with that gives him these strange ideas on how women derive pleasure.The laborious descriptions obviously tripped Kent up because I found two glaring contradictions in the text.

When it's stolen, so is his livelihood. He and his young son (Enzo Staiola) undertake a desperate search through Rome to find the stolen property, becoming increasingly more desperate as the search progresses.The story is simple and eloquent, quiet and powerful, harrowing and moving.

The English is dubbed, and it doesn't match the subtitles. As an added bonus, neither matches the Italian. I cannot believe an Italian actor is yelling in somebody's face, with the full range of body language for which they are so famous, while the translation is \\"you stupid guy.\\" No, he was unleashing some beautiful profanity. But no matter. This is a wonderful film. Comic and moving, full of depth. It has an Academy Award of some sort on the cover, and I'm sure you can read all kinds of reviews drooling over this classic.

Is that all there is to it?\\"------And I watched it recently on DVD and my reaction is the same.This is a very over rated film. 'Umberto D' by the same Writer and Director is vastly superior IMO, and deserves its terrific reviews. This film, well----- the Guy has a bike, it is stolen, he looks high and low for the Bike, can't find it, decides to steal another, is caught immediately (very unrealisticly done), and, the film ends. Okay, I just don't get the nutty enthusiatic reviews. Prehaps, too many people took film classes in college and your Professor told you this was supposed to be a great film. It is not! The only shot memorable to me is outside of the Soccer Stadium, with the hugh crowd inside, that I will remember.

You get a classic film along with great reading material about the film and a bonus DVD explaining why this film is a classic. Also, it sits nicely on any bookshelf. I especially recommend this film to younger viewers as a warning againt allowing society and governments to dehumanize its citizens (especially the poor). This film makes you think about what it means to be a human being--something that today's films seem not to do, The Departed, for instance. Obviously a worthy addition to anyone's film collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest films ever made.

It was so like, and yet so unlike the French filmmaking style. The admittedly thin plot could have been material for a dull nose upturned French film, but evidently the Italians actually give a $#!+ about what happens to them. The tragedy and unfairness poor Antonio endures are meaningful because he EMOTES, because he is a human being thrown around by the world.My only complaint is because of a certain aspect of the ending. Antonio makes a choice that is a perfect ending for the film, and than the film goes on to show the consequences of that choice in a way the kills the ending's momentum. It does not matter what happens after he makes this choice, the mere fact of what he does is the film's best idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultural Arts Center of Saint Louis recommends","review":"Story of an unemployed man and his son in war devastated Rome.

Its flawed adaptations of fairy tales made it a difficult book to enjoy and really get into. Such adaptations include \\"Snow White and the Particularly Little People\\", which teaches the reader about particles and atoms. The less-than-captivating adaptations became nearly monotonous, as Gilmore occasionally went into excessive details concerning each subject.

I went to the world premiere, and the only reason I was glad I went was that I got to have my picture taken with Dwight Yoakam. I admire Yoakam for writing his own movie, but I think he should stick to singing. The movie was plotless, and the only thing that kept from walking out was Vince Vaughn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-intriguing but lame.","review":"There are some very intriguing scenes here, mostly underdone, to include fresh takes on the western perspective, nice landscape shots and setting with potentially great characters, but the dialogue was diseased with an excess of modern day cussing/linguistics and as such was absurdly out of historical context - noted lack of enthusiastic acting/acting skills /enough to make this a lame sort of semi-intriguing unintentional spoof."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks beyond belief","review":"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I would rather push a nail through my finger then ever watch this movie again. Everyone please trust me when I say that you should not waste one penny on this film or take one second out of your lives to watch a moment of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"what an awful movie-do not waste your time","review":"Has to be one of worst movies of all time. Dwight Yoakam is a worse actor than he is a singer. How he ever got the cast talked into this one is beyond me. How can any person rate this above a 1?? I realize that even sh-- looks good to some, and that is what this movie is."},{"rating":"2","title":"South of Heaven West of Hell","review":"Vince Vaughn's performance more than compensates for the rough edges in this star-studded western. Mr. Yoakam has assembled an impressive cast to populate the strange world(s) in which this film's action takes place. Easily one of the most original westerns ever.I found some interesting background information about props including the guns and the comically giant bandanas that accessorize the players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theme To An Imagenary Lousy Western!","review":"This flick begins with a turn of the Century preacher proclaiming that these \\"new moving pictures\\" are a sinfull abomination. After viewing the rest of the movie you think he might just be right! \\"South of Heaven West of Hell\\" has all the bloodshed and exploitation of a Peckinpah western without any of the rhyme, reason or demension. The hard-to-care-about script takes you from one stomach churning monent after another with an understandibly unenthusiastic cast. (Who told Dwight Yokem he could act?) The ONLY people who'll want to waste time with this would be die-hard Pee Wee Herman fans! Pee Wee plays a perverted western badguy... a little TOO convincingly! Other than that no reason to forfeit 2 hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie went South, straight to Hell right from the beginning.","review":"The dialogue is artificial. The acting is ridiculous. The photography is beautiful. That's the only good thing about it.Don't even rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of film and time.","review":"Inspite of a all star cast, this movie was filled with profanity and a waste of my viewing time. The story made no sense, the language was vulgar which I don't mind, but this was senseless. I did enjoy the graphic sex, but I could not see where it did anything to further the plot, other than to get people who only watch R rated movies to rent it. Dwight Yoakam should for sure keep to singing and I hope did not use any of his own money to get into this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dwight....","review":"Groan...this was such a bad movie I turned if off after 30min. I have seen Dwight act in better films than this. Perhaps he should stick to singing as a first career. Mildly amusing in spots but I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense.","review":"I enjoy many different types of film, given that they have some kind of plot and good character development. This film had neither. I had little or no interest in who was being injured or killed in the scenes of excessive violence. The good thing about the violence, however, is that it gave us a break from the inane dialogue.I am upset that I wasted 2 hours watching this pointless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully photographed, that's about it...","review":"I love Dwight Yoakam's music and songwriting, he's surely one of the best singer/ songwriters out there but I think he should leave the screenwriting to professional screenwriters. This film looks beautiful, but the plot leaves a lot to be desired and the dialogue is often very dull. Dwight has some positives in this, as bad as it is. For instance, he looks great on a horse, but he looks uncomfortable in front of the camera here, which is unusual for him, given his other movies. The characters are interesting enough, but not given enough development that we can see. I don't think Dwight should give up directing entirely, but I would not recommend seeing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's pretty bad","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad, dialogue, nonsensical plot; one can't begin to describe all of the things that are wrong with this movie. Paradoxically, the cinematography is pretty good, so in a way you end up thinking that you're not watching a movie as bad as it really is. I guess that's why I endured about 45 minutes of it before finally giving up on it--something I very rarely do, even with the worst of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not From Hollywood","review":"I note that the only person who apparently liked this movie was a \\"reviewer\\" from \\"Hollywood\\". Not surprising. Probably was entered by Billy Bob. Truly this movie is a terrible waste of time and is without any redeeming qualities. I would rather watch Costner's Wyatt Earp 10 times in a row (and that movie truly [stinks] too) than watch Dwight's movie once. Perhaps it had something to do with hearing the word F*@K 200 times or seeing gore that's usually reserved for horror movies. Perhaps this movie is aimed at the 18-25 year old crowd who will actually pay money to watch mindless sex and violence for its own sake. If so, they should have had some young actors like in American Outlaws. I recently saw that movie also and laughed and had a good time. Dwight should stick to bit parts and making music. And... this is important... keeping his hat on."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you expect?","review":"Maybe in the theatre it would have been a tough sit, but this is a great western. If you don't get it the first time - watch it again. Believable sets, and writing. Got to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting features, worth a look.","review":"I am not really a fan of westerns, but this is different. Slow-moving, but interesting. A variety of characters. I would watch anything that Vince Vaughn is in, but Dwight Yoakum is impressive. The cinematography is different, too. Everything is bathed in golden light, almost a dreamy look. This film is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"south of heaven west of hell","review":"I was very pleased with this dvd,Dwight Yoakam was awesome,as usual,this movie is a lot of Dwight. Dwight fans will want to purchase this one. Very good western."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Western Since Pale Rider","review":"Easily the best western since Pale Rider. As a 26 year old non-country boy, the only other westerns I considered worthwhile were those of Sergio Leone and anything shoot-em-up with Clint Eastwood, pre-Unforgiven days... Dwight Yoakam serves up a fine dish of honky-tonk, gunfighting, and even raunch in a western that plays more like a documentary than fiction. Not in the boring ... documentary fashion, but in a way of life, be it low or otherwise. This movie is original, intelligent, and puts any later western to shame, including Young Guns, its sequel, Unforgiven, or Posse. Those who claim there is no plot are obviously not paying attention to a film they decided to critique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road to Bali","review":"Got it very fast and it is a great movie. Of course with old Blue eyes and Bob Hope. It had to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"a better version","review":"My previous review of this title was for a different edition of the same film (see below) I was in no way doubting the film itself - just that particular inadequate DVD release (this new, superior version does NOT include On The Road Tp Hollywood).But this version, released through Brentwood Entertainment, is part of the \\"Bob Hope Collection\\" (although a disclaimer says Bob Hope himself has nothing to do with the release of these films). Unlike the previous version(s) this release has a good picture and beautiful color. It can be purchased separarely or in a collection with other Hope films (some better than others).I still love the Road pictures and this is a particular favorite - so if you want the only color Road picture in your collection, the Brentwood release is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bali who?","review":"What a delightful Road DVD. Although the only extra is a Bio on Bob Hope, overall it is well worth the money. The color is great and the sound is acceptable(only ocassional fluctuation in level). The sets and costumes really add to this movie. Undoubtly they made them more colorful since this was the only road movie made in color. What a pity. This certainly follows the tradition of the others and Hope, Crosby, and Lamour look great. From stage performers to deep sea divers they sing and dance their way into your heart. If you only buy one road movie then be sure it is this one since it is great and the color will appeal to a younger audience as well. A movie that the whole family will find amusing jokes or site gags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"The plot was OK, but the songs were forgettable--almost painful--and the dancing was amateurish. I found myself fast forwarding through a lot. However, the comedic exchanges between Bing and Bob were fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"not full length film","review":"the original had a running time of 91 minutes!excellent road film,and I have them all in my collection,and love them all,but our favorite is road to morocco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still funny","review":"I bought this to watch when my Mom came over. Definately worth the $ I paid for it. I didn't think I would laugh much, because I had to sit through a few mediocre Bob Hope specials as a kid. But I did find myself laughing quite a bit. I always thought that Ferris Bueller's Day Off was one of the first movies where the actors stopped and talked to the camera, until Bob Hope told be to get popcorn/soda now because Bing is about to sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I grow up, i want to be a producer like Fat Jon!","review":"can't let another day go by without writing about Fat Jon. I discovered his sound by accident. Actually, while buying some vinyl records online, I read a review about his production and took a chance on it. This is the bomb right here! In a a hip hop world where originality has faded to black, Fat Jon's style stands out from the rest. It's smooth beats to say the least, a laid back, mellow vibe perfect for late night drives on the Autobahn. Check out \\"Mystery God\\" and \\"Beyond Love\\" which are (in my opinion) two standout tracks on an exceptional album. If you're longing for vocals, this may not be for you. Let me mention that Fat Jon did some production work with a \\"neo-soul\\" artist named Venus Malone. Although very hard to find, that collaboration is worth looking for. Beat connoisseurs will have a heyday with Lightweight Heavy. It's sure to please!DJ Come of Age"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Lovely.","review":"DJ Mark Farina did a wonderful job with this third compilation of jazzy hip-hop tracks. It's such a delight to listen to and it easily floats from one song to the next, and all the tracks are good. I find myself playing it over and over, it's impossible for me to get tired of this album. It offers a wide variety of tempos but it's mainly an album one would play for any type of activity, such as: Cruising in your car at night, cleaning the kitchen, just kicking back in your recliner chair and meditating, or simply providing chilled out background music for a party. You can't go wrong with buying this volume, there is something for everybody on this, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"...i jus cant be pleased sometimes...","review":"...i played this all the way thru the day i got it...i played it sparingly the next day...and later that evening i took it and my receipt back to the 'wrecka sto' and exchanged it for a copy of atcq's 'low end theory'...five years ago i woulda been all into this, but nowadays, i jus be sooooo closed-minded....sorry...."},{"rating":"2","title":"my new fave","review":"Now I don't have to listen to DJ Garth's SF Sessions 3 all the damn time.

Unfortunately, couldn't find an Ireland atlas we were interested in.The scale is the key, and in this instance, we felt it didn't give enough detail to even figure out when we were approaching roads we could see. Finally, we gave up and used maps in the tour guides, which tells you how desperate we were.When driving, we'd find that none of the roads listed in tour guides were to be found in the atlas, which was a problem. We'd also have trouble with very inconvenient spots where one map would end and the next would begin (either because of the binding or the need to turn a page).I've used a lot of atlases and maps, and this one just didn't seem to do enough for us to be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent - same as harbour freight tools for 59.99","review":"I have this same kit - paid 59.99 from Harbour Freight - pay the extra to get solid carbide edges - a good kit but the edge didn't seem to hold up for the 6 panels I wanted to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illegit product?","review":"The first several tracks on the CD have the song title and artist offset by one. So when you play it in a modern CD player or load it into iTunes, the tracks are mislabeled. For example, track 3 has the name and artist for track 2. The company is in Argentina.

It generates more heat that I expected. Certainly, there are better grills on the market, but for a portable grill that produces good heat at a great price, this is the one. The base is stable, the temp gauge is handy, and the removable and dishwasher-safe cooking plate makes clean-up a little easier (but good luck finding a dishwasher that will fit it). My only real complaint is that the unit is difficult to carry around because the grill unit does not latch onto the base so much as it sits on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but where's the heat?","review":"Convenient, compact and looks great on the porch/back of your truck but what about the heat?

Cooking is not so great. Food is dried out as if you were to cook on a frying pan or a George Forman grill. Doesn't have that flame broiled BBQ taste. The Teflon peels off the grill after about 4-6 months of use. AND GOOD LUCK TRYING TO GET A REPLACEMENT GRILL! and don't get me started on cleaning it!

I disagree with most of the good reviews. The propane output is pretty low and this is only so-so for smooth top grilling. It is quite large fo the cooking space.

They are so cute and it helped my daughter not be so afraid, maybe it will help yours too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween Spooktakular is just that Spooktakular","review":"This is a such a creative and different take on the idea of Halloween. You have your typical bully with a witch, skeleton, monster, vampires, and a werewolf to help set the mood. That is where the normal idea of Halloween ends because then this delightful story twists any sort of typical Halloween ideal and sends it off in a whole new fun direction. Jimmy is the older cousin who doesn't feel like being saddled with is younger cousin Hannah on Halloween. With three friends he decides to send his younger cousin screaming home by sending her into the Spook House. Before the night is over Hannah learns that monsters aren't necessarily the ones who look like them. Jimmy will learn a lesson as well and all of this is picked up in the second movie. The whole thing is fun romp that should be enjoyable for people of all ages.

I purchased it based on the positive reviews, which is usually a safe bet, but not this time. My kids are all in elementary school, and none of them liked it. The movie is colorful, but the animations are rigid and appear to be cheaply done. There are too many characters to keep track of, and they are creepy in a disturbing way, not in a fun or scary Halloweenish way. The storyline is all over the place and chaotic. It's a weird movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Most of the reviews were pretty good on this. My daughter is 3.5 years old and I felt this was way too young for her. I feel she is pretty intelligent, but all the reviews said they had kids about this age and the cartoon/story line is ridiculous.

The story begins in South America and moves to France and both places are described in loving detail. The father had first left Europe to avoid serving in the military and he returns, unknowingly, in time for his son to become involved in World War I. The description of the changing opinions and moods in Paris were fascinating. How many times have people thought a war would be over in a matter of weeks? The insight into pre World War I Germany was very educational. Many of the characteristics that I had assumed arose with the Nazis prior to WWII were clearly present much earlier.

And to buy the premise, you'd have to have a near-zero scientific IQ. Burning all the rocket fuel ever made wouldn't budge the earth, and even if it did, the Earth's rotation would mean the Rockets are pushing in a different direction as the day progresses.

It's below that! There are a couple of tracks that are not so bad (like 4) and some average tracks and a couple of terrible ones. The weirdest thing about this CD is actually the production. Like I said some of the songs are nice but most of them are either bad or have horrible, quirky beats. I can't believe Motown released this. I listened to samples of Shanice's 2005 CD and I didn't like that much either but it sounded better than this crap!

It started the trend going now of the 18-19 producers crammed on one album. She had too many on there and the album dragged as a result when I listened to it. I nearly fell to sleep in the middle. Some numbers sound too slow and slushy. I liked Turn Down the Lights. But that's the only strong song out of a stale album. I don't know why she didn't have just R. Kelly, Jam and Lewis and Babyface on this album instead of cramming 18-19 producers that gave her some bland songs, some dull material and songs that just don't match with her very great voice. She was excited about turning 21 for this album, but the album didn't sound like it to me. No wonder it bombed so badly. Her '91 album was much better than this and the '99 album was far more superior. This set the standard for some uneven-sounding R&B albums during the '90s.Disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Between Friends","review":"I have read Debbie Macomber books for years.

BUY THIS NOW.","review":"I can't say enough about this fabulous book. It's unique yet universal--the trials, tribulations and triumphs of two best friends through the years.

Honestly I zipped right through it quickly so that I could get it out of the way and get on to something better. I didn't like it at all. I grew tired of the unrealistic letter writing format early on. Plus, it is highly predictable, flat, lacked dialogue and content, and was filled with way too much drama. It is also filled with stereotypes. I also found it annoying how the author tried to tie in so many newsworthy events (pop culture, headlines, etc.) into the journals and letters. Too much like a soap opera for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I own this book on paperback and Kindle.

It is that the basic tool and meme for organization - the organization chart with structure, jobs and reporting lines - can not function in the new world of open innovation, process-driven organization, collaborative networks and roles in processes rather than jobs in structures.Verna Allee has a novel solution in her concept of Value Networks. It passes the conceptual test by offering a new idea of how value is created via intangibles, and the credibility test by providing real-life, very large scale examples.

I have 11 indoor cats and a husband who says he's allergic to cats. So I needed a good system. These 2 systems take care of my whole house.

What's the point of having a filter then?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what its supposed to","review":"I bought this because I was moving into a nice basement apartment and figured it would be good to get any potentially harmful particles out of the air. I had been looking for one that would cover the square footage that I have and this one was one of the few that could. I wasn't a fan of the price, but I was under the gun and a couple auctions on eBay didn't work out.I haven't had any issues since using this machine. It has been on constantly for about 3 weeks now (I typically keep it low when not home and medium when I am). It does blow cold air out which I don't particularly mind but some might. The apartment is super dusty and unless I have the purifier on high at all times, I know that'll just be something I deal with. I'm more concerned with any mold particles since I'm in a basement.Overall, I think this was a good purchase and hopefully it'll last me for a few years no matter where I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"filters DO NOT last 5 years","review":"I bought two of these units in November 2010. In July 2011 both units began to emit a strong chemical odor. I contacted customer support and was told that I needed to replace the filters. I explained that the cleaners were not even a year old and the representative said it could happen and that the 5 year life for the filters depended on how hard they had to work. I have my house cleaned every 2 weeks and dust is not a problem. I do have a cat (part of the reason for purchasing these) but only 1 cat, not several. I think it is also very suspicious that the filters began to \\"fail\\" at the very same time. These units are not cheap and neither are the filters. Having to replace the filters, even at a pro-rated discount is too costly. I ended up spending another $250 for 2 new filters after less than a year. Do not be fooled by the 5 year filter claim. It is false advertising as far as I am concerned. I will not be doing business with this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh air!","review":"I have only had this for a couple of weeks but the air seems really fresh and clean.

I am severely disappointed in its ability as an air purifier. We have 4 dogs and my home still smells like I have 4 dogs. The one thing this machine is great at, is its noise level. It makes a tremedous amount of noise. If that level was any indication of its ability to do the job, I'd have the cleanest air in the neighborhood. Definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM SUPPLIES4LESS","review":"We haven't had a chance to use the Purifier because the product was sent with a defective filter.

The air purifier would assist him to heal, and feel better. When I received the air purifier it was severely damaged. I could not use it. We were very disappointed. Luckily, I had also purchased another one. It arrived in perfect condition. Since we needed it so badly, for weeks we carried the one we have from floor to floor in our house.

After following the recommended procedure for running it the first time, I kept it running at its lowest setting for most of the 10 days. Day 10, I came home and I could immediately smell something burned out. Checked the unit and it was barely blowing anything and hot on top. Glad I wasn't away from it any longer.When it was working it seemed to do well enough. It was quiet on it's lowest setting. Any higher and it is far too loud to tolerate. I might buy again with the hope that I just got a bad one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to be working OK","review":"I have only had this unit for a couple weeks now, but it seems to be working as advertised. Put it in our finished basement and the slightly musky smell went away (noting we have a dehumidifier running as well). The only issue I have with the unit is that the exhaust fan is quite loud. I probably would opt for something quiter if I were to put this in my bedroom. Other than that, it is simple to use. A single switch turns it from off to low-medium-high. Came fully assembled and ready to run.Overall, it's what I was looking for - but a bit expensive (I know other highly rated units are more - but it isn't anything too high tech here)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Machine","review":"Purchased this unit from the merchant MoreQualityLessMoney and Fullfilled by Amazon. When we plugged in the unit, it emitted a foul odor that caused a pretty severe allergic reaction. Since the air purifier was supposed to clean the air and not make it unbreathable - this was not a desirable result. I am afraid that the unit's filter became tainted prior to shipment or was manufactured improperly. I cannot recommend this product and do not think I would be willing to gamble on getting a good unit. I think I'll write this off as a failed experiment.The only positive thing about this experience is the great customer service provided by Amazon.

I've not been disappointed yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Evil Looks Like From the Inside","review":"Although Shubin tries to distance readers from the crime by taking them through the story via the protagonist's cousin Colin, the author is so intent on showing the perpetrator's internal process that we are, in fact, catapulted into the very heart and soul of evil itself. So we undergo this chilling journey of obsessional worry, fear, and conscience to its ultimate conclusion with minimal buffer and explore the darkness of a single impulsive act all the more lucidly for that lack of detachment.

There is no \\"real violence\\". No twists, no turns, no robberies, no tough guys... Just one man conflicted about a possible murder told through the 3rd person.I ding it because it isn't tradiontal noir. It is a solid book, don't get me wrong.

One assumes their publication of a very bad novel by Stephen King was a deliberate mistake aimed directly at the bottom line. But there is no excuse for the Shubin book. There is no complexity, no twists, nothing going on beneath the surface, no surprises, no relationship of any kind with the traditional noir gestures. Anything suggestive of there being more going on than meets the eye, proves to be digressions that signify nothing. The characters are bland and unintersting and the plot almost nonexistent. A fifteen year old boy sexually abuses a twelve year old girl and then kills her. Fifteen years later he turns himself in and goes to prison. Big deal. If he had turned himself in at once, this book wouldn't exist, and we would all be better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable - a new low","review":"WHY doesn't Amazon.com let you rate a book Zero Stars?This disappointing effort is the worst of the Hard Case Crime series.

Short and sweet:This is a great figure, it looks like it should and the articulation is decent. It's not perfect but it's at least a bit more than the basics and at least this jedi padawan was in the movie. Kids should love this toy because it's a kid jedi, and what little Star Wars fan doesn't love pretending to be a jedi? Collectors should like this figure because it's pretty accurate, has no 'action feature', and it's a figure of a lesser character that we may not have otherwise gotten.Big downside is that it is a small figure but it's full price.

Not just a pouty country music singer, Yoakam has a sense of humor - and humor is what he uses to bring to light what goes on in his (somewhat twisted) mind.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in comparison to volume 1","review":"Having read volume 1 of this series and enjoyed it, I went ahead and purchased volumes 2-4. Unfortunately this is nothing like volume 1 because these stories seem entirely fabricated at worst or exceptionally embellished at best. Some are patently fantasy, others are fiction written by professional gay writers. A great example of the latter is Bingo (p.34) by Ryan Field. Not only are there common elements to another of his books, but the timeline makes no sense unless he started the relationship discussed when he was 7 years old. You'll also quickly notice that everybody is an expert at gay sex on their first run through.

Every true music lover has a copy of their \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD at least. They have put out more than 20 albums over the years, and largely these are the unheard albums. Thus, unfortunately, many of their gems have been overlooked. No-one (and I mean no-one) can sing a ballad or a rock anthem the way Naz can. These guys rock hard! I have seen them in concert many times and they have more pzazz than so called rockers half their age. It's a shame that they are not more recognized for the rock legends they truly are. Every time I listen to this godly album I wonder why people like Brittany Spears and Justin Timberlake are more famous that these guys. I guess it just shows what is wrong with music these days.Anyhow, do yourself a favour - pour a strong drink, light a candle and put on some tunes from these masters.

I would recommend them to you if the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful for anyone on the go","review":"I found the informaton in this book to be helpful for a low carb diet, but most of it is already covered in the low-carb diet book that got you started. The recipies are best for someone with a lot of time to shop for the specialized ingredients and then to prepare the meal. And if you're expecting that with 500 recipes there must be some winners (which I thought), you need to know that most of the recipes are merely variations on a single recipe. This may be helpful since each provides the actual carb counts, but I could have figured out the difference with any carb counting handbook.When I add in the value of my time, I found it more cost effective to purchase the prepared low-carb foods in my local health food store. When I cook, I stick to the simple recipes in the diet book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Low-Carb Cookbook","review":"This is the best low carb cookbook I've seen. I have about a dozen of them, deciding I'm in this way of eating for the long haul. The recipes are simple, yet good. The Greek Spinach was especially tasty served over baked chicken breasts. Nothing seems to take way-weird ingredients and most recipes are very easy to put together. I work full time and don't have a lot of time to fiddle around with gourmet faire. The 15-minute low-carb cookbook...a companion to this one is also a great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a MUST HAVE !!!!!","review":"EVERY Recipe we have tried has been INCREDIBLE! Recipes are very simple to read and understand with ingredients that are found in your local grocery store! I also got the 15 minute low carb book also written by Dana Carpender, also a must have!! the homemade Terriaki Sauce is fantastic, and I love the homemade salad dressings! How much easier can it get!! This has made our low carb lifestyle Much easier to stick with and gives us a great variety in food preparation vs.the same ole' eggs and bacon day after day!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"I have used all of the author's cookbooks to guide me in my quest for delicious low carb foods. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious, and surprisingly easy!","review":"i started the Curves low carb diet 2 weeks ago (and have lost a total of 10 pounds so far). Two shared secrets for success with this diet were planning and variety. This cookbook gives both! i am very pleased to have purchased it along with the book *Curves*. it makes not having the \\"old stand-bys\\" (high carb foods) much easier to live with than i thought it could be. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory Reading for the Low Carber!","review":"I have been on living low carb a long time. I have nearly every book Dana has written. I think if you are trying low carb or living low carb you should have her books. She's funny, she's encouraging and besides that, I haven't made a thing in the book that wasn't fabulous (how many cookbooks can you say that about?). If you are going low carb in life, take Dana's cookbooks with you. It will add interest and taste - afterall, serious low carbers know it's more than bacon and eggs - and what other diets allow such rich foods!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is awesome!!","review":"The recipes in this book are great. Most are very easy to make and they require ingredients that you usually have at home. My husband isn't low carbing but he says every recipie is even better than the last one. I definitely reccomend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative and often poor recipes","review":"I've made at least fifty of the recipes in Carpender's book, from main courses to desserts. All of them were very mediocre, and some were downright bad. I don't know if there were typos as far as the amount of ingredients goes, or if Carpender's taste buds have been ruined by eight years of low-carbing. Many concoctions simply needed to be thrown away, and I'm not a novice cook. I'm a very good cook, and perhaps that is the problem: I expect my food to taste good, and I'm willing to spend the time and effort to do it. Many of the recipes consisted of two ingredients, such as a meat and salt. That's not a recipe, that's a serving suggestion. If you want low-carb with flavor, I suggest one of George Stella's books, or even Donna Pliner Rodnitzky's books. These people are obviously good cooks and have many wonderful recipes to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best In Its Class","review":"Struggling to figure out how to keep to your low-carb diet but still enjoy food (plus feed your family)?This book is the one you need.Recipes like Pumpkin Cheesecake (great for breakfast with some bacon on the side, by the way), Vegetable Lasagna (tip: add some strips of zucchini cut longwise with a veggie peeler for faux lasagna noodles), and frittatas keep us feeling happy, full, and not deprived. My family has enjoyed many of these recipes (had to arm-wrestle my 16-year-old nephew for the cheesecake - I finally taught him to make it himself).Some of the recipes - particularly baked goods - may require some nonstandard ingredients. Most of these are available in health food stores, natural food stores, or, if all else fails, online.Dana has a breezy, enjoyable writing style that makes you feel like you're in the kitchen with your best friend, and none of the recipes are beyond the average cook.If you can only get one low-carb cookbook, this is the one to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cookbook lovers delight","review":"I have a lot of cookbooks...this is the first one that I have ever read cover to cover.

For the kitchen illiterate and time pressed low carb scholar like myself, or anyone who loves awesome food, Dana Carpender's book is a Godsend. Nevermind the fact that her recipes are easy, all natural, and ingenius: they are the best damn tasting concoctions I have ever had, so good I can't believe they came from my kitchen! The final test; My Soul food carbohydrate addict husband (who wouldn't touch a low carb diet with a 10 foot pole) has to loosen his belt every time I crack open the cookbook because he knows it's gauranteed to be stuff-your-face obsurdly delicious. Thanks Dana!! I'd either be withered away or overweight without you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of low carb without tasting like diet food!","review":"This is simply the best low carb cookbook out there! I like it so much that I bought a second copy for my mom, who is also low-carbing, because I wasn't willing to loan my copy out! Before I started on a low-carb way of life, I never cooked. Heating up a frozen pizza was about the extent of my cooking skills. With Dana's book, I get rave reviews from my husband (who is NOT low-carbing) on everything I make. My mom and I have so much fun cooking for family dinners - we made an entirely low-carb holiday meal last week using recipes from this book and everyone loved it! My personal favorite was the cauliflower kugel - I just finished the leftovers this morning, and now I have to make more because I CRAVE it! Dana has made the low-carb way of life fun - and I am deeply grateful for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I love the recipes.

Only problem is that you will have to shop at a health food store for some of the ingredients, but its worth it if you are doing the low carb thing. Unique low carb recipes that I haven't seen anywhere else. Even some faux baked goods like bread and muffins. So far, so good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enthusastically bought this book after reading the other reviews and I was very disappointed. Unlike most cookbooks, there isn't a single picture in this one, and it is printed on cheap paper. Many of the recipes call for expensive, speciality store ingredients. Perhaps if you make them again and again it becomes economical, but it turns out to be very expensive if you make it once and don't like it. I have used several of the recipes, but haven't found one that I would make a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, delish!","review":"I really love this book, it is making my new low-carb life a lot easier to handle. The recipes as so delicious and easy to follow, and I like the way she writes, she is very funny. I didn't give it 5 stars because I hate when cookbooks don't have any pictures and because I didn't really like the fact that she uses splenda to sweeten everything. I would recommend this book , the protein recipes are great and the vegetables recipes are great, so get this book! I also would say get her book on how she lost 40 lbs, that one is good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Low Carb","review":"Excellent Recipes if you want to go low carb and be healthy!!

I can't wait to try another new recipe!! Happy cooking!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit extreme","review":"This book is only for those willing to be pretty extreme in their diet changes - whey protein powders, coconut oil, almond flours, etc. I just don't see myself using many of these recipes on a daily basis unless I wanted to go extremely low carb."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"this is easy to follow, understanding that real world cooks are not chefs and don't have all day to make something.

I prefer not to use ketchup in recipes, Not a book I would recommend to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"No way is this book worth $20, or even $14. It's a mish-mosh of recipes quickly thrown together to cash in on the popularity of lo-carb diets. The author is interested in making a few bucks, not in presenting you with good recipes.Some of the recipes are so basic and low-brow that they reminded me of my first days of cooking as a college student. Others were complete disasters. One of the reasons I bought the book was that it has several recipes for lo-carb breads. I went out and bought all the expensive, hard-to find ingredients and made them carefully according to the recipes. Not one of them was even edible.I've bought a lot of cookbooks over the years, and still enjoy buying a new one, but I will never buy another cookbook from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity of recipes, not quality","review":"While I have found a few good recipes, such as Heroin Wings, it is obvious that the author threw in anything to reach the 500 recipe count of the title. There are many recipes that are cooking techniques, not a true recipe. For example, there are 25 recipes for omlettes/scrambles that can be summed up in one sentence: Try adding leftovers or classic combinations to an omlette or eggs (ie fajitas, mushroom scramble).For a well-written, professional cookbook with many great techniques and unique recipes, try The Low-Carb Cookbook by Fran McCullough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty impractical","review":"This book has a lot of impractical recipes that require specialized ingredients. I read some reviews that talk about no brainer recipes being in here and it was right....who really needs a recipe for how to make scrambled eggs?Not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book has really good recipes and it tells you how many carbs per serving, however it does not tell you how many calories. That is probably the only negative part about this book. The ingredients are very basic yet dishes come out very yummy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying","review":"Following a low carb diet often results in eating the same foods over and over again. This book has many recipes that I've tried and really enjoyed. Honestly, though, some recipes are pretty involved and call for ingredients that are not always readily available.Overall, it's a good recipe book and has some desserts to die for. Mmmmm. I just adore the pumpkin cheesecake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are the standards for Low Carb food this low?","review":"After all the great reviews I was expecting delicious results in the kitchen, but every recipe I tried was either bland and tasteless or downright nasty. I also found quite a few typos and it seemed like many of the recipes hadn't been tested at all, cook times were off and the proprtions of the ingredients in the recipes didn't work either. Just because we are on a \\"diet\\" doesn't mean we have to settle for second rate food! For a low carb cookbook from an actual skilled chef check out George Stella's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"tell me something I don't know","review":"I returned the book because I found it to be worthless in my kitchen. It might as well be titled \\"500 Recipes -- 450 of which you already know but I thought I would stick them in here anyhow\\". I didn't need a recipe for mayonaise or instructions on how to cook shrimp. Instructions on how to make a chef salad?!?!? A whole chapter on different things you can put in an omelet? This book just wasn't worth the money and wasn't worth the space it would take up on my shelf. I was looking for NEW ideas. It might be helpful for someone entering a kitchen for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A view from the other side of the aisle","review":"I'm not on a low-carb diet myself, but many of my friends (and frequent dinner guests) are. I picked up this book because one can only grill so many steaks and salmon fillets before one gets bored - I can only imagine what it'd be like if those were my only options every night!This book has been valuable for me. It's allowed some variety in what I cook for my friends and so far everything I've tried has turned out well. While I don't agree that mashed cauliflower is a perfect substitute for mashed potatoes, the recipe variations show that this is a pretty decent dish in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed!","review":"My only complaint about this book is that many recipes call for artificial sweetners, canned foods rather than fresh, and other un-natural additives such as whey protein powder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Information","review":"I was hoping this book could help with my preferred eating plan -- 1250 calories in a 40/30/30 mix of carbs, protein and fat.

Also, I'm not sure if this is a cultural issue because the author is from Indiana and I am from the South, but I found that the seasoning and taste of every recipe that I tried to be unappetizing. Her claims of liking things hot should not be believed. Because this book requires so much tinkering to get the flavors correct I can't even suggest it for someone who would benefit from directions on how to make omelets or deviled eggs. If you are looking to learn how to cook I say check out Mastering the Art of French Cooking. You will learn how to make eggs, sauces, meats and vegetables. I can also suggest George Stella's cookbooks for delicious low-carb cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This cookbook does have a ton of recipes, but without any pictures, much creativity or inspiration, it doesn't exactly make you want to cook or try most of them.

I wish the author would have used another ingredient.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, no calorie count?","review":"This book got great reviews so I thought I found the perfect cookbook. Not so.First thing I noticed is that there are no calorie counts with the recipes. So, for someone who is watching carbs AND calories, I now have to figure out the calories myself. Second, some of the recipes are basic and the author even admits to that. Some of the recipes look good but, come on, one recipe is for an omelet with 2 eggs and some cheese.

I didn't need a book to tell me how to fry up a few onions and mushrooms in butter and serve over the steak. To be fair there are some interesting things in this book and some I will try but it was not worth the money. I counted on all the good reviews i read here and folks you let me down this time. I did however get the other book I ordered and am happy to say that laurie's low carb receipes promises to be the best book i have ever gotten and all of the carb counts are truely low unlike this book which has counts as high as 13 or more. I am resistant and i must stay right around 15 to 20 per day to lose and keep it off. Dana's book limits what I can use for any one meal. If i had had a chance to leaf through this book first I would not have bought it and now that i have it I shall wrap it and give it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been named \\"Cooking for Dummies\\"","review":"IF you already know how to cook this book is an \\"insult\\" - it's so basic it's laughable. Plus most of the more \\"interesting\\" recipes can be found online at any of several low-carb web sites. I also found that there were editorial mistakes - like the temperature which to bake a cheescake was eliminated. And mistakes on the author's part in which she does not indicate the size pan to use - which DOES make a difference in the final outcome of any baked item. The author also uses ingredients that are HARD to come by in her recipes without giving substitutes.All in all I was quite disappointed! But in all fairness - it would be a good \\"starting\\" cookbook for those folks who are lacking in the culinary arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that good at all.","review":"Frankly, if you release a book that says \\"500 low carb recipes,\\" you expect something more creative than a series of obviously now-carb things (meat and salad? Mein gott!) and completely impossible-to-make recipes.I'm sorry, but I don't live somewhere where you can casually walk into a store and find yourself some vanilla whey protein/special protein mix that is required for 90% of the desserts in this book.Just get a real cookbook and substitute flour for soy flour/bake mix and sugar for splenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"There is only one reason I gave this book a 2 star review instead of 1 star. It is because of the intro section, where the author talks about a low carb diet. Overall, there are too many unappetizing recipes, such as the 'Hot Dog Scramble'. Yes, that's a hotdog with scrambled eggs on it....gross. sMost of the recipes have cheese, butter, or a lot of oil. She also likes to use Whey protein a lot. I figured that I could cut down on those things...then...The killer for me...the nail in the coffin....her use of SPLENDA. Why oh why do people use artificial sweeteners?!? I wish I had read more reviews, because I would't have purchased this book.Not all of the recipes sound bad, but for me, few sound good. If you're ok with artificial sweeteners and odd food combinations, then this book is for you. Otherwise, think twice about purchasing this book. It's really not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have yet to find a cookie recipe in this book which works!

This one has short ingredients lists so most of the recipes look more affordable to try. While I haven't actually cooked them, the question right now is \\"Would you ever cook from this book?\\" I'd say this IS the one I am going to start with.

Palance, who is perhaps one of the most over rated actors, delivers a ham handed rendition of Dracula. The look is all wrong, he would make a much better Frankenstein monster--without makeup. He does not exude the charm, the sophistication of Dracula as did Lee or Lugosi, but instead comes off as a semi-articulate thug in a poor version of evening dress. A couple of steals in this version from Return of Dracula and Horror of Dracula, but there's no blood to this vampire, just blah.

It's a good, fun, trashy version, and Jack Palance is excellent as Dracula (I don't understand the reviewers who complained about him). The busty vampire girls are quite memorable as well. The sets, blood, sexuality of this film are all excellent. And most unforgettable is the scenes when Dracula seduces his female victims. Great stuff, especially for teenage boys! I loved this movie when I was 10 years old, and I still love it. Dan Curtis did some great stuff back in the 1970s, and this film still holds up well. No, this is not a deep, super-intelligent version, but it's still well done, and well paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula","review":"I saw this some years ago on the television and I really taught Jack Palance captured the role very well. His features alone were very realistic. He plays the count very well the atmosphere and the whole Gothic thing came together for this one very well indeed. One very noticable thing in Palance role is the love with Mina and Lucy. I don't think any other version captured the love interest as well as this one. Palance vunerability came accross very much. The locations and the scenes were perfect and the encounter with Van Heilsen played by Sir Laurence Olivier in the graveyard was very scary indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatr for encouraging attention spans and memory","review":"If you think you'll get ill playing yet another game of Chuts and Ladders, Monopoly or Candyland, here's a pleasant change of pace - a game ADULTS and CHILDREN can enjoy. I absolutely love this game and so does my son because it is challenging for both of us. If your child has a hard time playing this game solo, it can be played in teams and the questions are just hard enough to keep kids on the ball without being too hard. It is also fast-paced and doesn't drag like so many games can. Best of all, it is good for children from 6 to 12 (and even older) so it will last for some time before the interest wears out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun all around","review":"My daughter gave this game to a friend as a birthday present, and they ended up playing it at the birthday party. We then picked up a copy for our children and they have been playing with their friends every since. Both my 10 year-old and my 6 year-old can play together, which is a relief. The youngest is given more time to look at the pictures on the cards, and the questions are easy to read and understand. The pictures themselves are very appealing to the kids, and the gameplay is simple to follow (the kids got the hang of it right away). I have played with the kids (under the &#65533;Parents version of the rules&#65533;) and the balance works well. There are too few games out there like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stare - A challenging and fun game for the whole family","review":"My younger sister and I helped to choose the cards for Stare! Junior Edition from the adult version. I am 10 years old and my sister is seven. We looked for cards that were colourful, not too detailed and that we thought would appeal to children. We love playing Stare because it challenges you to be observant, pay attention to details and tests your memory. The vocabulary is simple enough that my sister can read most of the questions on her own. It helps young kids learn colours, numbers and where things are in the picture. Example: in front of, beside, left and right etc. My whole family enjoys playing Stare together and we hope you and your family will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the old","review":"It was loads of fun.

It's good for memory for kids and adults and it is a quick game. My granddaughter also could read most of the cards on the back for the questions... though she'd ask a word now and then. I like the cards, too, old cartoons and Norman Rockwell paintings. I find I'm noticing things more after playing the game off and on for a few days. Enough cards and questions that it won't get \\"old\\" soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"I bought this game for my 5 year old grandson but the whole family had great fun playing this game. The rules of the game are simple but it was challenging enough that everyone had an equal chance to win. Even my father who is 87 liked playing and really enjoyed seeing his great-grandsons both win and lose while having lots of fun. I recommend this game for good family fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Game for the Whole Family","review":"I bought this game for my 4 year old nephew because it looked interesting and I thought it was a game that he could play with his mom and dad (since he couldn't read yet). Needless to say, he loved it. He just turned 6 and is still playing it! Other kids that come over really enjoy it too. The entire family loves it and we all play it when we get together. Not only is it a fun and challenging game, but it tests memory and attention to detail. Overall, a great game. And best of all, it is a game that the entire family can play together. I would highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I just bought this for my 7 year old son. We both think it is pretty boring. I think the game would be better, if the cards made some sort of \\"sense\\" but, they are very random pictures...a shoe floating above someone's head, etc.I gave it 3 stars for educational value, because there is some reading involved...yet, I doubt we will play it much. It just isn't fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs way down","review":"I bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts and was very disappointed.

It's excrutiatingly BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Out of Our Minds!!","review":"I bought this for an RV trip we just went on along with other games. We played this one night and it goes soooooooooo slow. You must wait for each person to finish, my daughter and son (14 and 10) were much better at it, husband and I (in our 30's) were stumped. It was very boring for the adults and kids. My husband was so bored and got cranky because of it, he went to bed. Thankfully we had other games that we enjoyed!!

Each song except for rust are hard to listen to for more than 30 seconds, because they are just power chords and screming, there is very little thought behind it, and it sounds like death metal, which was not what I was hoping for. Its not bad but for the black metal that we have heard from Darkthrone its a giant let down. Buy it only if u can listen to each song preview over and over again for 5+ minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"BM fans have always been accused of bad taste. It always seemed that BM albums required a minimal level of bad production and out-of-key-instruments in order to be considered as good.This isn't the case here. Production is much better than most Darkthrone's albums, and music itself is catching and very in tune.So, What's wrong with this record?Well...It's PUNK for crying out loud!As a BM fan myself I'm dissapointed to read the reviews below. \\"Black metal album of the year\\" one says, \\"Dark and evil\\" adds another. Guys? Are you OK? Have you actually listened to \\"Det Soarter No\\" or \\"Striving for a Piece of Lucifer\\"? No fellas, What I hear is Punk. Bad Punk. Blink 182 drums, Combined with Sex Pistols riffs, Performed by aging men that lost any musical talent. Crap.People, Darkthrone WERE a great group up to \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". But after that, like most bands, they just ran out of ideas. Do yourselves a favor and save your 15$ for something better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy, old school black metal done the Darkthrone way","review":"Darkthrone have been mining the same necro sound for their entire career, yet have managed to remain fresh despite the confines of a fairly narrow aesthetic. Hate Them is an aptly titled slab of brutal, simple riffs that call to mind Celtic Frost (of course), thrash metal and the energy of hardcore punk rock circa 1982. It's an angry, hateful and often grooving assault that delivers the bare bones essence of black metal. In other words there's no guitar solos, massive overdubs, operatic choruses or keyboards, just angry, hateful thrashing noise. The sound is big, lots of bass, distorted guitar, drums and Nocturno Culto's voice is mixed perfectly. While Fenriz may downplay his drumming ability, he plays with a lot of variety and more inportantly, feel. Hate Them is a monstrous wall of black noise and may be the heaviest, if not the best album by black metal's most enduring institution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impeccable service","review":"My purchases with Adorama went all very smooth, good products and excellent service even for the item I return.Cordially,Luis"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book.","review":"I grew up in the the Schenectady, N.Y., area and, along with my father used to watch \\"The Shoe\\" race at all the local tracks.

But, Defunkt were THE KINGS of the groove. Their live shows were INTENSE to absolutely COSMIC dimensions. Kinda like James Brown reincarnated as JAZZ. The funk guitar playing as well as the rock solid grooves and awesome horns left us drenched in sweat from dancing so hard everytime we saw them. I gotta lotta love for this band.

It is very hard to believe that the extremely strong-willed (and very maternal) Rowan would have shipped her older children off to be raised by their grandmother. It is also find unlikely that Damia's parents would so readily accept her relationship with a man old enough to be her father regardless of their friendship with said person. Basically an OK novel but not one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not hard-core SCI-FI","review":"I noticed the rather scathing review from Kirkus (above), and have note the complaints about plot, etc. I especially agree with the \\"token monster\\" comment one of the reviwers made. However, DAMIA should be understood as not so much hard-core sci-fi, but panders to a totally different market niche. It is very feel-good, and very enjoyable feel-good, by the way. It focuses very much on relationships, family, power and privilage. The FT&T universe is fun, even if improbable at this point in time (and I mean imprabable in the sci-fi sense - that is, mind power is not within the 'probable' spectrum that serious sci-fi writers pick from).

Damia falls into many misadventures, as any normal kid who could do stuff with her mind would, but matures into a brilliant young lady.\\"Damia\\" has everything a good Anne McCaffrey book has--suspense, drama, a beautiful heroine, and love.

Rather than just recount his research into Haring's life, author John Gruen has pieced together writings by Haring, the artist's friends, companions, mentors, and dealers. The narrative switches perspective quite often, resulting in a balanced and more revealing account of Haring's life and art, from different points of view. Among other things, Haring recounts his beginnings as a graffiti artist, his rivalry with the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and his coming to terms with being gay, and eventually, his contraction of AIDS. Profusely illustrated throughout, the book also gives an inside look at several aspects of the 80's art scene in New York city. By the end, the reader gains not only a thorough knowledge of Haring the artist, but more importantly, an understanding of the humanist philosophy and intent behind the art"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go for it.","review":"You have the grill so why not buy this. you know you want it.

For example, the last surge that came through the neighborhood was caused by a telephone pole being hit by a truck. When that happened, a 19,200 volt line hit the 2400 volt line that supplies our homes. I lost six surge protectors but no equipment.

But don't just take my word or the author's word. Examine it in the light of the Bible. And always ask God with sincerity to reveal the truth to you because He will reveal Himself to those who really seek Him but hides Himself from those who are casual enquirers merely.

It promotes the Truth in a \\"in your face mode\\". It does give Scipture references to all that is said inside. Not only does it use the Scriptures for references but it uses encyclopedia's, world history,books that you can get in any library to see for yourself ect... . It proved to me that everything has an origin from which it started. It showed me that the Truth has been twisted from its original form.

We kept demoting the 'know-it-all' in the group -- so thankfully, he never won a single game. A little unfair, but it certainly was fun making him work really hard to try and win the game. The questions in this game are all fair playing, meaning that they center around stuff people know, and the questions do not treat you like an idiot. They are challenging!

Even when you answer a trivia question correctly though, you don't necessarily advance forward, just another opportunity to roll. In fact, most of the time you might move forward one space just to fall back two spaces. It's very difficult to advance in this game which my group of friends found frustrating.

Nevertheless, Wit's End, if played with those who love knowing facts that may never come in handy, this game is the BEST. Seriously, this game is worth the money just to have those trivia cards for yourself to read every now and then because it's fun to learn those trivial lil facts!

I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"WIT'S END, WIT'S END, WIT'S END. I have been waiting for a game like this. I love trivia and fact based games, but feel there has been a great void in that area since the hey day of Trivial Pursuit. The game is not at all like Trivial Pursuit - It is better! Instead of straight questions, Wit's End has mind teasing categories. These categories use all types of facts - historical, geographical, biological, political or on a more popular level - sports, movies, famous people, etc. Also, there is an added twist - you can periodically promote or demote opponents or yourself, depending on if you provide the right (or wrong) answer. We, of course, kept demoting the person closest to the finish square. I definitely recommend WIT'S END - playing it is a great way to socialize with your friends and family and have great fun doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best trivia game yet - by far!!!!!","review":"I am a 30 year old professional who bought this game for a dinner party.

To begin with, there are so many types of questions (Brain Trivia, Teaser, Sequence, Odd1Out, Fill in the Blank, Two Out of Three, Matching Pairs - I could go on and on) that you are always on your toes. Just as impressive is the sheer range of knowledge and facts covered by the material. You always have options in front of you, so even if you don't know the answer right away you can always apply some deductive reasoning. Hats off to the makers of this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration stikes","review":"I played this game with 3 other people and had an awful time.

Now it is a handy dust collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"for loads of FUN, DO NOT get this game","review":"After spending about an hour playing this game, I was disappointed with it. The game was dry, boring, and simplistic- it was like sitting through a SAT review class, except the creators tried to make this fun. My advice would be not to buy this game, though if you want to learn about analogies, this may be the game for you. I'd recommend that you go and buy an SAT review book, draw a few squares on a board, and then subsequently play your own game. The Analogies don't make sense, the questions are all European history, and the other questions are plain... The questions aren't even hard; they are worded badly and try to stimulate the mind- it fails in all respects. I recommend this game to anyone who has nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon, and can not find another game to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"questions are too difficult","review":"We enjoy educational games but these questions are just too difficult making the game frustrating to play"},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"i learned a lesson after buying this game...REVIEWS ARE SO MISLEADING...a friend really wanted this game after he read the reviews for it...and man were we [upset]..this game is just loaded with SAT questions and pathetic trivia...it only took about 20 minutes to finish! do yourself a favor and spend your money on a more exciting game...like cranium for instance!!btw..out of the 6 people that played..only 1 liked it...need i say more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun","review":"Our family enjoys games, particularly puzzles and thinking games, so we were excited to try this one which has an intriguing premise. Unfortunately, it was too long, boring, frustrating and not fun. We had a set of 5 including teens who are all gifted, a PHD, and a MD; we consider ourselves good at games. Maybe we are not as smart as we think because we each answered only 2-10 questions correctly in the entire 2 hours of play. And, I don't mind being wrong if I am learning something or entertained by the witty questions, or pleasantly stunned by another player's knowledge of some minutiae, but I could not care less about many of the questions: which of the following was NOT an early 18th century writer? (the right answer was the one writer who was LATE 18th century--gotcha there!) Or how about knowing famous authors' first names? Boring! Inane!

I found it highly entertaining though. I do love jazz. But my kids (4 and 6) could not enjoy it. I wish that reviewers would check out what children think, instead of factoring in their own adult bias. There is nothing interesting in this book for a kid.

However, good performances come from Jeff Bridges, Karen Allen, and Charles Martin Smith. I realize that it's not simple to consistently act like a robot throughout the film, but Jeff Bridges does it and earns a deserving nomination. Starman is very much a hybrid between Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. with a lot of road traveling mixed in. It does get tiresome to see that everything has to happen in U.S.A. no matter what. Hello, there are other countries besides here where Starman could have landed in and perhaps have a better diplomatic experience. All in all, Starman is a good, powerful film to watch for the first time, but I don't think it holds up anymore after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Starman\\" is STAR QUALITY","review":"I SAW THIS MOVIE YEARS AGO.AND TRIED TO LOCATE IT FOR PURCHASE FOR YEARS, AND FINALLY FOUND AN OLD BEAT UP COPY OF IT AT THE FLEA MARKET, AND GLADLY PAID THE ASKING PRICE, NO QUESTIONS..THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE PART OF THIS MOVIE I DONT LOVE.

One of those movies you always remember seeing the first time and when seen again, you get that original feeling all over again. Starman (Jeff Bridges) was great integrating his alien persona with the DNA of Karen Allen's dead husband. His nomination for best actor 1984 was well deserved. Charles Martin Smith was just as good playing the role of a Gov't employed member of SETI--he quickly realized who the true enemy was--an over the top Government CIA/FBI/Special Agent etc. who was more interested in cutting up Bridges' character than welcoming him to our world---remember the gold disks message--welcome to planet earth!

He's a master of the 16:9 ratio and the scale plays a big part in his movies. Why this is in fullscreen is anyone's guess. And why it doesn't have the director's commentary--that's already available in Europe--is just weird. This is an odd movie for Carpenter but he pulled it off well...it's worth a serious look but it's also worth waiting for a release that retains widescreen so you can see ALL the movie and that contains the usually very informative commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wants full screen?","review":"I didn't pay close enough attention to the description because the version I bought was the awful full screen format, which is NOT what I wanted to watch.

I hate to start a movie, and not finish it, but it was a real effort to finish this one.I love 1970s movies though, the country is so uncrowded, and the cops are so lumbering.One of the stars is because I love the Barney-Fife / Gomer-Pyle attitude that Bridges uses.

Films that have $50 million in special effects, and no plot whatsoever drive me crazy. This film, though labeled as \\"science fiction,\\" is in fact more of a great love story. It is like E.T., because it involves an alien (Jeff Bridges, in one of his most incredible performances) being stranded on Earth. The alien takes human form and coerces a woman, Jenny (Karen Allen) into driving him to his final destination. If he does not get there in three days, he will die. Of course, they fall in love along the way, and of course, they are being chased by government agents. But what makes this sci-fi so different from the rest is that it concentrates less on dazzling special effects and more on the story between Starman and Jenny. What you end up with is a touching love story with one of the most bittersweet endings I've ever seen.

Post WW 2 found men like Sartre and Camus in great personal turmoil, at loss to understand the nature of man and the society he found himself living in. What I found in this book were cliches and a great deal of saccharine. Her longwinded descriptions of her love affair with Nelson Algren was terribly boring, and without literary merit. Oh does he love me; he doesn't love me; he does love me, etc. This goes on and on ad nauseum. What insipid nonsense. What it comes down to is this book lacks sou.

It's suitable for the entire family. Abhishek does a fabulous job. The ways in which he deflects the interest of his potential brides are clever and oh-so hilarious! I still laugh at his encounters every time I have a chance to replay this movie. It's also a story of love and Aishwarya's acting is wonderful (not one of her best, best though). There's a twist in the movie and it really shows how versatile these two actors can be. The two make a great pair.I also recommend movies such as \\"Dhaii Akshar Prem Ke,\\" which stars both of them. Superb acting by Aishwarya (& Ajay Devgan) can be found in \\"Dil De Chuke Sanaam.\\" Abhishek movies I also recommend are \\"Yuva\\" (superb all around cast & acting in this movie, but not suitable for children as there are violence and sexy scenes) and \\"Bunti Aur Babli\\" (another comedy in which there's an appearance by Aishwarya & stars Abhishek)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, horrible video quality","review":"This particular version of the movie is provided on a DVD-R disc, \\"Manufactured by Amazon.com., Lexington,KY\\" and the video compression is really horrible -- lots of compression artifacts, glitches, and skips.

This has a very slow burn pace that you have to surrender to (there are almost no shots with people at all) and just soak it in, I've watched it three times now and each time I notice something more.

Based on a real-life adventurer's autobiographical journals and enhanced by the grizzled Munzak's poignant portrayal of the title character, this story of unlikely friendship and the passing of a way of life has a subtle beauty and near-mythic power. As always, Kurosawa's versatile talents are on full display in \\"Uzala,\\" which won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1975."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for the whole family, or just by yourself.","review":"I really felt like I could connect with the characters in this movie about a Russian surveyor and his friendship with a Mongolian hunter turned guide.

This is my fourth time watching it. I just got this movie on dvd a few months ago. Decent transfer. I'm glad they did the transfer though. Not many people know of this movie. They rather do a transfer of \\"American Pie\\" than this movie! Overall, this is a great movie. One of Kurosawa's best! I rank this movie up there with \\"The Seven Samurai\\". It's a beautiful story with great characters, beautiful sceneries, and a touching ending. It's basically in my top ten movies of all time! If you haven't seen it, check it out, be patient and the reward will come. I think that's the key. With any good foreign movie, you have to give it \\"patience\\". Let the images go through you, transform you to another time and place. That's what you get when you watch poetry at work. It's a painting; all the colors and movements form to give you the whole picture. And this movie is like that. It moves you. I promise--you'll remember it for the rest of your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically miserable","review":"Let's make it clear from start : the movie is a pure masterpiece and will top rank in anyone vidéo collection. The point here is the DVD transfer which is a catastrophy. I am not a techno nut & am very tollerant when there is some quality problems here & there. But this DVD has to be a case on what can go wrong : the sound is scratchy at best, the colors are mostly saturated or are totally faded, the picture goes constantly out of focus, ... Things where so bad I checked my hardware with another DVD ! For the price this is a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blush, Kino","review":"Wonderful film, one of my top ten, but this is a terrible DVD. My videotape is MUCH better. Kino must have searched for the worst possible print to transfer; every flaw is preserved and magnified. A ridiculous, cheap, cynical, hack-job on a beautiful film. How did this happen, and why won't someone with a conscience do this film DVD justice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to correct some reviewers","review":"I hesitated to buy this movie due to criticisms on it's visual quality. I bought it anyway because it was Kurosawa. I'm glad I did. For the most part, the transfer was fine. There were scenes which appeared fogged, but that was because it was shot in fog and/or extreme cold conditions. The rest of the time I couldn't find what other reviewers were complaining about. An interesting study of two men from completely different backgrounds who grow to respect and love each other. My only negative comment is that I couldn't activate an added feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Lousy DVD","review":"Kino once again takes a great film and gives it the hatchet treatment. In fairness, I suppose that Kino puts out films that aren't likely to have the popular appeal (and price tags) of those issued by Criterion. But that's no excuse for taking non-anamorphic transfers of 'Scope films from lousy prints. At least they didn't put in hard subs this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"friendship","review":"Nature is grand in Dersu Uzala, but the monumental achievement of this Kurosawa classic is his deeply-moving portrait of a friendship. Two men, so different, each independent and self-sufficient, but forming through their shared adventures and love of the earth a bond of trust and affection that radiants the very splendour of being a human being. Changed circumstances hurry us towards mortality, but nothing can deny the transcendent truth of such a friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Hard to find interesting films that need little commentary.

It is great Movie and has some outstandings Tiger scences."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite, of all time.","review":"One of the best films - and best stories - about humankind's place in nature and the transcendence of human affection, ever.

It's been a steady influence in my life for more than 30 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Lousy DVD","review":"This is one of my favorite films, but my second return of the Kino DVD. Neither of them played correctly, especially in the last chapters. But it is also formatted poorly, with subtitles too large and partially overlapping the small letterbox image. The subtitles often cover important features of the story. I am not sure what to do now; is there another DVD version of this film that plays in the USA?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, terrible quality video!","review":"I purchased this video for my husband (one of his all-time favorite movies) and it was a terrible disappointment due to the exceedingly poor quality of the video itself. We were unable to watch it. It did not play well - squares of pixels were constantly cropping up and obscuring the picture almost to oblivion. Also, at times, the subtitles disappeared, and at others, there was no sound. We ended up turning it off halfway through.

I think I might have seen a handicam shakin out part of this movie, too, because the mood in this is supposed to be one thing but it turns to something different.I saw a review from someone that knew an actor from the local area and even they could find nothing to say except \\"I even knew one of the guys in it.\\" cold but deservedly a 1/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cool?","review":"Okay, not only have I seen this abomination, I know one of the actors in it. DO NOT waste your time on this unless you are trying to support the director. The fact that it is set in the hood is not enough reason to buy this disjointed and abysmal pice of drek. The storyline is choppy at best, and frankly, the whole movie is only a vehicle to promote the director and the lead actor who has pretentions of being funny. The best use for this DVD would be as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepin","review":"I watch a lot of independent movies and I take into account that many filmmakers do not have alot of money to totally make the film that they want, but creepin is a total disgrace. It is probably the worse independent movie I ever saw. It looked like they just turned on a video camera and did whatever came to mind. Some of the actors seemed to be funny but the movie is so poorly thrown together it is barely watchable. They should change the name of this movie from creepin to ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This is a great anime.

These thee movies were originally released around 1980, due to the success of the TV series, and they show just how outstanding the world of Gundam truly is. Sure, the animation is outdated, and there is no english dubbing, (whether that's good or bad is up to you) but these movies show Amuro's four months of combat through the later half of the One Year War. Many elements from the original series are missing, like many of the wierd Mobile Armors, no final duel between the Gundam and the Gyan, and the final scenes of movie 3 are missing some music. Overall, this set is not to be overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Beware, these DVD's are only in Japaese. I don't understand it and I don't read subtitles. Well I've been bitten by this I only hope others read this and avoid problems... at no stage was it indicated that it was in anything apart from Eglish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set - highly recommended","review":"Gundam, the original animation series ran more than 20 years ago in Japan. It was one of the pivotal works which pushed anime into a serious category in Japan. I am really surprised that it was never released in the US until now. Although the movie set is a condensed version of the 43 episode TV series, it still recaptures the story well. Although the animation itself may look somewhat dated to the modern viewer, the storyline and character development is superb. It is fairly serious science fiction and may not appeal to very young viewers. However, I thoroughly enjoyed being able to watch this movie again and so did my 12 year old son. I think this series is a must for any serious anime fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Copper\\" that rusts?","review":"I've had one of these for two years now and it deposits rusty water into my cistern.

In the past 3 weeks I have tried to contact the supplier twice to ask when I could expect the replacements. I received a generic email both times stating \\"it was an auto response and because of high volumes they we're unable to get back to me.\\" I received one of the emails a week ago and now again two days ago. All I've been left with is a superglued sword and a chipped back board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing service & an awesome item!","review":"I purchased this item yesterday as a gift for my husband. It arrived today, in perfect condition. The daggers are gorgeous, and he absolutely loves them! Excellent craftsmanship, and the detail on the dragons is to die for. The only issue we've had with it is that the mounting holes on the plaque are not even, so the daggers sit a bit lop-sided, but all in all, a great purchase for the price! We will be ordering from this seller again, and we'll recommend them to other collectors as well. Thank you for the excellent service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING BAND!!!","review":"Basically, overnight I have become one of the biggest DBC fans on the planet. I saw them perform on a local music spotlight show last night, and they blew me away. The DBC is definitely one of the best new bands I've heard in a long time.....definitely much better than the (stuff)I so often hear on MTV or the radio. Elaborate basslines, extraordinary d.j. work, and out-of-this-world vocals make The DBC a band you'll definitely want to keep your eye on. As soon as you can, run out and buy this album. You won't be dissapointed! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Simple Steps to Healthy Pets: The Holistic Animal Care LifeStyle","review":"I was under-whelmed and felt like I was reading an \\"info-commercial\\".

They were, however, terribly misinformed. While Charlotte Church is an amazing artist with a wonderful voice, she is not the same as the artist Charlotte. Charlotte is dance music/vocal house artist. She sang last year's huge hit Skin, and is a favorite on dance floors everywhere. This CD is a compilation of remixes by the world's most famous DJ, Junior Vasquez. On it he remixes two songs, Charlotte's Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and Kim English's Higher Things. The mixes cover everything from the shorter radio edits, to the extended club versions, and even hard beat mixes. Junior Vasquez remains one of the best remixers in the industry, and these mixes are among his best. If you are a fan of Charlotte Church, then this is not your type of CD, but if you are a fan of Junior's or of vocal house music, then this is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed!","review":"When I ordered this CD, I understood that it featured Charlotte Church. However, I find no trace whatsoever, on this CD of Charlotte Church's magnificent, spellbinding, clear voice. The credits on the cover refer only to \\"Charlotte\\" and \\"Kim English\\".

I was completely misinformed. I learned the rest in middle school. I didn't want to make that mistake with my kids. I rented this for my 10 year old daughter to help explain sex. She had been asking to know how babies were made. It's a great way to completely explain the process to a 10 year old. For the narrowminded reviewers, Your kids are going to hear all kinds of things about sex from school. I want to be there when they watch the video and begin to understand. When it's over, sit with your child and discuss your family's particular religious beliefs and answer any questions they have. Best video I've seen.

I also purchased one for myself, so that perhaps we might discuss it. In a word...just plain asinine. The travel adventures of the writer were absolutely void of common sense and/or intelligence. I give this book .5 of a grain of moon sand. Save your money, and travel with real class. Truthfully, the only humorous event was when Ayun had her knee realigned by a witch doctor.

ALL of them said it was hysterically funny, well-written and worth it. Since I was in the market for a funny read, I grabbed a copy for myself. When I saw that Steven Colbert had \\"endorsed\\" it, I bought it. I think Mr. Colbert's quote is something like, \\"I laughed hysterically reading this book.\\" Perhaps that was just the first part of a sentence taken out of context and the rest of the quote was, \\".... because she actually was paid for this dribble!\\" Really, it isn't funny, nor is it especially well written. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOGGIEPANTS! A mokey named Doggiepants!","review":"This book brought about my own memories with extreme low-budget travels in Asia and in the USA. I called up some old travelling companions, reminiced about our misadventures, and ended up spitting whatever we were drinking through our noses. Anyone who has travelled like this was will instantly bond with her in a way that regular tourists cannot even fathom. Everything from illnesses, to attacking animals, to lifelong friends, this book captures the world in a way that is lived and not just visited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of trouble from an experienced traveler...","review":"I'm not sure whether Ayun Halliday just traveled a lot so she's had many chances to get into so much travel (and most travelers do tend to get into trouble in foreign places), or whether she just has the knack of getting herself & her companions into trouble (whether through lack of sensitivity or just plain curiousness) - probably a little of both. Maybe it also has a lot to do with the fact that a lot of these trips were made on a very low budget, requiring her to improvise in stange places & strange situations.This book isn't for the faint hearted or the ultra conservative - Ms. Halliday speaks freely about drug use or bodily functions some people don't like hearing about in such frankness. But if you're willing to appreciate a good travel story combined with a good joke - this book is for you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbarge..","review":"Uninteresting personal soap opera on the road. Neurotic, easy city girl goes travelling. Yawn. The worse is her writing style. She has none. It's throw up on a page. No substance at all. You want to read some REAL travel adventures. Pick up Paul Bowles - a true writer. Save this book for the fire place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This book is not funny. It's the ramblings of a whiny, self-absorbed, ambitionless person, who thinks the grass (legal or otherwise) is always greener on the other side. Getting smacked around by someone in a red-light district is funny?! Descriptions of how blitzed-out one can get is interesting?! Carrying illegal drugs in foreign countries is, what, something we should all experience?! Motherhood didn't even open Ms. Halliday's eyes to responsibility - she thinks she should be able to take her baby into pubs and whines that taking care of her own child takes her away from doing what she really wants to do! Most disappointing is the fact that Stephen Colbert has a blurb on the cover. Stephen, admit it, you didn't actually read the book. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Substance","review":"In the world of travelogues which I love to read this book is about as lightweight as they come. Yes, there are some amusing passages, but nothing hysterical like some of the reviews would have you believe. I guess the writer has a lot fans, but I'm not one.I bought it because in my many visits to Japan one of my favorite things to do is visit the monkey parks. I thought there might be something about monkeys in Japan. No, nothing about Japan except I believe the author once changed planes in Narita. That's okay, there are some monkey hijinx in other parts of the world which are described. And a travel book doesn't have to be exclusively about monkeys for me to like it.All in all there are many better travel books out there including the Travelers' Tales books. I sort of doubt you'll see any of this author's writing in one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad the cover is so captivating","review":"I just finished the well written book, The Best Women's Travel Writing 2005, edited by Lucy McCauley which contained some wonderful travel writing, each written by a different well chosen author. Then I was presented No Touch Monkey. It, too, was chosen by the clever title and colorful cover, which promised that I would be laughing. This book is not funny or interesting (is being really dirty, sleeping on trains when you have no money, getting drunk at the Octoberfest, etc. funny and interesting?). Worse, it gives travel writing a bad name and might stop people from picking up a marvelous book, such as The Best Women's Travel Writing 2005. A bad book in a captivating cover is not a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that funny or entertaining...","review":"I really expected this to be gutbustingly funny, but it's not. Given that \\"travel lessons learned too late,\\" is included in the title, it is reasonable to assume that this is just misadventures, and it certainly is that. But the fact is, rather than coming across as something humourous, I just feel like Ayun Halliday is whining incessantly. This is partly due to the fact that she seems to get herself into trouble where just an ounce of common sense would have made things better...then again, that would have inevitably made this book nonexistent.That's not saying that there is nothing interesting or funny in this book. The monkey breaking into their residence in India was pretty funny, as was their misery in Romania. But other than that, I expected a lot more out of this. It just drags on, and on, with any bit of humour being sprinkled about like tiny grains of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible travel book...","review":"I got this book because the cover seemed kinda funny, and I like travel/adventure books. But all it reads as is one boring chapter after another of some immature girl travelling on the cheap; her travel tips seem to come solely from Rick Steves' books.She gives no insight on the places she's been. She tells us in a sentence she went to Dachau. Instead, she spins her yarn around her boyfriend's \\"assault\\" by an attendant in a men's room and the subsequent Happy Meal to cheer him up. If you want to hear about someone's adventure abroad, wouldn't you like to know what the place was like?Ayun makes a point of bad mouthing the foolish American tourist abroad but only shows herself as one of those she scorns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love travel essays but these are flat. They aren't so much travel stories - stories that make you laugh but also give you enough insight as to whether or not you'd like to put the place on your must-see list - as they are a journal about an odd woman who seems to revel in how cheap she is and how dirty she can get. If she loves the places she's been or the people she's met she doesn't show it. Stephen Colbert's endorsement was way off mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly American","review":"I'm a great fan of this sort of book but this one surprized me. Ms Halliday takes us on quite a journey throughout the world and focuses almost exclusively on her own discomforts--how poor she is, how high she is, how dirty she is, how sick she is, how unlucky she is to have male companions less game for \\"authentic\\" experiences than herself, then there is her bowel...I realized that I was reading a book by the proverbial ugly American. As such it is a chastening tale to us all, and worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I rather liked it","review":"Most of the negative reviews focus on the author's silly, naive, self-centered misadventures. But I seriously think this is the stated theme of the book. Maybe she doesn't come out and call herself \\"self-centered,\\" but I get the feeling she is aware of foolish missed opportunities here and there. She is certainly aware of mistakes born out of ignorance on her part.There are drug references, too, but not tons of them (don't go NEAR \\"Do Travel Writers Go to Hell\\" if drug stories bother you), and in almost every case she expresses some sort of regret over the experience--not guilty \\"drugs are evil\\" feelings, just the sense that she was an idiot.I read the book in two days, sitting in front of an electric fan during a heat wave. And I had a good time.It's a silly, frivolous bunch of stories, written in lightweight form. Take it or leave it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...not funny at all!","review":"I was very disappointed! I was hoping this book would be funny and entertaining, but it wasn't. It was either boring or stressful, but not funny! I couldn't finish it and ended up donating it to some random library I found while vacationing in Europe. Don't waste your money! Poor story-telling, and no humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Touch Book!","review":"This book is seriously annoying. The author comes across as a hyper hippie who just wants attention, is ignorant of pretty much all subjects such as geography (when she first hears of Surinam, she said the only Nam she'd ever heard of was Vietnam) and politics (she doesn't know why it might be dangerous to monitor political elections for a Southeast Asian military dictorship). The only thing she cares about is having a good time in the most \\"LOOK AT ME!\\" manner imaginable. She comes across as the kind of person who would keep interrupting other people to tell them her crazier/better/funnier story. She also comes across as the kind of person who can't be single for more than 15 seconds. And then it's a serious bummer for her when she's saddled with a kid and can't party like she used to. I am not too picky when it comes to train reading, but this was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grottier than thou travel","review":"To be fair, Halliday's writing is quite good. She does rather well describing her misadventures and traveller's mistakes throughout Asia. For all that, though, it was more than a bit much to read her grottier than thou stories of hasty and much overdue washups in bathroom stalls, numerous exhaustively described accounts of dysentery, and constant attempts to score dope in the Third World. Her praise of Brits on the dole travelling in Asia chafed a bit, as well. Halliday comes across as the nightmare travelling companion. As for the hilarity, I'll have to take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I saw someone reading this on the train. Great title, great cover, great idea.Poorly executed. I guess I expected something like \\"Dave Barry Travels Abroad,\\" but this book wasn't nearly as cuttingly clever as it thought it was. The vaginal references were embarrassing more than amusing, and a lot of the bathroom humor made me cringe more than laugh. It read more like a self-indulgent travel journal by someone's teenage kid trying to sound worldly and adult. It had some good bits, but not a book's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for conservatives","review":"Transporting me to places I would love to see, but perhaps aren't brave enough to travel to, I loved this book. I've always had the ambition to see the whole world, but finances and an inability to stay in less than modern accomadations have, needless to say, prevented me. Ayun's sharing of her mishaps & pleasures in going to these places have essentially fulfilled my need, and reassured me that I wouldn't enjoy the trips! I admire people who can be so carefree in their travels and so brave. I think any bad reviews are from people who likely enjoy the disney view of the world. Which is of course fine for them. I highly recommend this book to educated, free spririt types, and those who wish they could be (me)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about ME ME ME (and some about my travels)","review":"Most travel books focus on the places and maybe will include some personal experiences. This book reverses that.Rarely have I read any kind of book where the author is more self-absorbed and impressed with him/herself. I got SO tired of page after page of putting other people down while describing how cool she was. Worst of all were the constant put-downs of her boyfriend of the trip and how much more fun she would have alone. Then, when alone, she managed to have a lousy time as well.Overall, a simply annoying book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Like another reviewer, I have been a fan of Ayun's for years, and have even participated in some of the same online forums as her, so she and her family's antics are near and dear to me. I LOVED \\"The Big Rumpus\\" and recommeded it to quite a few people. This book, however, just aggravated me and made me want to throttle her. She painted herself as flakey, naive, and a nightmare to travel with. Add in the seemingly nonstop anecdotes about things going awry when they were inebriated (or looking to become so), and it just got really old really fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balzac rules","review":"This wholly engrossing masterpiece is as profound as it is entertaining.

WE had a hard time bathing baby when she was a new born. She could not be submerged in a tub since her umbilical cord was still attached. She HATED being sponge bathed. She would scream during the whole bath every time. When we finally got this tub, she just loved bath time. We put a little water in there, and made sure it didn't reach the cord. She loved being in there.On the down side I wish it was a bit deeper, and that the leg section wasn't so raised. Once baby was big enough to sit up, that's all she wanted to do, and bath time was not excluded. She wanted to sit up in the little tub, and I just felt she could just come right out on her own, so we had to move on to the big tub. She is still quite wobbly, so we had to get a tub seat for that. But I just wish that the tub would grow with baby a little, so we could use it a bit longer. Anyhow, we enjoyed it while it lasted, and we still use the duck in the big bathroom to hold her toys.

Fortunately, the latter tendency is largely absent on this album, their most consistent -- and most fully produced -- to date. Not every song bears repeating (particularly the more downbeat tracks later on the disc), but it offers a handful of hooks that will stick in your brain for weeks. The title track and the similar-sounding \\"Give Me Strength\\" will make any XTC fan cry ...\\"Hand on Heart\\" is a rollicking romp, and if \\"Right as Rain\\" isn't the catchiest song of the year, it's at least in the running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden","review":"A great album by a band that deserved much more attention than it got. Very tuneful, catchy, and clever. The title track is deceptively cheery, though has a wistful, bitterweet undertone. I don't like to compare bands, but you'll probably enjoy this group if you're into melodic rock, such as Squeeze, the Beatles, and even a little bit of Weezer thrown in. But they're definitely their own thing.

Same goes with putting the handset down on any counter etc. I wish I had not gotten this phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone design leaves much to be desired","review":"The design of the phone is at best a disaster. If you put the phone down anywhere on its back, you can't help but press the caller ID button. If you cradle the phone with your shoulder, you can't help but press the caller ID button.There is only one alarm available to set. In most clock radios, there is always two alarms, so when I need to get up at one time, I set it at night and when my wife needs it later in the AM, I need to remember to reset the alarm.All in all, the space savings of a clock radio and phone is helpful, but these drawbacks have me searching for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Grade Brain Teasers","review":"I teach 1st grade in Arkansas and I was expecting a book that would help my children with critical thinking skills.

You can also hear how American bands like Journey and Bon Jovi have influenced Shakra's style.Shakra is just a classy, melodic, \\"party rock\\" album, and was an impressive debut by a band that would only get better.

Dr. Howard has a program that might work for some patients, but is too permissive for others, including the weekend when the patient can eat what she pleases. The compulsive eater will probably undo all the good done in the first four and a half days with overeating in the last part of the week. Unlike some diets, his is not dangerous, but will probably not be effective long-term. His charts on body mass index and other information he supplies are accurate and well documented. He has an upbeat writing style and expresses himself well, but this book needs to be re-written and revised to make it one that can compete with other diet book authors. The present edition just doesn't quite have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"Owned this lamp for 4 months, used everyday, and it worked fine.

A man gets lost, and is helped by strangers, who are having a party, and telling stories. The stories are morality tales. The first story is about a boy who does something wrong and claims the consequences of his actions are not his fault. He joins with others like him to change his action from being thought of as wrong to being thought of as right. What is the significance of this story? How does one apply this story? Are there examples of this going on today? I wish the author would add a chapter to explain this. I would read that chapter, and skip the rest of the book.

He thinks the people are psychotics, and I admit I did too until the final chapter, which surprised me even more than the ending of The Sixth Sense. (Don't worry, I won't give it away!)

They cut the story down and redubbed it, changing the dynamics of the film. Instead of looking for a new strain of Anthrax, they're looking for Opium. So the urgency of the plot is gone. The new english is track horrible. This film is not the typical buffonery of Jackie's previous efforts, it's a little darker but the english makes an attempt at lightening the mood. They even cut a whole seen at the end! So it goes from a solid 108 minutes to a mere 86 minutes. See the original, it's much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun film, filmed in various countries, fun!","review":"The film is about Jackie Chan's character who is trying to find his father. He is told that his father is a man from Korea who is dying and appears to be a bad guy. Typical of Jackie Chan movies is the beautiful cop and an adventure that takes you from Hong Kong to Korea to Turkey. Also, you get an introduction to one of the most popular Asian actresses in the East, Vivian Tsu (Taiwan and Japanese pop singer/actress).This movie is way better than \\"Who Am I?\\" and the acting is much better as well.As for the movie, the audio is fantastic via DTS and the video is beautiful as well but unfortunately not anamorphic. As for special features, there is a pretty cool making of featurette but unfortunately it is not subtitled in English.Otherwise a solid movie for Jackie Chan and much better than \\"Rumble in the Bronx\\", \\"Who Am I?\\" and other movies of his that may be distributed internationally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad fan","review":"I am sad. I have seen TAS (the Hong Kong version) and it fully deserves the four stars. Great plot, very tense, exciting with some great drama as well. Wonderful unusual but exciting music, very Turkish in tone, with the closing song by HK singer Jacky Cheung. I highly recommend the HK version. But this one ... I think the US have done it again. It is 86 minutes, the HK version is about 108, so they have chopped it! The music? I don't dare imagine! Why is opium involved? The whole object of the story is the struggle by Jackie to get the \\"Anthrax II\\" away from the baddies and rescue the girl! Why do they keep chopping and changing Jackie's movies? It's a shame as a four star movie will probably be reduced to a 2 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Chan must be getting old","review":"This movie was soo boring. I now know that comments about the film on the cover are all lies. In Sweden it said; \\"Its so action packed it makes \\"Rush Hour\\" go in slowmotion\\". This was only for Chan to prove that he can make a movie creep slower than a frozen snail. He rarely fights, and when he does, he doesnt do any cool moves and he lacks speed. He doesnt do any dangerous stunts anymore and he is even using special effects to do some athletic scenes in his other movie \\"The Tuxedo\\". He himself said \\"I dont use special effect, I am the special effect\\" what about now? Hope he gets better with \\"Shanghai Knights\\".This ... wasnt even worth to rent. He doesnt even give many laughs these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Jackie's rare disappointments","review":"Jackie Chan plays a salesman who specialises in gym equipment. His life is turned upside down when he discovers his father was a Korean double agent who had made a deal with drug dealers to make super addictive opium. Chan is assigned the task of tracking down his father, who has since defected.ACCIDENTAL SPY is mainly lacking the slapstick humor and elaborate stuntwork that are Chan's hallmarks. The movies climactic stunt featuring a flaming oil tanker mildly rips off SPEED and LICENSE TO KILL. You'd expect more originality from Chan. The movies' final \\"twist\\" will only surprise those who haven't been paying attention, or possess the I.Q of a NZ Green Party member. This isn't one of Chan's best, but the out takes at the end are always fun to watch and ACCIDENTAL SPY is no exception. This went direct to video in NZ. It's not hard to see why.

In no way I want to dishonor the american veterans. But this is NOT the right platform to honor them. I believe there is not a single Travis song that can be seen in it's entirety. There are fade ins and fade outs on the songs and viewing handicaped vets balancing on one ski is not realy what I want to see when I buy a Travis Tritt DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video is absolutely great!!","review":"This video is very fascinating and entertaining.

Out of the box everything seemed fine but after 1 year and very little use (we get maybe 4 phonecalls a week) the battery is toast. It won't hold a charge for 1 day (with no use). Even more annoying is the answering machine. If people don't talk loud enough, the message plays with mumbling in the background (so you can't hear what on earth people are saying!)I would look elsewhere if you are considering this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Buttons","review":"I bought this phone as it had adequate features for what I need, along with a reasonable price tag. I was happy enough with the phone during the warrantee period (figures). Now, about a year and a half later, the touch pad keys are getting harder and harder to push. This is bad enough when trying to dial a phone number, but that much worse when I'm trying to use automatic phone services (such a refilling a prescription). I resent having to replace this item after such a short period. If I wanted a \\"disposable\\" phone I would have bought one.Another short-coming that was immediately apparent: The date-time setting needs to be reset every time the electricity is interrupted, even when the electricity just blinks out and is immediately restored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I bought this phone from wal mart last week, and got it set up and it was great. I was very happy with it, but now less than 5 days since I purchased it, it has stopped working. It all powers up but the phone wont communicate with the base. I can still receive messages on the base but the phone is useless. It powers up but turns off since their is no communication. To make matters worse, I already lost the receipt since I was very pleased when it all worked so I threw away the receipt and cannot return it now. So now I am out 40 bucks and I wasted a whole day just trying to decide which phone to get and then it dies a few days later. Maybe I should just get rid of my phone line altogether and stick to email. >:O"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello? Hello?","review":"After taking this phone out of the package I was immediately impressed. It was user friendly and a pretty major upgrade from what I was using before as the answering machine and caller ID were features I needed in one model. The answering machine has very poor sound quality, but I thought \\"Hey, who cares about the answering machine\\".Before I knew it I realized the phone did too. I changed channels, moved the base, walked around...but nothing helped. While you could turn the volume up, it sounded as if the person on the other end was holding a towel over the receiver. Not only that but when I talked there was a static echo. Sure I could get used to it, but it irritated me so much because my other cordless phone was clear as a bell....that I decided to take it back for a refund. The features were great, it's too bad the sound quality sucks. They should allow you to test models in the store before getting home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems","review":"I've had this phone for about a year now. There were a couple of problems right off the bat (not storing phone numbers of incoming calls & cumbersome deletion of caller ID information) but I could live with those. About nine months after buying it, I started having problems with the number keys. Now I have to press the buttons down so hard to get them to work that the phone is almost unusable. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Bought this and had it for about a week. The sound quality was very clear, but the problem was that I couldn't change the volume of the ringer. If I wasn't in my room I couldn't hear it ring anywhere else in the house.

(I found out later that it was finished after his death, so maybe that has something to do with it.) It would have been ok if one or two of the poems were written in this style (of transposing the letters as in the name of the book), but it's every single poem and it makes it hard to read and not funny or silly at all. I regret buying the book and wish I had purchased one of his older titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"This is the sneakiest book I ever read with my children.

My 7-year-old son checked the Runny Babbit book from the library, and we read it and loved it. We'd pause to figure out what the words \\"should be.\\" When he received money for his birthday, he wanted to buy a copy of the book. I made the mistake of suggesting he purchase the book that comes with the CD. THE CD IS AWFUL!!! The narrator sounds like he has a head cold and should have called in a sick day, but showed up at the studio anyway. There are only 12 poems on the CD, and it only runs about 10 minutes. (I know, that's like the joke about the restaurant that served lousy food, and such small servings!!! But it adds to the feeling of being completely ripped off by the CD.) It is not worth buying!!!

May be too much fun.","review":"Every Christmas I give my nieces and nephews a great book. So glad I found out about this one! Three of my five siblings called to tell me that their Christmas morning came to an abrupt halt when their children opened my gift to them--so engrossing and fun is this book. Since then, several of my nieces and nephews have picked up Runny Babbit talk and are delightedly confusing grandparents and other adults who are not \\"in the know.\\"As usual, Silverstein's poetry and illustrations are imaginative and charming. In my opinion, the poetry is perhaps not as enthralling as some selections in his other books, but still quite fun. If you're going to read it aloud (which I highly recommend) to the little ones, you may need a bit of practice first--after a few minutes, however, you'll pick it up easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Survey","review":"This is a great book for readers interested in a brief survey of Afghanistan's political history and foreign relations from ancient times to 9/11. Author Ewans, a retired British diplomat who served in Kabul, writes superbly, stays focused on issues that are important and interesting, and has a droll sense of the role played by stupidity in foreign affairs. The highlights are the chapters on Anglo-Afghan relations in the 19th century and the Soviet occupation and civil war in the 1980s and 1990s. Ewans does stumble in early chapters that reshash boring dynastic histories from the middle ages (hence my rating of four stars), but this is the only flaw in an otherwise excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"I highly recommend you do not buy this product because there is nothing but problems with it. I have had many problems with it such as NAPSTER which is horrible and sucks. Napster just doesnt want to do want I want it to do and transfering the songs has messed up many times.

Apparently this mp3 player can store 5,000 songs however once I got 250 songs on it, what happened was that if I upload an album the device will delete another album. What the f---?! Avoid this player at all costs and exercise your right 2 demand a refund! I sure did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is deceptive","review":"I received this product and followed the instructions for installation. Much to my surprise there was no way to make it function (even with my previously stored music) without connecting to Napster which is a premium service (with a free trial period).I think this product is fundamentally deceptive by not letting people know that you MUST be connected with Napster to make it work.If that isn't bad enough I could not get Napster to work on my computer probably because I use Firefox and refuse to use Internet Explorer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems...","review":"I bought this player in January, and have been able to use it less than 10 times. I have had to fix problems everytime I try to put new songs on. I have had to send it back twice--for the same problem! The second time Samsung said they would send me a new player--a week later I was sent my old one that they said they couldn't fix. Now when I call to find out what is going on, customer service says sorry, nothing we can do...be warned if you buy this player, you may not actually get to use it, nor is Samsung very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good player, but only plays Napster files","review":"I bought this because I have a large library of MP3s that I want to transfer to a device and listen to. I also wanted a lot of extra storage for other files. What I found was that this player only allows you to listen to MP3s that are downloaded from the Napster application. Even if your MP3s are burned from your own cd, you can't listen to them with this player UNLESS you burn them with the Napster CD ripper. This was not listed in any documentation, the salesperson at the store was not aware of it and the Samsung website does not mention this. I found this out because I called Samsung and they told me there was something wrong with Napster..I then called Napster who told me this.If you are looking to use Napster and store a lot of extra files, this player should be fine. If you are looking to listen to all the MP3s you have accumulated over the years, don't waste your time with this player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Player but Stay Away from Napster Software!","review":"For starters, if you want a player that stands out as a great alternative for the ipod, then this would probably be it. Having mentioned that, make sure you don't install the Napster Software! It screwed about 10GB of my music on the player, and I had to re-download it all over again. So as long as you stay away from napster your fine.I've used both Windows Media Player and Real Player to download my music and they worked fine, and hopefully Samsung will release a plug-in for iTunes like they did for other Samsung MP3 players.Again, I cannot stress the importance of not installing the Napster Software (a clear option on the setup page) if you want to use this player to play your entire CD collection and music downloads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this if you want to take it to the shop...","review":"I have had this since December. I agree the player is cool and has good features such as the ability to record from the radio but if it breakes down what is the point? I am now having to bring in my player for the SECOND time for servicing. Not a big deal unless you want to wait a whole month for the process and if you don't have all of your music backed up... My suggestion, go with something that has been proven to work that also has good features, not this player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung has more features, better price than overated IPod","review":"It says it all in the title: fm tuner, line in / voice recording, recording directly from radio, etc. This has many of the features that the IPod is lacking. I picked one of these up last week from Office Depot for $99 after mail in rebate. What a steal! Plus it comes with a case, line in plug, cradle charger, and more.***Do not use the Napster software. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Stick with Windows Media Player 10. Use the sync option. Very easy and very fast transfering WMAs. It seemed to take a little while to transfer some of my mp3s. It said it had to convert the files. When you rip the files off your cds, transfer them to WMA files.Besides that, this player is great.

Not just another history of the \\"supporting roles\\" of women during the war. This book goes far beyond the stock portrayals of WWII women to take you into their private thoughts and fears. There are pilots, war photographers, disc jockeys, spies, soldiers, members of congress -- so many women who stepped up and took part in the war, often in spite of great opposition. (And it doesn't shy away from telling about a few women who were not so noble during the war either.)I had never seen the women of WWII placed in this light -- as equal partners in fighting and winning. This book will make you want to know more about your own mother, your aunts, and your grandmothers. (Hopefully you still have a chance to discuss this book with them!) It should be read by every son, daughter, grandson and granddaughter of the Greatest Generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"from homemakers to movie stars....","review":"Very informative book on the roles that American women took on during WWII.

It predates Agriccola's De Re Metallica by several years, and has not yet made the bridge of thought from alchemy into chemistry. As a result, the section on fireworks speaks of principles of air and such to explain how they work.Additionally, many of the usages are different than we think of them today. For example, in the production of Aqua Fortis (nitric acid), one of the steps involves the use of red alum. After 10 years of research, I finally figured out that this referred to alunite, a mineral alum found in a certain mine in Italy which contained a high level of iron.Given the difficulty in interpreting what is being said, it is still an invaluable book to researchers in the field. It contains valuable information about the thought and processes in use in Italian metallurgy in the 16th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the very best music by Otis Grand","review":"I've following this guitar man since the mid-1980's, when I first saw him playing live (doing an uncanny slow blues à la BB King as NOBODY else, by the way), and from then on I've been waiting to find some of that blues magic (no just masterful guitar playing: magic) on almost every recording of him. Well, here it is -to my ears- the cream of the top: the best recording by this blues master probably. The singer, the band, the program and the guests (Joe Louis Walker) are all great, but Otis is nothing sort of simply SUPERB.If you can preview it somewhere, you just GOT to do it.

The leap to fantasy (angels, angel dust, etc.) I could make, but unrealistic details I could not overlook.Where is there a high-security prison in which an inmate is able to converse with a young boy standing outside the fence? At one point the boy even touches the inmate's shoe!! And this child has apparently arrived at the prison on foot. I don't know about the rest of you, but the high-security prisons I'm aware of aren't in quite such friendly neighborhoods.I was also bothered by Rice repeatedly casting the Stanley Cup finals in May. I don't follow hockey but I know I'm still hearing news about the game in June.These inconsistencies create such a feeling of unease that it's impossible to accept the \\"truth\\" of the rest of the story. Very disappointing. Surely the last of hers that I will try."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"This was one of the few books I had to put down in the middle of reading it. I just couldn't stand to waste another minute of my time. The inconsistency is ridiculous and makes believing the story impossible. Who would allow owls to come into a bridal planning establishment which houses very expensive gowns? The main character was as limp as a boneless chicken. I love hockey which is what drew me to this book, but this guy scored so many goals it was like reading about a video game, not a hockey game. By the way, soapbox derby cars don't have engines. Check your facts. I read Cloud Nine and should have known better to buy this book. I gave mine away and almost included a warning letter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper","review":"This is the first time I've read anything by LuAnne Rice, but it definitely will not be my last.I'm inspired by the way she draws the reader into the lives of these characters and you suddenly find yourself wrapped up in their emotions as if they were your own. I'm eager to see if she is consistent with her style and technique. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book, but... SPOILER","review":"This was my first book by this author. I really thought it could have been interesting, but it just ended up boring. The main character, May, seems so indecisive. Kind of a doormat, really. You never really get to know her at all. The story of how these two meet and fall in love is just too unbelievable. I mean they barely had a conversation, and next thing they were getting married. (A wedding that excludes almost every important person in the bride's life, for some reason.) I was kind of bothered by Martin, every time he gets mad at someone, he just stomps off. And I never got why May keeps nagging him about his father. I ended up skipping to the end of the book just to get it over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Write What You Know!","review":"Having read a few of Ms. Rice's other novels, I was looking forward to this one, not the least because it was partly set in a part of Canada that I know very well.The story itself was not up to Ms. Rice's usual standards: the plot seemed contrived and the characters lacked credibility. More irritating, however, was the author's shoddy research. Ms. Rice's descriptions of hockey games were laughable, and her descriptions of the setting were downright ludicrous. Ms. Rice should stick to writing about topics she knows and understands, or make sure she is writing about fictitious places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you Serious?","review":"I can't believe all the readers who find this an amazing read or get up early to finish reading this book! Yes, I stuck it out and finished the book, but to think this was one of the best books to read,YIKES. You really need to read a lot more if this is one of the best. It is sappy, boring, predictable and totally unbelievable. Yeah right, owls in a bridal shop. A hockey player who is so \\"in love\\", with a character like May. Really? Only in a silly story like this. Sorry, I just don't buy it. I'd rather read Cinderella again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wait for it to be over","review":"I probably have a chapter left to go and i can't wait for this book to be over. I get no pleasure out of the the main characters, I wouldn't want them as friends and I really wish they had more of a sense of humor. I don't get why Martin and May got together in the first place and why they felt they had to get married a few weeks after meeting. I couldn't find anything they had in common. I'm irritated by May's constant harping about Martin's father when it's absolutely clear Martin has good reasons for feeling the way he does.Spoiler -- Martin comes home late at night after a bruising hockey game and a three-hour drive to be with May and the first thing she does is talk about reconciling with his estranged father. When he says he needs to rest, she doggedly pursues the topic. What? What kind of spouse does that? I don't blame him for leaving either. In fact, I wish he'd never come back and then the book would be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Done","review":"If you are thinking of reading this book my advise would be, DON'T.

Customer service 800 numbers are backed up, representatives based i India or who knows where and offer very limited help if any, most likely they will send you to a Sears or RadioShack store. Yes this is a discontinued model but not that old and this lack of support raises concern for the current line of products from Thompson, GE and RCA - once they become discontinued are they to be junked? I know one thing - I won't take chances and stay clear of this manufacturer's line of products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice model, but annoying call on hold beeps","review":"IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE HOLD FEATURE OFTEN, RUN AWAY!!

While the phone works fine the problem is that eventually the phone, not the handset, cannot hear the person speaking into the handset. It seems to be related to the hang up button that's pushed down by the earpiece when you hang up. All the other features continue to work fine. You can hear the caller calling in but they cannot hear you. We switched a handset that we know works with the phone(s) in question and the problem persists. So now we have 2 of the 10 original phones left. I called GE and they said they couldn't do anything for me but I that I could go buy new ones.

The wall-wart is as big as the base of the phone. REALLY stupid, idiotic design. Also, the one I bought was defective in that it would not ring. Worked to call out, but no indication of incoming calls. Took it back. My dad's example works.Handset is also large and not comfortable to hold - sharp edges.

It is inconsistent in many places, none of the examples (what few there are) flow together in a consistent manner. Many topics are barely touched on, with no real detail and many with no examples that make sense. I have never reviewed a book before, but felt compelled to do so in this case. This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with a book.

Now you might say, thats the point, but wrong, because the questions that your left with are, \\"what is he talking about?\\" \\"how does that follow from that?\\"there are so many inconsistencies, obvious editing tricks, and simple non-sequirtors in this film that even a 4th grader could see it was closer to fiction than the truth.

But in fact it is, but not for the reasons M.M. would like it to be. Weaving a thread of personal bias through the documentary format is more corrupt than any elected politician could ever get away with. I was also upset by the fact that he used a bate and switch tactic in that he used the publicity of the Columbine tradgedy as a spring board for his real agenda, gun control. Removing the pumphandle from the well will not stop the spread cholera nor will gun control remove the spread the violent use of guns. The problem is still in the ground.The fact that M.M. received an academy award for this effort is even more distressing in that people are more impressed by entertainment than the honest and credible evaluation of social issues challenging American culture.For a more credible evaluation of the Columbine tradgedy see psychologist Elliot Aronsen's book \\"Nobody Left to Hate.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Done in the Best Possible Humor, Documentary Masterpiece!","review":"The Littleton tragedy affected me deeply and I thank Michael Moore for exploring it in such a thoughtful way.

His leaps and claims at times were irresponsible and downright wrong. That said, Columbine here is actually very good. It's funny, sober, and quite thought-provoking (sometimes all at once). For folks who bash this film, they're probably either 1) folks who've never seen it, or 2) folks who are so rigidly conservative they can't even see that there is a fairer, more middle ground on many issues out there, including gun control.

He is arrogant enough to think we will all just fall for it. Sadly, many people will (and obviously have) without taking the time to seek out the truth and form their own well-founded opinions instead of blindly accepting the position of some slimy (and all too successful) con artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it was more 'real'.","review":"*** Yeah, yeah yah, I've heard about many of the accusations against this film. I don't want to hear it anymore. I don't want to hear about...-- the missles referred to in the film were for commercial use not military.-- the Heston speech was spliced together from two different speeches, making him look like he's saying something different.-- the bank sequence is staged.-- the statistics about China's gun record are true, but that's because China is a police state.-- Canada isn't really that good of a place to live.-- France is socialist.I've heard it all before. I don't care. This was an entertaining movie. I don't go to the movies to learn 'facts' I go to be entertained, and that's what this movie does. Don't confuse me with 'truth' vs. 'error'.

Gun control is the reason crime in England and all other countries that have used it is up a 100%. If you want to read a book of FACTS read John Lotts: More Guns Less Crime or Wayne LaPierre's Guns, Crime and Freedom. It's all FACT and will stand up to any and all tests from anyone.

He is entertaining now and then, but beyond his ability to make a clown out of himself, and those he interviews he has no merrit. He never makes a firm statement, only allusions. He never approaches anyone in a straightfoward matter, but elbows his way into conversation with them and then cross examines them in a no-win fashion.

What was the whole point of him going to missile manufacturer? How's that revelant to the debate? Was it cool to pick on a guy who is suffering from Alzheimers? Heston may be the figure head of an organisation that is odious to the far left wing, but he is still a human being and deserves some respect and compassion.I belive Moore is just using his position to get rich!

Every bit of the way through this movie I found myself arguing with the TV and disproving, on my limited knowledge of the situations in question, almost every comment he made. Further while he comes off as very convincing, many should notice that he never really comes to a point, he is merely preaching to hear himself talk.

He makes points that which are very trageic and disturbing, but has no real tact in making them only showing what happened and how it occured. He pretty much slanders america, prey on the unwittingness of others, and has a very vague meaning.

But then he tells you only poverty kills people. But then he tells you guns are not bad at all. But then he tells you President Bush kills people. This was no doubt a very racist film, Moore completely stereotypes all races. The \\"American History\\" segment should have been called \\"Anti-American History\\", and the final seen with Mr. Heston was a joke.

More time should've been spent on the \\"whys\\" of Columbine, and not on the blame game.Not a fan of Moore's politics, but I thought I would give it a chance - big mistake.

Nothing!How does 11,000 gun-related deaths per year (I won't even check the figures) suddenly become 11,000 murders? What about self-defense situations, accidents, suicides?

He started out with an axe to grind and when the facts did not line up with his preconceptions, he simply made things up. I do not recommend buying it, but should you actually watch it, just notice how the clips are broken up. Then notice that the speaker is dressed one way at the beginning, and another after the break. Pieces are spliced together to portray something that never actually happened. Actually, Minus 5 would be an appropriate rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-see Documentary","review":"Leave it to Michael Moore to take a tragedy like Columbine and use it for a documental that's informative, provocative, illuminating and, surprisingly, funny. Moore, an NRA member, doesn't offer easy answers, but asks hard questions and that alone makes Bowling for Columbine a very good film.I always assumed that the big difference between the US and other countries --where furious kids and disgruntled employees don't go on killing rampages--is gun control, but Moore shows that Canada also has a huge amount of guns and people there simply don't go crazy and start shooting one another. I wish he'd delved deeper into this matter (Are the Canadian arms mainly hunting rifles? Is there a difference in the kind of weapons that explain this difference in the amounts of murders?) and into his own NRA membership, but these small flaws aside, I highly recommend seeing Bowling for Columbine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of FRESH air!","review":"This is the movie that really got me into Michael Moore documentaries. Their humor and drama fits perfectly together and its easy to see why Moore is so popular now. Good job Oscar!In this particular film, Moore targets the Columbine episode and how easy it is to get guns in America. He even shows that a person could get a gun by simply opening a bank account. Of course, Moores points always hit right on the nail and are very affective. Just like all of Moores film, this one will make you think.One more thing; Do these people who ignore Moore in his docs realize thats just what he wants. Haha.

Michael Moore's \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" is a fantastic doumentary-type film which opened my eyes on how [bad we really are](in the U.S.). I enjoyed the film a lot! I loved watching Michael walk into a bank to open a CD account and walk out with a rifle! Even better, the relatives of The Oaklahoma City Bomber are made a fool of, but not as badly as was Charlton Heston. What a fantastic interview! This is a greatly entertaining and enlightening film.

The site is filled with petty arguements that make me feel more inclined to believe Moore and his rendition of the story, than whoever it is was who spent, obviously, a lot of time to attack the film. Most people who watch documentaries understand that the filmmaker's bias will influence his or her work. The themes brought up in the movie, no matter if the cartoon is humorously inaccurrate or the Lockheed Martin plant's missles aren't used only for military purposes, ect., are thought provoking and possibly valid. The amount of gun violence in this country is definately out of propotion with the rest of the western world. Why? Moore might not have the definitive answer, but at least he had the guts (and the money) to ask question and attempt to answer them."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're Stupid, You'll Like This","review":"THIS ONLY GETS MORONS THINKING. First of all, Michael Moore only gives half truths in his statistics. The sources he used were varied and some of the numbers (i.e. gun murders in the United States)were just flat out wrong (unlike Mr. Moore, I checked my sources). He also cuts and pastes things out of their original context. For example, the political rally in that Charlton Heston was attending was months after the shooting not 48 hours after. And oddly enough, Michael Moore was in the same area in a political rally himself at the same time Heston was. The cartoon on the lies about the NRA was not made by the makers of South Park, but he really did do a good job in making you think it was. The cartoon was also riddled with innacuracy. This is propaganda that would make Joseph Goebbels look like Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"This film is complete liberal Propaganda. Moore twists the true, and edits the film to only show you the dark side of gun ownership in America. He never mentions the thousands of lives saved each year by armed cictizens. And when he gives the number of deaths related to firearms, he fails to tell you that more than 50% of them are suicides, not accidental shootings of children and murderous rages by sadistic youth. He only focuses on the problem and not the solution. This film protrays The NRA and the most evil orginization in the country and trys to make a connection to them with ever death by gun in the movie. The movie industy has lost all credibility in my mind, after giving moore documetory awards for a propganda film."},{"rating":"1","title":"how about bowling for incest?","review":"What is Mr. Moore's infatuation with incest? In this movie there were gay themes, incest, hookers, etc. But it's called bowling for columbine. What's the deal? Sure he hated Bill Clinton but from what I saw in the movie, he had people telling little cigar inuedos everywhere. And I didn't see one single bowling alley in the picture. This movie is a joke.

If you read about how Moore conducted his research and how Moore manipulated the facts and truth for his end you will find that his rendition of the truth does not add up. Just look at his comments from the awards. Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion-that is what makes America great.

Comparing the actual numbers of gun deaths in the U.S. to those in other countries--countries that are merely a percentage the size and population of the U.S. (as opposed to using a per capita or percentage based number so it would actually mean something). Hello again?! Honestly, it was far more entertaining than I thought it would be and not nearly as inflamatory.

In the end the film was way too long and the film contradicted itself more times than it didn't. Moore gives no answer to certain problems that the U.S. has, but instead many - and they all contradict each other. He seems to take every chance he has to put down the U.S. and exagerates the problems that it has. I would say that this film is also anti-American, but constructive criticism has always been a very American thing to do. However, this criticism is not constructive but instead somewhat nutty. Moore seems to enjoy hearing himself talk. I think he has more personal problems than the U.S. has as a country.

I thought he deserved it. Moore raises the big question but doesn't answer it: Swiss and Canadians have guns and hunt (so do Norwegians), Canadians are about as big gun nuts as US citizens, but Swiss and Canadinas don't kill each other (and Norway has extremely low crime), so why not? What is it that makes so many Americans trigger happy and violent? For a possible answer, see George Lakoff's \\"Moral Politics\\", which traces the 50/50 religious/secular split in America to two different prevailing sets of family values. And, surprise, surprise, it's not the secular people who are promote violence, it's the religious ones, the same group that gave us the Iraq war of aggression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and un truthful","review":"bottom line, the bank he got the gun from doesnt actually have guns on site.

There were some humorous moments, but there's only about 1 or 2 of them. The movie gets rather old after about 15 mins. His information is fraught with misunderstandings, misinformation, and misdirections leading to an overall cornicopia of ignorance. He harasses numerous people including KMart and Charleston Heston in a sad attempt to be profound. He acts as if those people perpetrated the crime themselves and should be held responsible, when in actuality they had the most minor of roles to play if any at all. Overall this movie (definitely not a documentry) lacks any direction or specific purpose and is just this man's atttempt to badmouth the United States with inaccurate information.

At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create.Lying about being a member of the NRA to get an appointment in order to play \\"tricks\\" on Charlton Heston in an attempt to humiliate one of America's best actors is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a \\"noble cause\\".A more balanced and objective approach with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore, more successful. The ultimate goal is good, but the method used is not necessarily the correct one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a documentary","review":"A serious documentary should not express the film maker's opinion like this one does. This is the worst movie ever. Michael Moore should just move to his beloved Canada and not in the 2 million dollar apt at the Dakota where ironically John Lennon was killed by a GUN, and stop milking the city of Flint and America's problems. He is part of the problem he presents. He has shamelessly edited parts of the interviews to present his points of view.

It's no secret that Moore has an agenda, whether you agree with the message of not. If you'd like to educate yourself on facts, or at least be able to address actual factual information, I strongly recommend ' More Guns Less Crime', by John Lott. He has compiled 20 years worth of statistical data from every county in the United States concerning gun related crime, as opposed to Moore's exploitation of one sad day of our history, and a series of out of context quotes by NRA members, compiled not to enhance facts, but rather to ensite hatred.If you want drum-beating, liberal sensationalism, watch Moore.

The entire segment with Heston is one big edit job. Heston a racist? The man marched with MLK. Moore's European figures on gun shot victims are much lower then the actual figures. He skips over the European countries that require that their citizens have guns, yet have much lower crime rates. Some how he thinks that comparing a country with a minority population of 12-13 percent, is equal to a country that is over 30 percent minority. He gives no per capa figures, which is all that really matters anyway. He completely ignores the fact that the safest states in America to live are the ones with the least minorities, and most laxed gun laws. He presents this little boy who was very violent, had already stabbed one child before the shooting, and has since stabbed another as the victim of loose gun laws. Pass on this movie.

He paints the picture that he wants to paint... which is completely biased... The interviews he conducts are all very well planned with the complete intention to try and make the viewer agree with his opinions... The representatives he chooses for his opposition are ignorant and extreme... He takes conversations, events, etc... and very nicely pieces them all together in his own context...

With the lessons of 9-11, we should all be aware that at any moment, the United State could be embroiled in turmoil so great, you and I may not be able to fathom all the implecations.

By debunking myths held so dearly by fear-filled Americans, and by revealing many layers of hypocrisy, greed, and fear, he pushes the viewer into a state of internal shock. Who am I afraid of?

In his attempt to denigrate America he lies about everything from the year that the KKK was founded to the text on a B-52 memorial at the Air Force Academy to the sattelite launch vehicles built in Littleton. It is very telling that he can not make his case based on facts, and is forced to resort to fiction while claiming it to be a documentary.

I must say before the film I was \\"on the fence\\" when it came to the subject of gun control. I could see that both sides made valid points. However, after watching this film, I am in total support of gun control. Wow! You know you have watched an amazing film when it is able to affect the way you think, especially on such a divisive issue as this. Michael Moore deserved the Oscar! What an incredible film! Bravo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowling For Columbine","review":"Without a doubt, go see or rent this DVD. Then take some time to find the truth! Trust me, it won't take long. This is NOT a documentary! Docs are real life and fact filled accounts of a particular subject matter. This film, 90% of it, is nothing but inaccurate story telling from someone lost in the fog of the unknown. The fiction starts as soon as he goes in the bank! Michael Moore is a disgrace to the film industry. I was shocked when he was given the Academy Award. I was taught that the Academy has rules that a documentary has to be truthful and not have any fiction. Maybe they lowered the standards for Mr. Moore.See this DVD and then study the facts to learn the truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It took my breath away","review":"An amazing movie. It shook me to the core. I had always known that past American governments had made wrong decisions, but this made my head buzz. Michael Moore is amazing, and I think this movie should have won Best Picture. (Loved the characterization of Canada!) I was vaguely aware of Kayla Rolland's murder (I remember reading about it on a plane to Mexico when I was eight) , but I had never known about the way those on welfare were treated in Michigan. Yes, some facts may have been left out, but it didn't damage the quality of the movie. I have re-evaluated my values. I want to be an activist (anti-gun, anti-war, anti-violence) when I grow up. Michael Moore has re-proven to the world that guns are big problems. I was not brainwashed or corrupted by this movie, you gun nuts who hate Michael Moore. This movie was great, and I don't care what maniacs think! This is my favorite movie. Hats off to Michael Moore!Rachael"},{"rating":"1","title":"alarmist drivel","review":"guns save millions of lives every year around the world. the unfortunate actions of mad men should not deter us from the enormous benefits that gun ownership serves. a 90 pound woman with a gun and a 250 pound man with a gun are equals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Propiganda","review":"This is just a bunch of liberal propiganda comeing from an anti american socialist nut.

Funny? Yes. Demeaning? Yes again.Moore makes numerous valid points throughout his film. But, too often, for my taste, he does it by ridiculing someone. He does it politely, but not without meanness. And that is why I was uncomfortable with watching the film. And that is why I am rating this film low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Micheal Moore hits the spot with this documentary. He uses his astute film making abilities to produce a documentary that is both humorous and entertaining whilst seriously addressing the issue of violet gun crime in America.Being from the UK, i found it greatly refreashing to watch a documentry by an American who has the guts to stand up and tell the American people that America is not the great country that it is percieved to be.'Bowling For Columbine' raises question and presents opinions that will have you thinking for days after you watch this movie.

Unfortunately, he is also an implicit liar. His movies are presented as documentaries; that is, documenting facts. This one, at least, is nothing but distortion after bias after distortion. It has been thoroughly debunked by others already, so there's no need for me to go into the errata (for those curious, a quick search for \\"Bowling for Columbine debunked\\" will reveal some very well-researched treatises).If you're looking for entertainment, Moore delivers in spades.

As a documentary, zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"I am not a fan of Michael Moore based on my brief experiences with his beliefs and rhetoric. In addition, while I don't affiliate myself with a particular party, I am \\"right of center\\" in poltical-speak.Having said that, EVERYONE should see this film. If you get beyond the pro-gun anti-gun arguments and rhetoric, you get to the crux of this film: Why is America full of people that are SO afraid?This film offers some opinions, but obviously can't provide a concrete answer. However, that's the power of this film. Maybe after viewing this film, Americans will look a little deeper at ourselves, society, media, and our beliefs and ask ourselves what we're afraid of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Documentary NOT.","review":"I enjoyed this film. It was at times very funny. It is NOT a \\"documentary\\" however.

Mr. Moore clearly had an agenda when he contemplated making this movie and continued with that agenda throughout. The out of context quotes, spliced together bits of tape and film of Heston and others, along with obvious bias, show that this movie was nothing more than Moore grinding his political axe.Was it entertaining? No. Was it educational? No. Was it thought provoking? No.Since Michael Moore is the darling of the liberal establishment, this movie has had some popularity with his peers, though none at the box office prior to the Oscars, and not very much since. I certainly hope no one has to actually pay and money to see this. You get more value from buying bubblegum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left or Right, this is a dishonest movie.","review":"This movie is one lie after another. Mr. Moore is constantly taking people way out of context. He'll compare statistics that do not use the same criteria, to make a more compelling argument. If you are opposed to his viewpoints, you should not buy this video as you will be financially supporting someone who is comfortable with lying to make his case. If you are in favor of Mr. Moore's viewpoints, you still should not purchase this DVD as surely you can find someone who agrees with you and is able to make the case without lying perpetually.

He takes things out of context and splices much of this film together to make it appear that people are saying things they didnt say.What appalls me the most is the way he ambushes Charleton Heston with things that arent true. Heston is obviously not at his best and in the early stages of Alzheimers. His lack of recall is show as a way to depict him and all 2nd ammendment supporters as uncaring and callous. It would have been much fairer to everyone if he had been able to give that same interview 5 or 10 years earlier. Taking advantage of old people is just sad and I find Moore to be a sad individual indeed.Dont waste your money, you wont be getting any facts from this.

Of course gun control is a liberal policy, which as we all know, \\"liberal policies when implemented generate the exact opposite of their stated intent!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Frustrating to Watch","review":"I just saw this movie recently, and found it frustrating to watch because so many of Moore's conclusions are transparent. He has a tendency to ask a completely pejorative question in an interview, and then cut to a new scene without letting his subject answer. He focuses most of the first half of the movie on Lockheed Martin, a defense contracting company in Colorado, and I don't see the connection between Lockheed and guns in schools. This movie requires critical analysis on the part of the viewer, because Moore's strategy seems to be to throw every argument (no matter how farfetched) at the viewer and see what sticks."},{"rating":"1","title":"michael moore shoots himself in the foot","review":"as usual, michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours. theres alot of great stuff here (the interview w marilyn manson, the interview w trey parker, &c), but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling, no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston. i agree with many, nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moore deceives the audience over and over...","review":"David T Hardy deconstructs most of his movie on his web site.Read it and think about it.

Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!). The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable. Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him? I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying. The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael! And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank. Bravo to those who figured that out. Also, Michael Moore is fat.

The NRA is ultimately blamed, but the significance of this connection is marginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left-wing propaganda","review":"As a propagandist, Moore performs quite adequately but, I suspect, only when he is preaching to the committed Left. However, his treatment of the aged Charlton Heston is disgraceful and devious.A self-serving journalist and undeserving of praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book by its cover...","review":"Everyone knows that Michael Moore writes great films, often referred to as documentaries. They are very entertaining, heartfelt, and very well-crafted. Mr. Moore is a film-maker; as such has the ability to edit and stage various moments to create a semblance of outrageous patriotic fervor. The true documentary film-makers tell things as they are. Mr.Moore tells things as he thinks they ought to be. There's no doubt that his heart is in his subject. That's the problem. It's always subjective. This is NOT documentary film-making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Work More Balanced Than Usual Moore","review":"Liberal or Conservative. you are sure to find something interesting in this intriguing investigation into the disproportionate handgun murder rate in the United States. Despite the topic, it is funny and entertaining. Yes Michael Moore can be heavy handed and he cannot resist going to K-Mart corporate headquarters to return a bullet still lodged in the victim's body. But this time the corporation did Michael one better and announced to all the gathered media that they would stop selling ammunition in their stores.(They did not sell guns at the time)This documentary explores all the common ideas about handgun ownership, crime, and murder in this country and worldwide and comes to some new and interesting conclusions. See it and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is kinda funny!","review":"I just got done reading through the reviews, and I love reading through them, because you find that these people did not pay attention to the film after the first hour of the movie. If they would have they would have noticed that Michael Moore did not blame the guns for the amount of murders in the US today; he blamed it more on Americans paranoia, and the liberal news media. He seemed to point out that while Canada has a lot of guns, they have around 100 murders a year. (Kinda interesting to point out that in Toronto he talks to a police officer who remembers 1 murder in the past decade, and that was commited by a man from Detroit.)This is an excellent film, and I'd recomment it to everyone. (And to you gun nuts out there, the NRA should not have gone to Flint and Denver within days af the shootings there. That's just flat out ignorant.) Watch, and even if you are an NRA member, you might change your mind after seeing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the stuff no one else is talking about","review":"Did Mr. Moore have an agenda when he filmed this movie? Yes, absolutely. Do George Bush, Ted Turner, and Rush have agendas too? Yes, absolutely.This movie approaches the issue of violence in America from an open and honest perspective. Mr. Moore makes his motivations clear, but still leaves it open to your own interpretations.The power of this movie comes from the examination of lots of things that are often ignored - e.g. how easy it is to get a gun, some of the bad things our country has done in the world, and how media uses fear to sell.If you don't like Mr. Moore, you need to watch this movie. If you are concerned about violence in our schools and country, you need to watch this movie. If you are concerned about the way our country behaves in the world, you need to watch this movie.You don't have to agree with everything that is in this movie, but you DO have to think about the issues that are presented here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and thought provoking","review":"I can't think of another film I've seen that moved me as deeply as Bowling for Columbine. If you're upset with Michael Moore because of his comments at the Oscars, get over it and watch this movie. You will think deeply about the state our nation is in, and how we got there. As a former Colorado resident, the scenes about Columbine High School made me cry. As a teacher, the story of the Flint, MI girl who was shot and killed by her young classmate moved me beyond belief. I can't praise Michael Moore enough for creating this documentary. All Americans need to watch it with an open mind...and then think about where we are at, and what needs to be done to protect all of us as well as our children. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may not like the guy, but this movie will open your eyes","review":"There are many reviews giving this movie a bad rating becuase Moore is a \\"anti\\" American and is trying to bring the government down.

When i first saw this movie i was shocked at some of the numbers given in the movie and i did research those numbers becuase i couldnt believe that they could be true, but sadly enough they are. Many of the reviews are probably just giving this movie a bad rating becuase of Moore's Oscar Speech, which is wrong. This movie was good enough to win an OSCAR!!! That tells you how good this movie really is.P.S. there is Bowling in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny at all","review":"The kindest thing I can say about this particular movie is that it suffers from a lack of the truth. It attempts to blame everyone from the Lockheed Corporation to the NRA for the sudden upswing in school violence over the years, and it fails rather miserably. The editing is done in such a way that the true message of some who appeared in it (like Charlton Heston, for example) is completely twisted around. Overall, I'd say save your money and get this from your local library. If you've spent the money, then get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Documentary???!!!","review":"While this film might have some value if marketed as the op-ed piece it is, presenting it as a documentary is just as misleading as many of the bits of misinformation that the director presents as facts. Even during the filming of the piece Michael Moore misled some of the movie's participants, then showed their \\"opinions\\" out of context and contrary to their true feelings. There is plenty of this kind of deception on the networks, why bother renting/buying it when it's the same drivel you can get for free every evening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political opportunism","review":"Moore uses the tragedy of Columbine to promote himself and his extreme political views.

Whites committed murder at about one eighth that rate, or 5.1 murders for every 100,000 whites. The murder rate for American whites was therefore lower than that of Britain or Italy, despite the wide availability in America of firewms.Robbery rates were similar. In 1992, the black rate was 1,343 per 100,000, while the white rate was 126. The figure for American whites, though higher than that of any European country, is not strikingly higher than the rate of 90.4 for France."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be retitled \\"HOLES\\"","review":"Moore manipulates events, quotes, and down right lies.

Through use of editing (leaving out the parts that disagree with his view) and the presentation of \\"skewed timeframes\\" (the Heston speech was made more than 5 months later) Moore presents a case that makes people see what he wants and not what is really there. To call this a documentary is a bit of a stretch and for it to win an Oscar under best documentary was very disappointing. Please when coming out of the movie, find some facts for yourself and make up your own mind. Shame on you Mr. Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was great until...","review":"It was pointed out to me how innaccurate it was. I used to walk around quoting the movie to all of my gun friendly friends, hoping it would help them see how needless guns really are. While I still agree with that message, I am growing more and more disappointed with his willingness to alter the truth to fit his agenda. I want the truth, whether it fit my point of view or not, and nothing deflated me more than learning how much he stretched the truth in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than Lies","review":"It's deliberately misleading, cunningly edited to misrepresent the facts, full of falsehoods, misinformation and insults. I don't think that anyone who owns guns does so out of fear of rampaging minorities, that the NRA and the KKK are connected, that Charlton Heston and the NRA went to Colorado to taunt the victim's families, that Moore walked into a bank and walked out with a free gun, etc. etc. And that's just off the top of my head. One definite factual error (i.e. blatant lie): I know for a fact that an American can't just walk into a Walmart in Canada and buy all the ammunition he wants. Moore's work is more Leni Riefenstahl than Ken Burns or Errol Morris. Unfortunately you can't convince the True Believers who think his films have any credibility whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"total nonsense","review":"highly edited piece of total nonsense by a radical left wing canadian who hates the usa yet still finds the time and energy to make a ton of money by criticizing it ... this review applies to all of his movies . i hope that if he does get sick he gets his care in his beloved cuba ....good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and the Lying Liar who tells them.","review":"I don't know what is more insulting about this film, Moore's insultingly apparent political bias or his general disrespect for the value of truth in documentary film making.

A good percentage of the events in this movie are verifiably false and taken out of context in an attempt to damage the cases of Moore's targets.

About 50% of murders in America are committed by blacks even though they make only about 12% of the total population. Murder rate among blacks is 7-8 times higher than among whites. Michael Moore did not include this troublesome information in his movie and in my opinion such an omission disqualifies it as a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowling for Fiction","review":"This \\"documentary\\" isn't a documentary.

My opinion remained unchanged from the start to finish. Michael Moore attempts to capitalize on a combination of one of the most unfortunate incidents in US history and an age-old opposition by a portion of the population to guns. Anybody can do what Michael Moore did in this documentary, accuse the NRA for the shootings in America. Come on Michael...anybody with any level of insight understands there is much more to the problem. Even my gun-fearing activist friends were embarrased at his cheap tactics and his simplistic view of the subject. Narrow-minded anti-gun activists...buy the film.

He distorts facts to suit his politics. It's commonly known as propaganda.It is ironic that he had a show called The Awful Truth because that is what Michael presents,not the whole truth.Michael's distorted version of truth is indeed awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching Between the Lines","review":"Yes at certain parts in the movie the arguments were obviously one-sided but I would argue that the only way to counter act hundreds of years of injustice in a 2 hour film is to have to skew some parts of the story.

No attempt to really put things into perspective (except his own, very slanted one) and certainly ignores facts.Moore is a gun-control advocate. Like all such people, he ignores that Murder, assault, etc. are all illegal NOW. So making more laws would do what? Make them MORE illegal?Don't fund Moore. Let the DVD collect dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking for a GUN CONTROL movie, keep looking","review":"Rather interesting fact: most single-star reviews seem to think movie is about GUN CONTROL -- it's not! This film is largely about the sensationalist news media and how they are no longer bothering to report the news. It also explores violence and hate in America.Lots of people complain about the treatment Heston receives but he agreed to be interviewed (no one held a GUN to his head) and he probably could have used the legal system to keep his interview out of the film (interesting side note: his bout with Alzheimers was announced the same week as the film was released in US theaters).So if you want to believe that Michael Moore is after your GUNS and that KILLER BEES are about to attack, don't buy, rent or watch this movie. (BTW, it's worth mentioning I first heard of this anti-Bowling for Columbine slant from my red-neck boss, who claimed his wife rented it but they shut if off because of the \\"all the BS\\" -- thanks for the tip, Frank!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Truth","review":"\\"Bowling for Columbine,\\" is the most important movie completely of 2002. It sets out the voice of the common person. Rarely does any film, newspaper, or magazine do this. Furthermore it sets out to expose true facts that are frightening to a lot of people because the media never shows the entire story. Good job Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lying For An Oscar","review":"Michael Moore is a disgrace to the left-wing society, much like George W. Bush is a disgrace to the right-wing society. \\"Bowling For Columbine\\" is a film that if it is taken seriously, the results are just laughable. The Columbine shootings weren't based on gun control, and the attackers didn't get their weapons legally either. Moore is just contradicting the second amendment and placing the blame on the firearms business. This isn't a documentary, it's a deceptive, biased, and opinionated hack job of a movie that Moore is shoving right into our faces. Weapons aren't a problem, humanity and lack of responsibility is the problem.Somebody give Moore a laxative, because he's so full of [sh]it when it comes to his \\"documentaries\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Inaccurate","review":"Moore has a unique ability to skew the truth to paint the picture he wants the world to see. He makes no sound arguments. All of his data is misleading and not correct. The biggest problem here is the misconception that Gun Control is Crime Control. If you research any of his facts with Federal Government's statistics on Gun related crime you will find huge disparities. In the U.S. the states with the highest crime rates are those who also have the toughest Gun Control laws. This movie might be good entertainment, but it is NOT a documentary for it relies on absolutely NO facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"socialist scum","review":"this is no documentary, no is anything but self-indulgent film spewing his leftist thinking. anyone who enjoyed this film has to be a liberal. this fat pinko should go back to canada. this getting an oscar was an outrage. we need to revert to the black list more than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowling For Laughs","review":"The problem with this film is that it is not a documentary. It is a pseudodocumentary so full of staged elements that an Academy Award for this goofy film is an insult to those who have won the award through legitimate effort. If you buy this film be advised that the \\"real\\" elements included are subjected to severe editing, twisting things to advance the view of the director. A case of \\"we don't report, so you can't decide\\". Unless you're just in it for the laughs, run screaming from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a documentary?","review":"I watched it with alot of anticipation, but what I got from this was a poorly done homemovie, edited to slant his argument directly to one side, I was looking ofr an objective debate, but I got a man who took delight in harrassing a person suffering from Alzheimers.I feel a little unclean after watching this movie, and would hope to save you from the same feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant social commentary...","review":"I believe the reviewer from NZ missed the message behind this film. The main message is not about guns at all, Moore is trying to show that the cause behind a lot of what's wrong with the US is the 'culture of fear'. He just uses the events at Columbine and Oklahoma City as a stage to illustrate his argument. This message is best conveyed during the interesting clip with Marylin Manson.The film is thoroughly amusing, and dismally frightening at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"www.bowlingfortruth.com","review":"I watched the video, it was funny but some things did not seem right.

If I want to know about a subject I rather read. But Moore masterpiece it's different; you sit down 2 hours, you don't move and second by second it gets more and more interesting. It's real art, and at same time it looks at the root of the all problems in USA. If you are a human being that cares, has feelings, wants to know what is happening in USA and appreciates art, go and see it, I promise you will love it. But if you think you have elected a President to think for you and decide for you it's better you go and watch Joe Millionaire. Moore's work may disturb your piece of mind and make you think (God forbidden)."},{"rating":"1","title":"He lost me early in the movie","review":"It took me a long time to get enough curiosity to even watch it the first time. If this \\"documentary\\" is Michael Moore's view of the world, then he needs therapy.He seems to only see the most negative aspects of people, and tries to prove his points with a form of analysis that completely evades me.Explain again how K-Mart was responsible for a couple of kids going on a murder spree? I guess that my family should go after Coors and Shell Oil if I get killed by a drunk driver. The drunk driver should not be held responsible for his actions, because Shell put gas in his car and Coors put alcohol in his blood...damn those evil corporations.He completely lost me with the references to Marilyn Manson, bowling, rocket motors and the NRA.

One is the idea of the countercultural writer or punk poet. He is both of these, to an extent, but nothing like exclusively. If he borrows weight from any quarter it's in that he's gay and tackling the very established, even passe form of the pychological novel (see that blurb about Austen on the jacket). Anyone who knows Genet, though, will see the influence straight away - a writer besotted with the erotic and mythopoeic property of words, while staying far from any traditional level of erudition that could be used to boost his reputation or advance an idea of his 'level'. He is, in fact, a perfect modern incarnation of (or caterer to) Baudelaire's 'hypocrite lecteur'. He's 1% artist, and his books are 1% art, but don't underestimate that fraction's potency. Writes from the heart like no-one i know."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite one!","review":"This is by far my favorite book from Mr. Cooper.

So I agree with the reviewers that think this novel is an easy reading.I give Heart of a Dog four stars just becuase I can't avoid comparing it to The Master and Margarita. Compared to Bulgakov's masterwork, The heart of a Dog is just an exellently written divertimento."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much lost in translation, so to speak","review":"Love dogs. Love Russian history. Love the idea of a book written from perspective of a dog with an eye on a pivotal point in Russian history. That's what this book is! Didn't love this book. The first part's a bit compelling for the very reasons I'd hoped it would be. Then, it dives into a tedious metaphor about communism and humanity that is a bit gross and dull. Probably seemed radical in its day. Now, just odd and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have liked France","review":"Bulgakov's quibble with the Soviet authorities seems not to be that they have come to realise that the lower classes are ghastly, but that they ever supposed they could be anything else.

Wells' books, and though this one is not in the same genre that I'm used to, I really loved it. It's sad and brilliant and sometimes hilarious. The message is deep and timely. Even though it's about a different war, the sentiment is still the same. What war does to the psyches of individuals and nations does not change. It unites us for a time only to eventually leave us feeling dirty. H.G. Wells shows us this process works in this excellent book.

Alex soon discovers Paul's father, Nikolei Vladmir Drevin, has plans other than luxury for his Ark Angel space hotel.

At 8, my son reads well (5th - 6th grade levels), but this book is still a little above him in its density and concepts for purely independent reading.

The book 'Girlbomb' begins with her escape, and the author takes us on a New York odyssey of bad sex, drugs, petit larceny, violence... all the 'good stuff' anyone could want from a memoir about street life.

For anyone looking for first-hand insight on what its like to be a homeless addict, I recommend this book.

Nothing seems to be as good as this book, so that if you have the chance to find one, do not hesitate to buy it (I have been looking for it in U.S., Hong Kong and in Panama -where I found it in 1997). It records memories until age seven, including vital data regarding different aspects of the development of your child, which I find really important if any reference in the future is needed.

Now that is rich, hold on while I clear my nose of the milk bubbles. Joseph Smith was no more God's prophet than Muhhamed was. In fact, the similarities between Mormonism and Islam are so profound as to exemplity the fact that the Devil actively seeks the promotion of heresies. 2 different knuckleheads claim angels came to them and came up with a new 'sacred book.' Both losers treated women as second class and promoted polygamy. Both birdbrains taught on going revelations which actively changed to fit the moment. Ask a Mormon where early Christianity went wrong and they blubber about a great apostosy which they cannot define.

The Lamanites are supposedly the Amerindians or current natives of North, Central and South America. There has been no archaeological or DNA evidence to support this tale.

Even as a young child I would worry myself sick over the big questions, things that dealt with who I was and why I existed. The Book of Mormon explains so much about \\"the plan of salvation\\" or God's reason for putting us here. It explains that good and bad exist for a purpose and that we can receive divine help through Jesus Christ. Many of the passages about Jesus Christ's atonement are so simple and powerful. You can feel that this is a good and true book. Read it! Joseph Smith was inspired by all our Heavenly Father to translate it.

For a book that has been around for over 150 years, you would think it would have inspired far more people to join the Mormon church than its paltry 12 million people worldwide membership everyone here is boasting. 12 million is nothing and at least half of that number consists of people totally inactive and have nothing to do with the Church. For a book that claims to contain all the truths of the Mormon gospel, it leaves out many aspects of Mormon culture and doctrine that is universally taught today - eternal families probably the biggest example.

He obviously has not read the book, something I would think necessary to write a review. I have studied it for over 40 years. The understanding of the atonement of Christ provided by the Book of Mormon complements and deepens what the Bible teaches us. It testifies of the truth of the Bible and its writers bear witness on nearly every page of the reality of God, of his love for us and of the great atoning sacrifice of his son, Jesus Christ. Those who dismiss it based on cursory reviews are missing the opportunity to gain greater knowledge and appreciation of these great truths. It is a powerful book with a powerful message for our day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, now what?","review":"The Book of Mormon contains a promise to all who read it. The Lord has given each of a promise through the last prophet in the book that if we will read from it, ponder it, and pray about it -then God will let us know that it is true.I have done so. Read it thrice. Thought long and hard on it's text and it's holy edification. And finally prayed long and hard every day asking for the divinity of it's truth to cleanse and wash over me so that I might follow with all my heart to know it's truth.But it hasn't happened.

It mentions pre-Columbian horses, chariots, steel, barley and other items that were not existant in the Americas until after Columbus. It also indicates that the American Indians are descendants of the Israelites and so are of Semitic origin (a 19th century belief).

Their aim was to, first, do the will of God in their own lives and second, to make sure their descendants and the people living today could be strengthened in their faith and live the Gospel as God intends. I honestly can't feel defensive about this. I love Joseph Smith for translating and giving his life for this book and for restoring Christs church. He was a prophet the same as the men in the Bible and the Book of Mormon. He was so because he was more meek and humble than any other man on the earth at that time. This is a good test of your faith deciding whether or not to believe an ignorant farm boy from Palmira, NY could become the means to restoring every gift and fascet of the Gospel to the Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"As former LDS who resigned from that church, I have read the Book of Mormon several times. Someone who is a believing member would find it to be of value on a purely emotional level, but for the rest of us (what LDS call gentiles), the Book of Mormon has no value what so ever. I find it difficult to believe that I ever took it seriously. The book is just badly written fiction. You can get a copy here for $0.01 which is about what it's worth, but don't forget shipping and handling which makes the purchase of that rag a poor value.There are many fine books on Amazon.com that address Mormonism in a much more honest way.

WARNING: do not read this book with the intent of finding a personal testimony. With the tools that the church provides and a some determination, the human mind IS capable of concocting just such a thing, but the fact that this is possible certainly does not make the church's claims true. Mind control is a real danger.The real truth is that anyone who actually experiences such a \\"moment of clarity,\\" should still use a critical mind to assess everything.

If you are looking into the religion, be sure to investigate all facets of their beliefs including their views on race and plural marriage before deciding. I think it's only fair that someone be informed of the whole religion and it's history, and not avoiding beliefs that may turn someone off of the church.Some interesting passages in the Book of Mormon include: 2 Nephi 5: 21. 3 Nephi 2: 15"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Read!","review":"This book was an sad attempt by Joseph Smith to create scripture.

While the Book of Mormon includes excellent bits about hacking people's arms off, being shot at with arrows while invincible, a guy getting burned alive and a drunk guy getting executed, it fails to metion Joseph Smith's divine right to have sex with teenagers and married women, which would've spiced it up a bit.I have to point out that I'm surprised it's for sale, as it has always been given away for free before, but I guess times are tough.-Beth"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Testimony of The Savior","review":"The Book of Mormon is a wonderful book.

You will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review on Ebook not content.","review":"I'm reviewing the ebook, not the content.The format of this book on the kindle is cumbersome. It starts with the table of contents and then as it presents the verses each verse is headed by the chapter and verse. This format is followed in each chapter. It's not at all pleasing to look at much less read.I was looking for the Book of Mormon in more of a book format. I have this version in print and it's closer to book format than the basic Book of Mormon. Unfortunately, you would never know that based on the Kindle format.For the price of $3, it was very disappointing.I also purchasedThe Book of Mormon: 1830 Original Edition (LDS) (Kindle Preferred Active Table of Content Edition)for $0.99 and this was exactly what I was looking for. It is presented in book format with no verse numbers and no chapter headings.Off the topic, if you are looking for the full Standard Works you can use this direct link [...] to get the download that will work for the kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I recommend this book to anyone. It has the true gospel of Jesus Christ and includes Christ's teachings from Himself. This is an excellent companion to the Bible. It's passages teach the pure love of the Savior.This book comes from ancient prophets as they relate their history and journeyings from Israel to the Americas and their history about 500 years before the birth of Christ. Read along as the ancient inhabitants of the American Continents receive a visit from the Son of God.Make your own assessments of this book. Don't rely on anyone's review. Rely on God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astounding","review":"It is astounding to me that anyone in this day and age would believe that the original Native Americans were really Jews who came across the Atlantic Ocean. How on earth can anyone believe that?

I highly recommend this book to every person seeking to know and understand Jesus Christ and his teachings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought murder and bloodshed could be so BORING?","review":"Any good Mormon will tell you that Joseph Smith had a fifth grade level education when he dictated this book to his scribes, and boy does it show. The book is a repetitive, juvenile, uncoordinated, rambling chore to read, written in the lowest style imaginable. There are wars and stuff on just about every page and Christ comes and everything but the plot and all the characters are poorly developed. What is a secret combination? Apparently you have to read it a whole lot of times to make any sense out of it, but it certainly isn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"108 Reviews","review":"All I have to say is that for a book to be for sale on Amazon for barely a month and already it has 108 reviews has got mean something, and those are only the 108 that were appropriate enough to leave posted. Obviously there is a reason this book polarizes people so much. Whether you believe the book or not, I believe it is a book to be reckoned with. So, love it or hate it, I think everyone should check it out. If you don't want to spend the money, you can get it for free from any Mormon, but that also means you may be invited to listen to a message from the missionaries as well. So, be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book in Bad Elizabethan English","review":"The Book of Mormon proclaims to be a collection of divinely inspired stories of two Jewish tribes that came to the Americas around 600 B.C.It is a long, drawn out, war story that when originally written, betrayed the origins of Joseph Smith's uneducated (but not necessarily unintelligent) mind. After 150 years of revisions, mostly grammatical and spelling, the book is still extremely difficult to read due to the horrific King James English used in it.The book amazingly enough also managed to answer a lot of questions people were asking about religion, Masonry, etc. in western New York state during the 1820's. But if the Mormon church wants to try to attract people to their corporation, I mean church, they should really consider updating the language in the Book of Mormon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a try!","review":"I really don't understand why people won't just give it a read, like any other book. I find it ironic that those who ridicule this book, haven't ever really read it. The same people who don't think that it can change your life, ironically will not read it because they also seem to think by posessing a copy they are going to be brainwashed. Like any other book, it deserves a read, they you can juge for yourself. I believe that anything that testifies of Christ and his teachings and helps people to become better can't be all that bad. I don't think I have ever met anyone who, by reading the book of mormon, has decided to go out and do bad things. So, my advice, give it a read, at worst it's just an interesting read about an ancient civilization.

Cursed people that God makes colored, metalurgy that just didn't exist in the Americas during the reported time frames, silk, elephants, horses, chariots, on and on. No references to Jewish holidays or traditions. Hardley any women mentioned; didn't they exist or contribute? King James version of the Bible plagerism.

This book is a religious book employing the name \\"Mormon.\\" You can't separate the book from the religion, particularly when the primary source (the \\"original\\" gold plates) has vanished into thin air. The burden of proof is on the members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to provide evidence that the book is \\"true.\\" To do this, one must look at the merits or faults of the religion.2. The LDS prophet has said that either the Book of Mormon is true or false; either Mormonism is true or the greatest fraud perpetuted on mankind.

I think I know the Book of Mormon as anyone.First, as a faithful and believing mormon, it is just accepted and believed that the book is inspired scripture and more reliable than the Bible. I spent most of my adult life with this belief.However, I eventually decided that I needed to know if the book would hold up to a serious scrutiny. What I found was very distrubing. It is not a book of scriture, but a tale weaved from the thoughts of others by an 18th century con man named Joseph Smith.It is okay to read, just look into its history from good sources before you really believe it as God's word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Translation","review":"Amazon's description of this book says that the Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith in 1829. This implies that Amazon buys Joseph Smith's story: that Smith did indeed, with the help of an angel, find an ancient tablet made of gold, written in \\"reformed Egyptian,\\" and translate it into modern English with the help of a magical stone provided by God.Please! If you believe this, you might also like books about Santa Clause.By all means, read the book, but don't leave your brain behind. It's not a translation.

I never get bored reading it because I learn so much about life and God; it causes me to reflect on my dedication to Jesus Christ and on the course of this life and into the next. It is through reading this book that I recognize the importance of Jesus Christ giving himself as a sacrifice for me and all people. When I have been worried or anxious about life I have felt peace come to me while reading it.

Oh, nothing wrong with a little polygamy, you say? What about Joseph pressuring a 14 year old girl to marry him so that her family will go to the Celestial Kingdom? What about him marrying other mens' wives because the men weren't righteous enough?Blacks weren't allowed to hold the priesthood (a position of leadership in the church that righteous men have) until 1978. Women still cannot.The list goes on and on, as you have seen from some of the other more lengthy reviews.This is a hideous book from a hideous church.

This is the flimsy foundation of most Mormons' faith. I have never heard of a single nonMormon scholar who accepts the Book of Mormon as historic. It is over 500 pages and covers many aspects of several cultures, and yet in 170 years, no outside scholars have accepted it as an historical book? That is amazing. Perhaps Satan has a lease around the necks of all scholars who are not Mormon? I'll let Occam's Razor cut where it will. It is a fraudulant book written by a flim flam man.

Some reviews talk of DNA evidence that disproves the Book of Mormon, yet this evidence is never sourced nor even explained, even briefly. One review says it conatins \\"NO uplifting prose that one might expect from a major work, and NO penetrating insight into God or humankind.\\" I would like to suggest that this person has not even read the book, or perhaps simply has a financial interest in members of his church not joining the Latter-day Saints.After a careful study of the Book, I have to testify that it IS what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says it is- a true book written by prophets who lived in the Americas hundreds of years ago.

It is a companion volume to the Bible and is filled with inspiring stories of faith and faithfulness, poetic verses of guidance and confort, and prophetic lessons for our time. Every sincere follower of Christ must account for the origin of the Book of Mormon and of its truthfulness. Joseph Smith is listed by some as its author but he claims only to be its translator from an ancient record.

The book contains a challenge to its readers that as they read and contemplate the sublime truths, that they need only to ask God for themselves if the book is true. The book teaches us to be more charitable and loving. The first time I read the book, I noticed that I felt closer to my family and to God. I have read this book several times both in English and in Russian. I have also read the Old and New Testaments and I can tell you that this book will change your life.

Do not hesitate buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for elderly","review":"Althought a great idea, with the different colors for each day, the morning noon, etc lables are not easy to see - maybe they should color code the time of day too. also, not easy enough to open for someone with arthritis...not a good choise for us"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, perfect size - needs a cover to be suitable for travel","review":"I know this is not sold as a travel pack, but all it would have needed was a clear cover to fit ontop of the little yellow tray to hold the daily packs in place and it would have been perfect (now the seperate boxes fall out of the tray and loose in the suitase or handbag.Other than that, great product. Good quality, perfectly sized compartment for vitamins (big enough to take Omega pills and the like)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my sister and niece and they both loved it.

I was hoping to be able to obtain it somewhere as well as an user's manual. What a major disappointment - you'd expect that product from such a major manufacturer would have parts available everywhere, first class support, web site with all kinds of information - well... forget it! This telephone uses very unique power supply - 6VAC there is no way to find it anywhere. Manufacturer's web site is utterly useless. Customer service 800 numbers are backed up, representatives based i India or who knows where and offer very limited help if any, most likely they will send you to a Sears or RadioShack store. Yes this is a discontinued model but not that old and this lack of support raises concern for the current line of products from Thompson, GE and RCA - once they become discontinued are they to be junked? I know one thing - I won't take chances and stay clear of this manufacturer's line of products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maravillosa historia","review":"Cautivante fuera de este mundo vaya aventura cosasde la vidad.

However, because I liked the other features of this clock radio phone, I decided to keep it. The unit is easy to operate and understand, the phone reception is pretty good (a little occasional static but not bad), and the digital numbers are easy to read. I had recently purchased another brand model that had a 2.4 GHZ cordless phone and the reception was terrible so I returned it. The reception on this phone is much better than the other model I tried and I am happy with this one so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Dual Alarm","review":"I have seen other reviews that the 26981GE3 has a dual alarm. GE's site is confusing as the top portion of the description states \\"Dual Alarm\\" but the specs does not. Another review in this site also states it has a dual alarm. But whem I received this from Amazon it had only One. The model was 26981GE3 but again only one alarm. I have contacted GE to find out but no response as of yet. I just returned to Amazon in hopes they might help. If I can get with Dual Alarm I think this would be a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well designed & hard to find","review":"I am very pleased with this product. There is not a lot of selection for cordless phone/alarm clock/radio devices. This one is well designed, easy to set up and use, despite the many buttons and features. Its just the rights size, way less space that individual components on the night stand. Beware the other GE cordless/clock, you can not turn off the alarm feature, will wake you up every morning like it or not. This model easy to disable the alarm for weekends etc. and then reable. The phone seems to have good sound quality. The only thing I miss is an option for the phone to turn on when picked up for incoming call, you have to push \\"call\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!!","review":"I can never get enough of Misty and Reese.

I have read the other novels regarding them and feel like I am growing with them. I think Lolita's writing is off the hook. EVERY book she has written is engaging, well developed and funny. I do believe that Tyrone and Tyrene will be the main characters of the next sequel which I can't wait to get. Ms. Files definitely has writing skills and I look forward to more.

I have read all of Ms. Files books and was looking forward to continuing the saga of Reesy Snowden and Misty Fine. I felt that the story line was rushed and silly. Ms. Files left a lot of loose ends possibly because there will be a fourth installment to this book. In my opinion she could have closed the saga of these two women and made this the last book. Faithful readers like myself will purchase the next chapter of Reesy and Misty's ups and downs because we hope that the continuing saga will be better than its previous chapter. I would suggest that you wait until this book comes in paperback or borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I usually stay away from African American novels like this becasue I find them stereotypical and repetitive. However, I was pleasantly surprsed with Lolita Files' work. The plot was well thought out, caharacters interacted well together and this book can be read as a stand alone (meaning you dont have to read the others before it in order to understand whats going on. All in all it greatly exceeded my expectations, and I would definetly recomend it. I alsomst missed my subway stop a few times; it was so engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book is hilarious and quite entertaining. Although there are already many, many reviews written about this story, I couldn't let the opportunity pass to say how much I enjoyed reading Lolita's works again. The mother character was a fire-starter, I enjoyed all the characters. I didn't think that I would want to hear about the same characters again, but Ms. Files wrote this book so well, that it doesn't matter that these are characters she has already written about.

The inimitable combo of Dio and Blackmore is captured beautifully with this live recording. Standouts include KILL THE KING, MAN ON THE SILVER MOUNTAIN, and the crowning jewel, STARGAZER. A highly recommended recording which begs the question, \\"Is there more we haven't heard?\\" Do live recordings of, say TAROT WOMAN, or GATES OF BABYLON exist somewhere in the Blackmore archives? As a companion piece I also recommend LIVE IN MUNICH, which has a slightly different set list. Further, any hard rock enthusiast should possess the first three fabulous studio recordings from RAINBOW: the eponymous debut, RISING, and LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL. I was lucky enough to see RAINBOW open for BLUE OYSTER CULT in late '83... sadly enough, the DIO era had passed, but Mr. Blackmore was majestic, charismatic, and so amazingly skilled with that Stratocaster in hand.Enjoy!!!Balthazar \\"Air Cool\\" Platini, III"},{"rating":"2","title":"The development of Islam","review":"This book argues that the development of a distinctly Islamic religious and social identity took years, if not centuries to develop.

Also in fairness there are several other very good songs and this is Shadow Gallery\`s first CD. I\`d advise don\`t make it youre first experiance of such a super prog unit.

GE and other companies need to always give support for replacements for a period of 5 years ( total length of time including warranty time ), and that includes internal parts for those that are savy enough to make inside repairs. This rule should apply to all manufaturers and all consumer products.I am buying the very same phone system for my sister.Another note.

So if you don't pick up a phone after 2 rings, you'll be talking over the outgoing message and your conversation will be recorded.Volume on the main unit is very low at maximum setting when trying to listen to messages, yet the beep on every button press is overpowering.BTW, there IS a red flashing light that tells you when you have a voice message, and I tested and determined that voice messages are still kept after a brief power outage.Overall, the phone is functional, but there must be better options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We've had this phone for a year and a half or so, and can't wait to replace it. Cordless phone seems to work ok, but the corded handset on the base unit is worthless. The speaker on the handset earpiece is very hard to hear and gets a lot of feedback (?) from the mic. The only way we can hear the person on the other end of the line is to put our finger over the mic when we're not talking, which is very inconvenient. Also, the volume on the answering machine is horrible, even when at it's maximum setting. I'm ready to toss this unit in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great buy","review":"The corded phone works fine but we have had nothing but trouble with the cordless handset. The battery dies constantly and won't hold a charge. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the numbers on the keypad stick so that that number dials two to three times. Forget making a long distance call. Definitely do not recommend, I am only giving it 2 stars because the corded phone and answering machine work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great set of remixes.","review":"Goldfrapp is a spectacular accomplishment as a band and a personality, but this CD of remixes falls flat like so many remix CDs do. If you do get this, do so because there's a bunny on the cover, that's about it. There isn't even one track I would recommend. While the Spanish \\"Calexico\\" cover of Utopia, is unexpected, it's not terribly outstanding. And the Let's Get Physical cover of the UK Girls I can do without, though to Goldfrapp's credit they do a reasonable job of turning this into a \\"Goldfrapp\\" sounding track. Possibly the only track of genuine interest on this CD is the live version of Human, which sounds alarmingly close to the album version but with out the intense low end. And there's a Utopia dance remix and a blippity electronica remix--the usual fair. It's just that the proper album is already so fantastic these tracks don't explore that. But if you have a burning love of remixes, or you like to dance, you might like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bow Down to Sunroof","review":"Utopia is a great pop song, but it took Sunroof to give it a really solid third dimension. This ep would be worth purchasing for the Sunroof mix alone, but every other track is good value and markedly different from the others; it plays out like an album in itself. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff...","review":"The more you get into jazz, the more you learn to appreciate the contributions Cannonball made. All his work is great, as are the several tribute albums(Louis Hayes' for example)dedicated to his work.

I got ahold of the second one first, Bangkok Tattoo. I have since ordered the other two. The humor makes you laugh outloud! It is right on. I loved his calling the reader farang, or foreigner. It is a word I heard often in Bangkok as the Thais commented to themselves about the many foreigners in their midst.Burdett has written an intriguing mystery. It contains, among other things, a humanized Thai whore; a mainly corrupt group of Thai cops and detectives; a CIA agent lost in his own mind; a philosophical Thai narrator and countless facts about the street life in Bangkok. The murders are horrendous and unique. The asides about Buddhism are wonderful. I can't wait to sink myself in to Bangkok 8, and I highly recommend this talented writer to mystery lovers everywhere.Cheryl Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"which swing of culture shock?","review":"a lot of others have commented that Bangkok 8 was a superior book. they're right.this book suffers badly from the author's imposition of his own voice over his character's. i find it hard to credit that a buddhist would take up such a vituperative stance toward westerners. lord knows western culture needs a good, solid critique right now, but somehow i don't believe it would come tripping out of a buddhist's mouth. buddhists after all are known for their tolerance of human--including western--foibles.so all i can assume is that the author is having one of those horrible culture shock swings, wherein his own culture looks really, really bad to him. maybe a vacation would help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious Tripe","review":"\\"Tell me Farang\\", how does it feel to know you threw ten bucks down the toilet. Burdett's first effort was a heroic surprise and garners a charitable 2 stars for this throwaway -- a cynical, cloyish, BORING effort to rake in the cash. A singular dearth of ideas, uncommonly purple prose, and a patronizing view of Thais and Farang alike. Look, if you need a vicarious make-believe Thai thrill whose extreme literary pretentiousness raises it just above a virtual Patpong hand-job, then, well, plunk down your chips and -- the real price tag -- your precious time. I'd awaited this follow-up eagerly. Now I think it would be a tender mercy if Burdett returned to lawyering and laid down his pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just skip it","review":"Ok like everyone else I loved Bangkok 8... but the characters we know and loved from the first book return here only to insult the reader. Which might have been forgivable had the rest of the book actually been well written which it was not. There was no action no intrigue or even a mystery. The narative is disjointed and in the middle of the book is a very long section of a Thai hooker's exploits in America, completely ignoring Sanchai for nearly 100 pages. So in the end this book was pretty pointless if only to call the reader a dumb Farang on every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Sonchai?","review":"Like a lot of other reviewers, I read and loved Bangkok 8. What a great read. I was surprised to find- after I finished it, that it wasn't written by a Thai. Sonchai was a real person to me.Now I read Bangkok Tattoo and I wonder what happened to Sonchai? What comes through is a Brit slamming the U.S. and the west in general through the voice of Sonchai.What's the purpose of having the CIA being the fools in the story? The female boss of the CIA officers is a lesbian? Why's that? Why isn't MI6 the object of ridicule? Why is the word \\"farang\\" in every other sentence? I get it- I get it...it's a derogatory word for westerners, right?I hope Burdett keeps writing in the series. I also hopes he lets Sonchai act like a Thai Buddhist and not like some political commentator on the Chris Matthews show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bite Me Farong !!","review":"Don't waste your time, the author uses the word Farong about every other sentence. I think it is supposed to be funny. There is little here to capture the readers interest. Unless you like being called or referred to as a Farong, save your money. There is a somewhat interesting description of Bangkok and it's seamier side, in fact I think that is the only side of Bangkok you will read about in this book.There is supposed to be a mystery here somewhere, but I didn't think it was worth my time to keep looking for it. Finally after about half way through I gave up. I was luckily able to sell my copy on Amazon at a small loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bangkok baloney","review":"Depravity and anti-Americanism on virtually every page.

That is why all the christian churches cannot agree with each other. Since the bible was written, manipulated, and rearranged by men throughout history, bible worship is mere idolatry. One interpretation of the bible is that it says one should practice something like the Transcendental Meditation technique. So now what are you going to do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to firm up your faith","review":"This book is very helpful for defending your faith in various areas, including abortion, evolution, reliability of the Bible, and more.

You might consider the 20-track, single-disc version of \\"Kiss This\\" to be a deluxe treatment of \\"Bullocks,\\" as it contains ALL 12 original tracks from that album, as well as 8 additional songs (and, yes, they're good too).

The length adjust piece (there must be a better word) along with the clasp are a very cheap metalized plastic. If you have very delicate hands and know you will never wear it a second time AND must save an extra dollar or 2 then this might suit you.

When I readjusted the neck band, the plastic clips moved with it-- metal clasp ties ALWAYS have the hook at the bow and the loop side always moves forward to meet the hook.This tie was hard to put on, and I remember the clasp moving based on how I adjusted the neck band. One time it was by the bow, the next it was at the right side or back of my neck.The plastic clasp was the worst part-- I ordered this in with 2 day shipping, just in time to put it on for a concert-- and the clasp broke the very night I received the tie.

I have to agree with the other reviews...get an editor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept that failed to meet my expectations...could barely force myself to finish it.","review":"I agree with the review that stated that Perlman seemed to want to impress us with his vast knowledge rather than write a gripping or interesting story that moved along. I did think the ending made it worth the excruciating, plodding prose with the nice little wrap-up twist, which seemed almost mundane given how \\"out there\\" he tried to be with the rest of the structure of the novel. I read constantly, so I'd say it was worth the read to add to my knowledge of what I do and don't like; the concept seemed so promising, and maybe in another's hands, could have been so much more interesting. Hey, maybe that could be a good idea for a reality show---watch writers write the same story from seven different points of view! Er, maybe not. Maybe you just have to be from France to enjoy the book (see previous review)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting for Stone is an amazing book","review":"I fell in love with all the characters in this book, good and bad.

I couldn't keep my interest during long stretches."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a self-indulgence","review":"This book made me want to be kinder and more sensitive; not because I want to impress people, but because it will ease the suffering of those already in pain. I'm pleased that I was able to finish it; there is such a powerful reward at the end. Its a reward that has life-changing effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, psychological thriller....","review":"Here is the story of a man obsessed with a woman, so obsessed that he kidnaps her child with disasterous consequences for all. Simon, the obsessive lover, sets many lives into a fult tilt boogie with his act and opens Anna's eyes as to what part he actually played in her life. The author delves heavily into the idea of ambiguity over and over and mainly, he's talking about the ambiguity of relationships and how differently each one of us sees our own relationships. If you like psychology and philosophy mixed into a great story with great characters, you won't be disappointed. The writing is first rate; my only qualm is that all the characters' voices sound very similar but that's really a small quibble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"I've had two attempts at reading this, some 5 years apart. Couldn't get into it the first time and really pushed through the pain barrier on the second attempt. The author is somewhat impressed by his own erudition but does not give his readers anything satisfying - the language lacks colour and poetry, the characters are narcissistic and unlikeable and the dialogue is woefully wooden and unbelievable. Perhaps Perlman had a shopping list of pet obsessions that he just had to weave into one long turgid thesis and somehow managed to pass it off as fiction. I pushed on to the end, determined to find some redeeming qualities, but overall a thoroughly unenjoyable process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consuming, Provocative, Forgivably Didactic","review":"Perlman's novel, written in dense yet fluid prose, is rich with suspense, empathy, and wit. The seven strands of narrative - each chapter written in the voice of separate yet intimately connected characters - propel forward a plot that is at once gripping and grave. Often Perlman's novel takes a narrative detour into the realm of the Socratic, with characters engulfed in 'casual' conversations on topics ranging from healthcare to literary criticism to the obligations of a human being to his or her community. While the book can sometimes get bogged down in excesses of ideology, it is the type of novel that both affects emotionally and intrigues intellectually. Upon putting it down, the reader can't quite decide whether to voraciously read up on the literature and ideas spotlighted in the book or to ponder the emotional echoes of the characters' choices and, ultimately, their fates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorting fact from fiction....","review":"Many will find it takes at least a bit of time to get into this novel. After reading each of the many narrators you realize that in your own life you likely will never be able to know what is perception and what is reality. Beautiful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Narrative of Ambiguity","review":"Rarely have I been as taken (read impressed) with a book, such as I was with 'mbiguity.\\" It is long, but I prefer long books to short ones and this is a complex story of the same circumstances as viewed by seven people affected by the actions of others. Each chapter is told by a different participant. What I particularly liked was that the author did not reveal who was telling his or her version of events, but rather let you figure it out as you went along (i.e. \\"Oh, that's Angel talking\\") It was fascinating to read the same events viewed by different people. It also contained good life lessons, increased my vocabulary and had a believable and fine ending. Good job, Mr. Perlman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"As the author I strived for vivid descriptions to create a good sense of being there and my tone of writing is one of familiarity making it an easy and fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotion and Insight - a powerful combination...","review":"This CD should be on the CD racks of anyone interested in Shostakovich and his music. For several reasons:1) because it is so interesting and insightful to hear Shostakovich playing his own music at the piano - remembering that before he turned to composing he was on the verge of a major concert pianist career...2) because the playing and singing is extremely heartfelt and beautiful - a real PERFORMANCE of the music.3) because the CD presents music which is not particularly well known and deserves wider performance (and acclaim).A really wonderful CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing","review":"This book is organized in a very odd way. Most translated pieces like this (Illiad, Odyssey, etc) have the verses numbered in the margin of the page. This particular piece is organized into a number of sections, something like 90 or more. However, this book did not mark any of them. Also, it seems like this piece wasn't edited at all. Many of the passages have random characters like c& just left in the middle of a sentence. Also, whenever there is a translated verse which has caused controversy among the translating community, the book will add parenthetical statements as long as a paragraph to discuss (in a very convoluted way) the different translations which may be substituted.All in all: I'm really not sure what I bought, but I had to do my entire reading assignment by finding Phaedo online for free. This book was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Translation","review":"This translation manages both to translate the Greek precisely, as well as capture the sense of the dialogue.

The one about membership in the Hardvard Club is in this book.And finally, Paul Chapin is a much better \\"Moriarty\\" than Arnold Zeck. He's much deeper and more complex, in fact, than virtually any other of Stout's other characters, doubly subtle by the way in which his villainy is propounded.Fetishism, kinky stuff - all here more so that in anything else of Wolfe's that comes to mind.

I am discovering that typos in Kindle books are almost the norm, and this edition of \\"League of Frightened Men\\" is no exception. The nature of the typos indicates that someone ran the original book through a scanner and didn't bother to do a lot of editing.If a book is issued by the publisher (Bantam) in a Kindle edition at essentially the same price as the paperback, I expect some serious attention to formatting and detail.

I found that at higher volumes the higher frequencies were harsh and hurt my ears. At low volumes, the lower frequency response was inadequate. Of course they are different from earbuds, in which the speaker is much smaller and closer to your ear drum, but I found that the earbuds that came with my phone produced more satisfying sound at the lower volumes I prefer than these full size headphones did. The synthetic material over my ears was also to warm for me.

As nearly everyone has pointed out, they're very cheaply built, and the fragile plastic hinges on mine broke within a few months, rendering them useless. And the sound was pretty poor to begin with -- muffled highs, harsh mids, thin bass -- to the point that they don't even justify the $9 shipping and handling it would cost me to get them replaced by Koss's warranty.If you're looking for cheap collapsible headphones and are loyal to the Koss line, the Koss UR40s are a couple dollars more, are incredibly lightweight and comfortable, and sound drastically better than these UR29s. They're also slightly more durable, and backed by the same impressive warranty. Check out my review of them if you like, and stop considering these UR29s. They're terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.....","review":"I purchased these headphones for roughly thirty dollars and I'll admit I used them quite frequently. After about six months one of the earcups broke off and on the seventh month the other earcup broke off as well. Shoddy design and the novel 'easy fold' mechanism probably contributed to the product's disintegration. I always went to painstaking lengths to be as gentle as possible with the headphones and they *still* broke apart as if they were made out of styrofoam. The KOSS Ur/29 model is pretty inexpensive, but not *that* cheap. Yes they are comfy and the sound quality was decent for the price, but if you plan on using a set of headphones for more than a year just invest in a proper set and ignore these altogether especially if your livelihood depends on a good pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Target","review":"We have been to Sicily three times and find the Rough Guide to be unerringly on target.

Because Moog doesn't actually recommend it...the instruction sheet says to use either the 1/2* or the 1* plates. Using these plates put a \\"sideload\\" on the bolt heads holding the rear spindle on the car...maybe 1.5* is a little too much??? At any rate they were fairly easy to install. I didn't use the rivets...I did RTV the plates in place over the old rivets. The (4) bolts do all the holding in place.I also added a \\"rubber donut\\" to each coil spring. This raises the suspension slightly (helps sagging springs)...stiffens the spring...and might reduce camber by maybe 1/2* or so.

Xellos who constantly gets under Lina's (and our) nerves. Also a rival by the name of Martina who through the entire series tries to get the best of our Firery Red Haired Sorceress. Episode after Episode they mock Both Zelgadis and Lina to further enduce plot, even some old characters make a cameo in the series. The only thing I found a bit of a disappointment was how it ended. You keep a steady pace of comedy and realism, then it just becomes realism with small splashes of comedy. However the ending is what cleans it up real nice.

However, it was a lifesaver for me in many respects. I had copied some of the recipes out of it before I left as I wanted to try them while cruising. Not only did we use the recipes (which were very good), it really gave me a feel for what to take (and not to take) as well as the things I would need to watch for on a cruise. The best example was when we caught a conch. Amazingly, I had the instructions for cleaning it on the page with a recipe. It worked perfectly and saved us incredible amounts of work.The only downside to this book is that I am now longing to do exactly what they did, take a two year cruise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Vacation Read!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read it on a recent beach vacation in the Caribbean. It is a very entertaining tale of a couple that did what most of us only dream of. They made a plan to take a two year sabbatical and sail from their home in Toronto to the Caribbean and back. The book tells of their challenges and joys in living and traveling on their sailboat, of their discovery of the cultures, peoples, and foods of the Caribbean, and how the journey changed them forever. Interspersed with the story are the writer's recipes she discovered as she traveled. I can't wait to try them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done Ann Vanderhoof","review":"Each time I picked up this book I felt my blood pressure drop and stress release.

She doesn't spend any time on how they were able to take two years off and I guess that ok but I kept wondering about it. When they actually get to the Caribbean the whole book really blooms. The love that these two feel for the areas they live in becomes infectious. The recipes are interesting but where would this Michigan resident find the ingredients? When the author is writing about the people she meets, Mr. Butter, the Minister of Rum, Dingis and family, those are the most WONDERFUL passages in the book.

If sailing is not in your blood... don't go, catch a plane! She wants us to believe that it is all very brave what they do, but with the house paid off, a whole package of insurances and without hardly any night passage, it sounds more like a Club Med adventure.

XIII is somewhat original in that you've got to play it methodically. Running in with guns blazing will only get you killed. The game is definitely fun to play.But - and this is a big BUT - you can only save at the beginning of a level. It is extremely frustrating to play through an entire level only to be killed at the end and have to play through again. This bug makes the game unplayable.

I'm running a pretty standard Windows XP box. I don't have problems running games like Unreal 2.Maybe it's just all the crashes, the game wasn't very exciting. The story was dull, the game play poorly implemented, the levels are __completely__ one-dimensional. If it worked well, it might be worth $30 to me. If it worked poorly, it might be worth $15. It doesn't work at all. How much would you pay for that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome game that doesnt work","review":"Now don't get me wrong about the title this is a great game its just that the tages client in the game which is the anti-pirating software is about the worst anti-piracy program there can be so its near impossible to play on the pc but if your getting it for a console go for it i loved this game when it first came out on the original Xbox it was honestly at the time my most favorite game of all time even though i never finished it i decided to get it again and it doesnt work and you can't get a refund or a credit for downloaded items so im trying to save you the trouble but overall great game just not on a downloaad you need the disc. well for me at least. best of luck to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't run on my video card","review":"Bought the game only to find out the video card on my game machine is not supported. Game generates a GPF on startup. Be sure to check the support web site for the few cards that are supported. The list contradicts what is written on the box; another example of less than honest product description. This seems to be a real problem with UbiSoft products (See reviews on URU). I am learning the hard way to stay away from them. One positive: the game uninstalls real fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I've never considered myself a big FPS fan, but thought I'd give this a try because I really enjoy cel-shading-based graphics and thought it would be an interesting concept for a FPS. Well, not only were the graphics very impressive, but the game overall was very enjoyable and this became the first FPS I've actually finished. The story was ok -- it has a more developed story than most FPS's I've seen, but it became a little confusing to keep track of all the characters and after awhile I stopped paying much attention to it. If you like cel-shading and you enjoy FPS's, I would recommend at least downloading the demo from www.ubi.com. I can't say anything about the multi-player mode since I never tried it."},{"rating":"1","title":"XIII: The Game That's Lame","review":"Like many people who have commented, because my PC has a CD Burner, XIII would not install properly and kept crashing or sometimes the mouse wouldn't respond properly. I've tried installing it four times, and it is continually riddled with bugs.The gameplay doesn't even look that exciting anyway. I'm not impressed.Fortunately, I only paid $5.00 for the game, but judging from my experience thus far, it is not worth even that.I also think failure to have an auto-save feature is annoying.My advice if you have a PC: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a joke","review":"Game is a total joke and a waste of money. Storyline just jumps from one topic to another, its hard to keep up with whats going on. The save system really ruins the game with is making you start at the beginning of level or two levels in a cheap attempt to make the game seem longer. AI is worthless and almost comical at times as they get stuck in between walls and fail to sound alarms when they spot you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't play the darn thing","review":"My computer freezes when I try and play this game which is completely and totally amazing to me.I just got done playing Doom 3 which is far more of a resource hog. So, I can only guess how good this game is. I even went online and got the update. So, my advice is don't waste your money. It is a dog.Update: OK, I did some research, which I should have done first... there is pretty much no way to play this if you have a CD burner... the game thinks that if you have the software to burn cd's you'll try and make illegal copies of the disk! Instead of burning copies, I think I'll just burn the original. Or perhaps drive over it with my car. And then burn it. Or perhaps.... stupid Ubisoft!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Investigator's Ready Reference Tool","review":"The marriage of The Sourcebook and the Guide to Background Investigations cumulates into an expert's tool which can be used by all readers.

I'm amazed one can write for so many pages and have absolutely nothing to say! God, it was torture getting through this mess. Good for Ms. Weisberger that she was able to get it published, but good grief - did anyone notice the bad writing?The movie? One of those rare instances when the movie was an improvement on the novel (and I'm talking a MAJOR improvement). I wasn't crazy about Anne Hathaway, but Meryl Streep makes the movie. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's light, entertaining and a whole lot better than that dreadful book. (And yes, I read the book first before I saw the movie.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and mildly offensive.","review":"Remembering the light-hearted enjoyment I got out of watching the film version, I thought I'd indulge in a little mindless summer reading and pick up the book. I found, not unlike some other reviewers, that the likeable, smart and believable character of the film often bears little resemblance to the spoiled and uninteresting character of the book. I didn't care what happened to her, I wanted to smack her pretty often, and there were even moments when I hated her and found her repulsive, such as when she described her new flatmates as investment bankers, Indian, and basically undistinguishable. In my books, this is unexcusable racist flap trap, and it gets two hearty thumbs down from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun! and funny","review":"we all knew Anna Wintour is a b*itch, but what a funny way to tell us about it! my book club thoroughly enjoyed this ride, and know we never want to work for her! insightful, first-hand experience of being a servant to a devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the reviewer of January 14, 2005","review":"Ms. Weisberger's use of the term \\"Jappie\\" does not refer to Japanese women.

It says something when I can finish an entire book in a weekend, because while I read a lot, I'm not a fast reader.This was a modern tail of \\"the boss from hell.\\" I'm not sure how the main character Andrea could have handled such a working situation for so long, but it was an entertaining ride.This book follows the vein of modern NYC comedies such as \\"Sex and the City\\" and \\"The Nanny Diaries.\\" While this book didn't clinch the horridness one self-involved person can be like \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" it was the look of Andrea's (non-existent) life outside of work that made this book keep going.Seriously, it's a fun read if you're looking for something lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FEEL MORE STUPID FOR HAVING READ THIS BOOK","review":"This book is so bad that it was a complete waste of time. The author discuses such juvenille issues. It seems like she used this book to showcase her knowledge of designer names. It talks about the woeful life of Andrea and her horrible materialistic boss. She devotes all her time to her work while she neglects her boyfriend and friend who is turning into a partying alcoholic. Her friend ends up getting in a car accident while driving drunk and it changes her view on her job and life. I can't put a book down once I start it, but this is the one book I wish I would never have picked up. It was so incredibly horrible. I truely feel shallow and insignificant after reading this book. I abhorred it and it is a genuinly heinous book. This author is TERRIBLE. Don't read this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"story not attractive nor convincing","review":"While the most prominent character is the always unreasonable, offensive & bitchy female boss, it's actually a story about the tension between family/friend commitmt & personal life vs career. I don't find the story attractive nor convincing, perhaps in Asia (& particularly HK), ppl have already got used to long working hrs, tight deadlines & demanding business reqts.What really interested me was the privileges enjoyed by the bitchy boss - if she was so unreasonable, why ppl around have to put up with it in the first place? I mean, they could have found another job if they couldn't stand her - so actually it's they have DECIDED to accommodate her. But why? The story said she was really brilliant & talented - so I guess after all, the motto is: one has to excel in his/her field to be a leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Ever wanted to work in major magazines? Yeah, me too. Instead I'm a bartender in Alabama. But through this book I got to pretend to be a cool, sophisticated NYC magazine editor.

This book is terrible!","review":"I was interested in this book with all of the hype surrounding it's publication. Then I read it. I finished it, but it was only because I was stuck on a cross-country plane ride with nothing better to do. It is very poorly written with tons of grammatical errors and oodles of redundancy. I didn't care about the main character and the secondary characters were also poorly written. Blech. What an awful book. I wish I had my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and whiny","review":"This book is poorly edited and NOT worth the hype. I enjoy chick lit, and there's a lot better stuff out there.

There's much better chick lit out there - try The Parker Grey Show or Anna Maxted."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this become a best seller?????????","review":"Like many others I cannot believe I wasted my time on this book - somehow I thought that MAYBE something interesting would finally happen at the end.

The details and personalities are perfect for the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and Entertaining","review":"It's a fun escape--certainly fun to read delicious nastiness about someone so rich and successful, but the writing is quite weak. Good book for a long plane ride or a beach vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"This is the worst book I have read. It just dragged on and on--about the 2nd to last chapter is when it was getting interesting. If I didn't have to read it for my book club I wouldn't have read it at all, but because of my book club I endured the torture.

If you have an insane boss you can relate!","review":"I have no idea why people are saying this book is whiny because it's not. If you've ever had a boss that asked you to do the most insane things or was just a complete [pain] you can relate to this book. Yes there were some parts that were kind of lame and seemed a bit overstated but overall this book made me laugh! I finally felt validated and I don't even work in the fashion industry, but I do know what it feels like to feel so crazy at work and have no one else outside of work understand what you have to deal with day in and day out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this is the only time I'll say this.......","review":"The movie is better! I really struggled through this one. I hate to buy a book that is not only terrible, but painful to read..... The author descriptions of characters, clothing, ..and basically throwing names of designers, and the descriptions of the attire was not chic, it was tacky. Totally not believable. ugh! How upsetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disliked the Book, Hated the Movie","review":"I read this book before I knew there was going to be a movie based on it. I completely disliked it. I think the part that pissed me off the most was the end. I expected more from Andy when she quit, not just a simple \\"f*** you\\". Any normal person would have gone through a tirade after enduring what she did or at least say something witty to make your boss feel like a complete idiot. Better yet she should have just stuck with the job and completed the year. She only had less than a month to go. The movie of course was a complete joke. They removed the meager amount of subtleness and humanity from the book (for example Andy's best friend's alcoholism) and demolished it with Hollywood glitter. Watch the movie before you read the book; maybe you might end up appreciating the book more. Or do what I wish I could have done and completely avoid both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I should have known better. I read this book with the hope that it would, at one point, make up for its poor writing, character development, and sweet valley high dialogue.

I am almost curious to read her next book, just to see if it can get any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great first 50 and last 50","review":"The title was the best part of this novel. Though very eager to read, i was not impressed with this book. The first 50 pages and last 50 were the only worth while pages of the entire book, and were only second rate compared with the title. If you want to read a book about a terrible boss read the Nanny Diaries, similar plot but a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over yourself... it's called the Real World","review":"Having worked as a veteran in the fashion and media industries, I had expected to enjoy this book as a witty skewering of the characters we have all known or had the experience to work with. Instead, I had the misfortune to read a badly written, whining account of some hick who can't take paying her dues like everyone else. It's so sad that some privelaged, undeserving lucky-break candidate can make this amount of press and sales simply for implying that the book might spill good dirt on people. Shame on the idiot media-types who bought into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Lauren....","review":"If you hated your boss and your job and wrote a bestselling tell all novel about the nightmare you lived for almost a year, making your job seem almost as bad as Oliver Stone's time in Vietnam, would you do as Lauren Weisberger did, and come out and admit that you, as well as your nightmare boss, were completely self involved and whiny?Lauren did.She whines, and she whines, and she whines for like five hundred pages. I wanted to enjoy this book, but it is badly written, moves at a snail's pace and spends time describing the fashion and name dropping, acts that \\"Andy Sachs\\" is supposededly above.The main character is unlikable, but not because she could have quit the job at any time. She's unlikeable because of her arrogance, and not just about her pretentions about being above fashion. For God's sake, there's a war going on, and she writes about Prada shoes.No sweety, you aren't Tolstoy. You aren't even Sophia Kinsella."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end?","review":"I looked forward to this book as an avid reader of magazines such as Allure, In Style, and Vogue. However, I found that Andrea was selfish, spoiled and self-absorbed, before landing the job at Runway. She was a completely unlikable character and the book itself ended in a totally foreseeable way. ARG! What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"i loathe this book! it was given to me as a gift and unfortunatley it's like watching a train wreck - no matter how much i don't want to read it or continue, i have to just for my own sense of accomplishment. it's is such a contrived piece of rubbish that i am embarrassed to be seen reading it. the main character tries so hard to come across as this do-gooder when all you want to do is call her out on what a hypocrite she is. i think the author is trying to project what she wants to be into the spineless little fashionista character she has not so craftly designed in this \\"novel\\" (re: laughing).and just when you thought it was over with the book, i have heard that there is a movie in the works. yikes!!! stop the insanity.for a really good read, check out the dive from claussen's pier or the corrections."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Than You Ever Wanted to Know About the Fashion Industry","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is a tedious account of an aspiring young writer's effort jumpstart her writing career by taking a job with Runway (read Vogue) magazine.

After reading this book, I will never lust after designer clothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disapointment","review":"Not nearly as clever as The Nanny Diaries or as smart as A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing. Weisberger's \\"literary\\" style is better suited to the \\"How To's\\" of Cosmopolitan than an essay in the New Yorker (the main character's dream placement). Even the guilty book pleasures of summer should be better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"I manage to get through 300 pages of absolute boredom-for the book to get momentarily exciting only to have it fall once again at the end; leaving everything pretty much unfinished. Would not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a reversal","review":"My boyfriend and I saw The Devil Wears Prada when it came out and it definitely made me interested in checking out the book.There's no denying that the book latched onto something in the culture at the right time, but jeez, it's so poorly written and structured, it's hard to see why it caught on.The movie's pretty good, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed this novel","review":"Even considering I'm not in the fashion world, the descriptions and writing sucked me in immediately. Very interesting watching the evolution a person in the industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this because I heard that it was not the same as the movie. And it is not. The movie was wonderful. I enjoyed the book for very different reasons. It was a little hard at first to change the visualized characters from those of the movie into those of the book. Some of them are very different, and the sub plots are also different. I love Meryl Streep.. but Miranda is a much better bitch in the book. So if you want to hear more about the bitch and you aren't too attached to the characters in the movie then enjoy this book. I know I enjoyed them both for very different reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do editors do?","review":"It's always a problem when it takes 150 pages into a book before it gets entertaining. The writing got a bit better, too. The book seemed like a rough draft with subplots like Andreas best friend Lily, boyfriend Alex, and writer Christian thrown in for good measure. The book could have easily been 200 pages. There is an obscene amount of redundency, and it is beyond wordy. I don't understand what editors get paid to do anymore. Publishers have a responsibility to correct grammar and punctuation. Ms. Weisberger should get a new editor for future ventures. I did relate to working for an insane boss. Miranda Priestley was believable and the best drawn character. I am sure Ms.Weisberger has some talent and could be a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the Movie","review":"I perused this book when it first came out but didn't find it very interesting. Then when I saw Meryl Streep in the movie preview, I thought I'd give the book a try. Well, my initial instincts were correct. I struggled through the first 50 pages, all the while hoping the movie would be better. It's just not very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"All promise, no delivery","review":"I couldn't wait to pick it up and then couldn't wait to put it down. There were so many opportunities for humor and clever insight and they were almost all missed. The writing is flat and the characters never really come off the page. I used to think the Nanny Diaries was just okay but if this is this year's version of that book then I'm starting to think Nanny Diaries was fantastic. And finally, the dish just isn't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fiction writers have EDITORS any more?","review":"There's so much garbage fiction out there and garbage writers like this one. But what really bothers me are the stories that could have been made so much better.

Also, are copy editors extinct?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"... Here's my opinion: The author is a young well educated woman who comes from a well to do family. She is too young to be taken seriously as an author- this is a term paper thats WAAAAY too long.

NO! Though her exploits were laughably over the top it's ANDREA that really shocked and appalled me. Why did she think it fine to rip off the company for personal expenses? Why did she think it was cute to tip a hundred dollar meal into the trash and throw away china, silver, and accessories away as well? Why did she feel obliged to wipe greasy hands all over her boss's expensive clothes? All of these petty little acts just turned my stomach.She was the real monster of the book as far as I'm concerned. If she hated her job and those around her so much she should have quit. I found nothing admirable about her or her high horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"the devil wears prada","review":"i haven't read the whole book yet but the condition of the book was excellent. so far, the book seems very interesting, and funny. seems like a good novel to read. i do highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

Instead, it was so boring I had to stop before I even read 75 pages. How many times can you read, \\"I want to work for the New Yorker\\" and page after page of \\"horrible\\" things her boss does. Where's the story? Where's the character depth and something beyond the obvious? I love chic lit, so it's not like I wanted War and Peace, but the people in the book aren't characters, they're charicatures, kinda like a bad sit com. It's her first book, so I don't really hold it against the author, but the publisher and editor should have known better. This was just such a weak effort, you've gotta wonder what the heck they were thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diary Redux","review":"This book is essentially the same as \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" but not as well written. Without giving away the plot, I can say I found it implausible that she woulda.) stay in a job where she is abused daily.b.) think spending one year as the assistant to the assistant to the editor of a fashion magazine would get her to her goal of writing for the New Yorker.At least in \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" Nanny has a good reason for staying with her obnoxious boss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes \\"Nanny Diaries\\" look like Jane Eyre","review":"I'm flabbergasted that this book is on the bestseller list. It is poorly written and edited. I had no empathy with the protagonist, and it was depressing to read about someone who cuts herself off from her family and friends because she thinks it will lead to a job at The New Yorker! Please! Don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get if from the library","review":"While an entertaining idea, this book needed some serious editing. Too many dull passages, too much repetition. Not very believable in many respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interest Ends at the Title","review":"With a catchy title containing the words \\"devil\\" and \\"prada,\\" as well as a comparison (not glowing, however) to \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" this book caught the attention of many readers. Thus, a top ranking on the best-seller list for many, many months. However, lacking any type of textual flow, over-use of flowery and unnecessary adjectives, and extreme drama over issues that the typical person would consider ridiculous, this book should be considered a waste of time. The tantalizing New York fashion gossip aside, it lacks any depth and most readers will likely find it difficult to empathize with, sympathize with, or even hate the central character of the story. Simply put, Lauren, it's no \\"War and Peace.\\" She could have ended the book saying \\"HA, I helped you waste money, since this book is like reading high school gossip!\\" Because, for the first time in a lifetime of reading, I put a book down without finishing it. Readers are better served elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to My Intelligence","review":"I am still trying to figure out how a book with no plot can be on the bestseller list. This was the most ridiculous book I have read in years. Weisberger repeated banal details so often that I have to wonder if she thinks her readers are brain dead. This sophomoric attempt at a book should have been significantly altered during the editing process. Someone should tell Ms. Weisberger that in order to write a book, you must have an idea for a plot. Shallow characters living in New York do not constitute a storyline. I felt that this was an incredibly poor attempt to copy the book, The Nanny Diaries. As a busy professional, I felt that this was a waste of valuable time. The only reason I bothered to finish reading this horrific book was due to the fact that my book club had chosen to read it. I warn all book clubs and individuals considering this book to stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"i love a good chick book, especially one about ivy league girls trying to make it in manhattan, but this was pathetic. the only upside was that it is a very quick read, so you could find out what happens to the ridiculous protagonist with a minimal time investment.the characters are dreadful, ex. our \\"hero\\" andrea gets quiet revenge on Runway by stealing from the company (buying macchiatos for the homeless, leaving extravagent tips). the do-gooder boyfriend character becomes unbearably self-righteous. and the book couldn't deal with alcohol and sex addiction in a more flippant way. it all ends up making the \\"Devil\\" look good - focused, demanding, over-the-top, but delivering on all promises and totally predictable.if you've ever had a demanding boss, worked in a remotely glamorous industry, lived in a big city, or had to work your way up a corporate ladder, you will find this book trite and foolish. i will be very surprised if i ever see the author's writings anywhere near the New Yorker."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring I skipped almost 3/4 of it","review":"In a weird coincidence, both this book (on CD) and The Nanny Diaries (in print) arrived for me on hold at our local library the same day. It was like having two copies of the same book, both of which were boring and annoying. After reading (or listening to) about the first quarter of each book, I skipped to the last chapter or two, just to make sure that I wouldn't miss any strange and sudden surprises. I didn't. While listening to this book, I was put off by several elements: the reference to \\"Jappy\\" college colleagues, the narrator's inability to tell her two Indian roommates apart after living with them for a year, her repeated use of the ear-grating phrase \\"as best as.\\" What is supposed to be so compelling about characters who have the boss from hell and are too stupid to quit? I'm glad that I didn't waste time reading both of these books in full, and that writing this review constitutes the last chunk of my time they will take up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another one of these books.","review":"I'm so tired of this genre. Bridget Jones has ruined it for us as publishers churn out this kind of garbage just because it sells well and we continue to buy it. I can't bring myself to purchase anymore stories about women that just graduated from college and their day-to-day stories about life, love and living in the big city. This book is like a cheesy Cosmopolitan fiction excerpt only much longer. This story is not shocking, I don't find any of the tales surprising and to top it off, the writing style is horrible. The author just tries too hard to shock and its way too obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing likable about Andrea...","review":"I picked The Devil Wears Prada in the airport for a light read while travelling on business. It could have been a really fun bit of chic-lit, but the main character is sooooooo whiny and unlikable that any of the books merit are overwhelmed.

Why do people find anything to like about these characters whatsoever? Horrible, despicable people, and I know, it's all in the name of comedy, but it's just not funny. Glad it is to some, but I don't want to hang out with those people, then. And the writing is atrocious. I've tried hard, really I have.

A self-righteous brat finds the kind of employment she deserves, but whines, cries and snivels about it--all the way to the bank, evidently! I don't know how assisting the editor of 'Vogue' (er, 'Runway') will segue into work at 'The New Yorker', but our protagonist believes that it will. Therefore, instead of just quitting this thankless, stupid job, she keeps at it. I wanted to kick her ass all the way through the novel. I'm not sure why I finished this book.

I on the other hand enjoyed it since fashion is one my interests. Many names would probably be unfamiliar to those not really interested in fashion or who at least read Vogue.The story is not excellent but not exactly bad, the novel is more of the descriptive type.

Andrea takes the job, knowing nothing about fashion, because she sees it as a fantastic high-paying position which she hopes will later land her on the prestigious literary review, the New Yorker, which is much more down her alley of expertise. Andrea's inept attempts to carry out her duties and errands to please her boss result in some hilarious moments.

Save yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun in the vein of \\"The Nanny Diaries\\"...but reader beware","review":"If you liked the \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" you will probably like this book. The reader warning is this: if you like good writing (strongly written characters, strong plotline, things like that), get another book. To be honest, I think the author should have stuck with stories about her experience at work (much more fun to read about a ridiculously demanding boss, free designer clothes and running around in Jimmy Choo heels all day than supposed character development tangents involving increasingly strained relationships with her boyfriend and troubled best friend). In short, I think she should have focused on the job; it was hilarious to read about the world of high fashion and the people who inhabit it--but there was too much focus on the main character's personal life and motivations. A fun, mindless read nevertheless--a step up from watching reruns on TV, if you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost $10","review":"I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did.

Its basically about a neurotic boss, but after a few chapters, you get the picture. But it goes on and on, with nothing new to offer. A very lame plot towards the end. But its highly predictable, and you feel as if you're just reading complaint after complaint and frankly, starts getting irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"One trick pony ...","review":"This book was easy to read and fairly well written. It gives an interesting, voyeuristic view of the fashion industry. Parts of it were laugh-out-loud funny, but this single theme book grows a tad tedious. I kept hoping for the protagonist, Andrea, to give her boss the comeuppance, but it never materialized. Instead it takes a very long time and a contrived tragedy to make Andrea have her obligatory light bulb moment. This book was overwrought and too long yet somehow fairly entertaining. 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go See the Movie","review":"This is one of those rare circumstances where the MOVIE is so much better than the book.

A better choice would be \\"TRADING UP.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a Half Stars","review":"In reading over the reviews posted here, it seems that people are very bothered by the shallow, materialistic protagonist. I didn't necessarily get that impression and besides, if every character was likeable and exuding righteousness, we'd never have had some of the great literary heroes and heroines. That being said, Andrea Sachs doesn't fall into that category and the book itself was largely a disappointment. I had no expectation of lofty intellectual reading, but some semblance of plot would have been nice. Every aspect of the story was completely predictable and the characters were rather poorly developed. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this was a waste of money, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters and Fascinating Situations","review":"Andrea gets a dream job at a fashion magazine, but gets the boss-from-hell. Actually her dream involved writing for the New Yorker but fetching coffee and dry cleaning for the boss seems unlikely to train her for that. She plugs away as the job becomes all consuming and the demands from her boss grate more and more on her nerves.As her relationships dwindle under the stress of the job, the conflict with the boss becomes more personalized. Andrea becomes more and more paranoid as sleep deprivation and lack of social support turn her into a whining, unpleasant person herself.Fascinating insider view of the fashion industry and working in the high-pressure NYC jobs. Often funny, a bit romantic and eventually somewhat depressing as Andrea is dragged further and further down by the job and the horror that is her boss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light beach read, nothing more","review":"This book is an easy read, but that's the best thing I can say about it.

Enjoy! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Fun! Lighten up!","review":"I purchased this book through Amazon.com right after another great purchase, THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, about an unlucky writer addicted to the personals. Both books are semi-satirical and set in \\"big, bad\\" New York City, but that's where the similarity ends. The plot for THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA revolves around Andrea Sachs, who graduates from Brown and gets a job that \\"a million girls would die for.\\" She is the personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor in chief of Runway Magazine. Ironically, Andrea doesn't even want the job -- she has only accepted it because she thinks it will help her land her personal dream job: working as a writer for the New Yorker. That just the tip of the iceberg, but it only gets better. If you enjoy fun, lively novels, why wait?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You didn't get it!","review":"This book was not by any means a literary masterpiece, but entertaining, absolutely.

I really don't care whether Lauren Weisberger was fair to Anna Wintour or not, or whether she sold out her old boss, I just care about whether the book will keep me entertained for a few hours, and it did. The book is moderately entertaining and very gossipy, although some of the plot devices were awkwardly handled (such as her saintly boyfriend and the hot writer she's attracted to).I liked it better than the Nanny Diaries, which I found somewhat disturbing--these characters are pretty cartoonish, and anyone who vividly remembers how much their first job sucks may sympathize with Andrea.Btw, I read that the book has been opted for a movie...who would play Miranda Priestly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I guess you have to be a New Yorker.

It was funny and unbeleivable. It reminded me of The Nanny Diaries, only a lot more enjoyable. If this book is only partly true about the woman that Ms. Weisberger used to be an assistant for, she should be embarrased and ashamed. For anyone who is remotely interested in fashion, it will entertain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Better than Movie","review":"From what I've read here, it seems the majority found the movie superior to the book. I don't know if it makes a difference of what came first (movie or book) but I read the book and was then dying to see the movie which I rented the very same day. I was disappointed in the movie. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Andy was not truly characteristic of the book's Andy. Book Andy was a stronger character and even flippant at times (which to me were the funniest parts). All in all it was an enjoyable quick/easy read and the movie was amusing. Meryl Streep was great. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read!

I only finished is out of sheer spite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish, having seen movie.","review":"Saw the movie version of this about a year ago and found it to be sappy and disappointing. I thought I'd give the book a go, as usually the books have much more depth and interest than the movies they spawn. Sadly, this was not the case for the Devil Wears Prada. As I read the book, I felt like I knew it all already (even though I have heard the book has a different ending to the movie...?) and since I didn't find the movie particularly interesting, I was not finding the book to be either. Couldn't justify continuing on with it when I have so many other great looking books waiting for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"Even if there was no movie to set my standards, I would've found this book to be a let-down. My love for the movie is probably the only reason I finished the book, considering it took awhile for things to get moving. Anyway, I know most people who saw the movie first and then read the book didn't like it, but I wanted to give it a try! Booo - so sorely disappointed! The characters in the book are by far less developed and likable. I thought Andrea in the film was whiny and annoying but yikes, book Andrea makes her look great in comparison. I also found Miranda's evilness so two-dimensional - we didn't get to see more of her to understand why she's this unbearable, which would've made for a much more interesting villain instead of a flat, predictable one. And the (kind of) worst part is that the writing style is baffling - it felt amateurish and got wordy and repetitive a lot of times. :( I didn't have very high expectations but geez, they still weren't met!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I was excited to see that this book had finally been released on paperback so I picked it up immediately. However, it was very disappointing. The book is a 400-page rant from a selfish, boring character that we've seen millions of times before (think blonde, blue eyed, naive, small-town girl..) The author writes as though she is an expert in her field dishing the dirt - meanwhile the info in this book is common knowledge and there are even some things I find incorrect. Also, it is not particularly well-written or articulate. The author tends to go into such detail about daily trips to Starbucks but briefly mulls over entire months of the protagonist's life.It may be a cute read for younger women or those who are really curious about the fashion industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Very light and humorous read...even though at times you can actually feel Andrea's pain and exhaustion. I would recommend this book for a fun vacation or beach read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"I thought this book was a fun read. It's not the kind of book that will change anyone's life, but if you're in the mood for something light that doesn't require a lot of thought, this more than fits the bill. It's so very different from the movie, though. Other than the names of some of the characters and a handful of basic plot points, they might as well be different stories. It drags in a few places, but for the most part it's good mind candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO GOOD!","review":"I love this book and have recommended it to all my friends. It's smart, sassy, funny - all the things you look for in a light summer read. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical!","review":"If nothing else, this book will make your own awful job look a whole lot better. What made the book funny was the fact that these characters were based on real people. It's hard to imagine someone so crazy could really rise to the post of editor in chief of an internationally known magazine. This is not great literature by any stretch but it is entertaining and full of crazy, funny people and situations. I thought I had the job from hell in a prior life but this poor girl truly had the worst job on earth. I think this job will appeal to all fashionistas and wannabee's as well as anyone who is now or ever has been an administrative assistant. Your own psycho boss will seem a lot more sane after you read this book. Oh and just for the record, I cracked up when I opened the June issue of Vogue magazine and saw that the editor in chief's favorite place to vacation was Oscar de la Renta's home in the Dominican Republic and included a picture of a skirt she wore for dinner. Hmmmmmmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm bothered by many things in this book, but what bothers me most...","review":"...is the fact that Lauren Weisberger perpetuates some openly racist stereotypes in the book. Was anyone else offended by her portrayal of the two Indian girl roommates, who sleep in twin bunk beds, have no personalities or lives to speak of, and (I can't believe she actually says this!) smell like curry? Weisberger, who considers herself to be too intellectual to care about fashion, even makes fun of their business suits.

From the very outset, she seems flat and uninteresting, much like the loafers she cluelessly wears her first day on the job. The only real jewel in this novel is the \\"Devil\\" herself. Miranda's outrageous character and her equally outlandish antics are the glue that holds this messily written book together, and once Andrea storms out of her bitchy boss's life, the novel no longer interests or stirs or even seems worth continuing. A nice effort, and a certainly phenomenal level of success for a first-time writer of questionable talent... however, Weisberger would do herself a favor by honing her writing skills a little bit and coming up with original material next time, rather than a nasty tell-all gossip-fest about the very visible fashionista we all know this book is REALLY about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn it, I liked it!","review":"I'm almost ashamed of myself, given the bad reviews posted here, but I enjoyed this book. Perhaps I can identify because I've worked for a real nut--no matter what I did, I simply COULD NOT please this woman, although I must admit she was no Miranda Priestly. Could Anna Win--umm, the person upon this was supposedly based, really be that bad? If so, how is she still in the business?

I felt nothing but pity for poor Andrea - the main character and my stomach would clinch up in anxiety with every absurd and ridiculous task that was put before her. This is not a relaxing, funny, good read. The whole time I was reading it all I could think was \\"Is this really worth it?\\" Surely Andrea could have found a different way of achieving her goal to work for \\"The New Yorker\\"!

It seems a bit implausible that someone would put up with so much mistreatment from their boss for a whole year simply to get a recommendation. If the main character had the charm, wit, or likability of Bridget Jones, this might have worked. But the main character is not especially endearing (in fact, she's fairly pathetic)and everyone in the novel is so vapid and bitchy, the story simply wears thin after awhile. I read most of it and then just couldn't take another miserable anecdote, so I skimmed through the last chapters and read the end so I could at least enjoy the final payback. I hope the movie inserts some sweetness, humor, and romance to balance the bitter. Otherwise, it will be a dreary 2 hour experience. This book will definitely hit the resell pile at my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I don't really understand all of the negative reviews on this website...I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun, light read. Nothing more, nothing less. I think the characters were believable & the main character Andy, was refreshing in contrast to all of the \\"clackers\\" and, of course the devil herself, Miranda. I had bosses like Miranda so I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! While this book was similar to Nanny Diaries in the respect of a wildly eccentic & evil boss, I felt this book was A LOT better than Nanny Diaries & much more well written.Maybe all of the negative reviews were from fashionistas lashing out--see the book has me paranoid ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating","review":"Satire has a long and distinguished history, and everybody, deep in their heart of hearts, probably enjoys seeing nasty, arrogant megalomaniacs get their comeuppance. But it only works if the person doing the satirizing has 1) SOME kind of moral authority, 2) A razor-sharp wit, and 3) the ability to see him- or herself somewhat objectively. Weisberger displays none of the above in this lame bit of opportunism. I found myself rooting for Miranda. Not a good sign.Prose that would be dripping red in a decent Freshman comp. course, cardboard characterization, a storyline that goes nowhere. Luckily I got my copy free from a friend who warned me not to waste my time reading it--if only I had listened. I would recommend you not make the same mistake I did, or compound the mistake by actually paying money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read","review":"Can somebody please explain to me why so many other customers are fawning over this novel. The writing just doesn't work, and in some cases doesn't make sense. I expected clearer writing from an Ivy League grad, something other than the fillet-o-cliches Weisberger dishes out. Plus I'm sorry, but I can't sympathize with the winy, annoying narator (make her stand in line for government cheese, shop at a Wal-Mart, something that tells me she's been struggling!) She works in the fashion magazine industry, for a TYPICAL, no nonsense boss. Whoop-de-doo! The part where she has to drive that $80k sports car, while wearing that Prada outfit, girl I just wept for Andrea.

A lover of fashion, but not a slave to it, it was quite interesting to get a glimpse into the world of high fashion and what really goes on behind the scenes. Overall, the book started out okay, but it went totally flat in the end.In otherwords, I was looking for something really juicy and got nothing in return. No need to re-hash what all the majority reviewers, thought. If I had to say one thing, I'm in total agreement with the folks that caught all of the grammatical errors in the book. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.Highly suspicious from a Cornell Grad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be...","review":"OK - this book starts out with the girl not knowing how to drive a stick shift makes her sound whiny and spoiled.

Well, I found myself finding the protaganist whiny, unrealistic, whiny, self-righteous, whiny, self-centered, and did I mention whiny?A college grad with a high profile job has to do some scut-work - boo hoo. She's lived a life of privilege, and seems to suffer the typical compensating for feeling inadequete by sneering at the haute couture world.Yes, Miranda is unreasonable. So are lots of other talented prima-donnas in every profession. Yet again - Boo hoo.The resolution was drivel. The implication that our protaganist has found what truly matters, and that standing up for her principals has served her is trite and difficult to swallow. The ending reads rather pompous and self-congratulatory. Oh wait, I believe that would describe the tone of the entire novel.This one is going to my local used book store, because it sure isn't a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur writing style killed it for me","review":"This book never would have gotten published if not for the dishy promise: Former assistant to a high-profile fashion editor writes \\"fiction\\" about....an assistant to a high-profile fashion editor. I only bought the book because I used to work for a big women's magazine and I was curious to hear her take on that world. As far as the dish goes, that part's pretty entertaining--and I don't doubt that the author culls from her actual experience, because all the parts that don't concern Andrea's dealings with Miranda are laughably lame and two-dimensional. I enjoy light beach-reading as much as anyone, but I believe a book can be fluffy and fun yet still smart and clever (like Bridget Jones' Diary)--and this isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped garbage","review":"This book is both thin (emaciated, in fact) on plot and horribly written. I guess Ms. Weisberger learned nothing more at Cornell than how to string together one cliche after another.

Skip this book. I literally threw mine in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ...","review":"Maybe I expected too much due to all the hype, but I found this book disappointing.

The simple reason is that it isn't. It was initially entertaining but so incredibly inconsistent throughout. Andrea's character had no depth, you did not find yourself feeling for her or becoming connected to her in any way. Anyone who tolerates this type of abuse, in my opinion, deserves it. I am not quite sure how Ms. Weisberger wanted you to feel about her main character. I did finish the book but I feel bad for the author because I think she does show promise but may not be able to recoup from this poor attempt at a novel (one that was highly anticipated as well!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a boring book....","review":"This book was a great dissapointment. What I wanted was a light, funny read. What I got was a semi-depressing bore. I had never heard of this book, or of the hype others had mentioned. I was bored and needed a book, ran to my nearest warehouse club and bought this. I think back and I bought it because it seemed similar to The Nanny Diaries which I found interesting and very funny.Andrea is NOT a believable character. She is saccharin sweet and a bore. We are lead to believe that she is a saint and doesnt deserve such abuse. Well QUIT!!! That is what I kept thinking through the whole book! QUIT, QUIT, QUIT!! And she should have followed the old addage \\"If it is too good to be true, it probably is\\" referring to her interview and job.Also, the whole looking at the woman and the fashion world down her nose with disdain,but, managing to \\"score\\" high priced items was so annoying to me. I just felt the \\"saint\\" Andrea was a hypocrite and was begging to be a doormat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"....unless you enjoy absolutely simpleton-type books.I borowed this book from the library. I expected it to be an easy read (it certainly is) but still an enjoyable one. I knew beforehand that it is the type of book you read on the weekend to kill time, or the type of book that you bring to the beach.I was six chapters in the book (95 pages) when I realixed that STILL nothing had happened. All you read about is how the main character's job is \\"so incredible,\\" and how the boss is \\"so difficult,\\" and how she works \\"so hard [at many menial tasks].\\" This book needs a plot, one other than how the main character chases down various items that her oh-so-difficult boss requires. B-o-r-i-n-g.I enjoy cheap and easy fiction as well as the next person. But this is certainly one of the worst books I have ever read that falls into this genre. I'm glad I didn't pay for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"This book has gotten a ton of press and I thought I would really like it. But it's terrible! The book is not well written and the content is fluffy at best. It goes on much too long with almost nothing new to say. Don't waste your time or money on this book! Go see the movie; I heard it was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, amateurish, and disappointing","review":"Like everybody else I was hoping for some good chick lit to pass the time. This book is so poorly written its a chore to get through it! Where were the editors?! Who does she know, that this book was even published in the first place? The writing is straight out of a high school creative writing class. At one point a character \\"groans audibly\\" - is there any other way to groan? Another character inexplicably appears every now and then and speaks entirely in CAPITALS! The characters don't know what they're supposed to be. Andrea is ostensibly a talented writer, but nothing whatsoever in the story supports any kind of intellectual ability or writing ability or interest. Its embarrassing that this was even published, let alone a best seller. Great concept, but so, so poorly developed. Not worth your time unless you like to laugh at terrible writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was rooting for Miranda","review":"Miranda Priestly, as shallow a character as she was, was infinitely preferable to the ridiculous Andrea, who was also about as deep as a raindrop in her own snotty way. The whole novel was based on Andrea's whining (both interiorly and exteriorly) about how she wanted to quit, but couldn't. How she wanted to quit, but couldn't. How she wanted to quit, but couldn't.If I typed that sentence five million times instead of three, that woud give you the idea upon which this novel was based.I thought it would be a good book to read while sitting by the pool, but I was wrong. It just wasn't all that interesting. I suppose if I really cared about the real-life world of Anna Wintour and Prada and Hermes and blah and blah and blahblahblah, it would have made more of an impression on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little boring","review":"This book was a little too long and very repetitive. Even though the story is interesting, it felt like the book would never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's no Shopaholic","review":"While I enjoy fashion and try hard not to love all the books based on women's obessesions with clothing and that strange, fascinating world, this book left me yearning to read a book about someone I actually could relate with and feel for...like Bridgette Jones or Shopaholic. The book was a slow read, especially since the author skipped around so much and many times dragged on when describing for instance her friend's makeup suitcase. I didn't pity the main character Andrea once, and couldnt understand why she stuck out the job as long as she did. She had no solid proof she would be working at the New Yorker after one year. When I forced myself to finish the book, I thought the same thing as a previous reviewer said...I was looking for more of an ending, for some gaps to be filled, and was left with a blank page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Summer Read","review":"I read this book several years ago. I thought the book was just OK. The characters were developed well and the story line was believable. However, I did enjoy the movie more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil wears prada","review":"I really liked this book. Andrea was very easy to relate to and amicable. It ended on a very good note with Andrea shocking us. If you've ever had a boss from hell, I'd suggest reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun read and easy to relate to...","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and had a hard time putting it down, mainly because it validated a recent experience I had working for a demanding prima-donna chef whose quick rise to fame made her think she was better than the rest of us peons. I couldn't wait to see what the next crazy incident in the book would be and if it would parallel the unbelievable things that happened in the restaurant -- the similarities were uncanny! I think anyone who has ever worked for an impossible boss will enjoy this book because they'll be able to relate to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title, Terrible Writing","review":"I expected this book to be witty and entertaining. Instead it was a tedious slog through awful writing and a banal story. Who cares if Anna Wintour is a nasty boss? There are lots of nasty bosses. The heroine is so oblivious that she doesn't bother to learn to tell her two roommates apart. She claims to want to write for the New Yorker, but she should count herself lucky to get hired by the local Pennysaver.Could I finish this book? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ended up rooting for Miranda","review":"This book started off well enough but after awhile I began to empathize with poor Miranda Priestly. I mean, here's a hard driving, high-powered, highly successful woman who obviously got where she was not by making friends with her many assistants, all of whom see her as a stepping stone to greater things anyway. And she knows it. And who wouldn't get impatient with a prying personal assistant who knows nothing about fashion, could care less, and who lets the boss' lunches get cold and keeps her waiting for coffee because she needs to have a smoke or call her boyfriend and best friend, both of whom are losers? Although I tried desperately to be sympathetic to Andrea, her great drive to be \\"liked\\" made her, in my view, extremely unprofessional and excrutiatingly annoying. She was complaining and f-ing up on the job all the time and should have been fired immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is an editor when you need one???","review":"I expected this book to be light entertainment. However, I still expect storyline consistency. First of all, the boyfriend cannot have a 6 year old child in his 4th grade class. There are more \\"minor\\" errors, but hasn't anyone noticed the most glaring? At the end, the roomate is in two places due to storyline problems. First, the roomate was there, next shes still drunk, passed out in bed. This drives me nuts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY","review":"This was not a very good book. After hearing that it was a best seller I knew I had to read it. First of I knew not to really take this book seriously as it was written in a humorous manner. Now, even though we all feel for the Andreah because no one wants an evil boss. But, in the real world she would have been canned the first time Miranda realized that she was not \\"Cut\\" out for the job. Also, there is no way that they would have let her keep those clothes. This book was just all about clothes, make up and \\"Clackers\\". Save your money it's not worth it. I give this book a serious thumbs down. All three of the \\"Shop-o-holic\\" books were better than this one book combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil Writes Chick-Lit","review":"Lauren Weisen-whatever cannot write. Period. She has zero technique. Five pages into this pulp and I knew I had a labor on my hands. I only deigned to read it because the movie was tolerable. The book is not. And that's because she CANNOT write. Cannot. The proof is in the pudding, folks: she's the only author I've ever seen who does not pass what I call \\"The Amazon Test\\" (this occurs when a book has multiple reviews; there are always, ALWAYS more five-star reviews for that book than any other star rating, usually combined). With all the five-star reviews on Amazon, you'd think every book ever written was A Farewell To Arms or something.Anyway, I digress. This is the only author I've ever seen whose books do not have a five-star review majority. It's not even good for chick-lit, which itself is a watery genre. I've got nothing else to say, so in the words of Meryl Streep: \\"that's all.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly-written, self-important, whiny mean-spirited crap.","review":"That basically says it all. The only reason this novel became successful is that humans enjoy trashing other humans, particularly famous women, and enjoy reading trash about other humans, particularly women, too. If you want to learn about Vogue, see \\"The September Issue.\\" If you want to read about a whiny, primadonna, by all means read this novel -- but the primadonna is not the \\"boss,\\" it is the author herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok...","review":"This book was just ok... nothing special but good if you're looking for an easy-to-read novel to take up your free time. It was rather funny in parts, but too much \\"telling\\" really makes you feel as if you are trudging through most of the narrative. Nothing special, very repetitive and I'm surprised that it was a bestseller for so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"Gratuitous use of the \\"F word\\"Really disappointing ending...but what might be worse is by the time I got to it (they could've trimmed up the middle for sure), I could only care so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic look at the fashion insider","review":"I used to work for a major fashion house in the early 1990s and this book reminds me so much of a couple of my bosses. I laughed and laughed throughout the book. Scheming, maniacal, people who totally lose it during Fashion Week every year, regardless of whether you are currently in Paris, Milan, or New York.You don't need to have worked in fashion to love this book. Anyone who has had an insanely obsessive-compulsive boss will relate to it. I loaned it to several co-workers and they all agreed that it was a fun, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live a little!","review":"I loved this book! It kept my attention and was def. interesting. Yes, she could've expanded on her main character's love for writing and the ending could've been thought out a little more, but all-in-all this is a great read and hopefully an inspiration to everyone that has a less-than-desirable boss."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was much better than the book","review":"I saw the movie (Meryl Streep, Anna Hathaway) before I read the book. The movie was fantastic. The book: not so much. As I walked out of the theater I felt repulsed by high-fashion fabulousness -- at the same time that I wanted to head to Nordstom for a new outfit. But I found the book annoying. Meryl Streep brought the Miranda Priestly character to life more than I could do in my own imagination, and the Andy Sachs character in the book was more of a weeny than I could tolerate. My recommendation: rent the move from Netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive","review":"entertaining most of the time, but the same scenario every time...got a little old..The author writes well, but this story should have ended after 200 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"No brevity.

What could have been a sharp, satirical novella clocks in at 360 pages of non-stop whining.I won't be finishing this one. If I want to listen to New Yorkers complain about their publishing jobs, I'll go talk to my co-workers."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Buzz and No Book","review":"The only possible reason for reading this book is to see if Anna Wintour stand-in Miranda Priestly is the worst boss ever. She is. However, unlike The Nanny Diaries, this book is so poorly written that by page 300 or so, you couldn't care less is Miranda had her young assistant Andrea drawn and quartered. There are a collection of characters so poorly drawn, serving only to satisfy the author's whim at the moment, that any arc is rendered flat and you find yourself waiting for the next Miranda outrage, which, after the twentieth one, is no longer shocking. Is Emily a back stabbing co-worker or a comrade in arms? Will sweet boyfriend Alex dump job-obsessed Andrea? Does funky best friend Lily have a drinking problem? Will Andrea survive this job to make it to The New Yorker? Who cares? After reading this book, I promise you, you will not care. Watch the final season of Sex and the City and you'll get the same fashionista flush as you had hoped you'd get from this pitiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"rant,rant,rant","review":"This book started off fun and then you realize that all this girl does is rant and complain...all the time.

I'm relieved that I'm not alone. I bought a used copy at the bookstore by my house, thinking I'd enjoy a nice, \\"flip\\" summer read, but all in all, I'm pretty disappointed. I feel like I could have written this book in a weekend, and I don't know squat about fashion. There's not much plot here, and really, not much point from what I can tell, and I'm on page 152.It's got some cute parts, and then some really ridiculous parts (when the lame-o security guard at her building requires her to sing Spice Girls and Madonna before he'll let her pass, I literally rolled my eyes).I'm quitting now based on what I've read here. I think I've actually gotten just a little dumber reading this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nothing book - boring and trite","review":"I am going to save you some time here:1) Young college grad (Andrea) aspires to work at The New Yorker Magazine and settles for a job at a fashion magazine called \\"Runway\\", working as an assistant for the fashion editor for one year (you are now on about page 20)2) For the next 200 pages we learn that the boss is a bitch.3) Then the last 30 pages have Andrea realizing she has made a mistake....4) Trite ending.Miranda was a devil, but this book is so totally devoid of creativity that I found myself wondering why Andrea didn't quit her job sooner, and why I hadn't stopped reading this book sooner as well!Miranda's antics go on and on for over 200 pages and it gets totally boring and repetitive.Skip this one. Not even a good airline trip read.How do books like this stay so long on a best-seller list?It frightens me to think about that question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"That is the one word that comes to mind after reading this book. It was plain and simple funny. This is a great read for anyone who has ever worked in an industry which takes itself way to seriously, i.e. fashion, advertising, entertainment.

Take this on the plane or train to keep your mind from going crazy over the commute and you won't be disappointed.

That ends what I thought worked well in the book.What didn't work well was the immature writing style which smacks of 6th grade girls' notes to each other; the thinly developed characters (especially Miranda who practically shows zero favorable traits) and the humdrum subplot involving the boyfriend and best friend. I honestly nearly fell asleep during these parts and fast-forwarded to the interactions with Miranda.Skip the book and watch the movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BOOK THAT REALLY PORTRAYS IGNORANCE","review":"This book was very good in the fact that the writer was able to bring out my emotions towards the characters in the story. Mostly disgust for Miranda, and anger towards Andrea for allowing anyone to treat her with such utter disrespect. It definately captured the feel of NYC and the fashion industry, and gave the reader the feeling of stress that accompanies that lifestyle. (I actually had to put the book away for a day because just reading it stressed me out). Those things are all good, however I was very disappointed that as witty and intelligent as the main character, Andrea is, she showed complete ignorance by stereotyping \\"anyone who lives below the Mason Dixon Line\\" as a dumb Southern Redneck or hick. I pretty much lost all respect for both the book and the main character when this began to surface. It pretty much ruined the whole book for me and negated any redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similiar to the Nanny Diaries","review":"This book is very similiar to the Nanny Diaries.

And I did receive more then a few looks while giggling on the train at some of the antics that Miranda pulled on Alex. We have all had a boss someplace in our lives that have done similar things, so we can all relate to poor Alex. However, you have to read it to the end to end to see what becomes of the characters.

I would recommend it to anyone looking to read a fun, easy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just dreadful","review":"I can't figure out how this book made the Bestseller list. It's the worst book I've read all year, and I read a lot. I loved the Nanny Diaries. This book isn't even in the same ballpark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Ending","review":"I listened to this book. It started off fairly good, but totally fell apart at the end. I'm glad that I didn't purchase this, because it really isn't worth the money. It's like the author couldn't think of a good ending for the book, so she just tacked on anything... it leaves one feeling very unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype","review":"So much hype surrounded this book. It was on the NY Times best seller list forever! I for one do not think this book deserved all of the recognition it recieved.For one the novel is FILLED with annoying typos, misspellings, and grammar errors ( as I am sure many of my own reviews are, but this is allowed because I am not a published author ;) ). That really annoyed me to say the least.Overall the story wasn't to bad. I mean it started out funny then got old quick. The characters were underdeveloped so it was difficut to get involved in the story being told. The secondary characters were mere snipbits and were practically useless.Bottom Line: The Devil Wears Prada is utterly dissappointing. While I didn't hate it enough to not finish I have to say having seen in on the bestseller list for so long I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Boring Than Funny","review":"I just didn't get this book. Didn't see what was supposed to be so funny about it. Andrea came across as a whiny complainer who, although she kept stating her fight against fitting in with the New York fashion world, seemed to secretly crave and yearn for it. She's also a masochist who consistently let someone mentally abuse her and came back for more. All under the guise of trying to move up into the journalistic world. Sheesh.There were parts that were humorous, but more were just boring. I didn't like the way the author rambled on and on and on, searching for that one-liner that would bring a laugh from the reader and never quite getting there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"After hearing about this book for ages, I decided to give it a try. Really, what is everyone all gung ho about? The character is unlikeable, although she obviously thinks that she's got the brains of a rocket scientist the way she looks down on everything and everyone around her at her job. Her relationship with her boyfriend is just plain old boring. The boss is a walking stereotype. I would have given this one star, but because I couldn't even make it through the entire book before I got bored and sick of the nauseating characters, I figured that wouldn't be honest because I don't know if the entire thing is bad - but most certainly the first half that I read wasn't worth all the press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure, whining drivel (& not good drivel)","review":"Unless you have lived the author's life, this is a truly tiresome book. It may hit the spot for 23-year-old women who are intimate with the fashion scene. For the rest of the population, it's a waste of time. The characters are badly drawn. The main character, for instance, is supposed to be smart and feisty. She dreams of writing for The New Yorker. Yet she chooses a year of exhausted humiliation over relying on her assumed intelligence and determination to secure her future. As a reader, I get that she is exhausted and that her job is rotten. That comes across loud and clear, but the author never moves on. There's no relief, no sense of the character actually growing or changing. Instead one long whine ends with the character acting as poorly and selfishly as those the book presumes to castigate. I'm not far from 23, I remember what it was like to begin working, but please...show us you can grow up or don't waste our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"OK, so it's got a nice cover and got some good reviews, but come on! It's boring, and who cares about the main character? It's hard to get behind a character who hates and complains about everything yet is a toal hypocrite since she acts just as poorly as the people she bashes.Fashionistas - in the same category - is a MORE ENJOYABLE book. The story is fun and the writing is witty and humorous. I actually laughed out loud through most of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"We were all young once. . .","review":"I agree with the general consensus that the book had some fun parts, but was generally way too whiny and predictable. By the time I was 2/3 through I was mentally done with it.My point is that from the point of view of someone in her 40s, I can really, really see that it was written by someone in her 20s. The continuously preachy and annoying message that it is just SO wrong to expect anyone to do any personal tasks for you (even if you were told that was the deal when you were hired) and SO disgusting - so incredibly disgusting - to touch someone else's laundry. . .ya know - I just do think that titans of industry should be able to use their time for something else. And that we all have to pay our dues.So I guess I'm not in my 20s anymore. And I could tell that this book was written by someone in her twenties. As they say - beautiful to look at, but we're really not interested in what they have to say.

Good thing I didn't actually READ the book - I got the abridged CD - ugh. (long commute home) I got so fed up with the main character being a weak little spoiled ivy-league brat. This story proves WAY too many stereotypes about ball-breaking NYC women, and all the while the author thinks dropping random designer names is going to make the reader swoon. gag.This was so boring, I returned it for cash. Don't waste your time. Read anything by Kinsella instead for a better light chick-lit read.

I certainly didn't think it warranted the 300+ pages that it was (<200pgs more appropriate i think) and i felt the author was was too descript on fashion items and not enough on the story. I kept reading the book in anticipation something exciting/unpredictable would happen (it never) and finished it thinking that as i don't work in fashion, maybe there were a few fashion in-jokes that I didn't get (giving it the benefit of the doubt). In all i agree with other reviewers that it's a beach read, but the length of it makes it too long to recommend it(who reads 300+ pgs at the beach, if you do i hope you wear sunscreen!). Read this book only if you have a LOT of time (which i have at the moment), not to satify curiousity (as i did) because you will end up disappinted."},{"rating":"1","title":"No beginning and no end...","review":"I picked this book up because I thought it would be an entertaining read on my vacation. However I found it written in a scattered style and did not hold my attention. I mean it starts off with a gal trying to drive a Porsche in NY and then jumps to Andrea's life. A lot of time was wasted on character development. For instance, Ms. Weisberger spends an inordinate amount of time on a male writer that has a crush on Andrea. The books ending was about the worst I've ever encountered, you would have at least expected that Andrea ends up with the writer (due to the number of times he was brought up in the book), but no, you're left looking for that one last page that really contains the ending, yet left with nothing at all.This is a fluffy book that is a real waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunt Move","review":"This book just cashed in on its back stage access. Poorly written and the character was not likable. The Pop Star synchronization of book writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is still on the shelves?","review":"I truly disliked this book, from the bottom of my heart....poor writing for someone who has wanted to write for the New Yorker, not to mention that it is told in such poor taste. I just saw someone in my bldg. with the book in her hand in the elevator. I told her not to waste her time reading a couple hundred pages of whining and complaining...not to mention horrible dialogue, which shows nothing good about \\"Andrea\\" and her attitude regarding work. I think almost everyone could write a book like this.....except she has some nerve writing it about such a highly respected editor! Really - what does it take to write a book of your own personal complaints? Weisberger should have stuck to writing in a journal or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too familiar","review":"Having worked for a woman very similar to that described in the book, albeit in Interior Design, I felt great sympathy for the main character, Andrea. There are some truly revolting people out there, and frankly you are better off getting out early on -I only spent 6 weeks there, as opposed to the year the main character put in - and this book was giving me horrible flashbacks.Apart from the similarities to my experience (which meant that in a lot of ways I didn't really enjoy the book as it brought back a lot of bad memories), I found the book shallow and fairly glib - there was no soul searching at any point except the end, and then that was fairly over dramatic. In addition, the novel was quite poorly written - ungrammatical and mostly consisting of \\"conversations\\" rather than descriptions. Reads like a screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fine literature but an okay beach read...","review":"My friend insisted that I read this book so I picked it up thinking that it would be a light yet entertaining read. Though I'm picky about writing styles I knew not to expect much from this book and it's a good thing that I didn't. The author's writing style is choppy and amateur at best. I'm glad that I live near the beach because that's the only place I can justify reading this book. I recall \\"Sweet Valley High\\" books that I read in Jr. High School that were better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"Reading this book was a complete waste of a day. Not only do I have no tolerance for weak characters, especially women, I have no patience for such ridiculous scenarios. There is no way anyone with any self respect would put up with such a ridiculous boss for any length of time. The only reason I finished this book is that it was a book club selection. I should have read the last chapter and saved myself the pain of reading the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Did Houston Ever Do to Ms. Weisberger?","review":"I was relatively enjoying \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" until page 72 when Ms. Weisberger takes on the city of Houston as if she was being paid by the Southern Stereotypes of America. She refers to my hometown as the following: \\"city of misery\\", \\"Third World\\", \\"swamp\\" - to name a few.Now, I can take a ribbin' - in fact there are plenty of things about Houston to poke fun at. But this was vitriol, not humor. I thought about pointing out that a city with the 4th largest museum system, a world-class ballet, a Grammy winning opera company and a Tony award winning theater probably shouldn't be called Third World...but what's the point? I hope Ms. Weisberger comes to Houston on a book tour. She will find the people very friendly and courteous... even though we have those horrid southern accents she hates (New Yorkers sound like music?)So I'm returning my copy for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is the poor man's Nanny Diaries. Not only is the style eerily similar but so is the plot. It was painful to get through the book but I felt obligated to finish it since I paid $... for it. Spend your time and money on elsewhere; this book isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for someone who likes picture magazines.","review":"The greatness stops with the title. This is part of a new genre of literature built around the success of Sex and the City and aimed at young women who dream of living in New York and wearing $1000 shoes while making $30,000 per year. It is mildly entertaining (emphasis on mildly) for escapist reasons, but I wouldn't put it in the category of a guilty pleasure. It is fun to think you could get a job where you have access to unlimited priceless designer clothes for free by pure luck, but that is about the only fun fantasy this book perpetuates. Unhumorous & boring. If you want to dream about wearing Prada and Versace buy a copy of Women's Wear Daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Complaint After the Next...","review":"Initially, I thought this book was going to be a fun light-hearted read. I was disappointed to discover that rather than being adventurous, this book was nothing more than a long list of whiny complaints made by the narrator, Andrea. There is never a moment when Andrea is actually happy and content, which eventually drains the reader and contributes to the fact that this book is just one big headache. I only finished due to curiosity, but the ending is so predictably anti-climatic that I found myself feeling no emotions at the end. Save your time and read something fun with a rewarding ending such as I Dont Know How She Does It by Allison Pearson."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I found \\"the Devil wears Prada\\" to be a bit boring. I admit that I am a sucker for the recent glut of twenty/thirty-something tales of making it on the world but the plot was nonexistant. I kept waiting for something REALLY aweful to happen and Andrea would save the day and finally get her job at the New Yorker but no...nothing. This book feels more like the author complaining about her days as an assistant to the Vogue editor than a novel. Weisberger tries to add some other characters such as Andrea's pregnant sister but it fails miserbly to take the reader anywhere. Weisberger should have just stuck to writing a memior about her days as a fashion editor's assistant. Also, I think that this book was poorly edited. I found a few grammer mistakes and many sentences that felt out of place--as if they were supposed to be edited out but got forgotten. Leave this book on the shelf where you found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This book was quite a quick read; in fact I was already at page 250 when I realized that nothing of real interest had happened yet. Rather than the witty and charming protagonist I expected, Andrea Sachs is predominantly unlikeable, rarely displaying any attractive characteristics. She's snide, rude, and negative. I have no doubt that the story is entirely autobiographical, simply for the reason that no writer would conjure up such mundane information, only to quickly pass over what could have been entertaining moments. Finally, for a person so critical of fashion magazines, it is notable that her book reads as though it was meant for nothing other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the movie","review":"This book is chock full of bad language and horrible morals. The movie is actually much cleaner and more interesting than the book. My advice- watch the movie and don't waste your time reading the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This woman can't write","review":"Great concept, great title, unfortunately Ms. Weisenberger is a terrible writer (not that she's likely unhappy with how she's done with this!). It's so rare that a movie is better than the book - but in this case don't even bother with the book. It's far too painful to attempt to read. Save your money and rent the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on the book","review":"This book was very monotonous and predictable. I fault myself for not doing a little research before buying it. Since it was made into a movie, I made some assumptions that it was a good read. Clearly, the casting and eye-candy made the whole concept worthwile as a movie. However, the book really fell flat. The characters were not engaging and the plot could be stated in one sentence : I had a very demanding job with a horrible boss where I got to wear great clothes and get a glimpse of the fashion industry. I was expecting some sort of revelation about what makes Miranda tick or what Andrea learned from the experience. But it seems that Andrea does not have enough depth to have really learned anything. Save your time and money and just watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"I was thrilled at the thought of reading a book about high fashion and a mean boss. When the movie previews started airing, I decided to read the book before seeing the movie. Don't bother! The writing is mediocre, and the story - wait, there isn't one. It is a quick read, but I think that's because you're desperately waiting for something to happen. And when you finally get to the end, it's as if the editor said, ok, wrap it up in the next 10 pages. The ending is totally dissatisfying and well...dumb. I have heard the movie is very fun though, and that Meryl Streep is amazing. If you're considering reading this book, I suggest you skip it and make a bee-line for the nearest movie theater instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that never ends","review":"This book starts out great. It's cheeky and funny.. but this books big problem is that the plot is to thin. So, your boss is crazy.. then what? The answer to this is nothing! That's it.. the book is about an evil boss and that is all the book is about. There are no twist, no mystery, no nothing... After about 200 pages, the jokes gets old and you just want it be over.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savvy yet Slow","review":"Maybe this book should have been a fictional memoir of a fashion assistant's life. While I enjoyed Weisberger's contemporary approach, I found that the content was entertaining but after awhile, it's like, \\"C'mon with the turning point!\\" If you're into chick lit, fashion, NYC, magazines, then this is definitely a novel for you. It took me longer than usual to finish, because it isn't quite the page-turner...but it's so cosmopolitan, stylish, and savvy. A must-read for young women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"This is a complete copy of the Nanny Diaries with less subadtance. if you want a quick funny read, read the Nanny Diaries instead of this imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"whiney, badly written memoir","review":"I know this book proclaims NOT to be about Anna Wintour, but the descriptions of life at Conde Nast are dead on. Although the book is mildly entertaining in that aspect, it is a boring and self-indulgent rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEEDS EDITING","review":"Okay, I admit that I have been a sucker for the recent Bridget Jones-esk books of twenty/thirtysomethings trying to make it in the big bad world but \\"the devil wears prada\\" was terrible. Andrea was an unsympthetic character with no charm. The book was plotless and Weisberger should have stuck to writing a memior about her life as a fashion editor assistant rather than writing an embarressing novel that will ensure that no one ever reads one of her books again. Lastly, who edited this book? There were so many poorly written sentences and grammer mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Movie","review":"Great title and promising premise, but the writing is dull-normal at best and you learn all there is to know about the story from reading the jacket. No insights await inside the covers. And the grammar is the worst I've ever seen in published writing... which is particularly astonishing since the narrator/heroine claims to be a graduate of Brown with a burning desire to write for The New Yorker. Hard to believe the book had an editor. Not only was reading it a waste of time, it was seriously annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully similar to \\"The Nanny Diaries\\"","review":"I was almost embarrassed for the author as I read \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" due to the fact that the exact same story was written last year by the co-authors of \\"The Nanny Diaries\\". I felt like I was reading the same book, only I had a much harder time identifying with Andrea, the protagonist in this book than I did Nanny (Diaries). I found myself wondering if it was just bad luck that \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" got published first, or if the author of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" actually knew of the prior and shamelessly copied those writters style."},{"rating":"1","title":"no plot, no point, no style....","review":"Although she was given an enormous opportunity to work alongside some of the most eccentric, talented, influential, and fashionable people in the world, Lauren W. failed to capture her experience on even the most obvious level. The biggest problem with the book is that it doesn't say anything - lists of tasks and errands do not make for fascinating reading. The characters at the magazine are oversimplified when seen through the eyes of our narrator, whose snotty attitude prevents her from seeing deeper than the designer clothes. This book is just a bitter tome written by an angry girl who cashed in on the name of the woman who employed her - employed her when no one else was offering. Unfortunately the narrator's insecurities about her lack of \\"perfect hair, perfect shoes,perfect body...\\" prevented her from seeing anything at the magazine other than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate letdown ...","review":"I love first-time authors as I enjoy hearing new voices in a world that often doesn't like to experiment. Unfortunately this book just doesn't do it. It's a rehash of many of the brand names that made Sex and the City - the tv show only - so great. But where were the great characters? I really could have used some! Or even one! This book just never caught me up. More fundamental: it was just a long series of anecdotes. Did anyone else notice that it didn't have a plot??"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil Made Me Do It","review":"I'll admit it - I read this book for the hype. They're making a movie, the title's catchy, it's a best-seller, blah, blah, blah. By the third page, any reader can see where the story is headed. The main character whines and complains her way around New York; all but abandoning those who love, support and need her the most for the sake of her first job out of school. A job, as we're reminded incessantly, \\"any girl would die for.\\" The ending is no surprise - but so long overdue, to say it was anticlimactic is an understatement. Please don't get me started on the author's writing style and tone... My friends and I wrote better notes in high school.Here's a newsflash: most jobs suck. In fact, most jobs suck, aren't in NYC and don't lend expensive designer clothes to their employees. This is one case where I'll bet the movie is better than the book. It really is the only hope for redeeming this drivel, I mean novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm way too old for this book","review":"In fact, I was way too old for it when I was 21. Sorry, I can not recommend this book. The characters are not developed very well. I feel absolutely no sympathy for the heroine who, if old enough to live on her own and take on the world by storm sure as heck doesn't have any self-respect or common sense. It seemed like a good idea for about 50 pages and then fell flat. I basically just skimmed the remainder to find out if anything ever really changed. For the most part, it didn't , the only character that seemed to have any growth in this book was one that had been on the peripheral during the entire novel. This book flew against the face of realism, ridiculously so...even for a piece of summer fiction. If you have a limited amount of time for your summer reading list, as I do...and you are over the age of 19 with your self-esteem and common sense fully intact, take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and easy","review":"I bought this book at the Linate airport and read in four days(!). There are some parts of the book that could be done better, but the general feeling is that is a really good book for its kind. It reflects the thoughts and actions of normal cute girl who enters in the advanced age of 27 - considering the field we're talking about - in the New York V.I.P. lifestyle.The story flows easily, almost naturally. Having lived in Milan, Italy for several years, which is the world's fashion capital, I found the book pretty familiar with stories I've heard or encountered.It's a good book, with happy end and all the necessary ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Live Up to the Hype","review":"So much hype surrounded this book. It was on the NY Times best seller list forever! I for one do not think this book deserved all of the recognition it recieved.For one the novel is FILLED with annoying typos, misspellings, and grammar errors ( as I am sure many of my own reviews are, but this is allowed because I am not a published author ;) ). That really annoyed me to say the least.Overall the story wasn't to bad. I mean it started out funny then got old quick. The characters were underdeveloped so it was difficut to get involved in the story being told. The secondary characters were mere snipbits and were practically useless.Bottom Line: The Devil Wears Prada is utterly dissappointing. While I didn't hate it enough to not finish I have to say having seen in on the bestseller list for so long I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Fishmouth is Sweeping the Nation","review":"Weisberger's follow-up to her 2001 debut \\"God Wears Pajamas\\" is full of faded ideas and tattered characters. In \\"GWP\\" she invented a St. Peter who hands out p.j.s at the Gates of Heaven. Portraying God as an advocate of the happy nap was an inspired idea, and it elevated this reader's conciousness to levels not achieved since I first read Camus. In \\"Prada\\", however, the gag of Satan forcing new arrivals to don uncomfortable garments seems contrived. So you didn't get into Heaven and now you have to sleep in golf shoes. So what? It's impossible for the reader to connect the dots when Weisberger offers fewer than you find in a typical elipses. While dissapointed, I still look forward to next year's final installment of this trilogy, \\"Buddha Wears Von Dutch\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"What a piece of garbage! I couldn't even finish reading this sad attempt at fashion fiction. The 'heroine's' sadistic attitude towards the poor puppy in the first few pages put me right off.The prose was forced, overly dramatic and unimaginative. The author seemed to be trying too hard to make her protagonist interesting, amusing, funky and cool but only proved to make her boring, repetitive, uncool, immature and throughly unlikable. Don't waste your time on this book. I'm amazed it was even published! Poorly written, ungrammatical, loaded with excessive adjectives,pretentious and very disappointing.A very silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Twenty-three year old Andrea Sachs dreams of writing for The New Yorker. Fresh out of college, she lands a job in Manhattan as assistant to the powerful Miranda Priestly, editor of the successful fashion magazine Runway. Although her writing abilities won't be utilized, all Andrea hears from everyone she meets is that she's landed the job \\"a million girls would die for.\\" Supposedly, \\"people who worked for Miranda got places.\\" The position is more of a college-educated messenger. But if Andrea can hang in there for 1 year, she's sure to get a great promotion. However, 1 year as Miranda's personal gopher won't be that easy. Miranda's like Cruella DeVil from Disney's Dalmatian movies. She's insensitive, demanding and just \\"cruel.\\"This had the makings of a hilarious book, but just failed to pull it off. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed!","review":"I am a very avid reader of chic-lit. I really look for novels that particularly deal with clothes or the fashion industry. Sadly, The Devil Wears Prada does not go on my recommendation list. The plot was dull and I was just reading it to get the book done with about halfway through!! You just keep thinking \\"Ok she hates her boss, so quit already!\\". There are some funny parts blended in with the overall dullness but you won't catch your self shedding comical tears any time soon. The story was a good idea but not good enough for over 300 pages!! I want back my [money amount]I paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"i read the book because it was highly recommended by a friend. It started off good but i honestly feel that she ran out of things to say and just started repeating everything over and over again. I honestly believe that the book can be summed up in 20 pages. There is no plot at all. I wouldn't recommend it. just read the first few pages and it'll be the same things as if you read the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Not Read","review":"Lauren Weisberger's, the devil wears prada leaves a lot to be desired. If you really must read this novel do yourself a favour and read the back cover and place it back on the shelf. What was the purpose of this book anyway? This novel was on the best seller list for six months? What did I miss?This novel is 360 pages of babble about a character that we know absolutely nothing about from a character we know little about. Someone should have told the author that void of a great plot, she needed to have, at a minimum, compelling characters. In the case of writing the devil is in the detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 'chick lit' novel with no substance","review":"Am I the only one to be getting sick of $15 novels that have nothing going for them but a silly, paper-thin storyline, references to Manolo Blahinks and 'hilarious' encounters with boyfriends/boss/best friend/dog? How dare people compare this and others *coughshopaholic,bergdorf blondes cough* with Bridget Jones Diary, which is more romantic comedy-style literaure then 'chick lit' (Men find it just as amusing as women.) and a good read to boot. The devil wears Prada is wooden, naive, stalls/starts and is so see-through it might as well be gossamer. \\"Beach read\\"? yes, if you borrowed it from a friend or you *really* want to drone out, but this book doesn't let you drone out, its actually hard to read because of the way its written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever title...a repeat through","review":"This book has a glamourous title and a fable of a girl who takes a job without realizing what it really entails. Nanny Diaries was actually more realistic and believable (i.e. there are probably more nannies in the world than assistants to a top fashion magazine editor).Good: Escapism and then suffering of the heroine who finally realizes what she wantsBad: Frantic subplots and suffering of the heroine for no discernable reason other than she is too dumb to leave. The nanny diaries, at least, you understood why she stayed in her job (loved the kid).Final: If you are into suffering, this is it. Otherwise, I enjoyed this month's issue of Vogue better.p.s. figured out that with her salary and the profits from the sale of her wardrobe and other perks, she came out pretty good for less than one year of work!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar & Crude","review":"I may be a little prude in this day of \\"sophistication\\" but I found the book vulgar and crude. I am in two literature groups and am used to reading and discussing many books but this book is the crudest book I have read in all the years. I loved the movie and so thought the book would be good. I am not into filthy language and animalistic behavior. The movie made me like the main character but the book portrayed her as a crude and base low class type character. Skip this book but see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will do??","review":"Maybe it's a little thing, but I found it irritating and implausible that Andrea and her friends use the phrase \\"will do\\" in response to the snooty orders they issue each other. These are supposed to be struggling 20somethings and they come off as arrogant and unlikable. The Nanny Diaries is basically the same story but is much, much better written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I loved this book, and I can't remember the last book I said that about. I read this book right after finishing The Nanny Diaries, and I enjoyed this book so much more. While The Nanny Diaries is cute and silly, this book was more mature and believable. I think you have to have some appreciation for the fashion industry, and the obsession with designer labels to appreciate this book. If a book doesn't pique my interest after the first 100 pages, I will not give it a chance, but I genuinely looked forward to the evenings when I could read this book, and had a hard time putting it down! I would definitely buy the next book from Lauren W. -- looking forward to it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"What a total waste of time. The author has NO aidea how to develop her characters--they were cardboard cut-outs. She did not give ANY detail about what Andrea's life was like before she interviewed at \\" Runway\\"( except for drifting through Europe and Asia with her boyfriend) I rather liked Miranda, at least her antics kept me guessing about what outlandish stunt she would pull on Andy next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up, reviewers!","review":"Lauren Weisberger, I hope you read this. Your book is terrific. I've published 5 books and thousands of articles -- only another writer would know that you don't need to be grammatically correct everywhere to establish character and mood and plot. Lighten up, reviewers! The book is funny, especially so for us \\"escapees\\" who grew up in NYC and now live elsewhere and can laugh at the absurdities, and relate to some of them. Many of the reviews that criticized Ms. Weisberger's writing style are themselves riddled with grammatical and spelling errors. And an Ivy League education does not a writer make, pardon the ungrammatical sentence. I loved The Devil Wears Prada."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I liked this book a lot because it shows how people can get out of touch with the people in their lives that matter most. Overall, it was very funny. I really liked the ending too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mmm, promising material but...","review":"Overall I found this novel disappointing. All the ingredients were there for a really satisfying satire/morality tale but they just never came together with the oompf they might have had in the hands of a more sophisticated writer. The heroine was not all that sympathetic, the villain not evil enough, plot lines either obvious or reiterative, climax really flaccid and unsatisfying. A few more drafts might have made a difference. A good book for a rainy weekend or day at the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"devil wears ungrateful","review":"i hated it, and not because it's chick-lit, or because it's stupid, but because the main character is SO unlikeable. Andi Sachs is a chain smoking, ungrateful, selfish girl who wants to be a serious journalist. Instead, she takes a job at Runway, the fictional Vogue. Ignoring the fact that it is a multibillion dollar company, and Miranda is the head of a HUGELY successful company, she spends most of the time saying how much better she is than a fashion magazine. It seems like Lauren Weisberger is bitter about her seperation from Vogue, and has decided Miranda is the villian, despite the fact that Miranda is a much more interesting character. Watch the movie instead: it paints both Andi, and Miranda in a much better light. Instead of Miranda seeming so black and white, Meryl Streep makes her complicated. I like chick-lit, and I like fashion, but Lauren Weisberger has written a book that incorporates both, but she seems to hate them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than the movie","review":"One aspect of this book that is undermentioned is the impact of having a hellish boss. I read this book when I was in that situation and it helped me have some laughs along the way. Other than that it is a little fantasy land to drift off to on a vacation. The relationship between Andrea and her best friend is truly examined in the book - a major piece that was likely left out of the movie due to timing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS ROOTING FOR MIRANDA","review":"This book is light, light, light. I was pressed to finish it -- but what the heck (I buy it, I read it). Andrea and her wimpy colleagues drove me up the wall. At least Miranda spoke the truth (for her!). I think the only people who would like this are those who have worked for someone like Miranda, or those who are really impressed by fancy clothes & designers."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I found this book very disjointed and trivial.Obviously, I am not someone mesmerised by the fashion world and cannot understand the fascination.It passed the time on a cold, wet afternoon, but I wouldn't recommend it for a stimulating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine until the end","review":"I worked at a Barnes and Noble and this book was on the bestsellers list for some time, so I purchased it and boy, was I disappointed. The \\"coming of working age\\" and \\"empowerment\\" story was well written, and the story was intriguing and amusing until the climax. I felt less empowered and more disgusted.

She just seems so whinny and not very smart either.Not sure if I will finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun book to read while sitting on the beach.","review":"Well, this isn't going to make literary history. It's a very, very fast \\"beach\\" read. Nothing heavy, nothing deep, just the story of an insipid personal assistant to a high powered fashion magazine editor. Once the pattern of verbal abuse, rudeness, and outrageous requests are established by Miranda Priestly (i.e. the \\"Devil\\") it goes on, and on, and on for chapter after chapter. I started to get fed up with the assistants constantly 'taking it' from the boss Miranda and couldn't wait for her to take action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun weekend read","review":"I loved this book. I also read the Nanny Diaries and although there are similarities to plot line, I was hoping it would not end the same. You will have to read it to see.

Take the book to the beach, or playground with one eye on the kids, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil Wears Prada Review","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was better than I expected it to be. To me, it's not supposed to be a book that makes you think. It's not an intellectual novel. It's an easy, fun, quick beach read. Put simply: A book you can read in a day. Weisberger is not an excellent, sophisticated writer, but she's good enough to create a story that's both funny and interesting. I will say this, I wasn't bored. I agree that it is similar to \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" however; they were two very different books (different subjects), but yes, they border on being alike in that they both have insane, over-the-top bosses. My two cents: If you've got time, (or if you're going to the beach), buy it and read it, but if you don't, I wouldn't recommend it. Weisberger is no Carol Goodman (\\"The Lake of Dead Languages\\" -a MUST read) or Donna Tart (\\"The Secret History\\" - another excellent book). She could have published a better novel, after all, she DID graduate from Cornell. Tsk, tsk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to stop the racial stereotypes...","review":"The book would have been okay except for some of the racial stereotypes. Why did the author feel the need to make it clear when the character was speaking with an african-american, yet never distinguished when the characters were speaking to other races. Were we to assume all the other characters were white???"},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"I found the book pretty entertaining. A Brown Univeristy litereature graduate crosses with a high-fashion, icon, of course personalites are going to clash. I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to see how it would end.I also found some inaccuracies but I over looked them. I thought the characters were very developed. I could feel Andrea's pain from Miranda's orders, etc. Although, I agree with the other reviewer, I don't know why she was so stuck on working at the New Yorker, I also didn't like how she, somewhat, put down fashion. I see fashion as a type of art, and expression, and a hobby.I kept asking myself what I would do in the situation. I probably would have stuck with it, seeing that I do not have the mass of problems she had. I also liked the side comments she made about such situations, quite humorous.Good, quick read. I'd recommend it to anyone who is into fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a best seller??","review":"I thought this was a good first effort by Lauren Weisberger although it really is no different from any other chick book, so I don't really understand why this one made it to the NYT bestseller list and any other one didn't. She does say in the acknowledgements that the people she named promised to buy multiple copies of the book if she named them, so maybe that explains the phenomenon.If you like chick literature, then I would recommend reading this book. I see it has some negative reviews, but it really isn't all that bad, it just has alot of hype, whether deserved or not deserved, you be the judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, Boring, Annoying...DO NOT READ IT","review":"This is one of those rare occasion where THE MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THE BOOK! Andrea's character in the book is pathetic. She whines and bitxxes about everything, and I'm getting VERY ANNOYED at her character. But since I started reading it, I have to finish it. Reading this book is a real TORTURE! Andrea is a forgetful snob who makes tons of stupid mistakes, and she does NOT understand the responsibilities of a personal assistant. She keeps whining about why she has to do all these things for her boss. Hello? That's your job, so STOP BITXXING! AND if she messes things up in her personal life, she blames it on her boss. How pathetic.I still don't know what all the hype is about. If you're reading this, here's my warning to you: DO NOT READ THE BOOK!Go watch the movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Amusing Fable","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is an amusing fable of the consequences of trading integrity for access to power. The author would have us believe that she was willing to trade one year of her life picking up kids, dogs, drycleaning, and coffee in exchange for a good recommendation for employment as a writer elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why all the bad reviews","review":"This book is hilarious. It had moments I could live without, but all in all I loved it. One of the reviewers ripped this book and praised Bridget Jones. I thought Bridget Jones was awful or maybe I just couldn't relate. The target market for this book seems to be (possibly) the post-college, present-\\"life after college kinda blows, what do you mean I don't get to run things\\", pre-career that I love reader.

BJ was more later twenties, early to mid-thirties and still looking for prince good-hygiene (having given up on prince charming) market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Unreadable","review":"This is the worst waste of ink in a long time. The boss is so maniacal that I couldn't believe the main character would stay working for her. It was too over the top. I got bored half way through and had to stop reading when I took a peek at the last chapter and knew there would be no great revengeful reward.Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"At only 30 I am too old for this kind of whining!","review":"This book was a real disapointment. I'd put this book in the same category of The Nanny Diaries. A long boring whine about young women who expect to have it all and resent their older female bosses who expect them to actually (gasp) work for their salaries. Yes some of the work demands are outrageous but get over it. That's life. I didn't feel a bit sorry for Andrea throughout the book. Boo hoo her boss made her work late and she was late to a party. The boss went home late to her kids! If she hates it so much then quit and do the real work to get a job at the magazine of her dreams. Save yourself the aggravation and read a different book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly clever author","review":"Lauren Weisberger did an amazing job of capturing a certain kind of American woman.Her main character, \\"Ahn-dree-ah\\", is a perfect example of an overeducated, racist, whiney twentysomething.\\"Racist\\"? The book's narrator frequently uses the term \\"redneck\\" to refer to people from the South. These southerners, rich or not, all have deep, torturous drawls, and in their tackiness aspire to the heights of elegance that the narrator and her boss represent.Ms. Weisberger must have encountered such women in college. Her portrayal is dead-on accurate -- unfortunately, she also effectively removed any sympathy I might have felt for the narrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure poop.","review":"What is the point of this book? Is it how can you cram the name of every overpriced designer label into a paragraph? Where is the plot? Who cares if this girl had a bad job? Big deal she told her boss off... Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disenchanted","review":"I bought this book after seeing the previews for the upcoming movie as it looked rather interesting. However, in reading the book, I became very disenchanted. I found the book disheartening as I read on about such a difficult person and superficial work environment the character lives in. So be ready for this. Laura's writing is wonderful however. Through her writing she develops the young women through her difficutl experiences in dealing with an eccentric and self centered superior as well as back stapping work colleagues. I realize this is fiction, I look to books to escape this atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nanny does fashion world","review":"The book is essentially The Nanny Diaries set in a fashion magazine - evil, unreasonable boss; excesses of filthy rich lifestyle in Manhattan, etc., etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fashion Insider?","review":"Supposedly written by an author with an insider's view of the fashion world, but when a book contains such gems as the description of a model's look as \\"heroine-chic\\", even us non-fashionistas gotta cringe."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and whiny","review":"I am about halfway through the book now and doubt I'll even be able to finish it. It details Andy, the narrator, working as an assistant to Miranda, editor of Runway Magazing (read: Vogue). I think she missed what her job title was in the interview - Assistant. You makes coffee runs, pick up the dry cleaning...The book is all about how awful Miranda is, but she is allowed to be - she paid her dues, unlike our herione who thinks she's entitled to the same amount of respect by virture of existing."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent read but the author should examine her stereotypes","review":"I read through the book very quickly as it was interesting. I was mostly offended by the author's portrayal of the Indian characters in the book. Contrary to the author's belief, not all Indians are meek and nor do their homes smell like curry. As an Indian, I thought her comments were offensive and based on racial stereotypes. The writer should have gathered more accurate information before using stereotypes to thicken her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Du-oh","review":"I bought this book because of the great title and after finishing it(that was torture). I just had to say Du-Oh. I think I just wasted money on something that I should have just borrowed from the library. If this were a movie, it would be Gigli or Glitter. Too bad amazon has no zero star or garbage icon rating because this novel rates a zero star or at least two garbage icons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow Up Already","review":"I read this book, and while I myself have had demanding bosses,demeaning bosses crazy enough to tell you to write something and then claim they NEVER told you to write that, and you then had to show boss where they WROTE it down I would of never done what her character Andrea did.I would of been fired for insubordination just for the sighing and the delibrate back talk with her little \\"Thank you\\". To show her boss she was supposed to be better.Not all of us get Mommy and Daddy to pay for us to go to Ivy Leauge colleges and wake up and know just cause you work for some woman for a year will you get a job at the New Yorker, tell me do you write for them now?I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"While the subject matter promised interesting reading, the writing is horrid.

It's a great beach read!Better than the movie, and the movie was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly fun and an easy read","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is a lovely book for taking on some R&R. Funny and biting, the story of our heroine's first job is sadly familiar to many readers. It is easy to identify with Amanda because she is so 'girl next door' and because so many of us have had a boss that resembled Miranda at least a little!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go away negative self-talk","review":"My biggest problem with this book is that the main character, Andrea, is constantly berating herself. It reminds me of the negative self-talk that drives young women to eating disorders and other self-esteem problems. I can't stand how critical women are of themselves, and I can't stand that this novel's heroine (!) is constantly engaging in this type of behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining","review":"I have to admit that I enjoyed the book to a certain extent. It was difficult to get too involved in it because the author maintains a surface level depth throughout the entire book. In other words, this is definitely not the most thought-provoking, earth-shattering book I have read in my life. Many of the characters were one dimensional and failed to evolve during the novel. I have to agree with another reader that the author failed to bring forth Andrea's true dedication. I was also sorely disappointed with the ending as I felt it was entirely cliche. If you want a novel that has twists and turns, this is not the novel for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"\\"THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA\\" seems to be a love it or leave it book. Turned out to be not my cup of tea. I only got through about 1/3 before I cut my losses and donated it to the library book sale. A better choice would be \\"TRADING UP.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"When I read this book I couldn't even finish the book. The main character, Andy was an uninspired lead and a boring one at that. I found it very difficult to relate to someone who just seems to be handed everything on a silver platter...it truly felt that she didn't have to work for achieving her goals. Thus, it made the book boring and complete out of touch with reality. Of course, sometimes you have suspend belief in novels, but I really can't do that for a whole book. Honestly, if this were me, there would be no book, because I would have quit that job instead of just complaining about it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but a bit too long","review":"We all know the plot. I thought the book was well written (better than I could have done) but it was about 100 pages too long. And the ending dragged out. An interesting story, though. A good rainy day read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper","review":"I have a word for the publishers out there. Just because a person likes fashion and \\"Sex in the City\\" doesn't mean they are illiterate. This book could have been a funny, entertaining look at the inside politics of a fashion magazine. Instead the book is a mishmash of fashion gossip without any story to kept it interesting. Did anyone...bother to edit this book?The idea behind the book seemed interesting enough-young woman gets job working for famous fashion editor-in-chief but where is the plot. There's some insider dish on the fashion industry but not enough to keep the reader interested. Miranda, the editor-in-chief, may be crazy but the assistant, Andrea, is a spoiled, whiny brat. Who am I suppose to like in this book? Andrea, I don't think so. Why should I care enough about anyone in this book to finish it?

My advice, as someone who endured the seasonal presentations, is to read the professional publications and NOT this opportunistic...version of events. Give it up, baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun movie/Awful book","review":"I made it to page 99. When I read that a 6-year-old who brought a box-cutter to school was in the 4th grade, that was it. That fact was soooo wrong, I couldn't stomach any more. I didn't like the \\"heroine.\\" The descriptions of the clothes and decor were more like name-dropping than narrative. Maybe that's what readers who liked this book wanted, but there's so much better fluff-reading in the world. (Like Janet Evanovich). And any person in the world who is as obnoxious as the Miranda Priestly character needs to be shunned. I liked the movie, but it was very good casting that made it work, especially the impeccable Meryl Streep who managed to create a Miranda that wasn't a cartoon character. I found the book in a bargain bin and paid 40 cents for it; that was probably too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, maybe slightly over-blown","review":"This is a good book, but what fascinates me most is that it has the most even distribution of reviews on any book I've seen on Amazon. 1, star, 2 star, etc. all get about the same votes. Take a look. You don't see it so even like that very often.This is a book that is really not for everyone. Being into fashion helps, and the author walks a wobbly line between glorifying the fashion industry and critiquing it.At any rate, it's a few notches above the movie, so if you enjoyed that, you would most likely find this book a fun and easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...so boring","review":"I tried really hard to be interested in this book but i quit. I just can not do it. The main character is a bland judgemental person. The plot lines are old, Andrea is so busy she did not pay enough attention to her boyfriend and best friend...so what? She is not a very likeable character. Miranda Priestley, outrageous as she is, was entertaining to read (which is a reason I gave 2 starts instead of 1), Andrea needs to develop some personality. I heard they are going to make a movie out of this, and glenn close might play Miranda, that would be hilarious. So go to the library and borrow the book, it is not worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The devil writes crap","review":"For someone who wanted to write for New York, ending up with such a novel it is not a good sign. I mean, I bet the devil is a happier person for wearing prada than if he read this awful novel. Sorry, but ...that's the ugly truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book is not even worth the time it took to read the cover with. There is no point to it and nothing of interest to it either. It is not light, funny, emotional or even \\"dishy\\"(whatever that is). The book is boring! BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my nanny back!","review":"I was very excited to read this book. I even broke my own rule of book purchasing and bought it new and in hardcover. Whoa, was I disappointed! I expected a lot more Sex and the City and a lot less Nanny Diaries. It was virtually the same book--just different girls in different jobs. The main difference is that The Nanny Diaries is better written.Like many of the other reviewers, the main character didn't move me at all. I wasn't sympathetic to her plight, and her reason for staying in this job just wasn't all that realistic. Many of the other characters had potential, but they just weren't all that developed. I would have liked to have seen more of the \\"twins\\" and of Emily. I would have liked to know more about Alex; however, we are only given one tyrannical phone call after another.Check this out from the library or borrow your friend's copy. But save your money for something different!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype! A total waste of time.","review":"I agree with the person who said that if you liked the Nanny Diaries, you'd like this book as well. Meaning, if you like vapid, \\"girls who should know better\\" characters in ridiculous New York situations, this is the book for you. Watch Ally McBeal? You'd like this book. Do we really need to read about yet another smart, capable young woman who falls prey to the allure of \\"City Life\\" and does stupid things in order to get by? I expected a trashy, Vogue-ish dishy read about Jimmy Choos, Manolos, and Prada -- and a character I could care about for at least a few days. But if you actually enjoy plot or character development, pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be zero stars","review":"I bought it because of the hype. I read it because I bought it. I returned it becuase I'm not a fool."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did they write my life story without my knowing it?","review":"LOVED IT!!!This book is so familiar to me. No, I don't work for a fabulous fashion magazine, but I do work for the devil and she does wear Prada!This is a must read for all you Administrative Assistans out there who are constantly asked to do the most ridiculous tasks every day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Reading...","review":"The writing in this book makes it painfully clear why the author endured the abuse described just for the chance her demanding boss would pull some strings for her and help the author get a job as a writer--she has no talent. Anyone who actually can write would have enough confidence in her ability to get a job based on merit rather than enduring the humiliation described in the novel. The characters are undeveloped and Andrea comes across as a whining, self-centered, insecure brat who expects everyone around her to feel sorry for her but who has no interest in anyone but herself.If you have a lot of time on your hands, you may find the stories about Miranda mildly entertaining; however, if your time is precious to you, this is not a worthwhile book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shoes don't fit","review":"Reading this book is like wearing a pair of Manolo's that don't fit. They cost a lot of money and look good but at the end of the day they hurt. A cute book but not worth the time to read the entire thing. Wait for the Cliff Notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I agree with so many of the earlier reviews. This novel was frustrating. The synopsis offered a good read. Sadly, the writer failed. The writing is horrible. There is little attention to detail and detail that was uneeded. I didn't care about any of the characters; they were entirely one-dimensional. Totally predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZzzzzzzzzzz!","review":"Repetitive. Boring. Gets slightly interesting near the end, but then doesn't tie up the loose ends of Andy's love-life. What happens with Alex...or Christian? Hellooooo? The one interesting storyline just buggers off and dies!!!

If it's printed, I'll read it. But I gotta tell you, I got half-way thru this book, and I gave up. Miranda Priestly is a boss from hell. Everyone around her jumps thru hoops to keep her happy. The main character, Andrea, spends all her time at work running errands and living in fear of Miranda. Who in their right mind would do that, just so they could get a shot at working at ANOTHER magazine? If you want to read about numberous trips to the coffee shop, the cleaners, putting up with irritating doormen, and not much else, this is the book for you. But after reading 175 pages of Andrea's errands, that was all I could take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat entertaining, but predictable","review":"I read about this book after I finished \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" and thought it sounded interesting and funny. However, I got a little bored with the whiny narrator and the predictable plot line. Basically, the whole book is about a spoiled Brown graduate who ends up working for a nasty boss. We've all been there and survived to tell about it, so what's so special about Andrea Sachs and her struggle to succeed in the real world?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny!","review":"This book is a must read! After 2 years of being a \\"personal assistant\\" to a high-profile executive in NYC, I can personally relate to many of the over-the-top and absurd demands that are brillianly and colorfully detailed in this amusing novel!

Not worth the money, I made the mistake of not following the reviews in the NY Times and others who all agree that this book is garbage. I heard that she got the job at Vogue but was not very talented to do anything so she made up scandelous stories, shame she has no ability and people keep buying this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worth skipping!!","review":"I wasted my precious dollars on this trashy book.

The most wonderful cast even on the dark side. Suzy was the model of the day. We all know about Joan Crawford and what a job she did. The book was great, but maybe this is where this author really got her ideas, but enough of the whinning and absolutely not a fragment of story line...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book if you're not expecting much","review":"I found it to be an easy, mindless read. There were some funny parts. It was easy to find compassion for Andy, the main character, but after awhile, I found myself getting frustrated with her. I suppose being young,impressionable and thrown into this world was overwhelming. I can see how young women would relate to her, as I found her character to be realistic.Overall, I felt the book was a bit slow and repetitive, and parts read like an ad for high-end merchandise. It lacked depth. I kept reading, waiting to see what happens next, but in the end, was left still waiting. The \\"big climax\\" I was waiting for was disappointing.That being said, I didn't find it terrible. If you're looking for a quick, light-hearted read, and you don't expect any more than that, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easy summer read","review":"I'd recommend this book to someone who enjoys the show on HBO \\"sex and the city\\". This is a book that'll take you only a few days to read, it won't challenge your mind, but it'll make you laugh and make you want to be this girl. This book is basically a chick flick - but I'd really recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delicious Trash","review":"While it's an entertaining and utterly mindless \\"beach read\\", Ms. Weisberger obviously has written an exhaustive autobiography of her fist post-college year. Having myself worked for a horribly demanding and selfish female CEO for many years, it was easy to identify with her frustration, degradation and lack of self-dignity and re-live the first years of my career. The only real humor regarding this book has been watching the fashion industry's reactions to the \\"INSIDE STORY OF THE REAL ANNA WINTOUR\\" which unfortunately is all this book amounts to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"I am fourteen years old and a fashion fanatic. this book was amazing i could not put it down. the way its written is very humerous and you really find yourself rooting for the characters and you are really able to relate to them. it is a VERY GOOD BEACH READ! this is such a fun easy read i totally recomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzz","review":"This is one book of probably three in my life that I simply could not finish. It could not hold my interest, and I was not drawn to any of the characters enough to get past the 3/4 point. You know how you and your girlfriends go through your early 20's focused narrowly on yourselves? For outsiders, it's torture to listen to the endless prattle. This reminded me of that phase. We get waaaaay too much detail about the lead characters banal, everyday movements and thoughts, which are compelling only to her. The more interesting book would provide, of course, the fly-on-the-wall perspective on the editor-in-chief's life. As it stands in this book, we only get tiny histrionic bits and glimpses of the most potentially interesting character. It's all just too dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"dialogue is like cardboard","review":"only buy this book if you want an inside peak at the fashion business, the dialogue is unrealistic and wooden at best. the editor is shallow and vain. hello? this is the fashion world we're talking about - it shouldn't be a shock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"People of taste- save yourselves!!","review":"The only thing clever about this book is the title. Because I have some faith in humanity, I'd like to believe that it would never be published were it not a roman a clef about a certain, famously difficult person. Miss Weisberger's characters are shallow, unlikeable, and one-dimensional contrivances who speak in horrible, wooden dialogue. The plot is a basic one which has been done many times to better effect by actual, talented writers. You cannot convince me that the author has any talent for observing human behavior as she produced no evidence of it in this, the worst book I've ever read. I never thought I'd be able to bestow that dubious superlative on another book since the day I read two chapters of Flowers in the Attic and threw it across the room in disgust, but V.C. Andrews is Leo Tolstoy compared to Lauren Weisberger.

I felt that it was poorly written and had a very weak storyline (if having one at all). While I chuckled at a few one liners, the rest of the comments, conversations, asides, and thoughts of the main character felt forced and unnatural. Then in mid-story, the author tries to bring on a serious tone in describing the drinking problems of the roommate and issues with our main character's relationships. All of this seemed quite false, however, in such a materialistic, shallow story about the fashion world. This story may be suitable for drunken sorority girls or fashion expert wannabes, but for the rest of us, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"This book is not only unoriginal (similar books include the Nanny Diaries, which was somewhat better) but very whiny. Despite her attempts, the author fails to convey any humour or gain pity for the protagonist... The Devil Wears Prada made me cringe; the \\"protagonist\\"(if she may be called that, as it is well-known that the author lived similar experiences) seems spoiled and unprepared to hold down a job. Basically, it reads like a spiteful dish-all about the author's boss (Vogue editor Anna Wintour). My advice: don't waste your time and money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Nuclear\\" Wintour Revealed","review":"This poorly written book exists only to reveal a glimpse of the miserable excuse for a human being -- and a highly regarded one at that -- who edits a leading women's fashion magazine. Is Anna Wintour of Vogue as beastly as the protagonist's boss Miranda Priestley depicted in this book? That's for the reader to judge. Whatever degradation author Lauren Weisberger suffered at the hands of the real Miranda, however, she got a two-book deal from her publisher, which is about one book more than her talents as a writer merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaaaa?","review":"Who edited this pap?First, Andrea says she specifically moved in with Kendra and co. because the apartment had a kitchen.She then says, about a chapter later \\"I thought about eating in the living room because there was no kitchen, but Kendra [and other roommate] were asleep there\\".In the VERY SAME PARAGRAPH, it says:\\"He tiptoed to the kitchen and came back with large garbage bags.\\"The above is only a small example of how the publishing world is going to hell in a Prada bag. The writing is appallingly bad, the characters completely undeveloped and one-dimensional, the situations completely ludicrous and the plot non-existent.What makes me ill is knowing that \\"writers\\" with actual talent are struggling to get ahead and this particular \\"writer\\" managed to scrape an international best seller out of one lousy job experience simply because the person about whom she is writing is supposedly famous.I wish books like this would be given less consideration - they give literature a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it!","review":"I saw previews for the movie of the same name recently in the theaters, and since I like to read the books first, I picked this book up. I do plan on seeing the movie and sincerely hope that it's better than the book. The main character, Andrea Sachs, lacks depth and isvery one dimensional - certainly not someone that you could care about. Miranda is almost too much bitchiness rolled into one individual. I guess my biggest disappointment in the book was that I kept waiting for the 'big confrontation' that seemed inevitable - where Andrea could finally tell Miranda what she thinks of her and her job and it just doesn't happen. The ending was a huge disappointment for me. I just felt that the ending was lacking the sparks that it needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"I wasn't aware this book was a bestseller or soon-to-be-movie when I began reading. Nor was I expecting great literature or insightful writing. But this book is scandalously awful. The main premise, that Miranda Priestly is not a nice person, is rammed home throughout the book. The characters are one-dimensional and disposable. The writing is poor (do publishers no longer employ editors?) and the dénouement implausible and rushed. How this book ever got published I have no idea.

An assistant for an editor who apparently does no writing. And somehow a year in this job is supposed to land her a writer's dream job at the New Yorker (you guessed it... it does.)This book offers no insight, no entertainment, nothing. It did not make me laugh. I did not like the heroine... or any of the characters. The 'plot' was inane. I cannot think of one redeeming quality of this book.Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HILARIOUS","review":"Worst book ever. This author tries to make the main character seem witty, funny and charming, but none of those goals is accomplished. The humour is too over the top and just does not cut it. The main character is completely unlovable, much like Carrie Bradshaw in 'Sex and the City'. This book was on a New York Times Best Sellers list? please."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book make the best seller list?","review":"This book is about a spoiled young woman with poor communication and decision-making skills who constantly complains about her insensitive employer's poor communication skills. There are some episodes where the writer builds some interesting conflict, but then the chapter ends and in the next chapter the essence of the conflict is long forgotten without any satisfying explanation of how it got resolved.Being a fashion-follower for decades, I was hungry for an inside look at the fashionistas. What a disappointment! I eagerly read the first few chapters. Half-way through I became dismayed, and then only skimmed the last half, uselessly hoping to find something worthy of my attention.If you have only enough money to buy one book, do not waste it on this vacuous story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"I enjoy a fun, mindless novel as much as the next chick (Good In Bed, Nanny Diaries, etc.) but this book was just plain awful. I found myself skipping ahead to see if anything interesting was going to happen but it just moved from one preposterous plot point to another with zero style or wit. The main character is such an annoying little brat that you start rooting for the \\"devil\\" (her boss). And one more thing: the spelling and grammar errors are just unforgivable. Wouldn't someone who is such an insider know how to spell supermodel Gisele's name? Or at least spell it one way consistently? I'll say it again: blech. If you still want to read it, I'm listing mine immediately on half.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I can't understand the hype around this book, nor can I really understand how it ever got published. The writing is simple and uninteresting, the plot is almost nil, and it's completely self-indulgent. I had much more sympathy for the mean boss Miranda Priestly. At least she was competent. There is no depth, no major style - the author uses big names to impress the reader rather than detailed, well-written descriptions of the clothes, parties, etc... A waste of money. I skimmed the last 50 pages to the predictable ending just so that I wouldn't feel like I threw $20 in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nanny Diaries Called... Devil Wears Prada STOLE my Plot","review":"I looked forward to reading this book. All of the hype made it sound like a fun summer read. THE BOOK WAS TERRIBLE!! The main character was contrived and all too stereotypical do-gooder.IT BORED ME TO DEATH!! If you liked the Nanny Diaries, you will hate this book!! It is the same plot only in the world of fashion instead of the world of an Upper East Side Mom.Worst money I EVER SPENT!!HORRIBLE BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books i've ever read!!","review":"This book was one of the worst books I've ever read. I thought it would be a fun read, full of insider gossip about Vogue, but Andrea, the narrator, was one of the most unsympathetic characters in recent fiction. Andrea is pretentious and spoiled and I thought if she mentioned the New Yorker one more time I would slip into a coma. She complains about all the thin women at the magazine, but tells us over and over again how she is 5'10\\" and weighs 115 pound. I didn't feel sorry for Andrea, who is at the beck and call of an evil Anna Wintour-esque character. and horror of horrors, forced to get fattening food for her -- in fact, by the end I was skimming the book and was rooting for the boss. The Devil wears Prada is boring, self-indulgent and badly written. Save your $$$ and read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"I loved this book. It made me laugh out loud numerous times and was extremely entertaining. I couldn't put it down because I could not wait to see what Miranda would do next. It's even funnier for those of us who have done time for people like her - yes, for all of you with doubts, they do exist!! The characters are very well-developed and the plot moves along quickly and smoothly. I have read some of the other reviews and think they're unnecessarily harsh with regard to the writing style. No it's not Shakespeare, but I don't think it was intended to be and it is written well. You will like the book if you are a fan of the Bridget Jones and Shopaholic type books. I'm eagerly awaiting another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devilish Dud.","review":"I was eager for a fun, summer page-turner, but this book made me more bummed out than relaxed. The writing is terrible, and at the end, I felt a little dumber for having actually read the entire novel.While the story about working for a crazy boss was somewhat engaging, and something most people can probably relate to, the character of Miranda seemed to be the only fully thought out and realized persona. The author didn't seem to know where she was going or where she was taking her protagonist. The \\"character development\\" was Less Than, and the ending seemed extremely rushed. I won't spoil the ending for those who have yet to read it, but I'll just say that it was not very believable that these characters would be acting in this way.It just baffles me that a piece of writing that probably wouldn't even generate a passing grade in Freshman Creative Writing 101 would actually be published! Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"This book is not thought provoking literature but I dont see what everyone is complaining about. It is supposed to be FUN. It was very fun to read, a guilty pleasure. The title alone told you that this book was major chick lit and not supposed to be intellectual. What is everyone complaining about??? I am an educated person and the grammer did not bother me one bit. A very good read. Highly recommend it espcially if you like fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I supposed to HATE the narrator?","review":"I think we were supposed to hate the boss but frankly, the whinny, self-pitying narrator got most of my wrath. So she works for a hard boss, a lot of us do and with a lot less perks than this chick got...plus, she knew it was only for a year - big deal! Did she think that she didn't have to pay dues like the rest of the world? I work in the entertainment world and have worked for people like this and know that it's a means to an end - I didn't take it out on coworkers, friends and my work...and I didn't really enjoy reading about someone who does. My advice - don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best thing about this book is the cover art...","review":"The only reason this book was published is clearly because the author worked for a high-profile member of the publishing industry who has made a few enemies in her day. There is no other plausible excuse for the hype surrounding this endlessly whiny diatribe of a recent college graduate. Everything is overly dramatized by the main character, and everyone is an affronting menace. The main character lacks any complexity as she is continuously martyred by The Real World. Even the antics of the evil boss suffer due to the incessant \\"I am a such a victim!\\" tone of the book, a sadly missed opportunity for an interesting read that would have probably been addressed by peers in a beginner level writer's workshop. The cover art is fantastic, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cute","review":"I do not recommend this novel, although it is interesting to skim the name-dropping about real people; the details about those real people are probably accurate, as they would not be protected by violation of privacy. Nonetheless, the novel seems mean-spirited. While the \\"Devil,\\" allegedly based in part on the author's former real-life boss Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, is a fascinating creature of arrogance and greed--and meaner than hell, maybe similarly to how some have described other \\"famous women\\" in real life--there isn't any depth to the novel. According to an interview with the author that I read on-line, Ms. Weisberger knows \\"this isn't War and Peace,\\" and has been surprised at all the \\"buzz\\" and about being called the new \\"it\\" writer. I don't think so. Cleverness and cuteness don't make for strong writing, no matter how many names one is able to drop."},{"rating":"1","title":"b-o-r-i-n-g","review":"This book presents itself as a quick, stylish read. It's not. It contains many structural errors. The reader is expected to embrace one-dimensional characters. It plods along- same-old, same-old, to its weak, predictable ending. This story could have been written by a high school junior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spicy but poorly written","review":"So I'm not ashamed that I wanted to find out about life at Vogue: the good, but especially the bad (!). However, this book made me feel like weak and depressed. Either you think Lauren is great and side with her against the monstrous AW, or you think Lauren can't write very well and probably deserved to be sent on meaningless errands. I fall into the latter category. There are some funny bits in the book but overall it was a little tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"YEAH, I heard such good things about 'Devil Wears Prada', but it's a completely plot-less book. If you have a boss that you absolutely hate then you may get a kick out of it. The basic gist of the story is a day-to-day recount of this woman's workday - she works as a personal assistant for an editor-in-chief of some fashion mag. in NYC. Apparently the author went through the same thing for 1 year of her life when she worked as an assistant to the editor-in-chief of Vogue. So this is somewhat autobiographical. You think that would be intriguing, but it's really not. Just a day to day spiel of how mean the boss is and how much she hates her job and they name drop top brand labels in every other paragraph. blah blah blah. No twist in the story, no story really. Definitely don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I read this book to see what the fuss was about and if it was indeed as good as other chicklit books.It isn't.The ending is more predictable than an episode of Friends. The main characters are horribly boring and one-dimensional. The story is not even remotely interesting, even if it is a thinly veiled revenge. It's just a waste of time and paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inside view of unfettered power","review":"I thought this was a fascinating look at how someone who generates lots of revenue is permitted unfettered power over underlings. It sheds light on not only the inner workings of VOGUE, but I suspect Enron, etc. Miranda/Anna can do whatever she wants to anyone because of her ability to generate income for Conde-Nast and all those who depend on Vogue for sales. The \\"rules\\" of common decency don't apply to her, either by her own or anyone else's standards because everyone depends on her for money. (I am asuming the book pretty much accurately portrays the authors's experience working for Anna Wintaur at Vogue). More of these kinds of books should be written. Maybe it would serve the salutory effect of curbing the excesses of executives when neither they nor their employer does so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Summer Read! On par with Nanny Diaries","review":"I devoured Devil in one day. Despite the book being too long (some parts seemed to drag on), I actually enjoyed Weisberger's debut and feel that it was on par with The Nanny Diaries. Even though the ending was predictable, it is more interesting than the ending of \\"Diaries\\"- which I think was a major flaw in that book. Overall a fun summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever","review":"a lot of hype, not even close.poorly written, bad plot, uninteresting characters.overall, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I kept waiting for something to happen. It didn't. There were no twists and turns; it was entirely predictable with an uninteresting ending. I can't believed I waded through this - maybe could've been more interesting if the book was cut in 1/2 and Ahn-dreah didn't last a whole year at Runway - it was too long for her and it was definitely too long for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"THE DEVI WEARS PRADA, by Lauren Weisberger, is an entertaining story.

But do I listen to my inner voice? No. I bought the book, I read it, I am shocked that this ranks as a NY Times Bestseller - I have to believe that it's how far down our society has gone, that this book is hot reading. Do they only poll the shallow and self-absorbed? The book has a plot, which earns it two stars. It is fraught with loose ends, no resolution for some of the main characters, and a one dimensional heroine who'd like to believe she's two dimensional. This is the sort of book girlfriends ought to write to each other on emails and chit chat about, not something they actually killed trees to manufacture, and certainly nothing that ought to go so far as to call itself literature, despite whatever rich kid college the author's parents were able to afford.

The writing is just plain awful and irredeemably tedious. There is no way this book could have been saved once she committed pen to paper. I must admit that I made it through only one and a half chapters before I tossed it across the room. My only regret is that the author wasn't there when it landed.

But all too quickly, Andrea realizes that working for someone like Miranda is the equivalent of indentured servitude. No request is too small -- or too ridiculous -- for Miranda to make, from tracking down a yet-unreleased Harry Potter book for her twin daughters to ordering $100 steak lunches that Miranda may or may not show up to eat.As the months pass, Andrea's job begins to cost her her family, friends, and boyfriend -- not to mention her own sanity. It becomes increasingly obvious what Andrea must do; and yet, she is somehow unwilling to give up and admit defeat.While Weisberger has taken on a comedic tone in relating poor Andrea's plight, the underlying messages are serious. Too many people, eager to climb the proverbial ladder of success, refuse to consider what it may cost them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I read this book (yes, the WHOLE THING), just hoping to get to the plot.

It takes me about 4 chapters to start asking myself why Andrea does'nt just march up to her nasty boss and tell her just what to do with her Prada. The supporting characters are non realistic and the book gave me an overall complex about how unglam. eating at Bennihana's is. I expected so much more from this novel but really all it manages to do is label sling excessively and make me wonder why anyone in the world would sell their free designer goods just to make a chunk of change. Keep those Louis Vuittons girl! Really dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devil Wears Prada - see the movie","review":"This is one of those rare cases where I have to say I think the movie was better than the book. Maybe my views were tainted because I saw the movie first, but I thought the consolidation of the story necessary to cram it into a two-hour movie actually made it stronger. Not to mention that fashion guru Miranda Priestly's character was so convincingly crafted in the book that reading about her horrid demands actually gave me a headache - a testament to the characterization but still not all that much fun.However, I'll be the first to say I have no real basis for reviewing this one because I am not a connoisseur of chick lit - my experience with the genre is limited to The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing and Bridget Jones's Diary (both of which, incidentally, I loved). So by all means, don't take my word for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book vs. Film","review":"Book is better than the movie.

The jokes aren't funny, the plot is far too undeveloped and the heroine is annoying. The entire book consists of her whining about her job.

It was an okay read. Enjoyable, but didn't have any real substance. This was not a book that entices a person to ignore the outside world and keep reading. Instead, it was the type of book you read for a few minutes each night before going to sleep. I didn't experience my usual \\"mourning\\" period after reading it that I do other books and was able to jump into a more intense book right after. It actually left me craving a much more intense read.My boyfriend and I even started refering to this book as diet coke. I'm not sure he actually remembers it's real title.That's not to say I didn't enjoy it on a superficial level and that I wouldn't contemplate reading it again in the future... but I don't see that happening.

However they should have just dropped more of the silly storyline, made the sex hardcore, and even add a few more, then at least they would have been able to make a real good film worth repetitive watching.But hey, we can't have everything we want, and the ladies were hot.

From the very first moment, you're caught up in the plot and furiously trying to turn the pages faster and faster in order to see what's going to happen. But, then, after about 170 pages of extremely well written, tightly packed, emotionally wrenching, pages, right at the very pinnacle of tension, it ENDS! Aaaargh! There's no excuse for this except pure greed on the part of the publisher. This book should never have been published without its sequel, \\"The Kif Strike Back.\\" I feel really bad giving such an excellent piece of work such a bad rating. But, unless you have the sequel handy (perhaps as part of the \\"omnibus edition\\" \\"The Chanur Saga\\" (which apparently ends without ITS finish)), I can't recommend you read it.

Cherryh's style of disjoint, clipped sentances along with her lack of detail on so many subjects which are crucial to the understanding of the interplay in the political game she is striving to describe, make reading her books aggravating in the extreme.That is not to say that she doesn't have some good ideas and that her plot is not interesting. She does, and it is. But it is so hard to read!

Our heroine, Wollie, is a perceptive, compassionate and funny woman struggling to survive in the LA maelstrom. She scratches from job-to-job, happily accepting an apartment-sitting gig to save on rent as well as a dubious role on a reality tv show, hoping to win extended life insurance for herself and her mentaly-ill brother.I enjoyed this book and its precedent. My quibble is that I think Ms. Kozak tries to do too much. The byzantine array of plots and subplots introduce us to a cast of characters so large you wish at times you had a scorecord to keep them straight.Given that, Kozak's writing is still energetic and fresh and doesn't reveal any of the burn-out that has crept into the writing of her contempoaries in recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining mystery","review":"Overall, a very entertaining book.

Matthew is now on book 15, he reads Tarzan constantly.We have the entire Tarzan series, plus almost everything else Burroughs has written. He really knows how to make a book come alive. Once you start, you can't put it down. The movies that have been made based on Burroughs books can't begin to compare to the novels.When I asked Matthew to review this book his first word quoted mine...\\"AWESOME\\"! Tarzan, and his creator, Edgar Rice Burroughs are TOTALLY AWESOME! We need to purchase a new Tarzan series (again!) because ours is falling apart from being read so much, plus Matthew wants a set of his own.What a classic!

The first few chapters were really good---exciting, gripping and helluva interesting. I couldn't put it down. The reason why i gave it 4 stars and not 5, however, was because i found the relationship between Tarzan and Jane so stale. It occupied only, say... a bit of the book? And everytime jane was mentioned, I wish the author painted a better picture of her. She was either invovled in some trouble and needed help from the hero ( it always seems so) OR she had fainted. Thank goodness the action saved everything.

I have read everything he ever wrote, and can say without a doubt his works are still thrilling and engrossing despite the years. Sure, there is nothing politcally correct about his books, but you have to remember WHEN these books were first written..and any attempt to water them down is a travesty. I still have first edition copies given to me by my father who purchased them when they were first published.Lose yourself in one of his wonderful books....step back in time..and enjoy.

It is a classic adventure story. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a great tale of adventure. I read this book in junior high school and then again in high school. I recently reread it again now in my thirties. It is still a compelling read. One grows to care for Tarzan of the Apes. The movies do not do it justice. The original is the best. A lot of the subsequent Tarzan novels do not measure up to this one. It is a bona fide classic of adventure fiction. It deserves a place next to works by Rider Haggard and Zane Grey. I find myself waxing nostalgic for youth gone by and Tarzan of the Apes is right there. A fun read at any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple concept that makes a great story","review":"The only Tarzan I ever knew of was the Disney cartoon. I used to love watching it, and to be honest, I stil like it. However, when I saw this book for free, I decided to try it, just to have something to read.From the very start, this book draws you in with great descriptions and vivid imagery. The story begins with a young english couple who get stranded on the coast of Africa. All goes well until the woman gets attacked by a gorilla.

I grew up watching Tarzan reruns, so it was fun to see the origins of the characters and series that I enjoyed as a kid.The story is filled with lots of action as Tarzan battles beasts, Africans, and mutineers. Intertwined is love for his ape mother, curiosity about his own people, and an eventual love story as Tarzan sets out to win Jane's affection.The story predictably saw Tarzan overcome great adversities, but I was surprised at the ending!

It holds its greatness until right around the time Jane Porter and her father show up. All of the sudden humor and romance are added to this story and while it's ok, it does change what could have been an amazingly great adventure story. Still a great book, but the whole indecisiveness of Jane and her suitors became extremely annoying towards the end of the novel. You kind of realize that Jane's only in it for the money, social standing and not what her heart is telling her. It's almost like Twilight with apes and lions, not really what I was after. However the parts that dont deal with Jane's adolescent puppy love make for great reading.By the way, to the reviewer that cried \\"racism\\", you're way off the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarzan Forever","review":"This was the one that started it all. The first book to feature the iconic character \\"Tarzan\\". Very entertaining and influential. But there are a few plot holes. Tarzan teaches himself how to read English, without ever hearing the language. He manages this by matching the printed words to the pictures in the books. A little farfetched, but not completely implausible. But how does he know how to spell \\"Tarzan\\" when he has never seen it printed and doesn't know what sounds the letters make? Regardless of that, it's a very enjoyable book that moves at a fast pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarzan as you never knew him","review":"Burroughs is a terrifc writer of fantasy.

The only portrayal I had seen was the Disney movie from when I was younger. In many ways I understand why the story of Tarzan is so ageless. It's a perfect mix of action and romance. It is, however, terribly clear that the book was written in an age of racism. Jane has an assistant who displays an incredible amount of stereotypical behavior. Apart from that, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action-packed stories!

I am an avid reader and am almost always immersed in the middle of a story, but Burroughs is one of the few authors that had my heart racing and gave a feeling of intensity of actually being in the jungles of Africa.

A truly adventurous read and definitely worthy of the title of \\"classic.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An adventure that will keep even reluctant readers entralled","review":"Burrough's Tarzan series is the perfect vehicle for capturing a young imagination. Burrough's use of verbal imagery causes the reader to feel sticky jungle air.

It was definitely a fun read, and leaves you hanging so that you HAVE to read the sequel.Yes, it does not set up blacks in a very good light, but one must consider the time it was written. In any regard, many of the whites were portrayed in unseemly manners as well (cutthroat, evil, stupid, cowards, etc.).

His story is interesting-I'll give Burroughs that much-but the writing is unimpressive. Burroughs was not first and foremost a writer, and perhaps he was uncomfortable with the attempt, but this book is verbose and quite honestly inept. It seems to me as if while Burroughs was clunkily setting down his prose, he would leaf through a thesaurus every time an idea was in the least bit sophisticated.Is Tarzan worth reading? Yes, as a sort of early compendium of the serial hero's requred traits, an insight into adventure and science fiction. You may get an insight into later works, like Star Wars and especially Indiana Jones. But don't expect to be captivated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable","review":"The plot was excellent.

We used this book in a couples' group over 7 weeks. We found the content and fill-in-the-blank style somewhat helpful, as it guided you into thinking and discussion while allowing you to think, not telling you what to think. We allowed the book to start discussion around the table with other couples, but there were times when the discussion was private, between spouses. Especially helpful was the weekly homework, where spouses were required to meet together and work through some topic for 45 minutes. Our entire group agreed the forced time together, talking, was one of the best aspects of the experience. I recommend getting a few friends togehter and working through the book as a group--the exposure to other's ideas, finding out others have similar issues in their marriages, and the accountability of the group will help this book have it's best effect in your marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for both doctors and patients","review":"rather than a how to behavioral book this book explores the human drama and issues of living with chronic illness -IE the chapter on \\"How are you?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect mower","review":"I am a woman over 60 who lives in a mobile home.

The front right wheel wobbles because it was broken. The grass box was missing all four screws, as well as the two C-clips used to hold the line from the motor to the controls. This mower is very loud compared to battery operated or electric mowers. Whilst using the grass box, clippings are blown up over the top of the grass catcher box, and into my face.

Do not leave it in the sun, the plastic will dry up and crack.2. Wheels are way too small. Your lawn should be very level otherwise you will be pushing it all day.3. The handle position is such that it digs into the ground so you actually have to hold the handle and push it with your belly.(hope you have a big one like mine)4. Don't take the height setting too seriousely. It can not cut that low. The motor stops and will eventually burn out.5. Cutting blande is narrow and thin.

I loved all the books in this series and I think this one may be my favorite. The reason behind that may be the fact that Kate goes after Brody instead of vice-versa.

What's more, most of the secondary characters come to life, especially \\"failed thug Nelson Pistek,\\" and the religious con man with the ever-evolving set of aliases. And the end of the book gives a promise of more to come. I think I would have enjoyed one less subplot to keep track of, but that's a small criticism.

'Color' by far seems the most exciting, dramatizing the drawings and providing eye-catching involvement in the symbolism of the unseen - while the black and white charcoal drawings might appeal most to artists who find color distracting.

You may not find the pianism of the likes of Rubinstein, Ashkenazy, or Rachmaninoff himself here, but it is a more than adequate account.The sound in both works in close and full, perhaps lacking the lustre of the finest engineering, but certainly adequate.

Additionally, the author has a poor grasp of punctuation rules. His inability to use commas appropriately negatively affects the flow of the story. The book could have used the assistance of a good editor.The story, about a man accused of murdering his wife and children, is gripping. The author does a fairly decent job of writing objectively and keeping the reader interested in the outcome--in spite of the poor writing style.For those who are able to ignore the grammar (incorrect use of plurals and possessives) and the constant use of \\"as,\\" the book will probably be a satisfying read.For those who are aware of the rules of grammar: buy a different author's account.

I'd skip this one, because it really wants to fit in a Little Coin Purse, not just help you make one."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor version of a British classic","review":"this is a terrible sanitized version of a great British classic... lots of funny scenes are missing ...most of the humor is completely lost in this awful re-working..if you want a simple characterless 24 minutes for little children fine...but if you are anticipating the Mel Smith 'fun for all the family' Christmas treat - forget it! It cites Mel Smith as the 'actor' but he is not!why oh why can't the original version be released in the US?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! This film does not have the correct voice for Father Christmas","review":"Beware everyone familiar with this film from British TV. This is an americanized version of what, to me, is a Christmas classic - and it ruins it. Mel Smith no longer provides the funny, colloquial voicing for Father Christmas. Instead you get a sanitized \\"posh\\" British accent, killing most of the humour. He hardly says \\"bloomin'\\" at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The staple of my family's christmas since it was printed","review":"Ever since I can remember, this book was out on christmas day and my mother would read to me in her best english accent. this is a timeless piece, there is always something new to it and we cherish the book. pure genius and enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Time regular","review":"I have had this book since it was published in 1973, and never tire of it.

ROLL ON MEL SMITH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"Do not buy this if you are looking for the original version from British TV. We had recorded that version on a VHS tape and wanted to update to a DVD version. I failed to read others' warnings that this version has been \\"Americanized\\" and watered down. The British (cockney) accent, unconventional language, and irreverence are what made the original a family Christmas favorite. This version is only appropriate for the kindergarten set. I am buying a separate replacement from the UK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalous!!! ridiculizes and demystifies Santa Claus","review":"My 3 year old daughter chose \\"Father Christmas\\" from the shelf of her school's library. It seems that the whole point of this book is to depict Santa Claus as cynical, indolent, and only able to find refuge in his several alcohol breaks. Is this the portrait of Santa Claus that my daughter should dream of on christmas eve ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Inappropriate","review":"This book was just brought to me by my wife...she was reading it to our 6 children at bed time after having got it from the school library.The \\"grumpy\\" attitude from Santa let alone the references from him drinking and using profanity is absolutetly inappropriate for anyone other than legal adults.This book is very discerning and is a perfect example of the degration our ethics, morality and adherence to \\"political correctness\\".If your child believes in Santa (God bless them if they do) don't buy this book and definately don't read it to them. It'll destroy the magic of Santa and Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageously INNAPROPRIATE and CRASS!!!","review":"My daughter innocently brought this book home from her school library hoping to have a nice Santa book the week before Christmas. Unfortunately, this book isn't even a story, intead it is a cartoon strip about a grumpy Santa swearing throughout his Christmas chores. One panel depicts Santa with his pants down around his ankles while using the toilet. Apparently, the only thing that make this Santa happy is booze.Not appropriate at all for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The expectations set by The Snowman were high as it is an excellent film.First off this short had dialog which was certainly not expected!The animation was ok and not nearly the quality of the first.The hope was extending the Christmas joy of the Snowman to/and through Father Christmas.Didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A childhood classic, ruined!","review":"For whatever reason someone decided to re-dub the original Mel Smith voice over with someone who doesn't sound grumpy, doesn't say bloomin' and swaps in words like vacation for holiday.

Mel Smith - the first actor listed is NOT the voice actor you get - apparently it is an American voice actor (if you look closely at the description) - I contacted amazon and told them about it - I am returning it for a refund and they are going to look into why mel Smith is listed when so many people have said it is not the right version!!

If you don't mind low res video, and just want something to mess around with, then it's fine. It does take good pictures, but if I wanted good pictures, I would've bought a digital camera. Same goes for the mp3 player, radio, and voice recorder. I wanted this for capturing decent video, and it does a really lousy job with what they should have made thier number one priority. I didn't expect too much from this camcorder for it's price, but it's pretty bad when my brothers digital camera, which was cheaper than this, takes much better quality video. So yea, your probably just better off buying a digital camera that records video, because it'll probably be better at pictures and video than this sub-standard camcorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad charlotte","review":"This band consists of posers that have no talent and have an awful style.

I now know much about Pieter Bruegel and the Netherlands in the 1560s. Would make a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging story on two tracks - present and past","review":"This novel runs on two tracks: the life of a London academic couple and their infant daughter on an early Spring sojourn to their second home in England's rural hinterlands; and a highly speculative and evolving narrative on the meaning and context of Pieter Breughel's 16th century paintings.On the latter track, the protagonist's personal quest eventually seems to get woven in with his art historical musings.The novel turns into a sort of \\"Keystone Kops\\" story for intellectuals as the action reaches its frightening crescendo. But all ends well. I was pleasantly surprised by the life decision of Martin's wife that enabled her to overcome the conseqences of his headlong fall into reckless adventure and financial shennanigans.A smart and entertaining book with an out of the ordinary structure, plus very well-crafted use of language and situations. A cerebral thriller of sorts that can be enjoyed at the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning book!","review":"This is one of the better books I have read in a long time. I know nothing about Dutch art in the 1600's, but I don't have to. Frayn lays everything out for you, and the art history is a vital and exciting element of the book.The book is so well written, you understand exactly what motivates the main character. Frayn's writing style is easy to read, but very well developed and intelligent. I had to force myself to slow down, I was so caught up in the plot, but wanted to enjoy the writing.Excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An art history page-turner","review":"Engaging story of an academic who discovers what may, or may not, be a forgetten masterpiece in a moldering English country home; his efforts to convince himself and his skeptical wife of the painting's provenance; and his increasingly complex scheme to swindle the painting from its owner, establish his place in art history, and pick up a couple of million pounds sterling in the process.Very enjoyable, fairly quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I certainly missed something...","review":"I also read a glowing review of this Booker award nominated novel, rushed right out to buy it, and must confess that my copy went straight to the local library sale within a week. I thought that the art history topic would be an enthralling component of the plot. Nope. Although I don't have an intense academic art background, I have taken a few courses and was surprised that the author couldn't spark more than passing interest in a complete new world of art historians, auction houses, etc. Ah well, at least the character development should be something special. Oops. No again. Other reviews saw this novel peopled by flawed but humorous, true to life subjects. I only read about fairly unintelligent, selfish, yet surprisingly boring characters. I frankly didn't care all that much about what happened to them. This author is off my list...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better read can be found elsewhere","review":"After reading the glowing New York Times review, I rushed to buy this book in hardcover. That purchase is certainly the worst I have made in some time, and I would advise others who have an interest in this topic or in works by the author to avoid this novel. In fact, I hate to even give the book away and subject someone else to the tediousness of this work.As an art historian, I anticipated discovering what the very clever Mr. Frayn could do with a highly fascinating topic. I am sorry that he could do no better, and would agree that the long-winded descriptions of the netherlandish political arena were overblown. In fact, they were discursive enough to cause me to lose interest in a theoretically interesting story with completely unappealing characters.For those interested in the topic, I would recommend Robertson Davies' What's Bred in the Bone. It is a far better read on all fronts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Premise Mired In Unabsorbing History","review":"I was fascinated by the theme of this book: What lengths will a man go to possess something that he covets? In this case, the object of desire is a painting which the narrator of the tale is convinced is the work of Bruegel, and he is prepared to lie, cheat, and jeopardize his marriage to obtain it. Although I laughed out loud at the narrator's efforts to rationalize despicable conduct, my enjoyment of the story was diminished by (what I deemed) the excessive descriptions of the political and religious forces in the Netherlands in the 16th century that shaped Bruegel's work. It is this detail which, although likely appealing to a reader with a keen interest in art history, significantly reduced the pleasure I derived when reading this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally disappointed","review":"after the vibrant read of frayn's media-satire (it had something with \\"tomorrow\\" in the title?), i was deadly disappointed by headlong. what a boring book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writer, not a great book","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, yet turned out to be pretty dissapointed. He gets 2 stars for being a good writer, sadly this book just wasnt interesting. The story grew stagnant very quickly, and seemed like a bunch of filler that I wasnt interested in. The main character started getting to the point where it seemed like verything he though about was a repeat of something he had previously said. I think the story had potential, but just wasnt executed well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't stick with it","review":"This had all the earmarks of something I'd love. I was an art-history major in college, am still a major museum-rat, and I especially love Dutch art. But the novel was sooooo boring that I gave up after about a hundred pages. The early dinner-party scene at the Churts' house was hilarious, but then the endless, dry art-historical and philosophical ruminations just put me to sleep. As other reviewers have said, it would have helped immensely if there had been illustrations of the works in question. But reading interminable descriptions of what various paintings look like, and how many different ways you can spell \\"Brueghel\\".... please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"I found the plot predictable; the characters unlovable; and the academic digressions ill-constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not force myself to finish","review":"I knew when this was picked by my book club that I would not enjoy it. I knew as I was reading the first 20 pages that I would not enjoy it. At 208 pages I decided to stop reading it. There are plenty of other reviews that discuss the flaws of this book so I won't repeat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the art history, hated the characters","review":"I'm not a trained art historian, but the only part of this book that I enjoyed was the investigation of the painting. I completely missed the supposed humor of the novel - I think because I didn't find a single likeable quality in any of the characters. This book got a great review in the local paper & was a disappointment. It's on it's way to the used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkwardly written about specialized subject.","review":"Headlong gets one star as in A for effort. The style is awkward and jolts. The subject matter -- mostly history of the Netherlands -- is near text book style -- and the characters are undeveloped. The lead characters stay married because one is Catholic. They smile at each other musing about the failings of their poorer half. Then they plan to have another child. Psychologically abhorrent."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could Kurt Vonnegut enjoy this?","review":"The book started off well enough but went nowhere.

I am alomost finished with it, and I cannot wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor plot, paper-thin characters","review":"This book was just awful. The characters were paper-thin, with no substance. The plot was entirely predictable, and pointless. I read to the end, thinking that there had to be some twist, some redeeming feature -- but there was nothing. Just what you think will happen, happens. It felt like a bad movie, there was never an original idea in the whole novel. The writings about art were dictionary-like, and without any special insights. Frayn wouldn't last a minute as an art history lecturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iconology, iconography, whatever you say Michael!","review":"This was, without a doubt, the most awkward book I've ever read. I've read text books that had more character development. Save your money and time. I can't even give it away because I don't want to make any enemies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"I found this to be a very enjoyable book for the most part. I thought it was a very pleasing combination of art history and modern comedy. Except for a few overly detailed digressions into art history (and I do like art history) the book moved along well. On the downside, although the narrator was likable, most of the characters seemed rather two-dimentional. Furthermore, though I did get a few laughs, the book was not nearly as funny as I was hoping for. On the whole, though, well worth reading--especially for an art lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, urbane, informative.","review":"One of the funniest books I've read in the last few years. His understated humor is marvelously accomplished. The dialogue between the protagonist and his wife (and the non-verbal communication borne in the silences between words) are hilarous. Art, folly, wit, and wisdom combine in a tour-de-force."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, and so funny!","review":"This clever, broad comedy had me stifling belly laughs every day on the train, as I commuted into the city and read. I loved \\"Noises Off\\", and this book has a bit of the same complicated, overwrought planning and fumbling, misinterpreted intentions, cleverness gone totally stupid, the destruction of pride that comes from tryong too hard to protect one's pride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book but didn't succeed","review":"This book does have some lovely writing in it. There are moments when I thought, \\"ah, at last, this is going to get good\\" and then two pages later I was back to feeling bored and antsy. The writing is clever in some spots and very funny but overall, those bright spots just aren't enough.There are interesting moments such as the lessons given about art history but Frayn goes into them in far too much detail such that they become boring and tedious. The characters tend to do things which are unbelievable several times over and in the end, I only finished it because it was for my bookclub and I was the one who made the recommendation to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, iconography....","review":"Michael Frayn's \\"Headlong\\" is a fun, funny tale of intrigue with the added kick of being a repository of \\"Northern Renaissance\\" art tidbits and curiousities. Reading this novel is akin to spending a weekend at a spirited seminar with very bright experts: One feels smarter for having been vastly entertained. This is a highbrow beach read with fun characters, settings, plot twists, and ironies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much history - too little story","review":"The book is one very long art history lesson. A career's worth of history. Worthy of a PhD thesis. I just wanted a good read but the pedantic writer kept adding more and more and more history. As a consequence, the book plodded along like an overburdened carthorse. Eventually, it freed itself of the cart and galloped thankfully to the finish. Don't bother to read the book. Just visit an art museum and enjoy a Bruegel exhibit."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and self-indulgent","review":"There is nothing worse than squandered talent and skill. Unfortunately this novel is the poster child for self-indulgence and narcissism. Frayn is a fine playwright and I highly recommend Copenhagen, but this novel is an extended narrative on the author's desire to be an art critic/philosopher, replete with long discursive sections that neither reveal character or move the plot forward. Female characters are a sham and are so unbelievable as to break the willful suspension of disbelief. Of course with this noxious stew in place it is no surprise that Frayn was forced to breathlessly resolve the plot in 5 pages or else, not withstanding voluminous ruminations on art and philosophy that could be better read elsewhere. Like a previous reviewer, I'm off to the used bookstore to salvage what I can from this book. A major downer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, if you enjoy an author enjoying his own cleverness","review":"For readers who fancy condescending and self-aggrandizing wit, this book could be a treat. It reeks of intellectual pride and sardonic misanthropy.

It was very low quality in it's making, and the instructions were almost to easy. I felt that for the price it wasn't worth it at all.

This CD is a 'Poor Boy' indeed, but no 'Hero'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Vignettes About Returning to Ones Spiritual Roots","review":"Roy Neubergers book is part biographical, part inspirational tome and part road map for those seeking the way back to their Jewish roots. The author nicely weaves a long series of spiritual short stories in his book as he makes his way from living a secular life in the suburbs, to a spiritual life based on the timeless truths of Judaism as written in the Torah. The authors enthusiam for his subject really shines through as does his hope for anybody seeking genuine fulfillment in life. One comes away thinking that coincidence is often G-d's way of trying to tell us something. The book is truly inspiring in that the author is able to convey his sense of mission to help others return to their Jewish roots without being overbearing. A marvelous and easy book to read that tugs at the mind, the heart, and sometimes the funny bone too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be Jewish . . .","review":"A Jewish friend of mine recommended this book to me. Although not Jewish myself, I had long wondered about the \\"hidden\\" (at least to me) lifestyle of observant Jews. I started out reading the book out of sheer curiosity, but soon I discovered that the writer had a very personal and uplifting story to tell. Anyone of any religion (or none at all) who is interested in modern spirituality and ways to attain it ought to enjoy and be inspired by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Central Park to Sinai","review":"In very warm and personal terms, the author explores the most basic of issues. Born into an extremely convential and sheltered exisitance, he found that everyting was not enough. The reader is inextricably drawn into his quest for direction, meaning and truth. His education and curiosity led him through a series of \\"-ism\\"s until he returned the that of his forefathers. The breadth of search and the sincerity of his effort make the book as informative and enlightening as it is touching and involving. Reading it was both delightful and rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great, Inspiring Story","review":"Roy Neuberger tells a great story about his search for meaning in his life. It is very inspiring to those still searching as well as to those who've been there their whole lives. It makes you appreciate the little signs G-d sends us that we are sometimes too busy to notice. Roy's personality comes through and makes this a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to my expectations","review":"The beginning is good, but the last 200+ pages seem very forced an formulaic. I finished the book because I had started it, but I didn't really want to. The story seemed to be heading in a predictable direction and I was disappointed at the end that I had wasted several hours of my life on this book. I love some of her other books like the Glass Lake and Firefly Summer, but this one didn't do it for me. I don't want to spoil the book by giving out details, but as usual the main woman is trod upon in some way and just sits there and takes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you will not want to put down!!","review":"I found this book very captivating...I would start reading it and before long, hours had passed and I had not noticed! You get drawn into the life and goings-on of the characters in the book to where you fill as if you have been to their town and lived there forever. A great book if you have a busy life..written in a way that if you don't get a chance to read it a day or two, when you pick it up again you it's as if you never put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Malancholy Beauty in Life: Echos","review":"For those of you who read these mixed reviews, do not give up on \\"Echos\\"! A fan of Maeve Binchy's works, I enjoyed this book. The landscape, the language, the people are very tangible in all of her works. Maeve Binchy writes about people living in Ireland with such color that you feel as if you know each place intimately by the completion of a book.Sometimes life is not what you expect. But just as people have hopes and dreams, each person has a story to tell. At times this book gives a melancholy tone, much like the sea-side town it takes place in. The overall story is as real and beautiful as life can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"After reading Tara Road, I was ready to read every Binchy book I could get my hands on. This novel started out very slowly, but by the time I got to the middle, I was glad I had trudged through to the \\"good part.\\" What I did not know, however, was that the middle was the ONLY \\"good part.\\" The last section of the novel was so disappointing. Clare changed so much, and in ways that were not true to her character. The Clare that Binchy had made me love would not have done the things that she ultimately did at the novel's end. If she had left out the first 200 pages and the last 100 pages, the novel would've been a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"trivial and boring","review":"Maeve Binchy is nothing more than a formula writer. She has shown that she can write a good friendship yarn; however, she doesn't seem to progress as a writer. Novel after novel, she churns out the same type of story-line. Perhaps it's time to turn her talents towards other topics. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I must admit that I was rather disappointed by this book. It started off prominsingly enough, we were introduced to intersting characters, each pursuing their own dreams. However, about three quater through the book, it seemed that the story itself was unsure what it wanted itself to be. Was it going to be about dreams, pursing or giving up because of other priorities in life? Was it going to be a romance? Or was it going to become a thriller, with a slightly crazy man pursuing his love? The book tried to bring in a bit of everything and ultimately left all the areas underdeveloped."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Maeve's best!","review":"Love it!

Maeve Binchy is usually a very reliable story teller and this book is not up to her ususal standards. The character descriptions are great in the begining but towards the end,the story line and characters fall apart. The ending is extremely unsatisfying.Choose another book by this author if you're new to Binchy,such as Tara Road.

I appreciate how well Maeve is able to make all the characters seem like real people.. they are never overdone and you can maybe even recognize them in yourself or in your friends. Perhaps one of the better aspects of any book I've read by Maeve is her story-telling style. Maeve is gifted at putting the words together, such that it seems like you are having a conversation with an old friend.If you have read by Maeve before, Echoes will not disappoint. If you are new to Maeve then Echoes will likely have you hunting for your next Maeve story. Echoes is a bit long, but once you get attached to the main characters (especially Clare) it's difficult to set aside the book for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful....this is a Reprint of a 1985 Binchy Book!","review":"I am always looking for new works by Maeve Binchy. Although I looked at the publication date before I purchased and read the description of the book, I failed to note that 2008 was the 'publication date for this edition.' This book was originally published in 1985. Be careful.....you may have already read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I ususually LOVE anything by Maeve Binchy...","review":"This book had an underdeveloped plot and was very disapointing to me! I love Maeve Binchy but I'm glad I didn't read this book before reading the Copper Beach, the Glass Lake, and Evening Class, which were all wonderful, or I never would have read another book by her. The characters start out so promising, and then their personalities become completely unpredictable towards the end. I think the plot wasn't well thought out for this novel, because the ending is tragic and severe, comes suddenly and really doesn't make a lot of sense. I recommend people read The Glass Lake, which is one of my favorites, and don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to curl up with","review":"This was my third Maeve Binchy experience and by far my favorite. Better than CIRCLE OF FRIENDS or TARA ROAD. A rich story, and wonderfully developed characters. The town of Castlebay is described beautifully, and Clare's experience at the university in Dublin adds a nice variety to the setting. I agree with other reviewers that the ending was not completely satisfying because it left me hanging, but I really did enjoy ECHOES. Pour a cup of tea, curl up with this book and be transported to your own Irish cottage in Castlebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story,but what is going to happen to David & Clare?","review":"This is a great story of life in a small Irish village. The characters are wonderfully real to life. Maeve really captures Irish village life mentality. Once you get in to the book it is hard to put down. I couldn't wait to pick it up and read when ever I had the time, it leaves you wondering what is going to happen next? I loved the story but not the ending. I wish we had known how things were going to turn out for David & Clare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Binchy's better novels","review":"Binchy happens to be my favorite author but this novel was truly disappointing.Yes,it had it's moments but overall it's was not very pleasing.I would'nt recommend this as a novel by binchy to read first.It would discourage you to read others which are mostly very good.Instead I would go with Tara Road,Circle of Friends,Evening Class or my fav-The Glass Lake.It was uneventful until nearly the end.Binchy is known for a slow beginning but Echoes just never seemed to get very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"tough to get into","review":"I have read many Binchy novels and have always enjoyed them. \\"Light a penny candle\\" being my favorite.

I loved it. Echoes is also wonderful until you get to the end. The ending is so abrupt and disconnected it is hard to take. The women is the story is complex and mulit-layered so it's a shame that we don't get to know how she handles the next phase of her life. I'm almost afraid to try another book this one was so disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it!","review":"I was in bed with the flu and wanted a comforting, long story to read and knew I could count on Maeve Binchy. Great characters, and an enjoyable read. I do wish the ending gave a little more information and I felt like the last part of the book was a little untrue to the characters, but overall a great book to snuggle in with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest about halfway","review":"Maybe it's me, but this book dragged on and on. I liked the beginning,but by the middle it became too repetitive for me. Who saw who in Dublin, who said what to who, who wore what. Like a movie that is too long, I think 100 pages could have been eliminated. How many times do we really have to hear about Angela's arthritic mother, or mrs. O'Brien looking tired? The limitations of Irish life in a small village in the 50's is very well done, as are the influences of Catholicism."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"Disappointed because it said it was a 6 air filters but only 1 was sent.

So the NOW series and Totally Hits series do indeed have a couple of \\"censored\\" versions of the tracks selected, but with 20 tracks per CD, it can be overlooked. \\"Only Hits\\" looks promising, even with only 12 tracks, but get to \\"I Write Sins Not tragedies\\", and the word God is wiped out every time it is connected with the word \\"damn\\" in the chorus. How ironic that a song called \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" is tragically censored.... Therefore, don't expect uncensored versions of Yung Joc, T.I., E-40, James Blunt, etc.... On the bright side, Cassie's \\"remix\\" is not remixed, but just an extended version with rap, running nearly a full minute longer than the 3:49 CD version.

The brass rings were rusting, and they didn't seem to line up right with the handle. The handles looked like they had been rushed through production, there were rough edges that needed sanding and the stamped name was smeared. The business end of the chisels looked awful, I only took out one chisel for inspection and that one had a small chip in the cutting edge. To top it all off, the packaging was for a set of plastic-handled chisels. It is obvious to me that whoever makes these chisels doesn't care at all about their product, so back to Amazon this one goes -- thanks for wasting my time Footprint. I went out to Lowes and got myself a set of stanleys that aren't great but they are a whole lot better than these, and cheaper too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Quality","review":"I have not used these chisels and am considering returning them. The 1/4 inch chisel has a cracked handle. The 3/4 inch chisel had nicks in the cutting edge. All the chisel will need some considerable work to establish a good edge. The handles and bolsters are not aligned well. I think I would have done better buying chisel from Harbor Freight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even a novice knows the difference.","review":"I am just starting in woodworking. I honestly hate this set of chisels for the disappointment they cause me. I bought this set thinking the wood handles would have a nice warm feel and would be nice to work with as I learn the craft. The ones that did not look like they were chewed on by a dog actually fit well. Only one of the 4 was sharp enough to cut into wood. Other users mentioned the ill fit of the brass ring and the corrosion and mine arrived in the same condition. Judging by the beat up look of the packaging it might have been the same set.

The entire book is filled with substance, and is immediately useful at work. Everything in this book rings true, and makes a lot of sense.This is the book I have been waiting for. It is definately a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little disappointing","review":"I guess I expected ALL the dirty secrets to be let out but they only cover most of the ones we already know about and the dirty politics that are played on employees when corporate considers them too outspoken and non cooperative. Let's face it, the workforce today is not one that wants its employees to be happy or to have fun while at work. Everything has to be political correct, watching out for everything you say that may offend others (especially with all the new cultures that have legally and illegally have inhabited the country), and God forbid if you compliment someone on the way they look!

It is both quite academic and practical (quite hard to find). The summary provided at the end of each section enhances understanding. It would even be better if the language can be improved a little bit. I found a few hard-to-understand sentences here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"I ordered Bust based on its Amazon rating alone when scanning Hard Case Crime books, not knowing what to expect. But the cover hardly encouraged me to dive in: it sat on my bookshelf, unread, for months.But when I finally dived in, wow -- what a surprise! Ken Bruen and Jason Starr combine to deliver a coherent, engaging story, the plot reckless enough to be funny without crossing the line of farcical. As the story alternates between the perspectives of four principal characters, as I reader I feel I am observing a developing train wreck, with the only thing certain about the outcome is it's going to get ugly.So while I wouldn't put Bust in the same top league as Hard Case Crime masterpieces Confession, Little Girl Lost, or Songs of Innocence, it's a highly recommended read.The sequel, Slide, goes even further over the deep end, edging close or maybe even crossing that boundary to farce. But despite their differences, each is recommended. Read Bust first, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"wast of talent","review":"Ken Bruen is a fine writer with a gift for creating truly nasty villians and that surely accounts for the appeal his dark vision of the nature of some humans has for readers. But this book has the look of a story he knocked over a lost weekend or two so he could pay his bar bill. It's like a rough draft of the first book of a diabolically clever series. He just doesn't seem to have the time or energy to work out the plot details that sustain even a shred of credability. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Churning through this book is a chore. Although it is a humor/mystery novel, there is no doubt about how events will develop, and these characters are about as appealing as preservative-laced, plastic-packages versions of the foods that are cooked in the home. Not only is it predictable, but there is a dramatic lack of humor, despite attempts to the contrary. It is written in the style of a Donald Westlake novel, but without the spark of liveliness that makes those so distinctive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"None of the characters were likeable, the story wasn't that interesting and it was really annoying how they tried to write an Irish accent. I hate when people intentionally misspell words and this book was full of them. Out of the 9 Hard Case Crime books I've read this was BY FAR the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"zoned out","review":"This is a very well produced piece of techno-romanticism - hence the title of the duo and of the CD.

I was mistaken, though.I must say that the German talking IS very annoying. I didn't think I'd mind it that much, but dang! There is too much of it, and it's spaced awkwardly within the album. The music itself is not all that impressive, either. I can't put a finger on what exactly it is that annoys me about it, but it definitely does not sit right with me.

I tried, I really tried but the book read very Mills and Boon and I was so bored and irritated I couldn't even finish it. This surprised me as the book came highly recommended by an old friend, an English teacher too! Maybe she had read it as a young girl, maybe it was suitable for secondary school students but I found it banal, almost like watching a BBC historical soapie on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"A great novel about love, loss, friendship, death, suffering and history. I loved the book but didn't care much for the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama at Eyam","review":"Having visited Eyam, the Plague Village, Brooks described Anna's town and the spread of disease in the village with right amount of creepiness I felt at the real village. The simple prose has been admonished by some reviewers as poor description and character building, asking for more flowery language. First of all, this book is about the plague and from the perspective of a simple woman--not a noble woman with delicate sensibilities. I appreciated the down to earth style of writing, as the character, Anna, appears to be a \`down to earth' kind of woman. She is an incredibly strong character, even though she demonstrates some poor judgement with her choice of lover--but haven't we all made poor life decisions? True, the ending of the book is rather farfetched for the time period , but the book is still an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb historical novel","review":"The book is itself a wonder. The attention to period detail and use of archaic, but accessible, language make it a pleasure to read. Having read about many \\"truth-is-stranger-than-fiction\\" events in the lives of real historical characters, I think some of the customer reviews are nitipicking the book's satisfying ending. I also think their quibbling over feminism in the novel is groundless. As a teenager in the 1950s, I was scoffed at for expressing some feminist leanings. Human nature remains the same throughout the times, and I felt nothing out of place in Year of Wonders. I'm looking forward now to reading Brooks' novel, March, and to someday seeing a good film version of Year of Wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, educational read","review":"I found this book to be so captivating. It is a sad topic and yet I found some parts of it to be very inspiring. I would definitely recommend it and feel that I learned something about people as well as history from reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Historical Fiction","review":"Since I was young I have always loved historical fiction and this book is one of the best I have ever read. Brooks creates an engrossing and enthralling world through the eyes of maid Anna Frith as she sees her rural english village ravaged by the plague. While some scenes are rather graphic about what the plague actually does to your body, they were done tastefully and in a way that is not meant to disgust, but simply to inform the reader. The plot is excelent, both interesting and well written. My one slight complaint is the ending which seems a bit unbelievable, but with the greatness of the rest of the novel, it is easily compenstated for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the ending seem familiar?","review":"This book started out strong and was readable, but the further on you go, the more oddly contemporary it becomes. But the oddest part of this book was the ending, which comes out of left field. Did any one else feel like they'd read this somewhere before? Like in a Diane Gabledon story? I wish I could put my finger on it, but by the time I got to the end, I was beginning to wonder if I'd read this book before!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending was Worse than the Plague","review":"Year of Wonders grips the reader in from its first page. This work opens the world of the seventeenth century to the reader and allows one to experience the horror, the fright, and the superstition that wreaked havoc across the plague ridden areas of Darbyshire England. The characters, to begin with, are intriguing. HOWEVER - The work suffers the most horrific anti-climax of almost any work that I have read. The story completely unravels at the end as the main characters make decisions that are completely out of keeping with the philosophies and the mindset of the seventeenth century. The ending of this book is not shocking, nor a bold twist in the tale - it is a pathetic conclusion that is so poor in its creativity that it diminishes the story that began so well earlier in the book. If you want an enjoyable read of this time period, I would reccommend that you real Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver."},{"rating":"1","title":"great period piece, but had too many soap opera moments","review":"Geraldine Brooks' research into the period and the plague is flawless -- her details regarding food, medicine, dress, class, and religion are intriguing and flow seamlessly into her narrative. Furthermore, her characters are deliciously well-drawn.Nevertheless, the final quarter of the book reads like a melodramatic soap opera. For a novel centered on something as heart-wrenching as the devastation of a small town, the author doesn't need to resort to far-fetched plotting to keep the readers' hooked. Also, the narrator's sensibility is far too modern for 17th century England -- I forgave it initially, but by the end, it became too much..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this!","review":"I know, a book about the plague, how depressing. Well, yes, it is a bit of a downer. HOWEVER, it is well worth reading. It gives us a realistic look into what life was like during the plague, delving into the isolation of not just one household, but an entire whole village, cut off from the rest of civilization and left to deal with the epidemic on their own, so as not to spread their 'plague seeds' to other towns.This doomed community struggles to carry on with their lives, while most fall victim to the infestation. They still had to work, tend the farms, attend to birthing babies, while nursing the sick, burying the dead, and taking up the slack of the fallen victims.There was also contraversy over the who was more effective - a medicine woman with her herbs and chants,or a doctor with his leeches.This book is well worth the read, and it really makes you think about how precious life really is. Thank God for modern medicine!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a book I wish I'd written","review":"As an author, I wish that I could have written such a fine novel. It was just about perfect, and although the ending is controversial, I loved it and felt that it fit. I first read the book not long after 9/11, and I loved that author Brooks could draw parallels between that year in Eyam and our own time, that then as now there were ordinary people doing extraordinary things to save their fellow men. I have re-read this book many times since then, and it is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I read exactly half the book and stopped.

The problem is the author needs to go back to writing school, since this is her first book. The plague is treated as a trivial setting I do not care for Anna and she does not care for anyone, even her dying \\"babes\\" it is all a nonsense teen romance story about Anna and her adoration for this Mr.pompelioni whatever....no character development and was of my time and money.I would not recommend this to why worse enemy and having read it, you could pay me handsomely and I would not read it again.can I get my money back?Is there a way to give it less than 1 star? stay away from this half-baked nonsense avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book missing pages","review":"Emailed book vendor BUT NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE.

Of course, you know it is the Plague that has attacked this town before they know it, but then you're into pages and pages of pus and purple spots, and the emptying of piss pots to the point of thinking, \\"Okay, I get it.

I did my senior thesis on the history of the plague many years ago. The information I obtained then did nothing to inform me of the day to day lives of the people who suffered during this time. Yes it is fiction, but well researched fiction and the tragedies felt during those times became real to me.The characters were well developed and the dialogue touched on how women were treated in those days. It was a wonderful informative story with a fair amount of suspense.Although you know what is going to happen, you don't know what the human reactions will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional!!","review":"I truly loved this book, but it was (as advertised with the title) very dark and tragic. I'd read it again, though and that's saying a lot because I'm picky!Anna is a strong character who's easy to relate to, which isn't always possible in novels like this. I like that it's based on a true story of a real village from this time and that just makes it even better for a history buff like me. The only problem is mine and it's that I'm so emotional I couldn't read it in public."},{"rating":"1","title":"story that had to be told . . .","review":"But the pace was too slow . . . the story was filled almost entirely with unlikable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick and interesting read.","review":"We read this in my book club. I loved it. I found it very interesting and thought Anna's growth as a person was amazing. She is a great protagonist. There are lots of terrible things in the book, it is about the plague. They are paced well, so it keeps your interest. I did think the ending was odd. It seemed tacked on to the book without really adding anything to the main story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexed Up Pseudo History","review":"Read the book because my book club had heard about it on NPR. I looked forward to reading it, and in fact it is competently written. That said, unless you are a Romance genera fan, I wouldn't recommend it. Yes there was a plague, and yes this book is loosely based on history, but it is throughly modern in presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment!!!!","review":"This wasn't a novel written to enlighten us about the Plague. It was written to ingrain us with the author's world views. What starts as an interesting book gradually denigrates as the plot becomes overburdened with Brooks' heroin, Anna, a \\"Super Woman of the 17th Century\\", while managing to present all male characters as hopelessly weak and flawed. The ending is pathetic. I couldn't be more disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Faint of Heart","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart. Geraldine Brooks, a Pulitzer Prize winner, has written a deeply vivid historical novel about an English village, circa 1666, coping with the Plague. The story is loosely based on a real village that voluntarily cut itself off from the surrounding countryside rather than spread the disease; a disease the villagers didn't understand in the least. Consequently superstition competes with practical compassion in the self-imposed cauldron of brutality and gruesome death. The writing is magnificent, drawing upon the vocabulary of the time. If you're brave enough to read this book, you won't soon forget the drama, or fail to appreciate the wonders of modern medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep disappointment","review":"Several friends recommended this novel, so I read it. I was impressed by the extent of Brooks's research and the apparent authenticity of the setting. But I found the novel shockingly trashy. Not only is it over-written in a flowery, gushing style, but Brooks threw in an excess of grotesque, sadistic and gratuitiously violent events beyond her graphic descriptions of plague sufferings. You name it, it's in there, from witch lynching to a near-crucifixion, to madness, to abortion by hot poker, to child abuse, to countless other horrors. Then, the ending trumps every soap opera imaginable.Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote the last 50 pages of this book? - Spoiler","review":"Year of Wonders is a terrific book! Up until the last 50 pages or so, that is. Then, it seems like another author took over entirely. Brooks spent most of the book creating a wonderful tale that I believe really captured the time and the people in it. Then, wham! Of course the rector turns out to be a fraud. Because where could you ever find a pastor, let alone a Christian, (Anna at the end) whose faith endures? And ending up in Algeria and marrying a Muslim? Way too much to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had great hopes for this novel, but found it slow going and was unable to connect with the characters, the story or the language. I gave up after some 40 pages. Obscure and antique words thrown in for effect (yes, the reader knows the story is set centuries ago and the language has changed over the years, but...) slowed the narrative. I love historical fiction, am fascinated by the Plague, and the cover art was compelling. Wish the book had lived up to its promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascianting...and so different to what I expected","review":"A fascinating book, wonderfully written, that was completely different to anything I expected. Hard and harsh, yet at the same time full of hope and joy, however hidden these may be by the struggles the plague brings to an English village."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving novel of survival and controversy","review":"Geraldine Brooks' Year Of Wonders pairs Stina Nielsen's smooth and clear voice with the story of an isolated village where a housemaid becomes a healer and heroine during the 1666 plague year. Excellent historical background supports a moving novel of survival and controversy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerising journey","review":"Year of Wonders took me on a fantastic journey into an age I didn't know much about. Geraldine Brooks uses compelling characters, vivid imagery and incredibly imaginative storytelling to reveal hope and love out of the most hideous and despairing of circumstances. I have since been googling facts about the plague as am now fascinated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm....what happened to the end????????","review":"The mood of the novel is sad and depressing but the author does a wonderful job of creating a character that you connect with. She is human, has her own faults which she is aware of, but has an amazing amount of internal strength to accept and move on from what life has dealt her. However, this book changed halfway through and the ending was completely ridiculous. It lost that historical atmosphere to the book where you felt like you really could be reading about someone's life during 1666. By the end, I felt angry like I wasted my time since the author shortchanged her own work with a stupid ending that fits nowhere into the rest of her book. Its as though she got tired of writing her own book and just wrote anything to finish it. Don't waste your time...I hate to say that because I really did like the book until midway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Renaissance soap opera with all the modern contrivances","review":"This is one of those rare occasions where a book's cover and blurb haunted me. I had found it in the library, and returned to get it. I read it in perhaps two sittings. It was gripping, moving, but...in the end, it fell completely apart. The heroes turn out to be monomaniacal hypocrites, I almost felt sorry for the heroine, only I could not conceive how she had succumbed to such stupidity. The rectors wife was perhaps the only person to draw from me any great sympathies. Her life is a tragedy in more ways than one, and as the wife of the rector, is perhaps more so now, though they seem a happy couple. Until she dies.The story is set during the true horrors of the plague but the web of entanglement is just a bit too contrived to be believed. I closed the book feeling cheated. In the end it felt a bit like a renaissance soap opera. I'm sure HBO could have a field day with it. All in all, a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing ending","review":"This book was wonderful to read, especially the ending. It tells the story of a woman, Anna Firth, who moves back and forth in society between the villagers and the decision makers during the plague year. Her observations are the heart of the book. The ending is particularly moving because all her prior beliefs about right and wrong are completely turned upside down. She must create a new sense of morality for herself in a new place and with a different religion (or lack of religion). The ending is difficult to accept, we want something else for her, we want her faith restored and in tact. The author was very brave to end the novel the way she did. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Year of Misery","review":"Compelling & predictably sad story of an English village wracked by the plague. Heartbreaking to read as a mother--thank goodness I cannot relate to what some women had to go through, before the introduction of antibiotics, which we all now take for granted. Depressing tale, very well written, with a glimmer of hope & renewal at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance Novel?","review":"This book can't decide whether it's a romance novel, lite historical or a re-tread of the same old issues about down trodden women of the world and their victimization. It would be far more interesting if the author had included more details of the plague era, not used such stereotypes for characters and given us more historical background on 1660 so we could imagine ourselves there. The cover art is quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Year of Wonders\\" is Wonder-ful","review":"\\"Year of Wonders\\" is an incredible novel. Geraldine Brooks manages, somehow, to gracefully intertwine incredible scholarship, thoughtful philosophy, compelling characters, and an engaging plot into a unified whole. The quality of Brooks's research and of her writing style makes it difficult to conceive that this is fiction. Anna Frith is an intelligent, believable, compassionate narrator, and it is her perspective that makes the novel come to life. The effects Brooks imagines of such a catastrophe on a village are entirely believable.My only desire is that Brooks would have had a different ending to her epilogue. Yes, it is necessary that Anna should find a new direction and meaning to her life, but the path that Brooks creates for her is highly unlikely and improbable and ruins the artistic unity of the novel. Otherwise, in my perspective, the book is almost flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story with an unbalanced ending","review":"I enjoyed this book -- I am a big fan of historical fiction, and found this story to be carefully researched and historically accurate. However, I was not surprised to read, after I finished the book, that the author Ms. Brooks was a Washington Post correspondent in the Middle East. The ending almost seemed like a way for Brooks to somehow include her knowledge of Islam in a novel about 17th century England -- it was a bit disenchanting, and subtracted from the believability of the novel. However, the rest of the novel was enthralling - I would still highly recommend the book to other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodice Ripper","review":"I wonder when real book reviewers, Pulitzer Prize not withstanding, will acknowledge that Geraldine Brooks is not that good a novelist. The book purports to be a story of one town's heroic decision, but only passing mention is made of that happening. Most of the novel focuses on the protagonist's \\"heroism\\" (She treats plague victims and learns how to deliver babies.) and her dime-novel, bodice-ripping love affair. If we want to read about the plague, why not pick up Defoe's JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR (he knew how to write) or PEPY'S DIARY. Either is far more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Year of Wonders","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Brooks is able to weave beauty into a story of death and despair. You find yourself reminded of those simple joys of living we all take for granted. We are also reminded that our future is in our own hands insomuch as we have the ability to keep fighting and living, or give up. This book explores the consequences of both."},{"rating":"1","title":"NON-Historical Hollywood ending book - a sales job if ever there was","review":"The author pairs up actual historical facts with unbelievable historical fiction to create a Hollywood book if there ever was. A country cleric with a library ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author should stick to non-fiction","review":"The author seems to try too hard to find a story in her research. There is much good historical information but her fictional story is very thin. The surprise ending was waiting to happen from page 1. Too contrived, poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought for a friend","review":"I bought this for a friend so I have no idea if she liked it or not. No more words"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda weird and gross, didn't like it very much.","review":"The premise sounded interesting enough. In 1666, a small English village quarentines itself to keep the bubonic plague from spreading. I couldn't wait to start it. However, the unsetting discription of a plague boil popping (only like 20 pages into the book) kind of grossed me out. Anna, the protagonist, is a young widow. She becomes enamored not only with the minister but his young wife. I thought her relationships with them would be interesting, but they actually weren't, and I was bored by the descriptions of things that didn't seem to matter. I wanted to finish the book, so I dragged through, but i was very disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting until the end","review":"I didn't really like this book -- I found it kind of boring. Most of the book describes the year of the plague and all the villagers that died (I'm not spoiling anything with that information). It felt like \\"Groundhog Day\\" -- the same set of events happened over and over with various villagers dying. I realize that each villager was a different character with different circumstances, but all the deaths just ran together at a certain point. The book just didn't have enough of an interesting storyline to draw me in. The ending was surprising and I was glad to have gotten through the book to enjoy the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied","review":"Pleased with fast delivery and book was in condition as was stated. Satisfied with purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it was longer","review":"I was surprised on how easy to read this book was. It sucked me in and I was disappointed that it wasn't longer therefore prolonging my enjoyment.Anna is a young girl who is widowed at an early age with two sons. The plague begins and her small village and the villagers take on the responsibility to quarantine themselves in order to prevent the spread of disease. There are many side stories and characters woven into the main thread making this book irresistible. I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read!","review":"The pages flew by as I was engrossed in Anna's story. Some difficulty with the ancient words used, but the gyst of their meaning was understood. So very interesting, would surely recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Geraldine Brooks","review":"After reading \\"March\\" and \\"People of the Book\\", I eagerly launched in to this book by Geraldine Brooks. I didn't think I was going to be able to get into a book about the plague. Rupturing pustules...really?! Turns out, this is my favorite of the three. It gives you an incredible insight into a dark period in history and tears at your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start but Disappointing Second Half","review":"Although the premise of this story is intriguing and the story is written in an engrossing manner, I was very disappointed with it's ending and almost felt betrayed by its totally contrived and ridiculous second half. It's really a shame that the author appears to have lost her good judgement in plot development as she had me completely committed to the story and its sympathetic protagonist, Anna, after the first page until she lost me around half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"I have always been fascinated by the Plague. This book showed a very real and human side to those who suffered through these horrible epidemics. A grear read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't end well","review":"I truly appreciated the view of the plague from the people and how a community might struggle after losing so many members, but the strange way this novel ended caused me to lose all respect for the story. I normally like Brooks very much, but this isn't up to snuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book. . . . terrible ending.","review":"I very much enjoyed the narrative of the heroine of this novel, probably because she thinks much like I do. The problem with this is that it is quite unrealistic for the time and place of this novel, not to mention the gender and status of the main character especially since this is supposed to be based on historical events. I was able to look past this issue (and a few other others) to enjoy the plot, sub-plots and various characters in this small village, but just couldn't in any capacity excuse the ending that seemed not only rushed but quite thoroughly ridiculous - this time not only for the time and place but even for the character herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-Historical Novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel after having read Caleb's Crossing and March. The writing is excellent and the vocabulary is very period- leaf fall, sennight! There is a subtle anti-Christian bias that might be masked from some readers by the religious context. Still, I was still intrigued by this satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't let anyone suggest it for book club...","review":"I deplore this book, and the only reason I finished it as it was part of my book club. So much was wrong with this book..and when you think the book couldn't get any worse along comes the ending. Historicaly inacurate, implausable and waste of valuable time, don't let anyone dare suggest it for book club, and if they do be absent that meeting, you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in kindle download","review":"After I purchased this book on kindle - the first on my new kindle - I found out it does not have text to speech. What a disappointment - next time I purchase a book for my kindle, I'll make sure it has text to speech and if it doesn't I'll just pick up a used paperback copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Brooks books in a week is ...","review":"probably too much. Brooks sure has a horrible (& probably realistic) view of humanity (& religions). I enjoyed People of the Book (despite some slow parts) but I had to stop half way through March and I flipped through to the end of this one. BOTH OF THESE LATTER BOOKS WERE SO DEPRESSING!!! Except for the last few pages of Wonders - hear lies the Hollywood ending as someone else noted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I bought this book after seeing it on a list (Amazon Listmania) recommending great historical fiction novels. I was expecting to learn about what it was like to live in the time of the plague, and how people dealt with contagious diseases while having a limited level of scientific knowledge, etc. But instead it was an unbelievable \\"bodice ripper\\" and I was completely, utterly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Year of Wonders","review":"\`Year of Wonders' is a complete waste of time. The plot is unnecessarily tragic, completely unrealistic, and totally ridiculous. Don't read this book, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of wonders!","review":"The cover caught my attention at the aiport when I noticed the much smaller subtitle \\"A Novel of the Plague\\". What I discovered was a true treasure. Anna lives life in a small relatively isolated village in England during the infamous plague year of 1666. The novel is voiced from her perspective as her village of 300 souls is wracked with not only the plague but the emotions, psychologies, and economics that traveled hand in hand with the dreaded disease. To look upon such a year of loss and devistation with anything but sorrow would be difficult. But Anna goes even further to find it a year of discovery, learning and growth. This book is sad in places, a bit gory in some places, but inspiring throughout. The author is to be commended for this fine piece of writing and it is a book I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating read","review":"Details of plague, death, fear, sorrow, helplessness... all felt so alive while reading this book. The story is wonderfully written; you feel for Anna - her losses, her loves, her determination, her betrayal. I wish the book had ended differently (won't give it away) - but I felt that the strength of Anna was somehow negated by her final situation & it felt somewhat out of place compared to the rest of the story. I still say \\"4 stars\\" - the final scenes were too few to overshadow this beautiful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Years of Wonders","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but it was very sad. So many people dying so fast from the plague.Never read anything about the Plague before, so it was interesting. How terrible to have lived back then when they didn't have the medicines to save your life.I wasn't too happy with the ending, as I wanted Anna to end up with the Minister Mompellion,but not all books end the way you want them to. We are reading this book for the Book ClubI belong to for next month."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book with a ridiculous ending","review":"I couldn't put this book down but then I got to the ending - the last 30 or 40 pages - and wanted to put it in the bin.What an idiotic ending! Seriously. Did the author's publisher call and say \\"hey, that manuscript had better be on my desk by 5pm\\" so she just photocopied a few pages of Twilight fan fiction and stuck them on the end?The ending is so unbelievable and ridiculous. I'm not going to spoil it for you but it's kind of like reading Huckleberry Finn and in the end Huck jumps on a train to Canada where he becomes a metaphysical poet and marries a princess. It's just that stupid.Apart from that, the book was fantastic. But the ending is so silly and disappointing I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I wasn't particularly excited to read a novel about the plague, but I really enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting, as was the story, the only thing I didn't really like was the ending, it just didn't seem to fit with the rest of the story. But I liked that it was historically accurate and based on a real events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant...","review":"A poignant account of the harrowing effect of the plague on one small village. The story depicts the realities of life in 1655 and the capacity for tragedy to bring out both the best and the worst in ordinary folk."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a \\"thumbs up\\" book!","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is fiction based on fact. Although the plague is the center of the theme, it is not as sad as you might think and how people carry on their lives in spite of the dire circumstances. I learned a lot about those times and the plague and how people really never change over the centuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not often that I dislike historical fiction, but......","review":"Way too many things were unbelievable in this novel. As an equestrian for almost two decades, I laughed aloud at one of the scenes involving the horse. Also, two people amazingly mastered herbology on their own in a matter of months. Third, if anyone was truly as selfless as the title character, sainthood is in order. Finally, the ending seemed like the author had basically just ripped the last ten pages off of some bodice ripper from the 5 and 10 and added it on. (Really.. Where did it come from???)While the time period and events were of interest to me, this book was just plain silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Year of Wonders Review","review":"The book Year of Wonders did not grab my attention to the story of the Black Plague. The theme was emotional and depressing, which wasn't entertaining for me to read for a free reading book. The book expresses feelings toward death, love and working together through such a difficult time. By reading this book you feel Anna's emotions when those close to her, such as family and loved ones, die because of the Plague. The plot captures a unique and mind-twisting love story that is looked upon as rebellious during that time period, along with a society working together and fighting to stay alive. Families have to decide whether to stay in the town or move out, risking spread of the Plague. Any decisions would hurt those around you, and death was a common outcome. Read Year of Wonders to find out if the society works together to overcome the Plague or are families selfish about surviving this tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I buy it?","review":"Can someone please explain why I am unable to buy the kindle version of this book from Australia?Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of Wonders","review":"I really enjoyed this book although when I read the Epilogue, I was in fact disappointed to learn that the author took liberties with the Pastor and his role in the book.

I have to tell you I really loved this book.

Eric's wife Nancy wasn't much better herself in that regard, but she shouldn't have been villified for wanting a career and NOT wanting children.Once again, LS came close to turning the male hero into a wimp. Nothing wrong with a guy cooking dinner, but for some reason, the scene with Eric making the cornish hens for dinner with Nancy didn't sit well.

Thank you for an awsome job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Door County, Wisconsin","review":"I have read this book numerous times because I live in Wisconsin and this book takes place in beautiful Door County in Wisconsin. I wanted the book on my Kindle, so I can read it again. A nice romantic lovestory."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know the setting well so I read the book . . .","review":"I live near Door County and have alway enjoyed my once-a-year week in the Door. Reading the book, I didn't have trouble working out in my mind just what was located where (I like to nail down these details). LaVyrle Spencer has a way of reaching the average American woman - that's why her books are so successful. But I look for characters with a little more depth. Also, Spenser's pattern of writing is very predictable. She uses lots of parallel structure - almost too much. But I still enjoyed the book - in factl the first time I read it, I couldn't put it down. I've read a few more of her books, but I just can't wax dramatically about them. I need a meatier story and Spenser doens't provide one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is comforting escapism?","review":"I enjoy a good romance novel as much as the next person and I don't think one need feel apologetic about reading them. I've read several of Spencer's books and have enjoyed them. However, I found this one intolerable. How can I feel the sense of escape, comfort and romance that I hope for when reading this kind of book when the major plot turns upon an extramarital affair? Like some other reviewers, I thought the portrayals of Nancy and Katy were disturbing; Nancy is depicted as such a bitter cold shrew (because she likes her job and has the self-awareness to know she wouldn't be a good parent) that she \\"deserves\\" to lose her husband. Katy is a selfish, rigid and unloving brat because she believes in obscure moral tenets such as \\"don't sleep with married men.\\"The novel does feature lovely descriptions of Door Country and some engaging humorous moments. Overall, though, I can't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can adultery be romantic?","review":"Right up front I'll say I didn't finish this book. I was so upset that Ms. Spencer could write a \\"Romance\\" that included and condoned adultery and turning your back on your own daughter that I could not finish the book. In the past I have read several other books by this author and enjoyed them, but next time I pick up a book by her I will research the subject before purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for phonograph","review":"We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this piece. My only critique of it is that I wish the top shelf was a little bit higher so that there'd be a little more room for records on the bottom to be stored vertically; they fit, but it's pretty snug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawiian Vacation?","review":"(A kid's review) I liked this book overall, except for the fact that the baby-sitters wanted to tow Dawn along on that school Hawaii trip- and she was on their side. I felt terrible for Dawn's mom- all she wanted to do was spend time with her daughter and WHOOSH! back to the west coast goes Dawn, without a care in the world about how her mother feels. There's even a paragraph in the story that goes like this: A trip to Hawaii? I'd already flown clear across the country. I'd been looking foreward to a nice, relaxing New England summer. Did I really want to go back out West so soon? You bet I did!That is terribly cruel and makes Dawn sound like a snobby brat without one care about her mother's feelings. This book WILL frustrate you in parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read!","review":"Don't get me wrong, i'm an avid bsc fan! but what i don't like is how it seems like the kids in the books are being forced to grow up so fast. I mean, the triplets one minute are big brats and the next are sitting for 10 year olds? Yeah, right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A casual read","review":"A book about a young boys transition to adolecence. Deals with all of the normal questions that arise as one goes through pubity.

An easy read for anyone a pre-teen and older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy textural questing","review":"Besides for the pretty decent centerpiece, but lead-off, track there isn't much more to hang your ears around than static sound manipulations at this point in the electro pioneers career, on what seems like a glorified demo disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very artistic... sometimes","review":"This album could have been a classic, but too much of it kills itself. A \\"song\\" of nothing but breathing noises slowed way down is not an artistic statement, or is it wierd. It comes off like pretention. That happens too much in this album, like one long rant from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. Yet it does have its redeaming moments. Kling Klang is a real artistic piece that is almost transportational. But as a whole, it falls short. It's a visionless, dirrectionless, conceptionless disapointment. But if you are like me, a compulsionary completist, and you just have to have EVERY kraftwerk album pick it up while you have a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful family story","review":"Family secrets, love and regrets are all powerful themes. Susan Wiggs uses them all together in a riviting story. I loved this story so much I shared it with my coworkers. Now I will want to buy another copy to read agian in the future. If you ever dreamed of a perfect love or ever had a sister, you will enjoy reading this book. Its a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and One-Dimensional","review":"Perhaps I just don't like this author's style. I found the book very boring from the get-go although I forced myself to read the entire thing so that I could make a fair observation.

Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming read about two sisters.","review":"Jessie Ryder and Luz Ryder Benning are two sister that could pass as twins but couldn't be more different. Jessie has returned to Texas afte 16 years of travelling abroad leading the photo journalist lifestyle. Luz has remained in Texas marrying and raising four children; three boys that she bore herself and a daughter that Jessie gave up to her sister, Lila.When Lila was born prematurely it was never thought that she would survive. Jessie walked out of the hospital never to return once she secured her sister and brother-in-law into adopting her child. The adoption has remained a secret for the last sixteen years but Jessie is back and she wants to tell Lila the truth. Why now after 16 years of silence, why is Jessie back? Through into the mix, a hunky widowed neighbour who has taken a liking to Jessie and you have got yourself a great novel about two sisters and finding true love."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been so much more if the filmmakers had b***s (guts).","review":"I got this thinking it was going to be a sexy jungle epic. Well, sexy, no - the Asian star was not utilized at all except for looking on as things happened - she was definitely attractive but it seemed as though the filmmakers were afraid of her sexuality, so much so that they didn't consider using it to make the film something to remember. As it is, it is a lot of fluff without a bottom line.As for Karzan, the 2nd feature, it may actually be more enjoyable because it's low-rent enough to provoke a lot of laughter, whether intentional or unintentional. Overall, these two films are nothing worse than the usual jungle dreck that has been previously released over various decades. They just fit right in with the dreck and let the viewer down, instead of keeping him, well, up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for weak back","review":"My mom is in her 90's and has a weak back.

Don't buy this book expecting to learn how to draw the pictures you see on the cover. The pictures it shows you how to draw are very low grade anime pictures.

Who does not want to be with the winners?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book if you actually know how to draw !","review":"This book shows many pictures , but it doesn't show you how to get there.Finished hands and feet, but NO INSTRUCTION whatsoever.

The laughs are non stop and that English humour is dry and simply outstanding.The entire series is represented here in all it's 1970's glory. So you need not worry about missing any of your favorite shows. This is a cool litttle package that is really well thought out.A classic that still has lots of life some 35 to 40 years later, amazing really!A good time to be had here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This video was not what I was expecting. I was expecting more content/video footage, instead it was more like a commercial lead-in for documentary. It may have been free, but not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Snippet.","review":"Far too short to do any justice to the subject matter, this little made-for-tv bit of filler is the barest outline of the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. One could forgive that, since it attempts to address a very complex historical event in 10 minutes; you can't forgive the absence of any fact checking. Anne Boleyn was not 29 when she was executed, she was 35 or 36, at which age she was considered beyond her prime child bearing years, which was an important element in her downfall. Skip this and look her up on Wikipedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected.","review":"The book vendor was prompt in the delivery and candid in the condition of the book. No complaints in this area.The book itself was recommended to me by a respected relative who has been very successful in the business world. I found the book to be \\"spot on\\" with its preparation exercises for the \\"one on one\\" job interview. In my opinion, it is a much better book on interview preparation than any of the more recent books on that subject that have been published. This is a useful and valuable addition to my personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for those who want social justice","review":"I saw a viewing of this moving film at my church recently, and left feeling a combination of righteous indignation and pride. Pride that there are people out there who are still willing to fight for justice, and righteous indignation because they still have to wage this fight. The fact that there are still systems in place in this country (the US), which is supposed to be free, to railroad people into pleading guilty to crimes which they did not commit is outrageous and sickening. This film opens your eyes, and should be shown in every church and meeting hall throughout the land, especially right before local elections!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A girl who doesn't give up","review":"This movie is amazing It shows the triumphs of a young mother fighting for what she knows is right, even if it means sacrificing herself.

Personally, I am finding it very, very difficult to find a GOOD Gamelan CD. In my opinion - this was not one! I don't want a Gamelan CD with anything on it but the ambient soft purcussive tiny gongs! I don't want nasal singing. I don't want see-saw violin-like string instruments. I don't want shrilly flutes. I bought this album and played it once. I ended up giving it away. I hope the person I gave it to doesn't resent me. If you are into that \\"raw, underproduced, barely engineered sound\\" then you might dig it. Next time, bring your microcassette recorder to a bonfire shindig in Bali. Same sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept spoiled by unclear printing","review":"This Greek Interlined New Testament has very small print & the readability problem is compounded by the worn out plates used to print the Greek text.Obviously in a Greek text intended for study by persons whose first language ISN'T koine Greek, it is very important that the type be very crisp and clear so that the various Greek letters can be easily distinguished. This goal has been achieved in other study material for students of NT Greek but not in this particular reprint.This book is cheap (& looks it) and commendably small but I couldn't recommend it to anyone since there are much better Greek interlined New Testaments out there.

Since culinary arts, and specifically pastry, is my passion and mid-life career change, much of the book didn't help.

It also fuels me with more information regarding what to notice in the food and the service when I eat out at restaurants.

Each chapter begins with an introductory paragraph by Mr. Lamb, but otherwise the show's creator and moderator is not injected into the material, which is presented as straight text rather than in an interview format.The short chapters make it a wonderful read in all circumstances, the material is engrossing, and one finds many suggestions for further reading here.

With a plot he already used a couple of times and filmed like he did also a couple of times, Dario Argento offers his daughter, not a bad actress at all, in one of his average work. It's no his worst movie but it's not fantastic either. The Hitchcock theme sounds sometimes like a very low budget music score, a pity! For me, not the revelation of Dario Argento's Art...This film could have been released decades ago, it's more like he didn't evolve at all and he simply makes the same recipe again and again. For ARGENTO fans only : You will find the mark of the master in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Guilty Pleasure","review":"Well, this is THE movie that trapped me into Dario Argento's horror world in no time-- the first one of his I've ever seen (not counting Demons which wasn't directed by the master himself.) Filled with bloody violence, sickly twisted family liaison, and absolutely over-the-top campy fun. A masterpiece? Depends what your definition is. I think it's one of it's own kind.

I loved both of those series (though they could drag at times). So, of course I should love Dawn and the whole Cutler series, right? Well, I was more than halfway into the book when she was in the attic for some reason and her brother molested her and I had to pause. I had read FITA many times and the molestation/rape scene read so familiarly in Dawn. So I picked up my copy of FITA, flipped thru to the part where the same thing happened with Chris and Cathy and lo and behold IT SOUNDED THE SAME BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME FLIPPIN PARAGRAPH. Word for word.I don't remember if I bothered finishing Dawn, but I do remember finding out that V.C. Andrews wasn't the one who'd written Dawn, that she'd died after the Heaven series.

I couldn't fall in love with my brother like that ever. This book would be ok if you've never read the Heaven series or the Flowers in the Attic series.Sadly this series gets worse. I picked up the whole lot of them on Ebay, and by the fourth book, I just put it down halfway through. The fourth book of the Dawn series is literally a copy cat of the fourth one in the Casteel series.I agree with others, Dawn is conceited, whiny and just plain stupid. The only part I liked in this one was when she was sent to the Meadows. That to me was halfway original. And it just sounded interesting to live without power or running water. As everything was said in this book, I kept finding myself saying \\"What's so bad about that?? Get over it and grow up!!\\"Now, the book Heaven. That's a good read. This Dawn book is written by the ghost writer, and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great book, but it could be better!","review":"The reason I think it could be better is simple--if you were in the same situation as Dawn, when her brother raped her, you would more than likely feel very insecure and embarassed about that. Dawn, on the other hand, seemed to forget about that situation until Phillip showed up in her bedroom. Otherwise, the book was great, and I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and twisted","review":"I admit I liked this book a lot when I was in my early teens, because of its suspenseful plot and its many sexual scenes. Fortunately, real life has never been like this for anyone. This book is about rape, incest, cruelty, betrayal, stupidity, and a host of other topics I would rather not even think about, much less read about. The main character is so stupid, it's hard to sympathize with her very much, and none of the other characters are worth two cents either. All of them are flat stereotypes. Be careful; this stuff will burn up your mind if you let it. But at least now I know how to identify truly horrid literature! This book has served a purpose after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn, the world's biggest dissapointment","review":"Dawn was a weak and woefull tale of a vain and prissy little bimbo. I.E. ''I filled my sweater better!!'' ''Was it a crime to like my blonde hair and blue eyes?'' This vainess posessed by Dawn was beyond like. It was to the point were she was willing to cut off her stupid hair and frame it for every one in the world to see.The plot was stupid because it concentrated too much around one particular thing. One highly unrealistic and pethetic thing I might add. Other characters in the novel were far to obsessed with the leading lady (The inspirational Dawn) this included people that really shouldn't have been, as well as people that were highly unrealistic in every way.This book is very, very annoying..Short and sweet. Dawn the story of a worthless try hard and her try hard friends and family.You really stuffed up V.C. Andrews."},{"rating":"1","title":"This deserves no stars","review":"All right, if I'd had my way, there would be no star above. This was a waste of my time, energy and the dollar fifty I paid for it. In fact, if I had gotten it for free, it still would have been a waste. Dawn is nothing more than a pretentious journey through some hicks pretentious life, her incestuous brother and her general stupidity (ie: blonde hair). Really, if you like wasting your time, your money, your energy . . . and your life, read this. Otherwise, burn it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great Book!!![.]","review":"this is such a good book!

Are they only handing out so many copies of this book for the Kindle? This is just another example of publishers being greedy, and preying on people's sense of nostalgia! To anyone out there thinking about buying this book for your Kindle, I say don't! Buy it used,then the publisher doesn't get a single penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story with a twist","review":"As all of V.C. Andrews books reveal...there are many twists and turns along the way of life. Dawn, a girl who finds herself torn between what she once thought as truth, and what she now knows as truth, is shown that life isn't always what you believe it to be. There is a slow start to this book, which makes one sort of believe that nothing too bad will happen. However, when it comes to it, we learn there are many secrets in the Cutler family, and Dawn is just one of them. To write much more would spoil everything entirely. I would personally recommend this book to a teenage girl trying to discover who she really is. Also, I would recommend this book, and the entire series to anyone willing to get a taste of what lies and deceit are in a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"Dawn was the best of all the v.c andrews books I have read so far.

You never want to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"I read this book a year ago and did not enjoy it. However I recently read it again and I loved it. Throughout the whole book I felt so sorry for Dawn. She had to deal with fitting into a ritzy private school, and then fitting into another family. Her Grandmother was absolutely horrible to her, as was Clara Sue. I hated Philip for what he did to her. By the end of the book things began to work out for her and she was able to get away from her terrible family. This book is worth reading a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!! COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!","review":"I could not put this book down..I stayed up until 6 AM one morning reading it!! that's how good it was! I am now reading the sequel,\\"Secrets Of The Morning\\" and i think it may even be a little better! this book is a must have!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of different...","review":"I was a teenager when \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" was first released and I loved the book so much that I would have read anything that VC Andrews wrote. However, as I've gotten older, my appeal for the VCA books has greatly lessened. Maybe it's because of the \\"ghostwriter\\", maybe it's my own maturity and preference for a different style of writing. The only book from this series that I had previously read was \\"Darkest Hour\\", and I really did like that book - however not enough to pursue the rest of the series. I ran across \\"Dawn\\" at a rummage sale and bought it for 25 cents. Although I did read the entire book, I still wouldn't buy the rest of the series. I guess I just can't get past how someone could lust after their own brother - whether biologically related, or just raised together. It's very wierd. If I found out today that my brother wasn't blood related to me, there's still no way I could think of him as anything but a brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This book of course was an excellent novel. But I couldn't imagine going through everything that Dawn went tthrough. All of V.C Andrews's characters seem to be so much alike, they're always beautiful, strong and determined and they usally always get hurt in so many ways. Also all of her books seem to have something in commmon, incest, forbidden loves, and family love. Anyway, I really liked this book, I can't wait to start Secrets of the Morning, I hear it's very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh-so-dramatic but it held my attention ;)","review":"Dawn's life is turned upside down when she discovers her parents were keeping secrets and have been on the run (without spoiling things, these *parents* are candidates for the biggest pair of dumb*sses ever in a fictional novel). Now she's forced to live with people who resent her and treat her to cruelty piled upon cruelty. To add to the angst, she's also all mixed up inside sexually about the two boys' in her life. Jimmy was raised as her brother and Philip (her boyfriend with the groping paws) who she recently discovers *is* her brother. Ehhh, what a dilemma!I have to admit that I was absolutely riveted to this story while reading despite all of its over-the-top drama and other assorted flaws. Four stars for the keeping-my-attention factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn wasn't original!!!","review":"I'm was so dissappointed in Dawn. I knew what was going to happen to Dawn from the first chapter on to the last. It was so predictable, i.e long lost rich family, incest, a grandmother who hates her, and a weak mother and father. Before it was \\"revealed\\" I knew she was dating her brother. I also knew her brother was going to still want to carry on their relationship. And the sister hating her, now that was a stretch of the imagination, NOT! This story was so predictable, maybe because the Andrews family won't let the writers stray to far V.C. Andrews original Flowers in the Attic series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to believe!","review":"This book was important for me to read, because it followed Darkest Hour, but all that incest of made me sick!!!

Well with those gorgeous blonde locks turning into a short curl, not the mention her girly ho blue eyes have gone grey, and her sex appeal has lef the building! I HATED GRANDMERE!

Stark film making from talented director of \\"Trainspotters\\" and \\"Shallow Grave\\" has its moments, but as a whole it doesn't add up to much. Owes much from similar films such as \\"The Omega Man\\",\\"Dawn of the Dead\\",and \\"The Crazies\\", just to name a few. Energetic(at times frantic)camera work, appropriate lighting, music and sound, take away from the fact that we've seen all this before. A few good scares here and there and some truly riveting scenes may keep some fans of the genre from cutting this one loose, but inconsistencies in the story, unintelligable dialouge and one-dimensional characterizations will quickly disappoint others. Clearly not for all tastes, but for those who are game, you'll have a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror no, Interesting no, waste of money Yes","review":"I watched this movie thinking that it was really freakin scary. Wrong. Some parts may be somewhat startling but not at all scary. In this movie as the suspense would be building up there would be some stupid joke or they would cut to another, more quiet scene. The plot in this movie is not bad, and neither is the acting, but the actual story line was a waste of time. Along with poor cinematography and crummy picture quality made it a real waste. I can't believe i wasted money on seeing this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"some love it, some loathe it","review":"This movie is, in a word, terrifying. You will be terrified, too, if you enjoy well-plotted action and suspense, thinking during your movie-going experience, realism on the big screen, and suspsense over blatant gore. You will likely *not* enjoy this movie if you prefer the George Romero-style of horror that zeros in on the undead tearing flesh, bone, and blood from their living victims as they (same victims) scream and writhe agonies of death throes. I can understand why some folks do not go for \\"28 Days Later.\\" But this movie had me creeped out for many days after I first watched it. The DVD extras are all great bonuses, too, from the extra endings (even the one that is only a narrated storyboard) to the short \\"making of\\" feature, which is not really a \\"making of\\" feature! It's more like a \\"how likely are viruses to be the end of the world?\\" feature. All in all, a great package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Not That Scary.","review":"This movie was good. It kept me entertained but I thought the directing was cheap and poorly done. The zombies however made up for this. They were terrific and life like! It wasn't as scary as I suspected but I jumped maybe once, but it was pretty graphic. People who haven't seen this movie should probabally wait until it comes out to video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring and lifeless","review":"A terrible, terrible movie. Honestly, the only thing this movie has going for it is the cool cover art. I admit the plot is kinda interesting, but the dull characters, unconvincing zombies (the \\"Infected\\") and utter lack of fright factor bury this movie. The only scary part is in the beginning, and it has NOTHING to do with zombies, or the movie. Its a random thing that happens. Overall, the storyline was hard to follow, the characters were dull and uninteresting, and it was basically one of those movies you watch just because you're interested to know how the director/writer decided to end this piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs, unless you're a rabid zombie/horror movie fan, in that case rent it nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, cheap blu-ray, get what u pay for.","review":"The blu-ray look exactly like it did in theaters.

It starts out like it's going to be really good with the atmosphere of the deserted streets but it soon just turns into one of those movies were you keep waiting for something to happen, but never does.

The first encounter with a zombie kills one of them off in half a second and this guy was supposed to be a survivor? The Nazi like camp they encounter iswhere everyone gets their highbrow ideas about this movie. It didn't bring me to any revelations. I already know people suck without a movie sucking to tell me bout it. How about some makeup for those dracu-ombies? The living people looked as much like zombies as the others. Please just rent the classic or even the remake of Night of the Living Dead. Otherwise its a horror suspense movie for poeple who don't usually like that sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is awful!!","review":"This is an absolutely pathetic movie that is neither scary or interesting. The characters are boring and they leave you at the end of the movie hoping they get killed. It is such a low-budget movie that its no wonder it only lasted in the movie theaters for a few weeks. That should tell you all you need to know about it. The actions of the main characters in the movie make no sense at all. I'm upset that I even wasted the $4.00 to rent this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Er...is there a point to this?","review":"I felt like the movie kept me entertained in the beginning, when it was all about the zombie-things and all. But there was that totally unnecessary shot of the main actor's nether regions. What was up with that? Anyway, I was mildly entertained through the whole beginning, but then all the sudden, the zombies weren't important anymore. What was important was that the two girls escaped being raped by the army guys. YEAH, RIGHT. We entirely shifted focus, and I found it terribly stupid. And the ending was the stupidest thing I've ever seen. It was a terrible disappointment when I had been wanting to see it for so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"I watched until the end but I wish that I hadn't","review":"Starts out great then about 1/3rd of the way through the characters start to make such stupid, unrealistic decisions that I almost turned it off. Ultimately, it wasn't worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and not scary","review":"My expectation was big and what a disappointment. This movie is kind of mix between \\"Day of the Triffids\\" and \\"Dawn of the dead\\".In my opinion, they simply copy both films to make this one so for someone like Danny Boyle, the director, I will consider his work as a real disappointment, possibly a mistake. Why to make such a movie when you know that you won't make better anyway ? Romero made a masterpiece with Zombies longtime ago and nobody never challenged his work so far.28 days later is first of all, not scary at all!!! Quickly, it becomes not very interesting and easy to imagine what will happen next. 2 stars for the scenes of the EMPTY LONDON, a real exploit in my opinion but what is the point ? This film doesn't deserve your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst BD Quality so far","review":"The movie itself is quite enjoyable; I already have seen it a couple of times before, but did not mind watching it again at all in BD (which is the only reason that convinced me to give it 2 stars instead of one).But, DO NOT watch it in BD! The regular DVD quality is much much better. Recently I've been watching new BD movies or even movies that I have already seen before in BD because I really enjoy the high resolution & high definition quality. This movie however is NOT IN HD QUALITY. This honestly without exaggeration is the worst Bluray quality I have ever watched so far.I can't believe how they would exploit people like this by just producing Bluray disc without improving the definition (which I thought was the point of BD) so that people would once again buy the title, expecting a much better quality of this amazing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"28 Days Later","review":"First off this film was NOT A ZOMBIE FILM. It was a film about an infection that made the carrier turn into a homicidal bezerker. They did not eat their victims they just tried to infect them by bleeding on them. Nothing zombie about that. The film was passable for what it was, a cutesy little horror film. I will forever be haunted by that idiot main caracter walking through the deserted streets yelling hello. I watched this saying to myself please kill him. I have never wanted the main character of a film to be killed faster than this guy. I just didn't like this poor attampt at horror movie making. P.S. 28 weeks later was even lamer than this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"resident evil........gone cheap!","review":"i will admit the zombies were pretty good but the storyline was just horrible i was about to leave the cinema before it ended take my word for it waste of valuable Time!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, original, and with great acting","review":"28 Days Later stars heartthrob Cillian Murphy. I never saw him before this movie and I must say I was very impressed. He is a great actor and really shines in this film. I like the fact that the cast is mostly English and that Cillian's love interest is an African American Naomie Harris; you don't see that much these days.28 Days is rather gory and is for a real horror fan, so if you think you're up to it then by all means see it. It is worth it and will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's got everything: drama (of course), a love story, horror, etc.AND the best thing is that the actors aren't ones you've seen over and over again (like Ben Affleck or Tom Cruise)...they're new talent! If you enjoy watching Cillian, which I'm sure you will, then you can also see him briefly in Cold Mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool twist on the zombie genre","review":"I have to admit that I did like it better when it was called Day of the Dead, but I still really enjoyed this movie. I have always been a big fan of the Romero zombie movies, so seeing the infected people in 28 Days Later was something different. \\"Zombies\\" that run and seemed to be a little bit smarter than the ones I was used to was a pretty scary idea. And the fact that the people weren'tt zombies, they were just infected with a disease was a cool twist too. The first half was my favorite part. Before it turned into a Day of the Dead homage (rip-off?). I also thought it was stylistically very cool. The transition from dv to film was awesome, and had a great effect. This review is pretty lame as I am trying to watch my new RES magazine DVD and type at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could of been great - buts its only good","review":"NOTE: I haven't watched the DVD version - this review is based on the theater versionLike many other reviewers have pointed out, the movie takes a pretty big plot turn in the middle of the movie. I thought the first half was great - but the stuff with the soldiers just didn't work as well. Had the four characters from the first half continued their journey's through post-apocalyptic Britain, I think the movie would have turned out more as a character study with a crazy zombie movie background. Unfortunately, the zombies just sort of disappear from the plot in the middle of the movie.Thats not to say that it isn't a good movie - its just sort of too bad that it isn't the awesome movie it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"PICTURE QUALITY IS AWFUL","review":"Im not sure what happend in the blu ray transfer of this movie, but the picture is absolutely horrible. Dont buy this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible resolution","review":"This was the most awful picture quality I have ever seen on a blu ray OR even on most DVDs. I haven't been able to tell online whether it is because of the poor quality of the cameras that were originally used, or if it was because of a wretchedly poor transfer onto blu ray. I tend to believe it's the former. If so, that's unfortunate. If it's because of the transfer, that's downright inexcusable. In any event, this is not worth buying on blu ray. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful BluRay","review":"Spending money for the Bluray version is very foolish. However much you like the movie, and I did like it, the Bluray is awful. Grainy, soft, loaded with halo artifacts from the transfer's effort to increase sharpness, and it's a disaster from start to finish. Buy the DVD if you must own it, but go cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"28 days later is a great movie","review":"I like horror movies a lot. That's why I bought 28 days later. It's a great great zombie movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie genre flick updated","review":"This is basically the old zombie movie plot updated. The zombies are those infected by a virus let loose on the world by misguided animal rights activists. What sets this apart is that it is well made by the same team that did, \\"Trainspotting\\" and that it is British. Good, fast-paced, suspense film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you time on this like I did.","review":"Don't waste your time buying/renting/watching this movie.This is NOT a zombie movie as they have advertised.You see more human than zombies in this movie.And the main leading male character just plain stupid. Being a total wimpy coward and trouble maker in most part of the movie and all of a sudden at the end of the movie able to defeat a whole squad of British army and saved everybody.If you want to watch a good zombie movie, go watch Dawn of the Dead. Even the poorly made Resident Evil is much better than this one. Avoid at all cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Picture Quality","review":"As has been pointed out by some others this is NOT a BluRay disc that even comes close to anything approaching HD quality.On my 55\\" HD it looked like an SD TV broadcast;This is an excellent movie but I wouldn't have wasted my money on this low quality BD if I had known how disappointing the image quality was going to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"28 Days Later, What a disappointment!!!","review":"When I first heard about 28 Days Later, it was made out to be a zombie flick. IT IS NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE!!! The so-called zombies are people infected with a virus known as RAGE... The \\"Zombies\\" run around screaming like idiots, kill their victims and run away screaming again... Most zombies eat their victims after killing them, they don't run away screaming! If you are looking for a zombie movie, this is the wrong place to start! A friend of mine seen that I was going to buy the movie and said don't do it and I wish that I listened to him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait for it to be over!","review":"I saw previews for this and thought it looked awesome. I was badly mistaken. It is slow, boring, and unscary. Less than halfway through it I was ready to leave. I kept expecting something scary to happen but it never did. Horrible film! Don't waste your time. I wouldn't have given it any stars if that was a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"and it started out so promising...","review":"I really wanted to like this movie, it had a good concept, (albeit stolen from 'The Stand'). The thing that threw me off the most aside from the horribly put together script, was the fact that the 'infected' never once attacked each other. They were practically lobotomy victims, how did theyknow that they wanted to infect others?TOTAL CRAP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks so bad, you've got to see it","review":"...I've never watched a movie and actually felt that it was soooooo bad that I wasted an hour and 45 minutes until this one! I sat there waiting for a movie to break out, but it never did. This has to be THE worst movie I've ever seen. It is SO bad that to tell you not to see it would be a mistake. You've GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE to appeciate how bad it is. But, watch it on cable or watch someone else's copy... don't waste your money on it. ...P.S. I recently picked this up for $4.00 because it was packaged with another movie I was already going to buy. It's still a rip off, but now I can show people how bad this movie was (yes, it was that bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: NOT HD!","review":"This movie is NOT 1080p. When you watch it, you'll notice in the first minute that this is a re-mastered SD version. Total waste of money for those that actually care. I loved 28 Days Later when I first saw it in SD some years ago. Amazing movie. I was so excited to see this in beautiful HD on my 46\\" Samsung LED... only to be angrily disappointed by the video quality. This is a hoax--do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad blu-ray DO NOT BUY!","review":"Great movie, terrible transfer to blu-ray. I bought this when it originally came out on dvd and loved it. Picked it up when it was released on BR hoping to have a brand new experience but I was wrong. I've seen better quality video on VCR recordings left over from the early nineties. It's absolutely disgusting that the blu-ray community keeps paying high dollar for trash transfers like this. DO NOT BUY ON BLU-RAY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless film","review":"Man, I'm having a rough streak lately! Another bomb. You would think that the director of \\"Trainspotting\\" would put out another original piece of work. You'd be wrong in this case. And then the box has the nerve to say this is the scariest film since the Exorcist? Please- it was neither scary or even comparable to that true classic. Last movie made that claim was \\"The Ring\\", and that box lied, too. That's it,no more buying movies with the word \\"Exorcist\\" on it. I should know better. Boring, overlong zombie film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely disappointing movie!!!","review":"I love horror and sci fi pictures and, going by the adds and hype, made the mistake of buying this on DVD before actually seeing it. I strongly recommend you rent this movie before wasting $20.00 on it. This is my opinion and judging from some of these other reviews, I either saw a completely different movie or I am too critical (which I doubt since I usually like crappy movies most others don't).The only thing I enjoyed about this horribly filmed and acted movie was when the damn thing ended. I cannot tell anyone what to think nor do I imagine my opinion matters. I just strongly advise anyone to borrow or rent it before spending good money on it! In parting here is a thought, I own over 1000+ DVDs that I have bought over the last 5 years.I feel so strongly about how terrible this movie was that this is the only movie I ever felt I needed to write something about and, the only movie I have EVER gotten rid of immediately after seeing it, HONESTLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"28 years later...still people will be amazed","review":"This movie is amazing. From cinematography to directing to the music. It is really a sort of movie that really takes your mind deep into the movie and you're just stuck their to enjoy the intensity of it. This movie perfectly shows the psychology of how human beings will act upon in a real situation such as this. Scary to believe but it's true. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it, and just want to watch a good movie that is intense. Is it a zombie flick? Not quite...but rather a 5 star psychological drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"I have to say that I was expecting a terribly scary movie, this wasn't it. I wasn't disapointed in the least, however. I thought this a great film, and am still enjoying what it did to me. I love it. There is nothing to get in the way of experiancing it, there are no stars, a simply and somewhat predicatable plot with enough twists to keep you guessing but never confused, beautiful and startlingly cinematography, nifty photography...Good stuff...If you aren't a fan of the apocalyptic film, or just don't like zombies, give this a try. Alex Garland's writing is as physchological as it is action intense...just try to put yourself in the shoes of Jim and his entourage as they traipse around a hostile world...It'll leave your heart beating harder than you might expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been there, done that...","review":"I enjoyed this movie. It was fun, scary, and very morbidly depressing -- if you like grim, dark stories of the \\"Gee, isn't it terrible what's happening to earth\\" genre, you'll eat it up. BUT: this is a just another rip off of John Wyndham's masterpiece \\"Day of the Triffids\\". A few people in London are left after some disaster, they leave town, hole up in some remote estate, fight each other, etc. Same story, different monster. But this is very creepy and effective. The picture quality is deliberately \\"bad\\": like TV documentaries. Add it to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok at Best","review":"I can't believe people are actually giving this Movie 5 stars? I guess it's one of those Love it or hate it things. I liked the Storyline but after that...mostly boring. It was just interesting enough to get me through the whole thing. If you want a really entertaining Spookie movie get House of a 1000 Corpses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Quality is Horrible","review":"Blu-Ray Quality is Horrible. Skip it skip it skip it.

I have six other Blu-Ray that look perfect. Don't know what happened to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"When I left after seeing this movie I have to say I was honestly not impressed at all. I thought it was boring and just plain weird. I left the theater thinking \\"what the hell was that\\". I thought the plot was just stupid and there were certain scenes that were simply unnecessary. Some scenes look as if they were just thrown in there to add time to the movie so the movie wasn't only 30 minutes. The opening is probably the most boring since there is about 15 minutes of nothing except a man walking around an empty city. I understand that was used to show that everyone died but for goodness sakes did it have to seem like it went on for days? I got the point after about 2 minutes of it. I did not like it and do not recommend it to people usless they really really like the zombi coming back to life and killing humans so they can live thing. I think this is a movie you either love or hate, there is no in between and for me it is all hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Zombie Movie Ever!!!!","review":"It's not even about zombies.

Somehow, 28 Days Later reinvents the zombie genre while stealing (or \\"paying homage\\" as they say in the industry) half it's material from Romero's early works.

I had forgotten that most of the movie makes heavy use of various digital filters & effects. While this is fine and the movie is better for it, almost all but the final 15 minutes are somewhat grainy as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be a zombie movie?","review":"Perhaps I have been spoiled on flicks like Dawn of the Dead, Dead Alive, and Evil Dead, which are all great zombie fare. I expected 28 Days Later to be of the same ilk; but it was a \\"grave\\" diaappointment. This movie played out more like a melodrama than a hardcore zombie flick. You wouldn't even know if the creatures were supposed to be zombies unless you had read the DVD cover. This movie was way to slow-paced and did not live up to the billing that the critics claimed. If you are a REAL zombie fan, don't get this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"28 Days....

The reviews hailed it as original and scary, so I was stoked. But, at the end, I was scratching my head wondering if I got the edited for tv version or something because it wasnt very scary. I made me jump a few times, but theres a difference between being scared and being startled. Plus, to call it original is a slap in the face to the zombie movies of the sixties and seventies. I mean, it was more intelligent than most horror movies, but what fan base are the filmmakers trying to appeal to? When I go to see a horror film, I expect either to be genuinely disturbed (The Ring, Blair Witch), or to laugh heartily at the cheesy villians and storyline (Freddy v. Jason). Either way, I expect a good time. However, with this one, I just felt disappointed. If you like zombie films, you wont like this one, guaranteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"British BOMB!!!","review":"Horror buffs need to take \\"28 Days Later\\" into muchly needed inconsideration. This had to be the slowest moving horror flick on the planet. While this British box-office smash was commended for chills and thrills..it is truly a fiasco. It had two moments of terror...222 moments of predictable JELLO. I spent $20 on this DVD. It's worth maybe $5.99.The soundtrack completely sucks...the acting is average...and the editing is the highlight. Unfortunately, when you edit one bad scene to the next, you simply can't win.This British loser must have been made by someone who ventured through WW2. It has the nauseating military twist to it that simply doesn't fit today. Why is it the British always want to embellish their hatred for the Germans? Move on!!!! Get a life!!!! Make a horror film and get away from those silly military fatigues. This one is simply billed as a horror film. That's right...it is simply horrible!!! It gets a 2!!!

First off I'd like to say the movie its self is great but the Conversion to Blue Ray falls flat on its face. I've got quite a large number of blue ray movies here and I swear at the time of this review this is the worst video quality blue ray I could find. It looks like someone took the DVD version and put the movie through a video filter trying to sharpen it and completely failed at it. This is a fantastic example of how not to convert a blueray. this movie was made in 2002 we had the technology to record a quality film. I'm surprised a group of people considered blue ray experts did this conversion sat down and watched the final product and decided this to be a quality picture. I want my money back, I feel kind of used. Blue Ray means they put forth their best effort to give us a great picture *puke*"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scariest Movie since The Ring!","review":"28 Days later is one of the most intelligent, suspensfull horror movies I have ever seen(and I have seen many). I was not expecting much from this movie, and went in thinking it would be stupid, but boy was I wrong. The movie is a horror movie that in death scenes it makes you feel sad, as if it were real. The score is marvelous, easily one that should win or atleast be nominated for an Oscar. Director Danny Boyle does a superb job of direction, and is so far the best direction I have seen in any film this year, it is a Oscar winning direction . The cinematography is in one word: WOW!

Much to my disappointment, I am sorry I bought it!! What a waste. From what I can remember (it was so boring to me it's hard to), it starts out eerie, which was cool, but it becomes so dull and loses all point half way through the movie. It's hard to stay interested in what happens to the people involved. One thing I liked about it was that the zombies were fast, but instead of looking scary, I just thought they looked funny. This movie was also way too long. I fell asleep in both sittings of trying to watch it. So take my advice, do not buy this movie UNLESS you KNOW you will like it. Maybe I just don't like this kind of movie, but either way, I would not watch it again if you payed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Potentially Great Movie Turns Out To Be Garbage","review":"Where can I begin to describe how awful this movie really is? First let me state that I am a HUGE fan of zombie movies. Day Of The Dead? Great movie! Dawn of the Dead? Great movie...both versions! This movie.... well, suffice to say that Danny Boyle apparently isn't so much as a pimple on the ass of the great George Romero, or Sam Raimi, or any other great horror director for that matter. While the initial idea of the movie is scary and the previews made it out to look terrifying, the plot is so disjointed, drawn out, chatty, and utterly stupid that any potential shown in the first ten minutes is quickly shot to hell. Did I hate this movie? Yes. Would I rather snort shards of glass than to ever watch it again? Maybe not, but it was still an utter waste of my time. I feel stupider for having seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie alas for a unworthy ending....","review":"David Boyle directed this movie and created a movie that was thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. However this film has its faults, the movie begins strong enough with the opening scene in the animal cosmetic testing facility where scientist's have been working on a virus called 'Rage'. The director shows the viewer how the virus was passed on to humans from monkeys. This is a movie, but closely based on a reality we has a species may have to go through sooner or later.Check out the bonus material and take a closer look at the alternate endings for this movie. I kind of liked the Radical theaterical ending that was shown via a story board. The ending they have in the movie was not that good. From a great start the movie became predictable.Although I loved the movie and will watch it from time to time, I did give it 4 stars for the superb acting, great directorship and the first 45mins of the movie was 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh?","review":"Well, I thought the movie had a great and original storyline but I was not to fond with the acting and filming.

By the film's end (should you make it that far, many in my theater did not) you may or may not feel like a lab monkey, but you will certainly be infected with \\"Rage,\\" having just witnessed one of the single worst cinematic endeavors of all time. Rent \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" if you're into zombies or \\"Night of the Comet\\" if you want to think about it being cool on earth without people. Do not see this. If you liked \\"Shallow Grave\\" or \\"Trainspotting\\" and you think Danny Boyle can recover from \\"The Beach,\\" you're wrong.

On both of these it failed. This is the reason I think the movie stunk like rotting cheese you forgot at the bottom right corner of your refrigerator from seven months back.Bottom line: if you are into \\"artsy-fartsy\\" type zombie movies then definitely see this movie.

It's okay if you watch it at, say, twice or more of the optimal viewing distance from your set. That is about eleven feet for a 42\\"-diagonal set, at 1080 lines.

I am usually good at weeding them out. So, I figured, \\"well, if he doesn't like it, me & my husband might\\" NOT !! WRONG !!

However, the plot has one major, glaring flaw which pretty much flies in the face of what it means to be human.I can't believe the women didn't go along with the soldiers' plan. They would have been protected, fed, sheltered and guaranteed to have offspring. If they had just a bit of smarts they could have spun that situation so that they enjoyed a somewhat powerful, comfortable position in a world gone to hell. Instead they chose to face the continued, exhausting threat of being eaten by pseudo-zombies.In general, people will do anything to survive and Selena says as much early on. Even if it means having servicing someone they don't particularly like. Carnal, unromantic, and harsh but a biological reality none the less.

The activists scoff at the scientist and set on monkey free. The minute that happens, the monkey immediately attacks a woman, infecting her with rage.Fast forward 28 days, and a man (Jim) wakes up in a hospital only to find himself completely alone. He leaves the hospital and sees that the streets are deserted as well. After a frantic search, he meets to survivors. Occasionally, they come across one of the undead and must kill them or else they stand to become infected themselves.This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Not.Where is the tension? Where is the suspense? We know who is going to survive and who is going to get it from the first 15 minutes of the movie.Yes, we have, as we have in all movies made by Boyle, a great cinematographic composition but it doesnt stand out.This is suposed to be a scary movie... And it might have been should Boyle had managed to put you in the players shoes, but that just doesnt happen.Since the plott is pretty obvious, you just dont care about the characters of the movie, you dont get simpathetic and you dont get scared.And I am not going to talk about history's plausability here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get me started!!","review":"Bro, seriously, how can anyone give this movie higher than one star?

So much so, that it had me messing around with the settings on my player and TV, and I even put another disc in to make sure it wasn't something I did. For reference, I also have 28 Weeks Later and its worlds better in visual quality, it actually looks high def. Unfortunately that can't be said for this movie (but for the last few minutes).

All I remember is the sheer beauty of this film. Seriously, the one thing that was horribly overlooked was the beauty of it all. You don't need to analyze every frame to find this either.There are many instances within the film where it is clearly evident. The Monet-like imagery of the flowers after the grocery store run, the camera angles and music while they are on the deserted highway, the plane viewed through the trees, a red dress that gained its own theme song only to swoosh across the screen for a few seconds, and the final scene where HELL is spelled upside-down out on a green hillside only be read as HELLO later.All of these, and more, captivated my attention throughout the horror of the movie's entirety.

It's much too dark - can't see anything that's going on. I'm pretty good with accents, but I couldn't understand what was being said.

This leads the audience to believe that the movie will convey rage and its effects on human beings, thus making people compare the movie's reality to that of their own. (Basically, people will be forced to look at their own lives and see how they need to change in order to make this world a better place. You would think this is another one of those \\"wake up and smell the coffee movies\\" that would try to get people to change their destructive behavoior.) This movie does NOT deliver this message however. Even if it tried to, the movie was just too violent and gruesome.

Shot on digital video, this is an extremely cheap, visually ugly film which rips off George Romero's zombie trilogy, especially elements of Day of the Dead (the weakest of the Romero trilogy) and also adds in what are now hoary cliches from other post-apocalypse films. The film's one inventive touch is that the virally infected don't lumber around aimlesly but are infused with an almost superhuman strength and speed. Other than that, I won't belabor you with my litany of complaints about this film, since there's already a surfeit of negative reviews posted. However, I was particularly offended by the deliberate stupidity of some the plot, such as the infected soldier who is chained up, who you just KNOW is going to get loose to wreak havoc, and the putative hero Jim's act of setting him free, and the whole last act of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary?

The begining of the film looked promising and original and kept your interest for the first hour or hour and a half but the end sucked. Started getting repetitive and boring in the last hour. Had promise but disapointed. Id definetly recomend this over the zombie movie Resident evil which was about 1 and a half stars. This is a 2.5 or 3 stars. It had cool looking zombies and an interesting plot but overall fell short and disapointed. Also on the back cover it says ( scarier than the exorcist) - THATS a JOKE. It got old after awhile and Its nowhere near as scary as the classic horror movies. Its sci fi. Another comment on the back says ( it will haunt you for days) - ANOTHER JOKE.

It's finally beginning. But no, not really.If you look at some classic zombie films, like Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead, there are zombies who stand out. A hare Christina, Bub, the clown.

Unfortunately, the movie was shot with one of the early Canon X Series digital camcorders. So, the resolution for \\"hi-def\\" simply does not exist.

The acting by the entire cast is phenomenal. The cinematography (digital) is some of the best I have ever seen. The script is strong dialogue wise although it completely ripped off scenes from other movies (i.e. dawn of the dead and day of the dead). What made the film for me though no matter what bad things I could say about it is the three central characters are so likeable, we care about them so much that movie works...Easily. This is one of those films where the cast really carries it all the way through. Boyle really lucked out in that respect. There are indeed a few suspenseful scares though regardless of what the other reviewers might say...And I have seen quite a few scary movies.

And like my review title states, it was unusually good. There is gore and zombie-like ghoulish behavior, but there is also the human element which overrides that and definately helps in making this a watchable film. I found myself shouting, \\"Go! Go! Move, get outta there!\\", several times especially during the scene with the rats (trust me, it's a good one). It also caused me to become squeamish and I had to put my feet up on the couch and sit cross-legged (deep-rooted childhood stuff that still pops up during good horror films). Yes, as another reviewer says the infected are fast, very fast. None of that Frankenstein-walking going on here; if they want you they quickly crash through windows to grab you.

The \\"what if\\" alternate ending is a little better, but, without giving anything away, the ending was just too happy. The first hour and a half of this movie were terrific, I was spellbound, but everything just fell apart in the last twenty minutes and the ending was just so typical. The ending was so bad that it reminded me of your average, run of the mill Hollywood horror movie. This brought to mind the bad ending of the novel \\"Hannibal\\" by Thomas Harris.

Wow, hate to break it to you but there were doznes of zombie films before Resident Evil.Secondly those complaining about product placement, the filmmakers have claimed they didn't get any money for product placement. they used brand names because they wanted verisimilitude. Not sure if i beleive it but that's what i read.Now, the film. The film really isn't a horror film as such, but I found it a very gripping film. It borrows from other films, but it does it so well that I forgive it. It is a genre film and genres have formulas.Certainly it is not without problem. A tough character ends up needing to be rescued, and one of the last deaths was totally unbelievable.

But it's almost as if two people were arguing when they wrote it: two very different people; a smart one and a not-so-smart one.There are just two many implausibilities unaccounted for.Such as: Why is it established that the infected monsters can eject infected material at a person, but then, later in the movie, you find a non-infected person standing right in front of an infected monster, taunting it, with no protection covering his face???And why, at the beginning, were the infected monkeys only encased in glass if what they were infected with was so drastically deadly???Unexplained stupidities of small detail abound in this movie and destroy it's believability for any thinking, questioning viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly your typical horror movie","review":"I rented 28 days later based on coworkers hype about thismovie.

You can pretty much predict what's gonna happen next which is terrible for an action movie. The worst is this kinda stories usually end up with no where to go and so does this movie. I believe those people who made the film still wandering around what they gonna do for the end during the hooting and that's why you can see the alternative endings in the DVD. I don't even what to see those endings because they will still lead NO WHERE! Bottom line: Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, not Horror!","review":"What an incredible waste of time, I can't believe that I sat and watched the whole thing. If I could give it a negative rating I would. The real shame about this movie is that the premise is possible, making it potentially horrifying. Unfortunately, the most horrifying thing about this movie was the acting.The characters were poorly developed and the character interaction was so completely ridiculous that it made the movie unbelievable. The dialog was idiotic and so poorly delivered that I started hoping that the protagonists would be kiled, just so that they would shut up. I was really hoping that Cillian Murphy would be eaten alive, or at least knocked unconcious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously other people saw things in this movie...","review":"Obviously other people saw things in this movie that I didn't. Either that or they're very easily pleased.If one word could describe 28 Days After, that word would be \\"pointless\\". It starts out as your typical flesh-eating zombie movie, and continues in the same vein until the end... yet nothing ever happens! Ever! People go hither and yon for no reason. Most of the people who aren't zombies are no less wicked, but again for no reason or purpose. A supposed military unit, despite having secured their area, degenerates into a band of undisciplined rapists and thugs... But why?You'd be better off watching the clothes dryer go round and round than to spend time and money on this ...If you want to watch a decent zombie movie, stick with Night of the Living Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"Having recently viewed this movie, I can honestly say this is a must miss for all horror fans. First the good, the sound track was really well placed and worked great, if you are a gore fan, there was plenty of it, and I really liked that they did not try to just keep things jumping out at you, they won't more for a pyschological thriller. However, they failed on the pyschological thrill. The movie was just walking and more walking, the few short action sequences where good (but there was only about 3 of them). Honestly you just walk out of the theatre rather bored and feeling like you've been it for 28 days, it fails to have any impact and comes off as rather comical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Sci-Fi/Horror","review":"A very tacky, politically correct, horror sci/film that has nothing going for it except for a generic screenplay, bad acting, and very cheap special effects.The story starts with Jim (Cillian Murphy) waking up in deserted hospital in the middle of London. He soon realizes that the entire city is deserted and the film goes back in time to tell us how it got that way. It so happens that humans have been infected by a rage virus which takes 28 days to incubate. The virus was in experimental chimps who were freed by overzealous animal activists. The film then becomes a cat-and-mouse thriller between normal humans and infected humans.A very bland film with politically correct undertones about the value of liberal activists and the dangers of the military establishment. A very contrived film with a cheap plot, lousy acting, and lousier still special effects. Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Euro Road Trip in Peril","review":"Yikes, another Euro Road trip through empty city-scapes, pursued by red-eyed zombies, with lots of close angle shots in the rain.

The film needed more suspense and action added to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter garbage.","review":"I would not recommend you to see this horrible movie. First off, the ending was ridiculous. It started off with promise along the line with Kubrick's \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" and then it turned into a very Hollywood version of \\"Gunfight and the OK Corral.\\" For this, Boyle left Hollywood for indie filmmaking??? Another problem I had with this movie was its implausibility. If the infecteds were filled with rage to kill--then why were they killing only the uninfected people and not each other? Finally, I also had a problem with the ending. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie yet--just let me say that it was a major letdown. Very corny. Boyle has a good eye for filmmaking. Maybe one of these days he'll actually make a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"One of the worst films I've ever had to endure...went to it based on good reviews here (yuck) and my positive experience with previous work (trainspotting)...characters were narrow, boring and depth of a wading pool...with the woman as usual victums and \\"love\\" interest developed upon NO substance...if you are young, boring, uneducated, I recommend you see this loaded so you can enjoy, otherwise--skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Looks like VHS!","review":"The quality of the blu-ray is about the poorest I have ever seen.

DO NOT BUY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, but not for all","review":"I watched this movie after receiving extremely mixed reviews from those around me, and I was not disappointed at all. This movie was actually painful to watch in areas, with scenes involving rape, violence involving children, and very realistic gore effects. However, all of these images contributed to a final message about the shape of mankind and the philosophty surrounding our own self-importance. The movie was flawed, yes, with some shaky dialogue and a slew of scientific nitpicks, but overall a very effective peice of art. My best advice about this movie is to see it despite the mixed reviews around you. It's worth seeing at least once to flesh out your knowledge of movies. It will at least help you learn about others' opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superfly's Review","review":"This movie was average. This was one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a while but the movie had a weak plot. I'm thankful that it wasn't just running around and shooting the undead.

To end my review own this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Zombie Horror movie since the 80s!","review":"I saw the trailer for this movie at Final Destination 2 and thought '28 Days Later'would be great and this movie more than exceeded my expectations. The film has a great soundtrack, great action sequences, was directed great, has great acting, and a great and simple plot. This the best Indie/Horror film since the 80s.5 stars. Two thumbs up (three if I had another). Hot. However, if are a senior citizen with your poker friends at the movies for the weekend this is not the movie for you, I had would have to recomend 'Seabiscuit'( I hear good things). But if you aren't go see this movie. See it once to be scared, twice to be terrified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop thinking about it!","review":"Good movies affect you. By that I mean after viewing them you still think about them and want to see them again. This is how I felt about 28 Days Later. I think this movie is just brilliant. I enjoyed everything about it. The script, the acting, the music, the plot, and even just the general feel of the movie were enjoyable. Don't get me wrong it was completely creepy but in a good way. Even if you don't like scary movies at all I would recommend this. It wasn't at all what I was expecting; it was so much better. I don't really have anything to say that hasn't been said. I just wanted to add another five stars to its list. People, if you haven't seen this movie for God's sake GO SEE IT! I love it and am counting the days till the DVD comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute shambles","review":"This has got to be one the worst movies. It started off great and after that just killed over. It was slow, boring, and hardly any confrontations till the very end. This is one movie you should leave on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overhyped movie since the Blair Witch","review":"If you haven't seen Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead this movie might seem original. If you have seen one or more of the above classic horror movies, it will seem, because it is, totally derivative. Either way, the movie is awful. Insights should arise from the characters and story. The character and story should not be used to force insights down the audiences throat. We know that zombies aren't necessaily worse than people after we see 28 Days Later, because Danny Boyle has been jamming that idea down our throats for two hours.I gave the movie two stars instead of zero mostly because of the way the movie was shot. The distorted frames, the views of an abandoned London were all visually interesting. Ultimately, though, the movie is a failure. A contrived plot with a corny, phony script contribute to a moviegoing experience that is not that scary and leaves a bad taste in one's mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Thriller","review":"I personally really enjoyed this movie, from the effects, the story, the characters, and the gore. I don't agree that it's the scariest movie since The Exorcist like it says, but it was plenty scary. It's more of a movie that grabs you and then makes your gut wrench watching everything that is going on and the thought of the world being destroyed. It doesn't really shock you and make you jump. Altogether though the movie is great and very much lives up to all the hype it was givin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for: blu-ray release ONLY","review":"This might be the WORST blu ray release ever. Oh great and merciful Poseidon, please don't let anyone buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"good zombie creation line","review":"28 Days later has a very cool and some what copycat way of how people are turned into zombies from the Resident Evil movies. If an uninfected person gets a drop of infected blood anywhere near a mucus membrane ( eyes, mouth). they will turn. this was about all I liked about this movie. for the most part this movie takes a long time to get to what I personally consider any thing good. the best part of this movie is at the end when the capture zombie is set loose and kills all of the army men who were acting like total jerks to the survivors. the way this movie was advertised I though there would have been more blood and gore and something that would keep my interest and instead what i got was a movie that took to long to get any non dark photos of the zombies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has a different feel to it","review":"A great movie with all of the dark mood you could ever want. There are other movies with similar story lines but this one was very well done. I highly recommend it if you would like to see a good large Budget horror/suspence movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, slow, not even relatively scary!!","review":"The back of the DVD says the most horrifying movie since the Exorcist!!! 3 alternate endings that will haunt you!! I had to make sure I had the right movie. I've seen scarier episodes of Scooby Doo!! The producers and directors of this must have paid off the reviewers for this film. There was not a SINGLE scary moment in this entire film. Save your time and money.

There were some (emphasis on the some) O.K. parts, but overall, it bored me to death. I couldn't wait for it to end!!! And the ending was also horrible! There was also absolutely no need to show Cillian Murphy naked.... The zombies RAN, which zombies are supposed to not be able to do, and the people turn into zombies in ten seconds!!! Also not supposed to happen! And the virus was spread by monkeys!!!! The movie was also very poorly filmed, like the movies Killjoy(another terrible movie), Pumpkinhead(which was good), and hellraiser. It was filmed as if it was directed and made in the 70's! Take my advice, if you want to go see a zombie flick, see Resident Evil 2 when it hits theaters......"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Resident Evil without a well developed plot and cast","review":"The only thing that scared me and made me think when it came to this movie was when I asked myself, \\"How did they get financing?!\\". And as a big fan of movies dealing with bio-hazardous incidents and in particular, the Resident Evil franchise, that really says something about this movie. The plot was not well organized or developed at all, and in acception to a few concepts of the movie, it was ridiculously unoriginal. I would describe 28 Days later as some kind of mix between the book The Hot Zone and Resident Evil. So if you are planning on seeing this, I'd recommend looking into one of those two instead, you'll be much less disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this","review":"THIS ISN'T SCARY AT ALL.

The production design meaning. But thats about it. Only watch the first twenty minutes and then shut the t.v. off. If all the people of England died, then how come there bodies don't even show? It's ridiculious. It's just a real stupid movie that you shouldn't waste your time on. But it's a british movie so what would you expect? Don't watch this film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes no sense","review":"I must say that this movie really stunk! It just didnt make sense at all.First of all, how come when the city is evacuated at the start of the movie, the main character is left behind in his hospital bed??? And how come he was the only one left behind??? Was he a bad patient?? :-)Secondly, if the RAGE virus takes less then 20 seconds to infect someone and send them into an uncontrolable rage, then how did the city have time to evacuate??Thirdly, if the RAGE virus sends people into a frenzy, then why dont the infected attack each other??These are just some of the things in this movie that dont make sense.

This is false advertising. The movie was not scary, probably because Danny Boyle fancied it to be more serious and weighty than your typical zombie flick. The problem is that it ends up being neither scary nor serious (when there's no real reason why it couldn't be both). The word that comes to mind is \\"pretentious.\\" The movie's about 60 IQ points short of being able to pull off what it hopes to pull off. It's that same too-hip not-exactly-nihilistic pseudo-punk thing that's apparently the rage in England right now and is getting just way too tiresome. \\"Trainspotting\\" was great; this is BORING. It ISN'T meaningful or interesting, let alone exciting. What a waste of time - seriously. It's as profound as an eighth-grade creative-writing assignment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful art horror movie","review":"I bought the dvd today, and watched it a few hours ago, and I must say, this is one of the greatest movies i've seen in a long while.I do sort of agree that the later half of the movie gets a bit off track, but it all makes sense if you think about it. Its a very interesting plot, how no matter what virus or anything else tries to destroy the world, in the end, human kind will eventually destroy itself.Also, its a beautifully shot movie, with great directing and some pretty scary scenes, though nothing that is very frightening like some editorial reviews might suggest.All in all, great movie and a fine addition to any sci-fi horror collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on You Danny Boyle","review":"I was deeply saddened and apalled that this director would have adult men attempting to rape and impregnate a child , you should be ashamed of yourself for featuring rape in your movie , I'd like to drop a load on this dvd for having such shocking content"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad!","review":"This movie stinx!

I just kept wondering when it was going to either pick up and turn into the amazing movie everyone claimed it was or finally come to an end. The characters(i cant remember their names, thats how bad of a movie this is) were badly under-developed (but perhaps they got more into that later im not sure), and the dialogue was just awful. Nothing about this movie was the least bit surprising nor frightening. And the story moved along rather slowly.

It starts great. You will never forget the first 30 minutes of this movie. Then, it all goes sour. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't suck (except for that ending)- it's not even that bad- it's just a remake of Day of the Dead. This is blatant plaigerism being praised as groundbreaking.

We get no action, no scenes of the plague going down, no chaos....nothing. The movie completely skips it.

Give me a break. And even though they kept on running away, Selena always had a just-after-salon hairstyle.

I've since read that it was filmed on some low quality equipment (Canon XL1s Mini DV Camcorder of all things) and so the picture quality just isn't possible as it is on real film.To summarise:***DO NOT BUY THIS FILM ON BLU RAY!***"},{"rating":"1","title":"28 minutes later...","review":"...I found myself \\"un\\"involved & thinking about what I did earlier in the day. After a very boring first 20 minutes I thought that I'd give the movie a few more minutes to pick up. Sadly it didn't pick up enough to hold my attention. I thought the film would have been right up my alley because I love zombie/horror, but it just seemed to take itself way to serious for it's own good. And it's not really a horror film at all. A few chase scenes and some bloody vomit doesn't mean you have a horror film. All and all the biggest problem was that it was overwelmingly dull. 1 star for the chic that hacked up that dude who became infected."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH. I PAID $23 FOR THIS DVD?","review":"I admit it. I bought into the hype. This DVD sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Did I say it sucks?I will not watch it again. Well, maybe again in 6 months, or more likely just to cut my loss, I'll sell it to a friend I hate for $10.Plus, the quality of the video sucks. It gets dis-configured and shifts, and is grainy and just sucks. It's like watching low-light movies on cable that has been \\"digitally compressed\\" for my viewing pleasure.Not enough? The audio is extremely quiet. I had my stereo and TV up to max volume and still couldn't hear it.WHY DID I BUY THIS?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Virus or Zombie?","review":"I watch this movie \\"28 Days Later\\" with couple friends with intense expectation. Here's my comment: Boring & Suck!The story is boring, not much horror effects. You cann't even seen the zombies clear. You can tell the quality of the film they used is very bad and different from the typical hollywood film which is clear and picture sharp. Very disappointed!

Like a Lovecraft tale of terror, Boyle takes us on an adventure for truth and survival with the excellent Cillian Murphy.Apocalyptic story lovers will not be disappointed with this film.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent contemporary \\"zombie\\" flick","review":"There are very few zombie movies made nowadays. This is considered one of the better ones. Although in this movie, people are induced into attacking others by a virus.

All of the new songs are excellent, proving that SNTR went out at the top of their game. Matt Slocum is a genius and Leah Nash's voice is beautifully captivating! From previous comments posted here it seems that we fans can't get enough, and I would've loved to see the following songs included in a larger release: I Can't Catch You; Bleeding; Healer; Falling Leaves; Thought Menagerie; Meaningless; Paralyzed; Down and Out of Time; Love; Sister, Mother; A Million Parachutes. This collection is a must have for true fans, and would be great for a first timer as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"Admittedly, I'm not a fan and never review music, but have to endure their music on the radio so I'll leave a quick comment. Have you ever listened to music that made you want to climb to the top of the nearest building and hurl yourself off? This is that kind of music. Especially tortuous is the cover of \\"Don't dream it's over,\\" one of my favorites when performed by Crowded House. However, this bands bubble gum, muzac inspired version makes you pine for William Shatner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Sixpence None The Richer has always been a notch above the rest of the alternative sounds... Contemporary Christian or otherwise. With lyrics that goes in so many levels interpreted by Nash' soulful voice, this band has a special place in my collection. I was pleased at the variety of songs featured in this collection. Loved the Japanese version of Kiss Me. I was a little disappointed with the fact that one or two of my favorite songs were not in the album. I was also hoping that I could find her solo movie soundtrack song. Oh well, I can't have it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Environmental Book in a Decade","review":"Power to the People is the best and most important book on global environmental issues since The Ecology of Commerce. Here at Aspen Skiing Company, we're making it mandatory reading for all senior executives. It's balanced but hits the crucial issue of our time--energy use--dead on; it provides a grounded, sensible perspective on climate change that few could disagree with; and it's a major service to people and organizations trying to get the corporate world, government, and individuals moving towards action on climate change and cleaner energy sources. This landmark book will become part of the sustainable business canon, along with the Ecology of Commerce, Natural Capitalism, Cradle to Cradle, and Cool Companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic.","review":"This book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming, etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing book. The author should stick to journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant and important book","review":"This book encapsulates the very complex world of energy into a few hundred, highly readable, fascinating, well constructed pages. If you want a wonderful read that will shock, inspire, and fill you with ammunition for arguments personal and professional for years to come- this is for you. One of my best reads of the last decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review--New Mexico Magazine","review":"Many people find the lines and textures of an adobe building at once seductive and compelling. This book is all about the unique aesthetic of houses made of mud. Third in a series of four books on popular residential design in Mexico and the Southwest, this book contains photos of spectacular adobe homes, inside and out, in New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and various places in Mexico.The book documents the evolution of adobe from its historic past to its most modern applications, including interior details and architectural elements. The authors chose well the buildings they use as examples for their premise that \\"adobe is an old tradition with a new future,\\" the recurring theme of the book.--New Mexico Magazine, May 2002"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy angst-filled guitar and drums","review":"764-Hero is John Atkins and Polly Johnson, and like another NW band the Spinanes, create songs without a bassist. While the songs on this album do contain pop hooks, they are usually buried under various levels of noise and overtones. Atkins' voice warbles and occasionally screams, as on the opening noise-rock feast \\"Comb the Carpet\\", but occasionally hits some soft notes too, as on the albums closer which pairs an acoustic guitar with extraneous synthesizer noise. \\"Wait Until 5\\" and \\"Check the Address\\" are a little more poppy that the other songs, my favorite is \\"I'm Lying\\" which features Polly's dad Ward on organ, who coincidentally also used to be an Amazon employee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Bag Boy service due to no parts","review":"My Bag Boy push cart handle broke in it's first months of use.

This time I had to wait for a new handle - FOR TWO MONTHS AND ONE DAY. Their only offer to me? A Bag Boy shirt and a hat for my wait! They didn't even expedite the shipping as it took 5 days.

Although I had never seen any other of her videos I opted to get this. I was blown away at how many videos she did have. Although some are kinda corny but Pat pulls them off with grace and her \\"hard chick\\" style. I also love the \\"Invincible\\" video and i have always loved that movie Legend Of Billie Jean which i hope they will put on DVD someday. Another good gem was the \\"Don't Walk Away\\" video I loved the song and now the video. So keep on Rockin Pat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The NOT QUITE complete video collection....","review":"Wow! What a collection of Pat Benatar videos and footage! The commentaries are awesome...you must watch the DVD with the commentary on....I love everything about this DVD collection except that fact that Pat's biggest hit, HIT ME WITH YOUR BEST SHOT, does not appear anywhere in this video collection. Not even as concert footage. How disappointing.I know that Pat herself does not care for the song, but fans do, and it should have been included somehow on this DVD collection.Of course, there were some nice gems on it, and quite a few videos I have never seen...It is still a must have for any Pat Benatar fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COOLEST COUPLE IN THE WORLD","review":"Is there a cooler couple in the world than Pat Benatar and her guitarist husband Neil Geraldo? Watch the video commentary to this collection and you tell me: if this isn't the perfect marriage, what is? They both look great, they've been on a long fun journey and they clearly adore each other. Pat's cackle at her most retro moments are worth the price of this collection alone. NOTE: I bought this DVD collection along with the CD of \\"Best Shots\\"; there is now a double disc collection (which I got for $20.99) which is more of a bargain than the DVD itself. And I mention this VIDEO COMMENTARY with Pat and Neil on-screen because it isn't listed as a feature in this double disc; I pretty much stumbled across it. If you're as sick of today's canned pop and endless \\"Idols\\" as I am, go back to the days when we had really cool singers with unique styles -- like Stevie Nicks, Debbie Harry and, yes, Pat Benatar. Get this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment for a fan","review":"I really enjoyed this DVD, not having seen most of the videos when they were originally aired. The best part, however, is the commentary by Pat and Neil on each of the videos. It really gives some great insight on what went on back then.

The recipes were more involved than I would prefer but I overlooked it because it was being cooked in one day. But it would have been much more useful if the author had considered the fact that Antacids are a giant industry for a reason. Lots of people have problems here. Include substitutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the food is good & not cooking every night is heaven","review":"I have looked at a lot of cook-ahead cookbooks and chose this one because the recipes looked like something my family would actually eat. I was right - they are \\"normal\\" enough for my taco and hamburger loving children and tasty enough for my braised lamb shanks and grilled duck breast loving husband. I would agree with other reviewers, that if you are looking for budget do-ahead cooking, this is probably not the book for you. However, if you want to save time and have a realaxed dinner hour then I think this is a good choice. I have always balked at the once-a-month cookbooks because I can't imagine spending the 12 to 14 hours in the kitchen that kind of cooking would take, not to mention the kind of freezer space it would require. This seems like a great compromise and I have been pleased with the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited use","review":"So far, I have been pleased with the poultry mix and seafood mix ideas. (The book also features a ground beef mix.) It is worth spending time on the weekend to set up 4 dinners/mix when time is scarce, and there is a nice variety of recipes for each mix.However, although we liked the seafood quiche, the directions produced much more volume than my pie pan could hold, and I stayed up late that night preparing macaroni to use the remaining mix. Oddly, my desperation macaroni with crab and tomato tasted better than the crab and tomato quiche. At least I had 3 meals from that experience.The poultry mix resembled chicken salad, but my husband was very impressed with the casserole he threw in the oven on a night with a tight schedule.The weekly menus in the rest of the book seemed less useful. I can't imagine planning a week of chicken every night."},{"rating":"1","title":"The concept works if you have time..","review":"You could break up the sessions in several parts to make it more manageable. I think the selection of meals is overpriced, too, like the steaks.There are better books on this subject, like Frozen Assets by Deborah Taylor-Hough, and the 30 Day Gourmet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, complicated, too fancy for me; Too much fish","review":"More fish recipes than your normal cook-in-advance books. I didn't want to buy the book, but my cat spilled iced tea on the borrowed copy (helpful kitty). There were a few interesting recipes, but everything was way too complicated and expensive. I have since given my copy to a thrift store. If you enjoy cooking and eating gourmet recipes, but don't have the time, this might be for you. If you can borrow it at the library (via interlibrary loan if your branch doesn't have it) you can better judge it. I can't recommend it, because I found almost nothing appealing. But tastes are personal, and YMMV.Just keep the book away from iced tea and cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes with good methods. You add the variation.","review":"The recipes are very good. As noted in other reviews, the full fix-ahead method gives you a repetitive week of dining. However, if it's already in the freezer, leave it there for a week or two and leapfrog on to another section. You'll have a nice stock of quick meals with minimal prep when you need them and can break things up with your own repetoire when you have time. The recipes are still easy to follow if you skip the bulk prep and use it as you would a standard cookbook. You won't get frustrated trying to work back through multiple steps on different pages to assemble a \\"one off\\" item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun 2","review":"A great variety of songs and the ability to sing duets have made this game a hit in our home for both 40-somethings and almost teens.

One microphone wouldn't have been enough, and the bundle was a better buy than a separate microphone.We each have multiple avatars so that we can choose a persona that matches our mood and the songs we're singing.

But it falls short of entertainment as far as the dancing goes. If you like DDR you won't like this. Next let me explain my title, this game was made for girls and guys with high voices. Almost all the songs save about 3 are all very high pitched, and there is no apparent way to adjust the tone of the songs to be able to compensate for those with a deeper voice. Secondly, most of the songs have female leads anyway, which makes it extremely difficult to match if you have even a mildly deep voice. Overall the gameplay isn't very much fun. Get Singstar, it comes with two mics and has a much better song selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Fun!!!!","review":"This is a great game for the whole family.

ME is garbage.....I was going crazy everyday, reinstalling the program. I was a master, an expert doing that. An everyday new crash. I bought XP and my life changed, My girlfriend now loves me and everything is different in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON WINDOWS ME!!","review":"We bought 2 HP Pavilions for our office with Windows ME loaded on them. They are a nightmare. You just simply have to get used to re-booting several times per day. I habitually restart the pc every few hours just to avoid the inevitable crash....BR>At the very least, get XP or 2000. Anythind but ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not mix this with Dell","review":"Windows Me is completely incompatible with my Dell Dimensions 8100 series. I have investigated into every possible solution and the only one is to upgrade to the new and better XP. I hope this will work considering Dell is making me pay for the upgrade while my warranty is still in effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst thing to happen to the PC since...................","review":".......it was invented. Windows ME came with my new machine a P1500 with 128 Megs of RAM. When the machine is turned on it loads at lightning speed.It's all downhill from there. ME is unstable, crashes and locks up regularly. It is slower than my old pentium pro 200 with 96 megs of RAM running Win98 (which I have been forced to pull out of the closet to setup once again)If you are interested in connecting a web site to a database, or even just learning how to do it, (with a program such as Macromedia UltraDev) ME does not support Personal Web Server, so you will have to go back to 95, 98, or get Win 2000 to explore this arena.95, 98, or 2000 may be better choices than waiting for XP to come out. If you change the configuration of your computer \\"too much\\", XP will lock up your computer and you will have to call Microsoft to get an code to unlock it. What will they think of next?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Well, let's start from the beginning. Microsoft wanted to get something out for the big \\"Millennium.\\" So, they beefed up 98 with a few \\"prettier\\" functions, made things look a little different, packaged it off, and whoosh-an easy ten million. Now us, the people who rush out to buy the \\"new\\" Microsoft product and set it all up. Before you know it, everything's gone wrong. Your RIO doesn't work, your games aren't playing, and every time you try to fix it-something else goes wrong. Welcome to Windows ME. Ha. The only, possible way if you would use this is if this is your buisness-only computer because it's okay at formatting. But anyone that's a mediocre gamer, uses cameras, downloads games for palms, or does anything else except type. This not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely poor compatibility","review":"I bought the computer from Dell, so I don't have to bother to install it. However, the installation of other hardwares was like being grilled in Hell. My PC camera, my scanner, my printer, and lots of other drives are not compatible with WinME. The worse is most of manufactures do not have WinME compatible drivers; or they just claim their drivers are compatible, and they \\"should\\" work...Since my computer is still within 30 days after purchase, I am considering to change it to Win98 SE, I feel that's the most stable edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windows Me? Try Windows 98 SP2.","review":"Okay, I have to admit, it really looks like Microsoft took Windows 98 SE, and added a few upgrades, like Movie Maker, WMP7, a few new drivers, and slapped a new name on it. It crashes even more than the disappointing 98 versions.You really need to consider if it's worth buying Me. I would reccomend sticking with your current operating system, upgrading to Windows 2000 (MUCH better), or waiting for the final release of Windows Whister (A.K.A Windows 2001, Windows NT 5.1 and Windows.NET 1.0), which will be Microsoft's first consumer-targeted NT version.Forget about me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those older computers.","review":"I owned Windows ME from 2000 to 2005 (when I upgraded to Windows XP Home Edition SP2). My computer came with ME pre-installed. Not as stable as Windows XP. Only ever crashes when you don't defrag, spy ware scan, virus scan and reg clean. If you do this daily - weekly. You will be running more stable. I'm not exactly sure why Microsoft released this operating system so close to Windows 2000 and Windows XP. I think it is because of a delay in XP causing ME to be a force release. A bit like a XP Beta. Id recommend it to anyone but if you're looking for that extra piece of stability, performance and not looking for the blue screen of death id recommend XP.Minimum requirements states:150MHz PII32MB Memory2GB Hard diskMy Recommended Minimum is700MHz Celeron, 600MHz Pentium III or equivalent256MB Memory20GB Hard Disk Drive (5400RPM)That is also enough power for Windows XP. Although on XP I do recommend 512MB Memory rather than 256mb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst OS for game playing!!","review":"I have to say that ME is the worst Operating System I've ever encountered. Blue screen after blue screen error is all I get every time I played games on it. I even blue screen errors when I'm not playing. I finally got fed up with and switched to XP. Much better OS than ME. Don't ever consider buying this. It's not a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Microsoft thinking? Apparently not much...","review":"This is the worst Windows operating system I have ever come across. My computer crashes constantly and I have noticed many flaws in the performance of ME.
