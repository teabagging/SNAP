I couldn't be a more pleased with their performance. They provide super cooling and are so much more quite than the old fans that came with this PC case.

Leah! and I finally found it on this CD and I felt lucky to hear Molly Hatchet's Beatin' the Odds, I would also replace Foreigner's Urgent and put Juke Box Hero or Dirty White Boy cause I cannot stand Urgent and I think it's Foreigner's most overrated song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible audio quality for a CD","review":"I bought this CD mainly because I wanted \\"Ah Leah\\", but didn't want to buy a whole Donnie Iris CD for it.

I wonder if they just downloaded some random MP3s from dubious sources on the internet and made a CD with them. I can't believe anyone involved in putting this together got within 100 miles of the original master tapes.

Nevertheless, I'll buy it because where else am I gonna find those two songs without buying entire Triumph and Donnie Iris albums? Not that I'm averse to having Tommie Tutone or Billy Squier's The Stroke, the latter of which does somewhat qualify as a screamer. But most of the 18 songs in this collection are better described as snoozers. A better choice from Foreigner would have been Head Games, which is actually a 2fer (screamer, screamingly funny). A better choice from April Wine would have been Roller, which is a screamer and also probably their best song. A final point: I can't imagine how Krokus' Screaming in the Night didn't make it onto this collection, and if it had I'd be much happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Dry, Always Satisfying.","review":"Yes, I know that title sounds like a beer commercial. I figured a three-hundred-year-old book needed an updating in the promotions department and except for sex, booze sells the best when it comes to advertising. Seriously, though, Robinson Crusoe is a rich character study that sheds light on the outlook of the human mind of the period, on the world, on civilization's merits, on basic behavior when confronted with extraordinary circumstances for which nothing in life has prepared you. Its tale of one Englishman shipwrecked on an uncharted island greets something wistful inside us all, some part of us that longs to \\"get away from it all\\" and escape. Yet at the same time, this novel also provokes a fear reaction from within, as Crusoe lives out his and our own terror of abandonment, of total loss, of being forgotten. This is a classic novel that addresses ageless themes and wraps them in a story that's actually quite good for its age and all location-imposed limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Does not leave the fur with luster.

When I received it, I played it right away. I was extremely disappointed as you can barely hear Robin sing. His band and orchestra completely drown out his voice.I don't have the heart to watch this again, as I know I'll only be frustrated with not being able to hear Robin. It's a shame as they are so talented and you would think between Robin and the producers they would've heard this and worked to greatly improve this before it was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative for the Bee Gees","review":"This is a great DVD. If you're used to the familiar Bee Gees sound, it takes playing a few times, as at first it seems to lack Barry Gibb's strong voice.Although Robin Gibb is mainly playing Bee Gees songs, it is not just a Bee Gees concert with two brothers missing. The philharmonic orchestra, the small venue and the alternative versions of some songs make this gig stand out for itself. One highlight is My Lover's Prayer, a Bees Gees song from the Still Waters album that was never issued as a single or played live. On this DVD it is presented as a interesting duet."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD QUALITY","review":"You cannot hear Robin's voice while playing the disc in DTS mode.

I played the Eagles Farewell one disc and there was nothing wrong with my system. I have a very good system with some of the finest brands like Krell and Classe's. This Dvd sucks big time.

First and foremost his beautiful voice is always lost whitin that of the 3 back-up singers and all we hear, is him mumbling his way throughout the concert.I wished that Robin would stick to singing his original songs from his 5 albums and the BGs songs he sang on record.Instead he sounds ridiculous in trying to cover Brother Barry's Fever hits and destroys altogether their magic.Barry himself found it bewildering that his little brother would try covering his songs!!!!! and said that he would never do the same out of respect for Rob's voice.The BEEGEES were magical, their songs made up my youth and i loved equally all 3 of them, yet in 1 album and 1 DVD, Robin Gibb burried whatever was left of the BEEGEES legacy by making a mockery of his past."},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody stop him!!!","review":"i LOVE the Bee Gees and Robin and all of them....I was at the One Night Only show in Vegas ...at GREAT expense.

It's nice to hear some of the Bee Gees songs with a different lead vocal and not so much falsetto, which I really wish they had never stumbled across. I think he did a wonderful job and the orchestra comes across really great. It's just nice to see that Robin didn't go into a deep depression after the loss of his twin brother and went back to what made them happy, singing.I mean come on everyone the guy was in on writing all of these songs, so why can't he perform them. Congratulations Robin on a great piece of work and I enjoy it every time I watch it. I highly recommend this CD/DVD.

This forces the user to modify technique significantly just to get a relatively accurate number.When a grip is released, the clock starts and the reading begins and stops when the ball is no longer moving. The ball is basically just a stopwatch that calculates feet per second and converts to MPH.In our testing, multiple throws made with the same effort at various distances measured up to 35MPH difference, depending on release point and pressure.Assuming you modify your release technique and mechanics, you should be able to get a generally (~20-30MPH accurate) correct reading by averaging several throws.If you want to measure pitching speed accurately, don't waste your money and buy a radar gun instead.

In all honesty, the original didn't have much better acting; however, it managed to throw me to the floor in violent convulsions of uncontrolable laughter when Chuck Norris launched what appeared to be model rockets from a motorcycle at a very surprised terrorist in a pickup truck. Delta Force 2 featured mostly a bunch of people being stabbed in a very agonizing manner, or in one special case, being gassed and shouting profanities on his painful way to death.

In reality, Nicholas Maier never got close enough to Cramer to come up with any interesting information we couldn't find on the book's cover. Only a fool what compare this author to Michael Lewis while purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"I laughed my [rear] off reading this book. It was F-U-N-N-Y! I felt bad for the author, Nick Maier, who was obviously in an inappropriate job, totally unsuitable to his personality and academic background. I'm a Cramer fan, so I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Read the book, and have some fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cramer is a trip!","review":"Having read both \\"Trading With The Enemy,\\" and, \\"Confessions of a Street Addict,\\" all I can say is, I'd like to have Cramer trading for me. The man is brilliant and, entertaining as hell. I highly recommend both books, with Maier's book getting a slight edge for readability."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story of the Also-Rans","review":"This book appears to be a knock-off of the feisty, both enthralling and appalling \\"Confessions of a Street Addict\\" by James Cramer. Cramer admits that he's not a very nice guy to work with, but he can write and tell a story. Nicholas Maier whose only claim to fame is that he knew a friend of Cramer's which got him his job, for which he did not appear to be very talented, and he leaves at the end to go back to his family, much richer, thanks to Cramer, and he would lead us to believe wiser. Cramer at least has passion for his work. Mr. Maier seems only to have sour grapes. It's not a good read. His book only confirms Cramer's account of himself, but Cramer's account is much more compellingly written, even suspenseful. Mr. Maier should have quit sooner and should not have bothered to write this sorry little tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is rocking Wall Street!","review":"Nicholas Maier has given us an amazing insight into the truth behind the Jim Cramer that we see everyday on TV. Mr. Cramer can protest all he wants, but I don't think that even he can stop the truth from coming out this time. This book is a raw, honest look into Cramer's manipulation of Wall Street. This story is exploding - Read the book that started it all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality Investing","review":"There seems to be a discontinuity between trading a la James Cramer and rational investing a la TheStreet.com. Is Jim just a day trader or did his hedge fund have significant long term holdings? The author doesn't tell. Of course, there had to be significant long term positions, but the author wants to attack Jim so that is what he does. It's hard to believe Jim or anyone short of a gangster would threaten another man's children. Maybe he was yelling that garbage into a dead telephone to relieve pressure. This is a story I cannot trust. What we have here is an author who lived in an alleged hell for five years who only left after he was fired and then complains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgruntled Employee Trashes Employer","review":"Basically, this book is about a young man who lands a job at Jim Cramer's hedge fund. Works there for 4 years, makes more money that \\"both his parents combined\\", and then finally walks out after the Cramer gets fed up with him.There are some funny moments in the book, like when Jim throws computer monitors across the room, bashes copy machines into small pieces, constantly yells obscenities, threatens brokersThis writer would probably do a good job for the National Enquirer. Let's take a story and but a monster twist on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to decide who I dislike more...","review":"As portrayed in the book, Jim Cramer is one of the most loathsome figures on Wall Street. The only slight mitigating factor is that Cramer appears to be a text-book bipolar personality and therefrore pity rather than hatred seems the more appropriate emotion in his case. Unfortunatly for the reader, Maier is hardly a sympathetic charater either. Maier fed at Cramer's trough for years never having had the courage to stand up for himself, his co-workers or his friends (especially his lifelong friend Marty Peretz). Maier's public attack and betrayal of Cramer (and partner Jeff Berkowitz) with a kiss-and-tell book is so, well...Crameresque. However, unlike Cramer, Maier cannot plead the insanity defense.Stick to Liar's Poker if you want a good, funny inside Wall Street book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read....It should be reprinted now that Cramer is Hot","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it.

He says everything much better than I can.Second, the whole book is summed up this way: Maier is upset that Cramer (may have) yelled at him. Anyone who has ever worked on Wall Street, especially a trading room, knows this is par for the course. Maier goes on and on for 200 pages how Cramer yelled. As the publisher has already admitted the fabrication of some details (WDC insider trading) one, must take everything that is said with a grain of salt.Third,there is no character developement-none-all characters are presented as one dimensional.The book is a waste of money.Finally, I would like to comment on some of the reviews other people have left. Some, not all, have grudges to bear with Jim Cramer. Why? My guess is because Cramer has made recommendations that have gone against them and lost these reviewers money, probably on several occasions. I also woulnd't be surprised if one person left more than one review."},{"rating":"1","title":"lies lies lies","review":"Poor Nick Maier. ... even the publisher had to admit that \\"Cramer & Company did not conduct any trading activity in Western Digital Corporation in reliance on inside information.

The various incidents are either funny or at least interesting. The author rely doesn't complain very much, but rather simply presents Mr. Cramer's antics. The most interesting thing about the book is seeing Cramer behave in ways that are totally inappropriate and down right dehumanizing, but never suffer any real consequencies for his bad behavior. If you are interested in Jim Cramer and his world, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!","review":"MR. Maier's bravery and honesty should be commended! It is about time that Jim Cramer is exposed for the fraud that he is. Don't just take my word for it...see what Victoria Murphy has uncovered.

Much of his writing contains vocabulary terms that are unknown to 99% of Americans (who knew there was a glossary at the back?). Furthermore, Balf's writing is amateurish even if he is judged against other \\"journalistic\\" authors. I expected this to be a page turner, but instead found myself trudging on in order to finish. Balf has no idea how to create any sense of suspense in his writing, which, in the end, is part of the purpoose of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book-on-Tape Review","review":"Although I \\"listened\\" to this book on tape, I too was lulled into thinking this is like Jon Kraukauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" -- hardly. It is interesting and at first I didn't realize it was a true story. Balf's book does give a bit of a behind-the-scenes glance at how a trek like this is set up & the importance of the personalities of the people undergoing the trek....but I agree with previous reviewers that this was no page-turner (or let's put it this way, I wasn't sitting in my garage, after coming home from my commute, to stay listening to the tape). If you are a kayaker, maybe this is for you - having trekked in Nepal, I found some of the countryside info of interest, but can't really recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money","review":"This is an appalling book which should never have been written. Whitewater kayaking is about the most exhillerating sport around but this book never gets near to it. Sure the characters in it are some of the finest boaters around but this was hardly their greatest trip. Indeed they never really even started the trip before disaster struck. There is only so much you can write about a trip that barely started and this description is about 200 pages too long. It might have been a little more interesting with some photos or, if the print budget couldn't stretch to photos, at least a decent map. But there is nothing. It is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why compare kayaking to climbing?","review":"I have read this book recently, and couldn't stop wondering about the fact that Todd Balf keeps writing about climbing. His book is about kayaking!

I found the coverage of measurement, testing purposes, reliability, and validity to be very useful. Perhaps the one warning I would give is that this book is a little statistics-heavy, and it assumes that you have at least some knowledge of statistics. If you don't have any knowledge of statistics, then the sections on reliability and validity may take a little work to get though. In that case, I recommend Brown's text on testing.

It is complete as possible, though it does not possess some collaborations. It would be pointless to review the individual songs. It is packaged as simply possible without obstructions. It is weighty book. It does not even have the year the songs were written accept in the back. It does not provide context of the year or try to explain why the song was written. Ask any writer every ten year about the same song and you'll get completely different answers, none of them wrong. Either would be a distraction and open to interuption and context.

A lot of the uncovered material was general Real Estate law, and was totally ignored by this book. I would spend your money on something that focuses on your specific exam, Borders had several books that focus specifically on the AMP test and looked much more in line with what I saw on the exam.

If you want good hard rock, go listen to Stavesacre or something. The bigger problem (and reason I can't listen to Kutless) isn't the music, although it's definately nothing to shout about. It's the fact that the lyrics seem to have taken all the genius of a five-year-old and the effort of scribbling down notes during lunch. Maybe Kutless should focus more on making decent music and just drop the lyrics altogether - at least then the listening would be tolerable.PS-Nothing against the guys in the band.

However, I would like to ask a question: How many more bands that sound like Creed will have to emerge before people have had enough? There are so many groups out there right now with pounding guitars and a tough-sounding lead singer that my head spins trying to keep them all straight. The Calling, Pearl Jam, Plumbline, Alice in Chains... they all sound the same. In my humble opinion, it's high time that a little creativity, originality, and interest be pumped back into the music scene, Christian or otherwise. So nothing personal, but I think your money could probably be better spent somewhere else, perhaps on one of the countless immensely talented bands who never see the light of day, because no one bothers to make a pseudo-grunge product out of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbing, compelling memoir!","review":"Kathryn Harrison's The Kiss is quite an intense memoir. Kathryn Harrison's four-year-old incestuous affair with her father is disturbing and disarming. Despite the fact that she mentions all of the events that lead to her relationship with her father -- her loveless childhood, her struggles with eating disorders and depression -- Harrison does not expect her readers to pity her. Her memoir is honest and compelling. I applaud her ability to share her truths. I'm glad she told her startling story to the world. She is an amazing author -- one of the best authors of this era. I recommend this book to those who like books with unflinching honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"morally reprehensible","review":"Harrison has talent as a writer. Unfortunately, understanding that this is a 'true confession' leaves me with little sympathy for the author. She was 20 when the affair started, however, I wonder if she had the moral consciousness of a 3-year old, or if she was as much a sociopath as her father? From her telling, it seems the incest was motivated by a rage toward the mother, both by the husband and the daughter. All three individual's are so completely self-absorbed as to act with only pointed hurt toward one another, while trying to justify their sadism by proclaiming their own victimhood. I wonder what would motivate a person to reveal something that portrays herself in such a horrific way, is it a desire to shame herself in public........or sell books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The slowest kiss ever","review":"Touchy topic, but if you can handle reading about a father molesting his twenty year old daughter, than try this one. But don't expect a story that moves a long. How can you critique a memoir, well it's not the true story that is the problem. You come to understand, and empathize how this yong girl was able to allow her father to start doing this at such an old age. But here is the problem with this book. It took me some time to read it. I could only muddle through 10-15 pages at a time.I write poetry so naturally i like metaphors, but this book is so filled with metaphors that if it was a person talking it would almost be sickening to hear. I just didn't really enjoy it, and i thought it was exhausting. Just a overuse of metaphors, and unessesary comparrisons out of nowhere as if she is struggling to make this dark story even more dark.Would definately not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"When I picked up this book, I thought it would be an interesting. Hell, having an affair with your dad is as messed up as it gets. The way Harrison writes is very annoying and distracted me from the main point.

I read a couple of chapters and couldn't go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entrancing, Horrifying, Blindingly Honest","review":"In simple, powerful prose, Kathryn Harrison tells a story of something that no human being should have to endure, of the incestuous abuse that happened to herself.I find it stunning that Harrison was able to write about her abuse with such mental acuity, such wisdom, and such vicious honesty.While the events in this book were horrifying beyond belief, I simply could not put it down, could not stop reading it, and go back to it time and again. Like the narcotic kiss Harrison describes her father inflicting upon her, I find the book to be like morphine: powerful, seductive, addictive, and sickening.The worst of the reality in this book is that Harrison has exposed something that truly happens, something our society hides, something we pretend does not exist. This book is so real, it must be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Piece of Art","review":"After reading this book, I consider it the most intellectually complete pieces of writing ever to be comprised into a book. It is not for everyone. I feel one must either have a literary background or high score of emotional intelligence to truly appreciate the metaphors and psychological insight this author paints. The author is refreshingly honest, a saving grace for the times I found myself lost in the time gaps - in other words, how could I complain about the writer not explaining enough while she has exposed SO much. What makes her story different than other memoirs, is she tells it from retrospect, analyzing herself openly, which is fascinating to the curious heart. Ironically, she writes in the present tense. ...I think she portrayed her story perfectly. Her story is not uncommon, just unspoken, but I am grateful this author has produced such a comprehensible outline of how one can fall so far by the aid of heartache, and the stroke of one selfish man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling and Excellent","review":"A beautifully composed story, this book tells a frightening tale of control and abuse. Unlike what many may think - this is a not a sex story. I read this book from start to finish without putting down, even though it was a suspense story, which normally precipitates that dedication.This book is not for the squeamish, nor for those that are used to buryig their heads in the sand. It let me understand more about myself and others. Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"disturbing but very good","review":"This is a very brave book. It isn't easy to read due to the subject matter but it is certainly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As enjoyable as a book about incest can be","review":"Obviously, there is nothing pleasant about the topic of this memoir, which surrounds Kathryn Harrison's sexual relationship with her father. \\"The Kiss\\" is disturbing, intense, and reads like a very bad dream. Reading the book was like watching a very bad car accident...I couldn't turn away. Also, I was struck by Harrison's bluntness and honesty, and admire her for having the courage to share this horrific tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I fail to see the purpose of this book. What did the author want to accomplish by writing it? I hate to come across as cold and unsympathetic, but I find it hard to call what transpires \\"abuse\\". Abuse is what happens to children who are helpless to defend themselves or to know that a wrong is being committed against them. As a young women that grew up without a father, in a not-so-stable home myself, I feel somewhat justified in saying that all the author needed to do was stay away from her father to prevent this tragedy.Aside from the topic of the book, I did not enjoy Ms. Harrison's style of writing. I enjoy good writing, am not a \\"Jackie Collins or Danielle Steel kind of reader\\" (no offense to any that are fans of these authors) yet I found this book boring and difficult to finish. Bottom line: save your money. This book is not as intriguing, nor is the author as sympathetic as you might think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true story that will shock you.","review":"The Kiss by Kathryn Harrison was eloquently written. I truly enjoyed this book, even though the content was a little grotesque. I never thought that I would enjoy a book about this subject, but the way she wrote really pulled me in. I couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paging Joan Didion...","review":"My rating is based on the intrinsic literary merits of the book, not the moral stature of the author. (Just for the record: I would have an easier time respecting this as \\"an act of courage\\" if the author hadn't inched her way up to it through several earlier fictions, as if she were performing a striptease, and let no one equate the victimization of a defenseless child with the legally - and, one would hope, ethically - responsible actions of a 20 year old woman.) It's written in stark prose that aspires to the taut suggestiveness of Joan Didion or (more likely, given Harrison's penchant for glamour) Marguerite Duras but is more often merely flat and affectless. This may be an after-effect of surviving incest but this isn't a diary we're reading, it's purportedly \\"literature\\", and it must be judged accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kiss is very engaging particularly for survivors of incest themselves","review":"Katheryn knows how to describe her experience of participating in a family taboo. Her eloquence and honesty makes this a book that can't be put down. I only wish there was more! It's kind of a let down and I don't know if her other books are as intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incest","review":"The book is an emtional look through the eyes of an incest survivor. The book is well written and accounts the life filled with manipulations. I am absolutely amazed that this child found the courage to survive.Also recommend: Nightmares Echo by Katlyn Stewart"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cha-ching!","review":"Kathryn Harrison milks incest for all its worth in this drab memoir, and I don't doubt it paid off handsomely. Readers, on the other hand, are likely to feel robbed. Harrison's involvement, for one thing, is too close for her to have any perspective, and her whining, pity-me tone cuts no ice. The story by itself is not without interest; it just needs a real writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writer, horrifically disturbing.","review":"Let me shoot straight to the point. The book was astoundingly disturbing. The funny thing is, I can understand where she would feel the need to have done what she done. However, to keep obssessing about incest, as she does with her other books, just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I thought I was in for some heart wrenching revelations about the human mind. She didnt really delve into the emotional aspects about the wanting and lack of relationship she had with her mother above all. I honestly, got the creeps just reading more into her story and its truly not inspiring in any way. The saddest part of her book was when she dreamed of her mother. THAT was sad. But the other stuff just struck me as shock value. It was too convoluted. All I can say is that she is messed up mentally and emotionally from her truly sick family. I wouldn't touch this with a 3 ft. poll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"The synopsis of this book left be hopeful, but reading it left me disappointed.It is very hard to sympathize with the character, which is amazing since she is supposed to be a victim. However, this book is completely unbelievable and a sorry read at that.I felt like I was cheated and forced to read rubbish after I was through."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"Forget for a moment the subject matter. The storytelling is very confusing. Flashing back. Flashing forward. And she offers readers very little in terms of guidance. I had heard many things about Ms. Harrison's work.

She's married to the deputy editor of Harper's, the last bastion of upper west side smarmy NIMBY liberalism in the U.S. She's written some critically acclaimed novels, but sales are not as they should be (or her or publisher or hubby would like). What to do? Well, I would recycle the plot of my FIRST novel, style it as a confession a la Oprah and -- well, as one reviewer said, ka-ching! Brilliant, but nauseatingly cynical. Her New Yorker writer style, with its charming little images and two-bit solipism, might appeal to teens who like Nine Inch Nails, but this is not linerature for adults. It's a swinish attempt to cash in on the faux-confessional trend that dominated American letters in the late 90s, and succeeded magnificently. Colin and Kathryn Harrison are the Borgias of American fiction. As Lee said of Pope, \\"[They] should be suppressed.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great at all","review":"I love reading different type's of memoirs....but this one lacked any meaning. Even though the book subject is extremly disturbing it was hard to get into the main characters head and really \\"get it\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intimate look into a girl's experience with men","review":"This book goes beyond telling a story of the injustice of incest but gives a revealing view of what young women grow up experiencing from a world where men knowingly or unknowlying abuse and exploit women for their own self-gratification and self-esteem. This book more accurately depicts how men are no longer our \\"knights in shining armor\\" but now are really selfish, grown up babies. I would definitely recommend this book to any naive girls who's hearts have been broken more than once by men and still don't understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Incest\\" is a tantalizing pigeon-hole, but not the","review":"Buy this book because the reviewers are outraged that an adultdaughter committed incest with her Father. It's a juicy topic. HowDARE they! Then watch yourself, at the hands of this incredibly talented author, get wrenched in an emotional storm like you've never felt before. Kathryn Harrison is holding up a mirror. So you haven't committed incest? Ah, well, I bet you see yourself on these pages anyway. We are, ALL of us, starved for love and approval. And we haven't the slightest notion just exactly how far we'll go to get it. The author's particular talent is in using the words such that the emotions they evoke drown out the words. I'm no literature student by any stretch, but I've not had any other author \\"strum my strings\\" like this one. This is an \\"important\\" book.

Aaliyah's version of \\"Journey\\" knocked it out of the park, mixing some good r&b into it. Liz's \\"Once Upon A December\\" is also haunting, and you do wish she'd remember why she sees such visions.

The soundtrack and score are breathtakingly beautiful; \\"Once Upon a December\\" will transport anyone back to that time and lose you in the past. \\"Journey to the Past\\" and \\"Paris Holds The Key ...\\" are my other favourites.That said, however. Do NOT watch this film if you're interested in Romanov history. It's about as historically inaccurate as you could get.

Finally, Liz Callaway gets to sing something better than the stuff Disney gave her in the Aladdin sequels, and the actors singing Rasputin and Dimitri do a great job.

Also, it doesn't work that the illustrations clearly show a modern setting (at least a 20th century one), but she keeps referring to an \\"ancient barn.\\" It renders the story historically inaccurate for a telling to children, which is a disappointment.

Thanks for the books !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible explanations and techniques! 8","review":"This was the book that our teacher used in our Visual C++ class. It was absolutely horrible in explaning what was going on within the code. I still have no idea what went on during that class. I really wish that our teacher would have used another book. Ivor seems to me a very confusing man...and to most of my class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for beginners","review":"After picking up a couple of other books on programming with Visual C++, I came across this one. The explanations of the language are very good, especially classes which are covered by four chapters. Most of the code examples are, of course, trivial problems, but Mr. Horton did an excellent job of explaining what was going on. I guess my only complaint with the book was occasional lapses in explanation of what exactly the code is doing and why he chose to do it that way. Perhaps a more thorough discussion of the design aspects of programming would help. Of course the book is already well over 1000 pages. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad way to begin C++","review":"Ivor Horton has written several C++ books. It's quite disappointing that the level of \\"Beginning C++ : The Complete Language ANSI/ISO Compliant\\" is not maintained in this book at all. The source samples do not compile, the C++ language tutorial is very superficial and so is the coverage of Windows programming. A sheer disappointement (and a pretty expensive one too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy, outdated and dilettante book","review":"This book looks like a recycled version of Beginning VC++ 4.0 (or earlier). Nothing about the new intellisense, edit-and-continue or auto-complete features. C++ coverage is outdated and sloppy, major topics like RTTI, namespaces, STL and many others are not discussed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my bacon . . .","review":"I bought a couple of Visual C++ books preparing for a senior project coding final. I ended up working through the odbc database section in this book over and over again.

If you work through the examples in this book, you will gain the ability to use Visual C++."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for very patient beginners","review":"I have bought and read numerous C++ books, and this one is definetly one of the best ones out there. It really does start from scratch, building all the way up from \\"Hello, World\\" to some pretty advanced topics, such as MFC and ATL. However, it does take things slowly, so you might consider getting a supplemental book, such as Deitel & Deitel's \\"C++ How to Program.\\" Often times I found myself being so bored, that I has to read that lesson over and over again. So any other textbook-like book will help to get thru things faster and more efficently. Ivan Horton is a great teacher, and why then learn from anyone else?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this one if you want to master it through","review":"As everybody knows Visual C++ is a must who is going to write big Windows applications. This book is the one out there which can teach you how to begin with it, if you only had experience with other programming languages or have patience and can slowly and carefully read through 1200 pages full of information. It is even a good book if you know yourself around with C++ programming and just want to learn Visual C++.Ivor Horton's style is very straight forward and if you are interested in programming it keeps you going through all those pages without actually being boring or repeating itself. I can only say this book is really a 5 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I just hated this book.The author has this one example that he uses for 10 chapters.So if you suddenly wanna learn how to write a Dll you have to go back atleast 5 chapters and read everything.Besides what kind of an example is the draw line,circle and curve.The author should have used a more mature and useful example.I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"excessively complex","review":"The idea is great. The book covers a good amount of C++, and then moves on to MFC. The execution of the idea is terrible. It seems Mr. Horton spends more time showing off his abilities as a programmer then he does trying to explain the concepts. My teacher used this book in a college MFC programming class. I hardly ever touched this book, and was forced to use others for reference. Almost everything I learned about C++, I learned from lectures and other books, and everything I learned about MFC, I got from \\"Practical Visual C++\\", which manages to focus on MFC while teaching it instead of focusing on an excessive amount of trivial C++ code. If you want to get a good feel of C++, get \\"Beginning Visual C++\\" by Tony Gaddis. It covers more then the first half of Horton's book, and explains it well (unlike Horton). True, you might end up spending a bit more money then just by buying this book, but at least you'll have an idea of whats going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, very smooth and accurate easy to follow","review":"This has been the best C++ book I have ever read. Not only does the author provide comprehensive coverage of Visual C++, he also gives an A-1 intro to the language itself. I am not a beginner at C++, but I am new to MS VC++, however, the explanation of the basic C++ language given in the first several chapters filled in nicely the gaps in my knowledge. I highly recommend this book without hesitation. If you want a quick grasp on a powerful language you need this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start!","review":"I am an Online Instructor for 22 Colleges and have many volumes of the latest Visual C++ texts. Horton has been the only Author to start with console apps and incorporate the meatier fundamentals of C++. Horton evolves this insight into win32 and of course MFC. The reality is the C-World is still at the command line level. The High Priests of the MicroSoft world have had a priveledged environment. Most of us cant go there. The business industry demands the C programmers deliver/convert existing apps to Windows applications for 98/NT and Win2000.

I think this book is only good for dummy users and the ones who really don't know programming in C++. It doesn't suit the title of the book.

Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable. Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch. First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg. Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel. Secondly, this is set in modern day. So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves. Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel. Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion. For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent \\"Austin Powers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Hopeless TV Retread","review":"No one was clamoring for a big-screen remake of the classic \\"Avengers\\" TV series, but Hollywood didn't listen and churned out this forgettable box-office fiasco. Despite its impressive visual style, the finished product made a good cast look terribly foolish. Ironically, the film's most positive aspect was introducing new viewers to the original exploits of John Steed and Emma Peel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird as hell, and terrific !!!","review":"This movie was hilarious from beginning to end - from Steed's (Ralph Fiennes') first scene when he is \\"working out,\\" to seeing Mrs. Peele(Uma Thurman) storm into his traditionally all-male club (the shock and horror of the members was priceless), to suddenly seeing businessmen concealed in Grateful Dead-type bear suits. This film definately isn't for the unimaginative or those who want a meathead , predictable spy story like James Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"unforgivably bad","review":"How can you improve on perfection? The original series with Diana Rigg was one of the best ever. It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories. It was a wonderful world unto itself.By contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story. But it fails utterly.This film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book. Not only do Fiennis and THurman utterly lack chemistry, in spite of their great talent, but the plot is simply and stupidly unbelievable. I think that this is the worst tv-remake I have ever seen. That answers the question: you shouldn't try to exploit perfection by slapping together a stupid film.Not recommended. THere are far better things to waste one's time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"As a big fan of the original TV series (I saw them all in reruns), I was extremely disappointed by this movie. Fiennes and Thurman are fine actors individually, but together in the roles of John Steed and Emma Peel they lacked any chemistry whatsoever. They just didn't capture the flirtatious, twinkle-in-eye relationship of Steed and Emma. The plot was forgettable and rumor has it, Connery, who played the villain, didn't want the movie to be released once he saw how it bad came out. If you're the curious type, and I was, you'll sit through Avengers The Movie, but don't have high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Something","review":"Connery was good. Thurman was good. Fiennes was good. The supporting cast was fair-to-middling. The teddy bear scene was a trip. But the film was lacking a certain carefree quality.

Steed and Peel don't come across as witty and smart; their dialogue seems stilted and geared to one-up each other (\\"I'm wittier than you.\\" \\"No, I'm wittier than you.\\" \\"No, I'M wittier than YOU.\\" etc.) There was almost no chemistry between the stars, which is what held the TV show together. There also seemed to be a lot cut out as the plot really didn't explain what Prospero was about and how DeWynter's weather generating equipment would work against it. The weather equipment also seemed to work only because DeWynter said it did.

Fiennes and Thurman has got absolutely no chemistry together which was partly why the series worked so good. The FX is okay but watching Sean Connery in a teddybear suit...I mean, even as a so-bad-it's-good movie it doesn't work.

The only thing worth mentioning is how much work in must have taken to make Sean Connery look so bad on screen. Patrick McNee, the original John Steed, appears as an invisible man.

But the characters were poorly developed and generic (I *really* wanted to like Fiennes' character, but just couldn't), the plot was just silly, and the whole giant teddy bear thing was too surreal and freaky to be anything but acid-inspired.I bought this movie only because I wanted to see Uma Thurman in a skin-tight leather outfit, and because it had a Jaguar E-Type on the cover. I admit that watching Uma fight with herself is certainly worth paying for, but the rest of the movie has me wondering why the studio didn't pay ME to sit through it.

It must be deliberate...","review":"Whether you've seen the original series or not, anyone with half a brain can see that this film is terrible from start to finish. The script is lame, Fiennes and Thurman sleepwalk through their roles with no feeling, the special effects are totally unnecessary (did they blow up Big Ben just so the Americans would think it was all so quaintly British?) and the direction was unimaginative. The plot idea was quirky and off-the-wall, but the way it was told was just so stupid it went from amusingly silly to boringly stupid very quickly. A must-see for all those insomniacs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrendous","review":"This movie is the one of the top ten worst films I have ever seen. The story makes no sense whatsoever, the characters are very wooden (all three of them), and most of the effects were thrown in to waste money (flying mechanical bees? give me a break).

Please, for the love of God, avoid this movie at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big big big flop","review":"This movie is an insult to the original serie. The worst movie I saw in 1998 (as a matter of fact the worst since at least ten years!). No complicity between Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes and even Sean Connery is bad.

Alas I have never been more disappointed when watching a film. Compared to the series, the portrayal of the characters was dire, (especially Ralph Finnes as Steed)and the script was lacklustere and tedious. The only scene which gains some merit is the scene with the electronic bees, but this cannot compensate for the apalling drivel in the rest of the movie. Altogether, a great shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN>TERRIBLE!!","review":"The original series was great. However this movie didn't live up to the original. I have told several people if they happened to be at a local dump and they spotted a copy of this movie still sealed in the original wrapper just leave it there.

Too bad amazon doesn't give you the rate of 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"This movie must have been done by \\"The Producers.\\" Every thing possible to make it unrealistic seems to have been done.Steed and Emma seem to be culturally lower class people who have come into inheritances which they use to buy expensive clothes. The actress that plays Emma would be more realistically cast as a prostitute.The characters substitute arrogance for talent.My favorite bad scene is where Emma is walking away from Steed and unable to see him. She has her sword over her shoulder point to her back. Steed hits her sword on opposite sides with his sword. This is something the Three Stooges would do. The real Steed would have whacked Emma's bottom with his sword."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"Even though we approached this movie with the attitude that it had the same title and characters as a series that we enjoyed, but that it would most likely be different from the series, we were seriously disappointed. The movie stinks. 'Steed' is not comfortable with his umbrella or his bowler hat, and 'Mrs. Peel' is channelling 'poison ivy' from the Batman film. The plot is threadbare, the acting is woeful. Even Sean Connery fails to save this movie.Rent it if you have to watch it, it's not worth buying. Better yet, buy one of the box sets of the original series. Even on her worst days, Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel is far sexier and wittier than Uma Thurman's attempt, and Patrick Macnee's wit and dry humour has to be seen to be believed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"One should never fear of being wet...\\"","review":"I have to say that I am not familiar with the series, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that did not \\"know\\" of The Avengers prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!Apart from the GREAT cast (Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery among others) and the very good acting, the plot and the dialogues are way below average! In addition, the whole \\"weird\\" atmosphere just for the sake of being \\"different\\" and \\"original\\" just falls flat!Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really...In a nutshell, it's a weak movie; it lacks that something to make it bearable, let alone put it over the top. No masterpiece here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful","review":"A Movie that just tries to hard to be clever & succeeds only in making the film worse and driving the viewer closer & closer to despair. Plot - Well not Much can be said for it since it really was awful, Did you care what happened? Did anyone come across well? No! The shame was that the potential was there but unforunately this mix of a typical Hollywood Plot & the sureallism that was attempted failed dismally.

A total disgrace to the original TV series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your time more constructively -- view something else!","review":"I loved the TV show. The surreal situations, the action, but mostly the clever banter between Peel and Steed. And it is mostly for lack of the latter, that this film doesn't work. Where there should be lightning quick exchanges there are holes in the repartee you can drive a Mack Truck through.Uma Thurman was a poor choice to play Emma Peel. Her English accent sounds awkward and contrived. Often she accents the wrong word within a phrase giving the impression that 1) she doesn't understand the meaning of the lines she's delivering 2) she's reading her lines from cue cards.Let's face it, big budget production values aside, without the Peel/Steed repartee and chemistry there was no point in making this movie.Spend your money wisely. Buy the videos of the TV show instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"Well as many have said so far I too was looking forward to this movie thus when I saw it I was shocked.With a cast of true performers I was really expecting a \\"knock your socks\\"off movie!.The story must have been dreamt up by a seven year old Teddy bears and all!!.My only unanswered question is why did Sean Connery aggree to feature in this movie its the mystery of the century......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes down like a seaweed sandwich","review":"Great actors.

The plot is so in-expertly woven, the characters so undeveloped, the action so random and disjointed, this movie put me to sleep just after the first hour. I simply cannot believe that Sean Connery, one of the greatest actors of (and before) my time, would agree to a starring role in such an embarassing display."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Totally anticipated, sadly disappointing. I don't think the director had a clue what makes the Avengers tick. It started out flat, the timing was off, and the movie was over before any chemistry ever hit the screen.

It is my personal opinion that this tasteless spectacle is the all-time WORST movie ever made. The plot was unexistent, the screenplay was terrible, and it was tooooooooo long! Oh sure, you say, 100 minutes is too long, but we all could have done without guys dressed like huge teddy bears and five minutes of Uma Thurman running through the same room! Who shot this movie, some wacko experimental filmmaker trying to shock the public? But the biggest blow was the acting. Thurman and Ralph Fiennes turned in totally dispirited performances, and Sean Connery played the worst character of his great career, throwing his wonderful talents away like the garbage this \\"movie\\" is. I issue a word of warning to all film lovers everywhere: don't see The Avengers!!!

Thurman was still with none of the style or appeal of Diana Rigg. Fiennes had no savy at all - way too stiff. And what was with the sauna scene or the scenes when they kept taking one another to thier apartments. The relationship between McNee and Rigg probably gave way to classic TV relationships like Sam & Diane on cheers and others. No innuendo and no need for it. What about Sean Connery? Does this guy need the money? Nice bear suit but I would have left the head on so my face wouldn't have been show. No wit, no savy, just nothing. Even Patrick McNee played the invisible man.

Perhaps my expectations of a thrilling remake of a favorite childhood show were too high. The writers, producers, and directors should all be flogged.The storyline held no suspence of disbelief because it was hard to care about the characters let alone any predicaments they may have gotten themselves into. The premise was completely unbelievable.

Do not encourage Hollywood to make Avengers II."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Uma Thurman","review":"Since I had not seen the original series, I was not expecting anything for the actors. What I got however, was a very enjoyful movie. I though it was highly entertaining, and recommended it.

If you are not to shallow when you start watching this movie, then you should enjoy it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad script good actors","review":"I liked the original Avengers and I liked this movie. The script was not a very good one, but the sexy-stilish-modern acting of Sean Connery and especially Uma Thurman was extraordinary. If you haven't seen the TV Series you surely won't get the feeling that comes with this movie and some \\"for insider\\" ones. Like the unvisible man which is ridiculus but from an original episode. The picture is clear and sharp as well as the bright colors from the cinema are displayed very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining , but a little lacking in substance","review":"I thought the movie brought back a sense of 60's charm of the original avengers series. (If you have never seen the series you will think this movie is the biggest flop ever.) I think the director should have spent less money on special effects (especially the flying bug scene ?) Sometimes I think when making movies they think the namebrand actors like Connery , Thurman and Fiennes will just satisfy the audience, well this movie proves that wrong. It is very entertaining to see Connery in different roles rather than 007 and Fiennes in a different role than a SS officer. But, they still don't satisfy this movie watchers expectations. Nice try but this movie won't be a cult classic like it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the decade!","review":"As the late Thurston Howell III said on a Gilligans Island episode... \\"I would have walked out on this on an airplane\\". Even that would have been too kind for this movie. What was Sean Connery thinking when he accepted this role. A producer probably had some dirt on him. It least I hope so. I went to see it only because I trusted his judgement on quality. I will not make the same mistake again. Only buy it if you want to give it to enemy for a birthday present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh..

And this pathetic movie is one of them.I'm not sure what they were thinking, but the plot is slow, the british humor is lamer than normal, and what on earth was up with the giant Grateful Dead-esque Teddy Bear costumes??The only thing worse than watching this movie is the fact I originally confused it with something else and didn't realize I'd seen part of it on Cable before and then ended up trying to watch it again to see if it realliy was that bad.. and indeed it was. I couldn't sit through more than 1/3 of it this time either..No James Bond/007 here.. this is a big dud.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder how...","review":"from a succesfull TV-Series and with actors like Connery, Thurman and Fiennes, they come out with this???

However, that doesn't save this film from extreme mediocrity. Even the worst 'Tough LA cop fighting the drug cartel' film has more going for it than this.This film dissapoints in almost all areas. The plot is far fetched and weak. Half the film is set in the 1960s, the other half in the 1990s, and the two halves do not marry well together. The special effects are mediocre. The film even drags down two excellent performers (Sean Connery, Uma Thurmann)who are given so little latitude that they can do nothing to salvage the situation. Overall, the impression is of a very second rate James Bond type movie, with cliches galore.I'm sorry Amazon, this review isn't going to sell you many copies of this DVD. The only people who would find this very interesting are young producers finding out how not to make an action movie.

Of course not, no one has an original thought anymore, so just rip-off from favorite old shows & so what if they're not box-office winners, SOMEBODY out there will pay their good old hard earned money to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peeeeeww!","review":"The less-demanding critic may hail it as being sharply witty, but an apology is due to those viewers smacking of intelligence.

It has NO redeeming features. Don't buy it! Don't rent it! Instead, spend your money on copies of the old Avenger series starring Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg. You'll find genuine campy humour, British style, and the wonderful, sexy interaction between Steed and Peel that made the original show so inimitable. I'll take one of Rigg's tantalizing smiles over a rear view of Thurman in a leather cat suit, any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mrs. Peel, your needed, to destroy all copies of this film!!","review":"The most looked-forwarded to movie of the year for me.

I don't know how you can take an entertaining television show such as The Avengers ans make it boring, but the producers of this film did. Where the original was a little quirky, this was just stupid.Ralph Fiennes was accepatable as John Steed, but Uma Thurman is not English, and does a horible job as an English spy. I have an orginal idea, if the character is suppossed to be British, why not hire a British actor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avenge Garbage!","review":"One of the worst movies ever made. Watching Sean Connery in a bear suit while running around was ugly. The pair (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) have no chemistry what so ever and talk like their English. Horrible.

I'll just say this -- it's questionable whether this is a movie. There's a plot in the sense that the scenes are connected with some kind of logic. Zilcho story. The acting is about as good as those times when you read out dialogue in high school English classes.This is really an abomination which words find it hard to possibly convey to the reviewer.

Easily the worst big-budget \\"film\\" EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"How real do you feel Mrs Peel?","review":"Dry, arch...this could be Monument Valley, but tis an apt description of an underrated film. The original John Steed has been described as a man NSIT (Not Safe In Taxis)and the latest incarnation, the talented Mr Ralph Fiennes, is equally seductive(check out the leather boot scene, mmmm...). The killer bees, suprising nuns and decapitated teddy bears are in the spirit of the original show, as is the fencing in the gentleman's outfitters. Only mistake, and huge mistake at that, was at the end, allowing Steed and Peel to... Innuendo abounding, subtle and witty thoughout, so why? tell me why was THAT necessary? Smacks of pandering to the lowest common denom'.

It's the perfect video to watch when you're cleaning the house, because you can simply watch a scene here, a scene there, and not worry about missing scenes or missing out on the plot, because there is none. The sets are pretty, and Uma Thurman looks nice. There are some goofy situations. That's about it. If you want to watch a movie clean through, and be satisfied, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment for fans of Feinnes ...","review":"I saw this movie because I think Ralph Fiennes is a fabulous actor. But what was he thinking appearing in this stupid, cheesy flick? The actors sounded like high school drama students running lines -- there was no emotion. The plot was ridiculous.

I went to see it in the theatres with modest expectations, and proceeded to enjoy exactly 3 minutes of it (the cool opening titles). After that, I sat in astonished silence watching this obviously grossly expensive piece of trash. The fact that one of history's most dignified actors, Sean Connery, manages to give his single bad performance to date, is only one of the negatives on display here. THE AVENGERS occupies that strange void where it's badness can't even be laughed at. This movie is pure trash, and there are very few movies that I heatedly dislike. If you're reading this review and actually plan on buying this movie, I recommend you save your money.

If you don't cast a Diana Rigg then forget doing a remake. When Val Kilmer took on the role of \\"The Saint\\" it was casting agent Elisabeth Leustig and director Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games) that had the right stuff to revive a British staple of 60's television. It should have been Noyce directing \\"The Avengers-1998\\" as well, coupled with another incredible music score of Graeme Revell. I've no doubt it would have been DY-NO-MITE!

But Hollywood got it's paws on the story and ruined it. If your a fan of the show then you will hate this movie. I even tried to watch it a second time and just turned it off. This after Wal Mart had it for $5.00 on a discount rack. I should have been free.Nothing in this movie blends with the real show. Nothing! I only wish that the real Avengers fans had a say with the script before they drove the image in the ground. I bet the script writer never really watched the show in the first place.Stick with the original Avengers of the 60's. It can never be replicated. At least not in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"directors cut-you're needed","review":"i think it is almost common knowledge by now that this movie was cut to shreds after poor test screenings. A very good opening sequence was cut along with \\"backstory\\" scenes that would have ensured that the film made sense. Therefore this version has curiosity value because it shows exactly what happens to a film when a studio panics and decides that a film will exactly fit 90 minutes regardless of how it will affect the story. The directors cut is in the vaults and should be released on DVD now if only to show the fans what the original story was intended to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't See This Film","review":"I was too young to see \\"The Avengers\\" when it was showing in the late 60's, and I don't think it would have changed the way I would have felt about this movie. All the way home in my car I was running my fingers through my Rosary Beads praying that this great blight on the careers of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery would not harm the public perception of their talent, not to mention their ability to intelligently choose a marketable film. This film, undoubtedly the worst released in 1998, is plotless, thoughtless, witless, artless, not to mention just plain dumb. Not even the very talented cast assembled can salvage even one moment of artistic accomplishment in what on paper might have looked like a good idea but but on screen was a big-budget embarrassment. Poor Ralph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch alone...you'll want company for this one!","review":"This movie is either directed at the very young or the very young at heart: it's silly. And unfortunately, the plot neither stayed true to the series nor stood on its own very well. The dialogue was the biggest problem. It seemed like the cast actually spit out some of their lines like, \\"I can't believe you're making me say this!\\" Even still, it did have cult appeal: a few humorous lines and numerous cool special effects. (And wow, who picked out those clothes for Uma...could she have looked any better?) If you like silly, or can tolerate it, it's worth watching with a fun group of friends--and maybe a few good drinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"arg!","review":"i give this film two stars because although you have to question why three good actors such as these would even consider this script, they still acted well with the poor amount they got. but still, how could great actors such as these three accept such a terrible script? what were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"JEREMIAH CHECHIK WORST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME!","review":"Jeremiah Chechik completely ruined the remake of Diabolique although he had a cast to die for,Sharon Stone of the greatest actresses of our time and Kathy Bates who is a great Character actress...here he actually makes a boring action film.All style and no substance even achieving a mediocre performance from the always wonderful Sean Connery.All I Know is when you see Directed by Jeremiah Chechik or Joel Schumacher...avoid it like the plague.Joel Schumacher is supposedly attempting to remake a fabulous french film called L'appartement.That's like having a child restore a painting by Cezanne or Da Vinci....It would be an insult,like this whole film was.An embarassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing acting and plot","review":"A truly disappointing re-make of the Avengers series!

But, for heaven's sake, don't buy it till you've rented it! If you saw the previews, you saw the few good parts. It's a rambling mess of a film, more so than the '60s spoof \\"Casino Royale.\\" It's painful to see Sean Connery in arguably the worst movie he's ever been in. Connery has always seemed to bring some saving grace to any film he's been in--until now.

The answer is undoubtedly- YES! Also, this live album is way better than The Business Trip. The band is basically a four piece line-up (Bridgette can only be heard on a few tracks) at this point, so you can actually hear the music as it's not buried under a barrage of noise. The songs are longer and there is no fake applause, like on The Business Trip. Even more refreshing, is the total lack of those annoying momentum killing poetry readings and aimless keyboard instrumentals. I've had more success converting people to Hawkwind with this CD than any other Hawkwind CD. Also, unlike some other live Hawkwind releases, the quality of the recording is first-rate. Rock On!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawkwind - California Brainstorm' (Iloki)","review":"This disc,by some has been refered to as 'a companion CD' to the band's 'Palace Springs' disc since they were both recorded live on the band's 1990 U.S. tour.BELIEVE me,'Palace Springs' is SO much better.The only reason I'm giving this release a two star rating instead of one,is that \\"Ejection\\" actually sounds pretty decent,but even that track gets snipped off in the last couple of minutes.\\"Brainstorm\\" is a lame-ass mix and most of all \\"Refer Madness\\" is truly pathetic!For Hawkwind completists ONLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainstorm?","review":"This live set follows the much better 'Palace Springs' set.

It had mostly color plates of starfish, sponges, sea buscuits, other animal life. I was disappointed in that, but as most of their books have, a nice description on how to identify it. It does seperate out the different types of corals, such as brain coral, then different subspecies (depressed, common, sharp hilled) but NO good pictures. It tells depth circumferance and valley, color, nice descriptions. It does have some black & white photos of coral, but it really does not help much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This field guide does not meet the expectations and standards of a Peterson Field Guide. The line drawings are inaccurate and amateurish, not enough pictures, the pictures are not placed in any logical association with the material and too many black and white pictures of poor quality which makes identifying similar corrals and fish difficult.

I already had some experience but needed the particulars. I found the particulars but wasn't impressed with the information. I felt that the book is biased toward those who have a fair amount of experience and are ambitious enough to undertake a store front, while home-based businesses are made to seem unprofessional.

This book was not one of the better books of the series. The mystery is average, but lacks any original thought. The first 100 pages of the book are somewhat boring and rarely entice the reader to continue. After that, the book gets better and is fairly interesting until the end. If you can make it through the first half of the book, the second half is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something went wrong","review":"The author really missed when he wrote this one.

The brothers travel down under and like so many books during this era incorporated way too much educational material about the place they were visiting. Hello - This is a Mystery series - not an atlas! Horrible artwork. No surprise there. Overall the book ranks between horrible and average. It did contain a little suspense in a few places.

Unfortunately, the date it was written really shows because there's just way, way too much text for a picture book. So it takes too long to get the heart of the story, then the end feels rushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the whole truth","review":"At first I thought this was the truth (when I had read it back in 2005), but when I came to read Nightmare at Scapa Flow along with The Royal Oak Disaster, I soon learned that this book is largely lies, distortions, etc. brought about by Paul Weymar who had ghostwritten the book during the war as Mein Weg Nach Scapa Flow.There was no Pfalzburg, but rather a second Cape Horn ship known now as the Suomen Joutsen (back then as the Oldenburg). Jost Metzler's book The Laughing Cow even mentions having served on this ship with Prien...and that is just one of the many distortions in the book.I advise readers if they choose to buy this - to also buy Nightmare at Scapa Flow and The Royal Oak Disaster to learn more of the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost brilliant...","review":"One of the main reasons I bought this collection was for the Ibert. However, I was very unhappy with Galway's rendition of it. The third movement is so full of mistakes and cracks that I was rather surprised. Not to mention his lack of dynamics.

No Daniel Craig Bond themes either, because there were none when this was recorded.All performed by the original artists, all the recordings you know and loved when you heard them the first time (at least, they sound like it to me).The recordings are excellent, the mix is not in chronological order of release.And for my money, the ballads are the best even if the films they pushed weren't.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond by John Barry Title Tracks.","review":"With this CD you will reexperience each Bond movie with the authentictitle tracks from the movies.

I thought it had a great deal of potential, but was otherwise very bland and conventional. This recording, despite the vocal proficiency of the esteemed Colm Wilkinson, highlights that bland, convetional nonsense. I find most of the \\"11th hour songs,\\" the \\"showstoppers,\\" the majority of the songs on this album, to be utterly forgettable and derivative of pop songs on the radio's Top 40. The only thing saving this album are the few wonderful bits, like \\"Transformation.\\" I suggest purchasing another _Jekyll & Hyde_ album."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good....","review":"I bought this because I really loved Colm Wilkinson in Les Miserables, all 3 recordings of it I've heard with him, and also enjoyed his Stage Heroes CD. I own the Complete Work of Jekyll & Hyde too, and it blows this one away. I don't even think it is that great, but I must say it is much better than this. LETTING GO is probably the one song on this that I like. I don't think Colm gives a very good performance of Jekyll/Hyde, he sounds like he's just singing another song. Linda Eder sounds good, but I don't think the songs are well written. So in short, buy the Complete Work if you want Jekyll & Hyde, or spend your money elsewhere if you don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened, Colm?","review":"Now, normally, I am a BIG fan of Colm Wilkinson, but this just isn't right.

THis is one of those things that you get on a cheap tape that someone else makes for you, just because you're curious to hear how Colm Wilkinson would have sounded as Jekyll & Hyde. His wierdly undulating voice just doesn't work for the part. Linda Eder is, of course, wonderful, but she's on two other recordings as well...with two better Jekylls, with much better non-synthesized music, with much more songs...get my point? True, there are songs on this recording that aren't on the other two...and there's a reason for that. So, without wasting too much more space on this page, I suggest this: Hit the <back> button on your browser to return to the search query results you got when you did the search fro Jekyll & Hyde, then click on either the Original Broadway Cast Recording or the Double CD concept version and purchase either/both of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE VERSION THAT GOT J&H FANS HOOKED!","review":"THIS ORIGINAL CONCEPT VERSION OF JEKYLL AND HYDE SPAWNED A BIG FOLLOWING OF THE MUSICAL. IT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER CD WITH ANTHONY WARLOW AND THEN THE BROADWAY CAST ALBUM. HOWEVER, THE PARING OF COLM WILKINSON AND LINDA EDER IS A DREAM COME TRUE. COLM'S VOICE IS NEVER BETTER. THERE ARE TWO OR THREE SONGS SUCH AS \\"LOVE HAS COME OF AGE\\" THAT WERE CUT FROM THE BROADWAY SHOW, AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER, WHY? THE ALBUM IS WONDERFUL AND READING OTHERS DOWNGRADE IT IS VERY SURPRISING. ANYONE WITH A TASTE FOR FABULOUS AND ORIGINAL MUSIC WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM. WATCH FOR FRANK WILDHORN'S NEXT MUSICAL, \\"VIENNA\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably Bad","review":"This is a dreadful excuse for Broadway. The instrumentation is like that of disposable 1980's easy listening. The always over-rated Colm Wilkinson gives his worst and most vocally uneven recorded performance on CD. Linda Eder sings beautifully, though, but the cheesy electric piano arrangements kill the experience. Don't waste your money or time on this. Purchase either of the other two recordings that are actually scored and at least demonstrate the final vision of this mediocre piece. But, if you love Jennifer Warnes, Helen Reddy, and Anne Murray, then this is the CD for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Colm Wilkins...ugh","review":"I had first bought Jekyll and Hyde with Anthony Warlow, and LOVED it, so when I was looking to see if they had anymore other Jekyll CD's, I ran across this one and bought it. I wish I hadn't. Colm Wilkins playing this role was just wrong. He just doesn't know how to sing, but that's just my opinion.

The theme of this book is very weak or it is not fully exploited. I was expecting so much more of this book. I wanted to finish reading it soon not because it was good, but because it was SO BAD that I wanted to get my hands on a good book. Restrepo didn't focus on anything, she jumped from the situation of an affluent family in Colombia linked to drug trafficking, to a murder in a gym, to the life of the daughter who goes crazy, etc. The whole book presents a picture of life in Colombia to some extent but it only scratches the surface, and the result is a boring, confusing book. Furthermore, Laura Restrepo writes the same way as the master Saramago, but with so much less continuity that I think she should not try to write this way again.

I've always enjoyed reading her historical romance. Silent Rose is a good book. If your the type who go for ghosts and goblins and other supernatural beings (as I do) then this is one book you shouldn't miss. The only thing that made me hold back on that last star were the moments when the book dragged a bit. Devon and Jonathan are interesting characters though that hold your attention even through the slow pages. The kicker for me was the postcript from the author which says that some of the events described in the book happened to her! Makes you think more about the other \\"beings\\" existing in with us........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Romance","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all.

Unfortunately, the rather boring romantic aspects of the story seemed to be the main focus. It mostly consisted of the main characters saying \\"damn you\\" to each other. Also, what was up with the Japanese mistress and the sex scene in the limo? This type of thing may be standard in Regency romances (substitute \\"carriage\\" for limo), but they just didn't fly right in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the historicals Kat!","review":"What can I say?

Every time I sat down with it my mind started to wander and I found myself skipping over sections simply picking up dialogue in hopes that the plot would pick up. It started out interesting with the ghosts in the old house, but soon fell apart when she returned home to New York. I felt the main characters were rather cold and distanced from the reader. The relationship between the hero and heroine seemed staged rather than heartfelt. After about three hundred pages I couldn't stand it anymore. Too much pointless talk and descriptions and not enough action. Perhaps if she had cut the five hundred pages back to three hundred it would have been better. This is one I will definitely trade into the used book store so that I can pick up something more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bayco Work Light","review":"Recieved the trouble light in black.

My wife loves the album and now I find the wife digs Fish too! Needless to say I had to buy all of his albums! Which brings me to \\"Fellini Days\\". Its different than his previous albums. Alot less guitar, more synths, more personal, spacey....as usual Fish covers alot of ground. Favorite tracks....3D( The grass is so green) and Tiki 4.

Pulp's 'Like a Friend' is pure glitter rock, and Poe has a new song on here that exhibits her butterscotch voice perfectly. The only question I have is, why are so many of the songs on this CD not in the movie? That's extremly unusual, but I'm glad they did it, because it improved the album overall. Even jailbird Scott Weiland gives us a pleasantly kitschy-Paris like song in 'Lady Your Roof Brings Me Down.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety!","review":"This CD has a variety of musical styles and is enjoyable to listen to.

With ballad-like refrains and sublime descriptions of the harmonious way of Japanese life, we are drawn into an evocative portrait of what it means to be human, at our most elemental, and the effect is awesome.The hypnotic curiosity of a distant unrequited love leads the novel to its stark and tempestuos end, which lingers in your mind long after you've turned the last page in bewilderment.I have never read such an effortlessly haunting saga of compassion, obsession, intrigue.

Hervé Joncour organizes - in the course of four years - four expeditions to japan to buy healthy silkworm eggs.Between France and Japan there begins a confrontation between two different civilizations, between two worlds totally apart from each other. Misunderstandings occur and risk to jeopardize the negotiations. But beneath the surface a weird and peculiar love story begins between Hervé Joncour and the mistress of the Japanese negotiator. They are not able to touch or speak to each-other. The woman sends mysterious notes to the Frenchman and there is only one woman in the world who is able to translate them...Long and dangerous voyages, the soft sound of a voice, the sacralization of a magnificent and sensual silk tissue, all these things add to the mysterious atmosphere of Japan in the 19th century. But above all \\"Silk\\" is a poem about a fragile and impossible love-affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's calm down","review":"this novella's a breezy, engaging read, but it's principally a sketch and insufficiently developed to justify, in my view, the accolades it's getting from most reviewers. the story seems to me to exploit (and not so originally) a very basic, primitive fantasy. there's a somewhat neat twist towards the end, but still, it's pretty much a fluff piece, as i read it. this man can write, no question, but this is a light, not deep, book, whose impact dissipates quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely read","review":"An elegant, understated read.

It was given to me with rave reviews by my boss. I thought the info on the silk industry at the time was interesting. But I didn't get how he could fall in love with someone from such a distance. I didn't have any emotional investment in the characters. Like someone else said, maybe something was lost in the translation to English. Short read, so not a huge waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I thought this book would be brilliant given all the hype. It was alright, the style of writing wasn't really amazing, and the story was something of a short-story fairytale.

For gosh sakes this is LAS VEGAS in the super showroom built to house Ms Dion for five years, you know they've got the very best sound and video available, but this DVD is just a bad afterthought. It's a shame, because Ms Midler has always been captured best live on camera, and she has a whole catalogue of HBO shows that were extremely well done (but apparently aren't available today).I've loved Bette Midler her entire career, but this DVD is absolutely a piece of crap. Do not bother. It is an insult to one of the great talents of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Bette but...","review":"This is a very big disappointment. I don't understand why they just didn't record the whole Vegas show and release it that way. This doesn't show the fun side of Bette. I can't believe they left out the song \\"I Look Good\\".

How could she do this to her fans. The DVD is 67 minutes long. If it were not for the showgirls, and costumes it would have been worse.

When I heard about the Las Vegas show I was really excited and after seeing it on HBO I'm glad I wasn't able to see it there. Miss Midler seems to have phoned the show in. I wish she were hungry enough to try something unique again. This was just a rehashing of old hits and tedious patter. (Her patter used to be sharp and reflective, now it's whining) Miss Midler, there are plenty of new hits for you in the universe. Did Bruce Vilanche help you write this show? Perhaps he needs a makeover as well. Bette Midler has always been the one to reinvent the stage.

I am thinking of Diva Las Vegas, The Bette Midler Show, and Art or Bust as highlights of her finest moments.She seemed pissed off to have to be on stage throughout most of this show. The most off putting thing of the whole thing is listening to her complain about being tired. If I had flown from Boston to Vegas to see this show and she was complaining about being \\"so tired\\" after I paid $120 to see her I would be FURIOUS!!! The other issue, why the hell is this so short? with so LITTLE singing?To give a reference: if you saw the episode of my life on the d-list where Bette was a guest and she seemed to lack any genuine interest in what was going on to a degree which she seemed irritated and bothered, it's kind of like that, but with an audience, and no Stay With Me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Bendingly Awful","review":"Perhaps it was partially due to the editing? Miss Midler comes off as a semi-talented singer of little range and a kitsch/camp comedienne that has told the jokes so often that even she is unamused by them. If this were the only thing one had to view of hers, one would wonder how she became an icon, much less a noted and in some circles, talented performer. The diva takes a dive with this show. I hoped for better. When I saw it on HBO, I watched with all the fascination viewing a train wreck and kept wishing it to be over but, as with any train wreck, could not avert eyes, as it were.You may be as vicious about me as you please.

The skill level of the good Doctor on the didg is what I would consider outstanding, but he's not the master that David Hudson is. However, his employment and messaging the waveform is a breakthrough for the instrument, additionally he has spent time perfecting the didg by adding valves to change keys, alongwith the amplification and effects. So he's taken the didg to a new technological level, and it works wonderfully!Cut 6 and 7 are favorites. Heavy subwoofer and excellent genre' bass throughout the release.

Written in novel form, as the Celestine Prophecy and Way of the Peaceful Warrior, The Magic Life contained wisdom I recognized as spiritual truth revealed through an engaging story. My perception of life shifted because of this book; as I e-mailed the author \\"I feel as though a sleeping GIANT has been awakened within me\\"....a gentle giant, remembering the WHY of being.

The author's intentions are good, but his abilities are not up to the task he has set for himself. The writing lacks any trace of technique or character; it is plodding and simplistic. Furthermore, to anyone who's examined their life, purposes, and motives at all, the ideas presented in this book should be old-hat - the kindergarten level of the process of self-discovery. It's probably a good book for people who are accustomed to low-grade novels (_very_ low-grade novels) and unaccustomed to introspection, but I can't see how it would be anything but a waste of time for anyone else. If you're looking for a sophisticated presentation of these kinds of ideas, read The Celestine Prophecy; read Mutant Message from Down Under; Read Skinny Legs and All by Tom Robbins. But don't read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, uninteresting, slow","review":"How awful!I'm a keen reader, but this one was unbeareable....I could not get past the first 50 pages,though try I did!

Well guess what, I received the \\"Classic\\" Caramel flavor which is absolutely horrible! The box that this glass bottle shipped in said Torani Sugar Free Caramel but inside was the Classic version. I do not know if Torani packs these individual bottles and ships them to Amazon and there was a problem with Torani's labeling or if Amazon packs these and labels them and someone in the warehouse isn't paying attention but the result is the same, nasty syrup.

I've been lucky enough- being a Charleston native- to take many classes from Tracie, Jeanne Anne, Bonnie, and Susan Harris.

Boy, this workout sure did! With only a medicine ball and a stability ball, my core was worked until it screamed. And I certainly didn't master the moves my first time. These moves are so innovative, there is a learning curve. And balance is constantly tested. Anyone can do a bicep curl, here it takes a strong core to perform these moves with proper form. JAC's personality shines through and I love this workout more each time I do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Work Out Rocks!","review":"This is the best core work out I have ever done.

Although it provides valuable Numenorean historical information, it is comprised of unfinished stories. Tolkein's son Christopher has annotated passages, and he includes his notes at the end of each tale. This is sometimes helpful, sometimes not. He points out the obvious. A lot.There are some fairly interesting tidbits in here, though. The book shows you exactly how Tolkein started writing about the history of mankind inheriting the world.So, only read it if you're looking to learn about Numenor or how Tolkein thought up Middle Earth, otherwise, stick to The Silmarillion and Lost Tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful in the Dishwasher","review":"These measuring spoons were not very durable and actually became mishapen in the dishwasher.

I thought it would be like a squirt gun that I could aim at invading dogs chasing my cats. Not a chance.

I wanted the 24\\" Stream Machine, which \\"shoots up to seventy feet,\\" to scare them away and thereby condition them to the fact that our yard was NOT the place to be. Unfortunately, I found the max range to be under 25 feet. By the time I got that close, the pigeons just calmly moved off a slight distance and returned immediately. I complained and was told the restocking fee would amount to 50%, plus return shipping, c. $18.00, BUT since it was used (in testing) I could no longer return it. However, the distributor contacted the manufacturer who promised (and did in fact) to send another one. Unfortunately, it shoots exactly the same as the first. Good for 10-foot water fight games.

The trilogy contains his long poems, broken into sections, that combine a northern European sensibility (joy for the green blades of grass and despair at the burdensome winter just ahead) with his love for Greek mythology, gnosticism, and the Greek New Testament.One can find a taste of Saarikoski's poetry in the Vintage Book of Contemporary World Poetry. His writing is clever but always accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I've read some of the reviews for this album, and it seemed to be pretty mixed. I think this album is great. WAY better than Miss Independent, maybe not quite as good as Breakaway, but it'll be hard to top that one. There are a lot of stand-out songs Never Again, Sober, Maybe, Judas, just to name a few. Id recommend it to anyone who is not afraid to venture out away from the \\"popular\\" songs that play on the radio right now. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity is a good thing................","review":"While I enjoyed the \\"pop sound\\" of Kelly's first two releases, I must say while a different sound, this is still a solid album. I am one who prefers lyrics over melody and this album is filled with emotional content. In my opinion, Kelly Clarkson has the type of voice and range that can cross over into a variety of genres. No matter where she goes the voice I have come to appreciate is sure to folow. I look forward to her future efforts and the variety that will be sure to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Another great one by Kelly Clarkson.

I like her edger songs(Never), but this album shows off her vocal talents and that she can sing any type of songs... Looking forward to her next release! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly Clarkson, My December Love It!","review":"We bought the CD because we liked Kelly Clarkson on idol and saw her perform Never Again. It sounded like a rockin' CD and not a \\"pop\\" cookie cutter CD. We didn't know what to expect because of the bad publicity she got over arguing with the record label.Well, we LOVE the CD. It seems to reflect a real Kelly, up and down, fast and slower. We love the variety and pureness of Kelly's voice. You go Kelly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Again","review":"I don't own the album, but if Never Again is a preview of what is to become of Kelly Clarkson and her music, I say go girl -- it's a bit edgier than her other music. The song kind of reminds me of something along the lines of Pat Benatar -- and we all loved Pat Benatar!You go Kelly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't Have Been Released","review":"\\"Thankful\\" was an okay release, but it was the first release of any kind by an Idol. \\"Breakaway\\" was a wonderful CD. This CD is just plain awful. Kelly's advisers were right, that this CD should not have been made. Me and my three daughters listened to this CD; it was unanimous that it is really really bad. It is so bad that if I did not have the complete Kelly collection, I probably would not by another Kelly release. This release is what is called a \\"career killer\\". I would not recommend this release to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointed!","review":"I was very dissappointed in Kelly Clarkson's new album. I loved her last album from the first to the last song so I was very suprised at how bad this one is. It has a very different sound that I just don't like very much. Its just my personal opinion but at least I understand now why she was fighting with her managers over this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I had high hopes after hearing her other featured music, and of course on \\"Idol\\", but this one really left me turned off.

I dunno what it is, maybe it's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I understand what Clive was saying...","review":"Defenitely a great singer, but I was very disappointed on lyrics, arrangement, all of it.

WTF is up with this one?...Not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have a great deal of respect for Kelly Clarkson her voice is amazing. However, this cd is Kelly at her worst. I found it interesting that many comments state that Kelly has matured on this cd this could not be farther from the truth. The lyrics are at times whinney, bitter, and down right nasty. Aspects which do not automatically prove maturity. Do not buy this cd it is a waste of money!!! I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long anticipated... huge disappointment","review":"I am a huge Kelly Clarkson fan, and have been looking forward to the release of her new album for several years now. Boy, was I disappointed. The new album is a completely different style than her last two... and by different, I mean, it sucks. I ran out and bought this album the day it came out, took it home, listened to it, and slowly lost hope that there was one good song on the album as each track played. It seems as if Kelly is trying to take on the image of hard-core rock girl... and it just isn't her. While this style works for female artists such as Pink and Amy Lee of Evanescence, Kelly needs to stick to her roots. Being a pop artist is what she is good at, and the so-called rock music was a bad choice. Let's hope that Kelly goes back to singing the music she's good at for her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Third Cd","review":"Well thank goodness a friend let me borrow this cd and see why they didn't want it back. Listen people there only two average songs at best on here and most of it will hurt your ears. If you like screaming and loud music then you will maybe like it. It has no comparison two her previous cd's, so you have been worn. Why all the 4-5 stars on this awful cd is way beyond me. Do people listen to this stuff? Must be true die hard kelly fans. I'm just glad I didn't waste any money on it. Do yourself a favor and listen to it somewhere or how before purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to Clive Kelly","review":"I think Clive was right to shelve this album for 4 months and wanting her to redo the whole album because this album is really really awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so down Kelly??? Why all the sadness??? Why hate???","review":"I really like Kelly, loved her cd Breakaway! This new cd, is so depressing. I hope Kelly is allright. I know she wanted to do her own thing and got her way, looks like getting your way isn't always the best thing I guess. Her voice is good, but the songs are sad and negative. After listening I found myself to be depressed. I don't buy a cd to be depressed. Sadly I don't recommend this cd and to be honest I don't even want my daughter to listen to it. Whats with all the hate in Never Again. Just a horrible song. Sorry Kelly, but I bet your next cd will be awesome, please try some uplifting songs! 1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!","review":"This is awful.

Depending on your feminism.And, not because she's a WOMAN...even though she insists on blaming all her failures on such a RIDICULOUS argument.The GENDER card is JUST as CHEEZY and LAME of an excuse as the RACE card!\\"The man\\" wasn't trying to stick it to you just because you are a woman (um, I mean a girl...as evidenced by the pulling of the gender card). He was trying to stick it to you because the producers and label execs want to make MONEY. You made them MILLIONS by recording trite radio pop. THEY WANT THIS SUCCESS AGAIN. It has NOTHING to do with you being a \\"woman.\\" It has EVERYTHING to do with MAKING MONEY. They want instant hits. They don't want some syrupy \\"oh I've been done so wrong\\" uncatchy unoriginal crap. Bottom line is MONEY. NOT what hangs between your legs. Idiot.Oh...Alanis and Benetar called. They want their style back.Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I don't like this cd at all. I've liked Kelly Clarkson since the beginning, but I never bought an album of hers until recently. I bought her debut album, and liked it so much, I ordered this one and was so excited when it came in. But it's just a bunch of metal and yelling. I still listen to \\"Thankful\\" all the time, but \\"My December\\" I haven't touched since I first heard it. I was dissappointed; I had such high hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like/love Kelly, buy this CD.","review":"My husband bought this for my birthday a few days ago. I've just now gotten a chance to listen to it and I LOVE it. I've never had a problem with addiction (except to chocolate) but \\"Sober\\" gave me chills. Yes, she is more raw and edgy...she's growing as an artist as well as a human being and it's all right there on this CD.As someone else stated, kudos to Kelly for staying true to herself. I've been a fan since I heard her sing \\"Surrender\\" in Season 1 of American Idol and judging by how things are progressing, I'll always be a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"So emotional...","review":"As Kelly's voice soars and even breaks with emotion, your heart just might do the same. She's managed to capture so many facets as an artist, and emotions, all packaged brilliantly into one record.Anyone with a heart will be touched buy this record.Buy it; you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really what I expected - a superb surprise","review":"I have resisted Kelly Clarkson to some degree over the past couple of years, and I think I am realizing that my feelings were incorrect and unfounded. I was pretty convinced that she was yet another Idol winner turned pop star, and was putting out catchy, but overtly pop'py sounding bubblegum. At least this particular album (I now want to investigate her others) is simply incredible. It is deep, layered, thoughtful, edgy, gritty, rock and roll. I mean this disc is not even remotely bubblegum. I am thrilled I took a chance on this, and now will re-evaluate her past works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but fades towards the end","review":"The first few tracks are great. Kelly is trying new things but it still is classic Kelly. The songs get weaker though towards the end.

Rushed?NOT impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, single Remix is better","review":"Not Kelly's best work. The Remix to here single, \\" Never Again\\" is better then the whole CD. Hard to say that since I am a big fan of Kelly's since I my girlfriend and I meet, had to say that for a bro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have never seen American Idol, but I enjoyed Kelly's first few songs on the radio. Her second album was excellent. This one was horrible and I have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"I bought this album with great expectations since Kelly's career has been so successful over the past few years. Her debut album \\"Thankful\\" and her second Album \\"Breakaway\\" were nothing less than amazing... however, \\"My December\\" is , in my opinion, definitely not one of her finer artistic compilations. The music drowns out her lyrics so much that you can barely make out what she's singing about. Add to the fact that every song is so angry that her talented vocal skills are not showcased in the least on this album, leaving much to be desired after being blown away by her beautiful ballads on her past albums. I was pretty disappointed with this album... in fact, I only listened to it once through and it's been sitting under my carseat untouched for the past 6 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really couldn't make it through this CD more than twice. I really wanted to like it, but the songs just weren't good. Her current album sounds good so far so I won't hold this one against her."},{"rating":"2","title":"What music is all about","review":"I never ever listen to an artist that I cannot relate to personally. For example, britney spears gives me no inspiration because she lip syncs, and doesnt write any of the music she sings, except for a couple songs. But Kelly Clarkson's album My December showed me just what a true artist is all about. No, the album isn't perfect to everyone but it's perfect to people like me who respect what music is all about. This album was raw, and real and something I have never heard before. It doesn't go along with the trends of other artists, but it stands out and it's amazing and such a shame people never gave it the credit it deserved. My favorite song on this album is Maybe. Its a song I can relate to the most saying I'm not perfect, I have flaws but I wouldn't change who I am just because someone else doesn't accept it. This album is beautifully written and I am proud of Kelly for creating what it to me, a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for popular music","review":"A few listens into this album and it hit me: This is the best pop record in a long time, particularly by a female. The variety is its strength. Just when you think you've figued out what this album is \\"about\\", an unexpected turn hits you out of nowhere and redirects your perceptions. I've listned to it about 10 times through, and it's STILL happening.Sure, \\"My December\\" is not as immediately endearing as \\"Breakaway\\" was; but it is a far better record. Buy it; give it a chance. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"It is her most artistic album yet! Sober, Haunted, Yeah and Never Again are the highlights. There are may more but its a album that will grow on you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD - MUST HAVE!!!!","review":"I received my CD just two days ago and at first only liked a few songs, NA, SOBER and IRVINE. After several listens, I realized just how great this CD is - the songs stay in head and I must say I like just about every song on the CD. KC, please come to New Orleans on your next tour. Do youself a favor, pick up a copy and give it several listens - you will absolutely love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a breakup album with an obsidian beauty","review":"It took me a few listens to actually get use to this album. Firstly, it's very different from her previous albums, with more emotional depth and strength that it will take time to digest the raw passion from her vocals. Anyone who has been through a break-up can relate to her agonizing lyrics, and the pain is the clear link that threads all of her songs together. It's quiet admirable for her to take such a large step outside of her proverbial pop soap-box. I'm completely amazed at the diversity she pulls through her various sounds. She's not just any pop-princess, she has soul, and the control over her voice/words is a clear indicator of her growth. After a few listens, you will be able to appreicate the care she has put into this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again is the only winner","review":"I was really looking forward to this new cd as a Kelly Clarkson fan but unfortunately the only really good song was the 1st one \\"Never Again\\". It's a bit more rock than her usual style and I really like it but the rest of the cd bounces between disco, and sort of folk rock. It's uncentered and now I understand why the record company didn't want to release it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly's in a different \\"light\\"","review":"Despite the negative feedback from her producer, I enjoy listening to her voice on this CD.

This album is not your typical stereo-type pop/rock female record. This record i feel is full of raw emotion which came from kelly herself. Eventhough some of the songs are not as radio friendly as some younger kelly fans may like i think that with such ballads as \\"Sober\\" any person would like this record. Also the hidden track \\"Chivas\\" is a nice surprise and another great song that just adds to the other amazing songs on the album. This record has songs like \\"never again\\" and \\"yeah\\" that you can rock out too as well as the amazing showcasing of kelly's great vocals. Overall, i love this record and i think people who weren't kelly fans will become one after they listen to My December."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to Go Kelly!!!","review":"I love this album! Kelly has to be the best American Idol! She has been so successful in her music career. This album has very powerful, meaningful lyrics along with Kelly Clarkson's amazing voice!

You wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the purchase...","review":"Obviously a master lyricist as well as singer as the words in these songs written by Kelly are exceptional.

It is a shame that this album had such negativity surrounding it because it is truely a gem! Sober should have won a Grammy or at least been nominated. Clarkson's song writing is superb! You can tell she put every ounce of emotion she had into the lyrics. They are deep, personal and meaningful! She doesn't get the credit she deserves and it is upsetting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I think that she should have released this album independently she had low concert sales due to her record label's lack of marketing, aside from all that I really think this album shows growth"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like lyrical content","review":"I'm a casual fan of Kelly Clarkson. I enjoyed a few songs by her, which I downloaded from iTunes (A Moment Like This/Before Your Love single and Breakaway single).

I was surprised this was the music style she had longed to do and was warned against. For those who want more rock it probably would be a good choice. I just don't see Kelly in chains & tattoos. She can sing anything well, and I understand her desire to change things up to break away from the hometown girl image. She can change, but must keep the solid pop coming or risk losing those fans who voted for her and the great style music we picked her for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Disappointed in CD.

This album wasn't very good with about two exceptions.1. Never again2. One minuteKelly Clarkson is/was one of my favorite artists. She slipped greatly with this album. All of the songs she was mad and screaming!I was very glad to hear \\"my life would suck without you\\", as it seems she has gotten her pop sound back. I am very much looking forward to All I ever wanted, and hope it will be as good as Breakaway was."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Good As Her Other Ones....","review":"This album is on track with all the other Kelly Clarkson albums....average. She has a nice voice, but her songs always seem to lack something. This album has a angery tone, but it seems very plastic anger. I don't feel that it's real anger. She's seems to be making bland music. No hooks, no beat, no emotion....nothing. But than again, every Kelly album has been like that....Key Tracks: Yeah, Hole, and Judis"},{"rating":"2","title":"To be honest...","review":"I don't think she lived up to her full potential... but than again I dont think that about any of her past albums either. I'm not saying this cd was bad in any way. I kind of like it actually... alot actually. It reminded me sort of Hole (pre courtney in rehab) and a little of Veruca Salt. It is a very different sound for her and if she should so choose to remain in the harder genre. It may take a while for her to gain acceptance and a \\"rocker\\". But she has shown she's got it in her.. she has a beautifuly emotional voice.I have to admit I love how there is not one hook in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD OF DELAYED IT","review":"This is by no means a review to bash Kelly Clarkson. I enjoy her music and I even have some of it on my MP3 for running but this CD has only one hit NEVER AGAIN on it, which has already ran it course peaking at number 8 on billboard. The CD is a lot of rock and roll and the ballads are extremely weak. I will say it will enter the TOP 10 in Billboard but not number 1. I also think it will drop very quickly. The cover does not match what is inside. The cover would be more appropriate for her first CD Thankful. The songs inside have a more harder, aggressive sound and the cover should of reflected that. Hopefully after this CD is forgotten she will come back with a much better and powerful CD. This is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Style","review":"Fiest off I consider myself a Kelly Clarkson fan. But.... I also know what I like and what I don't like and this cd is more like therepy for Kelly than anything musically coherent. No real rhyme or melody. And after listening to her yell out so many of the songs I want to rip my ears out. I'm sorry, just my opinion. I know other fans would love her if she stood there and whistled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive was right!!","review":"Kelly is ruining her voice and she is not a song writer. Really bad but it will do well with her fans buying multiple copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks,...move on.","review":"Im a HUGE fan of KC's first two albums. Unfortunately, this one is a coaster. Part of the problem is in the engineering. Often the music smothers the vocals. The other part of the problem is the songs just arent very good. It almost feels like the music was recorded seperately from the vocals, and they were paired together by some random means. I respect the fact that this is the album Kelly wanted, but for me its just a horrible waste of talent. She was obviously aiming for edgy, but she hit 'bad' right on the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe too fast on this one Kelly","review":"Love Kelly (especially Break Away), but this one seems to be maybe a little rushed, lacking a real head turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarkson rocks and rocks well!","review":"I did not have her previous albums, but this one caught my interest because of all the Kelly vs Record Label hype. Well let me just say this album is excellent all the way through. I enjoy each song, and hope Kelly stays in this mode for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly's inspiring songs","review":"I bought this cd for my birthday and have not regret it.i received breakaway as a gift for Christmas 2 years ago and i have played it to death also.Kelly was the most successful American idol winner so far and this cd shows us why.Her powerful vocals which can sound so strong and moving like on hole and so mellow and sweet on can i have a kiss.This album is a slightly grungy and at times angsty but its basically an album that i play in the morning when i get up,all day while i relax,and all night to put me to sleep.She is so talented and she showed that by releasing sober a song that is both beautiful and empowering.Hole is such an angry song and Kelly pulls it off so well that it makes you wonder how did it take so long for her to be discovered!overall this album is rockier than breakaway but is the album of the year so far.this is Louise saying good bye and buy this cdbye"},{"rating":"1","title":"My December","review":"I like some of what Kelly does but not all. I only made it through 3 songs before I stopped listening to this CD. She just screams too much for me. She has a good voice but screaming does not make it with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Media be Damned!","review":"I've tried not to listen to the media so that I can form my OWN opinion.It's NOT all hard rock and it's not all doom & gloom!All I have to say is: LUVS IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Journey","review":"I admire Kelly Clarkson for several reasons. This disc is not a radio driven pop catlouge as her 2 previous discs. My December is a highly personal, at times gut wrenching, journey for her and a true connection to Clarkson for her fans.My December is by far her most personal and accomplished work to date. I would reccomend this album highly. The album showcases Clarkson acousticly, in a more raw rock edge and even in a modern rock nearly gothic showcasing.\\"Sober\\" puts Clarkson at her very best, absolutely incredibly lyrics and performance. \\"Can I have a Kiss\\" showcases her voice in a very edgy way, Clarkson producing a new sound of pure raw emotion. \\"Hole\\" is reminiscent of Janis Joplin and \\"Haunted\\" explores darker territories of suicide with a modern rock sound.This is truly an album that I found incredibly moving and a treat to music lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I dont know why all the reviews are negative on this album. I love it. Kelly is a great singer and she should have the power when it comes to what she wants to sing. You go KELLY! I will keep buying it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Disappointed..","review":"I've been a Kelly fan since her Idol days. \\"Thankful\\" and \\"Breakaway\\" or two of my all time favorite albums, and I thought without a doubt that \\"My December\\" would be as well. I bought it the day it was realeased, and I'm sad to say I was disappointed. The only really good songs on the album are Never Again, Don't Waste Your Time and Judas. All the others sound the same, are slow songs, and are just plain BORING. Kelly has an amazing voice, and she's a good song writer, but this album never should have been. Every artist has an album that is a fan-least-favorite, and I think this is Kelly's.I will continue to be a fan and hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing.","review":"The word that I frist heard describing Kelly's new Album was edgey, and if by edgey you mean full of annoying guitar melody's then it is very edgey. The lyrics are fine, but they would have worked so much better if they were put the good music. Like I said the lead guitar is just overwhelming and annoying. Kelly Clarkson is famous because she is an amazing singer, and I don't want to hear her overshadowed with guitar melodies and overproduced background beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Her","review":"I love this CD - I loved Never Again the first time I heard it on American idol, but it took me a few times through to like the CD in total, but if you listen, it tells a story of her pain and healing. My boyfriend thinks she is just male bashing, but I don't agree at all. It is like her singing is her therapy. Anyhow, I love it. Her singing moves me because it is coming from her heart and you can tell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT My December","review":"Did not like this cd at all. Loved the first two cds. Each track sounded the same on this cd. Go back to Breakaway and Thankful and regroup!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice. But....","review":"Let me start of by saying that Kelly Clarkson is by far my favorite former-Idol. She's easily got some of the best pipes out there. I eagerly anticipated her first release (which I loved) and even fell in line when she seemingly changed stylistic directions with 'Breakway' - one listen to 'Where Is Your Heart' and I just got it.However, this right here, this hook-free, jumbled mess called 'My December', never should have seen the light of day. It's unlistenable. I certainly understand artists wanting to challenge themselves, whether it be through songwriting or production, but her vanity clearly got the best of her and her label had every right to be concerned - from beginning to end, this cd is..well, it's just bad. Painfully bad.Am I still a fan of her voice? Absolutely. I think everyone's entitled to their musical equivalent of 'Ishtar'. But after this turkey of a project, I probably won't be so eager to run out and snatch up her next release without some serious forethought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Horrible Screaming","review":"I think Kelly was going for edgy, but she failed miserably. She screams her way through most of this album and the music seems too strong even for that. I think this is her worst album so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"I only listened to the sample tracks but from what I've heard, I will not buy the album because...Kelly has two types of songs on her album:1. fast,yelling angsty (tracks 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,12)2. slow, moaning angsty (4,8,9,11)I like Irvine - has a different vibe. Otherwise, all the songs sound the same to me.Not bad for a first attempt at writing some of her own songs. But they aren't good enough. Just because she has the fame doesn't mean she can use her career as anger management. All her songs sound like they are in the same key, as well. Her second album is still her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"The lyrics are mediocre, her vocals are nothing great.... it's like she lost her spirit. Don't get me wrong, I listened to it with an open mind ready for change, but this? I'm really disappointed. All the songs sound the same, except for Sober and Irvine. Irvine almost sounds like it belongs in a cafe, which is a nice change but still not mind-blowing. In Breakaway, I loved every single song. On this, it's just... not so inspiring. Sorry, Kelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought Kelly Clarkson cd My December thinking it would be a good cd.I was so disappointed in this one. I bought the cd Breakaway beforeI thought that was good.

I am returning this item as it is not even close to being worth the $99.00 I was charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMSO Review","review":"The use of DMSO is very much debated, but I purchased it knowing that. The label on this bottle gives very little information, but it says to not use it on the skin. Well, you sure are not going to drink it. Yet, there is no explanation as to how to apply or use it and no information sheet with the bottle. It does not tell you if the solution is industrial or not. Apparently industrial DMSO is dangerous to use, but refined DMSO can be used for aches and pains even though this is not an approved FDA application. Also, it shipped in a plastic bottle and that is NOT recommended for use because DMSO soaks into the skin and takes other medications and or impurities with it into your tissue. So, plastic is not appropriate for packaging as it is known to leach into its contents.I have NOT used this yet and have not yet found a company website for additional information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pure","review":"Despite the label this product is not 99.9% pure. I tested the product according to the instructions on page 33 of Dr. Morton Walker's Book 'DMSO Natures Healer'. The test results revealed that this particular product has only a small bit of the solvent mixed into a much larger amount of water.I would have not made this purchase had I known the actual purity level. I will go on searching for DMSO that is truly pure pharmaceutical grade and matches what it is advertised to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"This is not to say it will not work for you, I can not say. i bought this on the recommendation of an acquaintance.

I have no idea how to explain Les Sans Culottes. The name of the band is, crudely, \\"Those who wear no underwear\\". They are so ultra-cool that nobody much yet knows who they are yet. They are simlutaneously the antidote to high school French and a weapon of mass destruction aimed at the boring junk put out by the major labels today.I heard the live version of \\"Funky Peripherique\\" on local college radio (KCOU) and ordered the CD the same day. Listen to the samples here and on the band's eponymous web-site, and you could well be hooked, too. I guess they are best described as a cross between the B-52s and Jacques Chirac....The melodies are infectious, while the lyrics are allegedly French (or as French as you'll get from a a ye-ye pop band that comes from Brooklyn)."},{"rating":"1","title":"MERDE!","review":"Revivalist of french garage rock.

Numbered map icons do not refer to anything. In other words you can't find campground in the text from a number on the map.2. Reference after place names in the text are worthless. They could have referred to map grid coordinates but the maps in the book contain no references along the edges that would allow one to look up 1C for example.The book I purchased says it is the 14th edition. How can a book so poorly referenced be in its 14th edition, its incredible. It is like the publisher, Cottage Publications, did not even look at the book before it was printed.If you buy this book you will be disappointed, like I was.

Besides the fact, that we found only a few nice spots described in those books so far, our comments are as follows:1. The contents of both editions are outdated - certain camgrounds dosimply not exist any more for years!!2. The directions are awful if not wrong3. We spent more diesel on finding the described campgrounds than we savednot to mention the hazzle, driving around in circles4. Lots of directions seem to be copied from other books we have and areas wrong as they are in those5. Campgrounds indicated in the maps by numbers (icons) are not part ofthe book anymore6.

Basically I overreact.This book is a lifesaver, with clearly defined terms, and ways of thinking about conflict that you can implement TODAY. Your family life will be forever changed...and as a matter of fact, by studying these principles you will quickly see improvements in other areas, too.One section, beginning on page 143 did more to help me with my anger than all the other books I ever read put together!

It catalogs thousands of family crests and they're indexed by motif, which makes it relatively painless to look a crest up. Do be advised that all the crest names in this tome are in katakana (Japanese syllable symbols) so you will need familiarity with katakana (or yet another handy reference tome at your side) in order to determine what family each crest represents.Dollar for dollar, though, you cannot get a better deal than this book which has about 400 pages worth of crests, with 20 crests per page.

Often about halfway through, things begin to turn sour. You wonder: is it me? Am I too demanding? Am I being unrealistic? There's not a book out there that can satisfy a person from start to finish. Well, guess what? This one did. Thank you, Luis Alberto Urrea, for giving me a book to fall head-over-heels in love with. And, yes, get busy on that sequel! I want to know about Teresita's life in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hummingbird's Daughter","review":"This novel is based on an actual relative, a great aunt, of the author. Most of the characters were real people, and the locations are accurate. The novel itself, however, reflects the magical thinking of the Mexican people. They incorporate the mystical with daily living, believing in spirits and their power in our lives. The protagonist, Teresita, is a curandera whose life follows many twists and turns, including a resurrection. She uses herbs and potions in her healing, but also has power in her hands to ease pain. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the underlying beliefs of the Mexican culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luis Alberto Urrea is by far an amazing writer!","review":"Can I just say that from this book I have now bought 4 more of Luis Alberto Urrea's books and absolutely am mesmerized by his writing!The Hummingbird's Daughter was my first novel by him and I also have the Unabridged Audio of the book. I fell in love with this book and this story. I have listened to it many times and Luis's voice just makes it that much better. I would highly recommend this Novel and any works by Mr. Urrea~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly true, Completly wonderful","review":"This book is the true story (fictionalized biography) of a saint who lived in Mexico in the tail end of the 1800's, a time of Indian wars, ruthless dictators and dreadfully poor peasants. Born among the poorest of the poor, Teresita has a gift that is recognized by Huila, a medicine woman of Indian heritage. Teresita's story as she rises from dirt poverty to recognition by the Vatican as a witch, initially, and later as a national treasure is so beautifully written by Sr. Urrea.The author chooses his words with the utmost care and produces a book rich with the art of language which will surround the reader like a silken blanket. The smell of roses will linger in your nostrils long after you have finished this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hummingbird's Daughter","review":"This was a very moving and informative story.

We have visited many of the places mentioned---Alamos, Hermosillo, Guaymas, Culiacan, and Navojoa. The book emphasises the intertwining of the native religions and the Jesuit's catholosism.

The novel excites, entertains, saddens, frightens, but most of all, made me laugh. Given the deep content of the story, the author was also excellent at finding the humor in the most unhumorous situations, making sure that I never took the characters too seriously and reminding me that even the most amazing people are simply human."},{"rating":"2","title":"great experience and efficiency delivery","review":"I really appreciate the seller and sent the book in a very efficent way.

All the parts were there (always a plus), the instructions were good; I could have easily figured it out without the instructions, though. Multiple lengths of rod (12\\" each) are included so it works well with varying ceiling heights, it's gimbeled (is that a word?) so it will hang straight down from an angled ceiling and a hang chain is included if you prefer that look. They look great in my quasi-Victorian bathroom but I think they're modern enough to fit in that style, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again","review":"This comes with three 12\\" rods. Many other pendants come with 12\\", 8\\" and 6\\"rods, which allows you to adjust the height. I looked and couldn't even find an option to buy different lengths.

Rare as it is, Ms. Leonard-Conger as successfully stated her point of view while probably ruffling the feathers of many who do not subscribe to her brand of candor. At times her views, though founded in truth, rings of systemic rhetoric used to demean rather than educate.Don't Call Me African American is one woman's journey through life many will call odd. Shared memories and relayed recollections contradict such notions. Moreover, it slaps the definition of Prima Facie (presumed to be) left and right.

The story went nowhere, the characters were flat, the love story pointless, and the environmentalism/social commentary was tedious. \\"The Serpent's Shadow\\" and \\"The Fire Rose\\" were much better books, and I almost wish I hadn't read this one because it makes me leery of reading anything newer by Lackey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I didn't pick this book up expecting great literature, but I was expecting... better.The Fire Rose, and the Serpent's Shadow were both enjoyable books with lively characters-- just the thing for spending a cold day with a warm blanket.But this book was boring. It had lifeless characters, a passive heroine, a weirdly cardboard romance, and some not-very-scary villains. I wanted to like it, but couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Don't get me wrong, Lackey is a good author. All the other books I have read - Serpent's Shadow, Phoenix and Ashes, and Black Swan are all engaging reads.But this story disappointed me. It had a good start, but it ended in a boring and bad way. In Serpent's Shadow, the protagonist is a Earth Master who is rescued by a Water Master. In this book, it's the other way around, which disappointed me. I'd have liked to see Marina paired up with a Air Master or some such, so as to not repeat Earth x Water.This book had a lot of potential, but unfortunately it started to sputter out about halfway through the book and ended poorly.I really hope that for the next Elemental Master book, opposing elements are paired up together. I'd love to see a Water Master being wooed by a Fire Master. Now, that would be a more than engaging read, provided that Lackey put as much effort into that tale as she did Serpent's Shadow and Phoenix and Ashes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character Development Good - Plot dwindles","review":"I love Mercedes Lackey and can't wait to read everything she writes, but this story lacked substance. I thought the characters were well developed, but the whole premise of the story never added up to me. I felt there were many issues never resolved in the book: why Arachnia was banished from her family - marrying someone they didn't like never made sense and the reason they despised him was never revealed; why her son Reggie put up with her, his role was marginal at best; why she didn't just kill Marina instead of putting her under a spell; why Marina tunred into a materialist after being raised by artists was kind of odd and why, after only a brief relationship did she realize she was in love with the doctor. And it really bothered me that they didn't follow up and destroy the satanic room beneath the pottery. There were too many loose ends to make this book fulfilling for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"We gave our 5 year old daughter this for Christmas this past year and she loves it.

I purchased extra beads at the Dollar Store. My only complaint was in the method used to end the strands. There were 10 special beads used to end a row. This wasn't enough, and I couldn't find replacements. I tried to use little elastic bands but could have used instructions on how to put the bands in effectively. Perhaps someone with more ingenuity could figure out a way. Still, it was a lot of fun. And my daughter uses it with her dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough beads to be a good buy","review":"I have read the two reviews and was ready to add this beader to my shopping list when it dawned on me...I went back and enlarged the pictures of the two girls with the beads in their hair. If you count, you will see that each girl has at least 40 beads per strand. Since the kit only comes with 40 beads plus the 10 clip beads, you can only make two strands of hair with beads. If you think about it....this means you not only have to buy this product at about $20 plus shipping, but you have to find a store that sells beads and buy more. Was originally going to get this for my granddaughter but I think I'll buy her something else that won't cost extra to make the whole thing complete. I gave this product 2 stars because I think it would be fun, just not good enough when you have to buy extra beads to make it a complete set."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tool for beading girls hair","review":"this works sooooo good. if you have to bead girls hair, this is the tool you need. with this you can even skip the braiding if you want -- WHAT A TIMESAVER!!!!!!!!!!!! and it puts 5-6 inches of beads on at one time. just put rubber bands on at the bottom of the beads and they will stay in. one time investment in this tool and some beads and you are ready to go. it works with regular pony beads you can buy right in your own town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"When I received my Quick Bead I wrapped it up for my daughter for Christmas.

I didn't like Kat and couldn't relate to her;I didn't find her the least bit interesting. She was a condescending know-it-all. Too preachy in some parts, as well as far too solemn and drab.Karen tries humor here and there, but she's not funny. She uses more cliches in this book than any other author I've read before.

That's modern feminism for you, I guess.Story wise, this movie isn't all that thrilling, and to say that it isn't predictable would would be rather deceptive.

This Panasonic electric shaver will not remove the stubble from your face. I consider it a complete waste of money and will never buy another Panasonic razor again. I have used it for two weeks now and it literally takes 10 to 15 minutes to shave, after which I find myself switching to a real bladed razor anyway to pick up the stragglers the Panasonic left behind.

The only truly red thing in the picture is the strawberry. On the pink page, the dress has yellow, orange and red flowers on it. Another confusing aspect is that on the green page, a leaf is the highlighted object , but the little boy is not holding a leaf. For every other color there is a highlighted object, and the baby displays that object in some way, but they are inconsistent with the green.

Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman give outstanding preformances. One of Sandra's best films! Almost as good as Speed.

I usually don't write negative comments on movies and especially on a movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock in it. BUT.....there was something missing in this story...can't put my finger on what, but....it didn't leave me with a very good, satisfying feeling the way movies usually do.The acting was excellent. Especially Kidman's. She is SO gorgeous that I was desperately trying to find flaws in her! (sorry Nicole:)...and couldn't find any!!! Tom is extremely lucky, but then so is Nicole!!Anyway, the acting was very good, there were some cute parts and some good special effects but other than that, the movie was an ok movie.

It had a plot, but not a good one. I believe this movie could have been better than everyone says it is. I also think that Nicole Kidman could've done a better job acting in this movie. Overall, I think this movie was a little interesting, but not enough to make me go \\"oh wow! I really want to buy this movie!\\" I think that it really could've been better than it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this movie","review":"You're better off going to the library and checking out the book version of Practical Magic, a truly delightful book filled with interesting characters about love, and sisters.This movie on the other hand is a psuedo-feminist typical dull chick flick devoid of the magic and beauty of the book it's based on.They took all the good stuff out like the relationship between one of the characters daughters, and her trying to flee her aunts so they could lead a normal life, or the science teacher and filled it with high fructose corn syrup cornness. For the real better story, just read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"should've been better","review":"Not a travesty, but a rather pedestrian filming of a terrific Alice Hoffman novel. There are some good elements: the cast is engaging enough, the cinematography is lovely in a Wiccan-Martha Stewarty way, and it's hard to fault any movie that includes Nick Drake's haunting \\"Black-eyed Dog\\" on its soundtrack. But the film dumbs down both the plot and the atmosphere, spelling out the story so one can practically figure out the ending from the opening credits, and replacing the book's mystery and wonder with sub-Spielberg gee-whiz effects. I admit that I enjoyed the film when I first saw it, and still have affection for it, but much of that I would attribute to knowing, via the book, what was really happening that the filmmakers were at a loss to convey. Too bad, I'd much rather get those feelings from the film itself. Perhaps a remake will eventually happen, with someone like Alfonso Cuarón at the helm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is one weird movie.

I wish I would not have wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is 1 Star the Lowest I Can Give It?","review":"Even Satan would get bored watching this dumb story of two witch-sisters and their problems with the men in their lives. This movie seems like it's trying to be a comedy, a horror movie, a romance and a \\"chick-flick\\" all rolled into one, yet it's never funny, scary, or romantic and the \\"chick-flick\\" elements are all rehashed Hope Floats-Mermaids stuff that we've seen before. The last scene where the movie attempts to turn a satanic ritual into a Tupperware party is both laughably stupid and disturbing in its handling of demonism. If you like original, interesting movies , don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a five-star movie, certainly","review":"I wanted an entertaining movie for my Sunday night and I had totally trusted the review of almost 5 stars here. Well, I watched majority of this movie, expecting the boredom level to decrease, which is sometimes the case with some great movies, they start boring, but, those who are patient enough, get the prize. Well, with this movie: No, it's not the case. I tried my best to watch it to end, but I just couldn't.I should have checked imdb rating: It's 5.7/10 from almost 35K people. 5.7 seems right for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Magic","review":"I loved this movie. It is my all time favorite movie ever. the acting is terrific. And the director did very good with it all. I absolutely love this movie. I would recoomened this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great actresses, wonderful story","review":"I read the book this movie was based on several years ago and totally loved it so I was really excited to see they had made a movie out of it, and like the icing on the cake, featuring one of my favorite actresses, Sandra Bullock!This movie is sort of a love commedy, very unusual though. One of the things I liked best about his movie is the viewpoint that you should not judge things without knowing them and that you should not judge people because they don't have your same religious beliefs. It will amuse you, touch you and make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of Magic","review":"Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman do a very natural and effortless job in portraying two sisters who are trying to put things right in their life. Both were raised under two powerful guardians in the movie who influenced them in being aware of how to use magic for practical areas in life (hence the term practical magic). What both sisters want the most is true love, but they end up having to find a way around that as well because of a wish that one of the sisters made as a little girl for her dream partner. Things really get interesting when a handsome man enters their life, and he questions the sisters on a disappearance for someone that is wanted by the law. Overall, this is a very cute and entertaining movie on how practical magic plays a role in shaping a person's life and those who surround them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Unlike the person above, I will actually REVIEW the movie and not go \\"play by play\\".

The book is even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop being so hard on Sandra Bullock!","review":"While I agree with some of the reviews I have read about the conflicting changes of tone in the movie, I base my liking of a movie on how I felt after it was over. \\"Practical Magic\\" left me in a good mood, and for me, that's all I need. Enough already about the social ramifications, people. Did you like it, or not? Stop being stuffy. And I must say that Sandra Bullock is a very talented actress. Those who don't believe me, please rent \\"Hope Floats.\\" You'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fizzle","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I purchased the video second-hand and was really looking forward to viewing it, especially after a highlight article in \\"Victoria\\" magazine on the location of the shoot. The house and garden set and the town in which the film is set are enchanting. But very patchy performances from Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman and a ridiculous script and story line render this film about as dazzling as a wet sparkler on a foggy Fourth of July. Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest are wonderful, as usual and exude far more sex appeal than their younger co-stars but they disappear for most of the film (magic or just poor directing?). Aidan Quinn is badly miscast as the love interest-come-detective. If you're looking for magic and romantic comedy, you're better off watching re-runs of \\"Bewitched\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hard to Sit through Movie!","review":"I dont know but were is the plot in this movie? What are they trying to say? I didnt like this movie at all. Plot changes throughout the movie. I dont recomend this movie unless one wants to be bored!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"I rented this DVD mainly because of the large percentage of 5star reviews presented on this Amazon page. Maybe I should haveconcentrated on the few 1 star reviews instead. The only good thing about the movie was the 5.1 soundtrack. If you want to see a great witch movie then you should watch 'The Witches of Eastwick'. This movie may be 12 years old but it kicks butt. I'm sorry to say that Practical Magic just does not make the grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practically dreadful","review":"Two sister witches try adapting to life under family curse which ensures death for any man a given sister truly loves. Kidman's boyfriend (who she obviously must not have truly loved) turns out to be an abusive alcoholic who attacks her and Bullock when she rushes to her aid. Bullock accidently kills him and the two are desparate to dispose of the body. What builds itself nicely with some actual characters and plot goes for CASPER/THE FRIGHTENERS special effects to move it along and then relies on a BARNEY & FRIENDS style ending to tie the whole thing together. Only entertaining in the beginning. Take my advise and skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dare you.","review":"I defy anyone to explain the story of this movie without stammering and possibly giggling. This movie is boring. It has no energy. Even really bad movies have energy, but this one's just a rock. They managed to make a boring story out of supernatural people. Congratulations. Also, they managed to make us feel comfortable with Sandra killing a guy. And then we see her SOOOOO upset about her upbringing that it causes her to... open a store! And what's with that \\"he'll have these color eyes,\\" thing, and then the guy doesn't have the right color! Nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Sit Through It","review":"This movie was minipulated so much from the book that it made it immposible to watch. The story line was a joke and the acting mediocre at best. One word summation: Crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another misstep from Sandra Bullock.","review":"Someone needs to tell Sandra that not all good movies are romantic comedies. This one adds a bit of a twist, but basically it's just a by-the-numbers jilted lovers movie. The witchcraft aspect is enticing, but they do not go nearly into the depth with this one as they did with \\"The Craft.\\" \\"Practical Magic\\" is a hackneyed concept rehashed once again, simply a star vehicle for Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. We can't really blame them though. Whenever they try to make something else they walk away with \\"Speed 2,\\" \\"The Net\\" or \\"The Peacemaker.\\" \\"Practical Magic\\" is nearly unforgiveable, albeit with an OK ending involving raising the evil dead. It doesn't save this. The only reason this movie was made was thanks to the incomprehensible success of ABC's insipid \\"Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch.\\" For a more interesting witch movie, check out \\"The Craft.\\" As far as relationship movies go, just stop watching movies for cinema's sake. They're getting extremely old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is one of the WORST movies ever made. Sandra Bullock does her usual job of not acting, (Am I the only one who notices that she NEVER changes her expressions during any part of any movie?) Stupid story, bad acting, easily one of the worst movies of 1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Mates DO exist!","review":"This is a great movie for those who believe in fate and finding one's true love. It has comedy, tragedy, drama, and love all wrapped up in one movie. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are great actresses and play their parts well. The soundtrack for Practical Magic is also excellent and goes perfect with the movie. The plot of the story is based on finding true happiness, yes even for a witch. This is more of a girly movie and not meant for guys, unless you're watching it with YOUR soul-mate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"EVERYTHING WAS AS DESCRIBED....THANK YOU I will purchase again for different occasions.

That's what happened with Practical Magic. Having read the book and enjoyed it immensely it was a natural for me to want the movie.Although the movie version deviates from the book and the viewer loses much of the backstory, it is lovingly adapted and given wonderful treatment. The scenes of the young sisters living in the aunts house especially were full of detail. Costuming was wonderful (in the case of the ecentric aunts especially). Cinematography captured all of the essence of New England in various seasons and made this native New Englander a bit nostalgic.If you've read the book keep an open mind here and you will enjoy the film immensely. While all of the actors gave solid performances I mostly enjoyed Stockard Channing's portrayal of Aunt Frances.I think this movie could easily replace Hocus Pocus as a Halloween favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Magic","review":"If you like Sandra Bullock and you enjoy TV shows such as \\"Charmed,\\" then\\"Practical Magic\\" is a film you'll be glad you purchased for your video library. Sandra Bullock plays a relunctant witch who does not want to use her magical abilities, while her sister, played by Nichole Kiddman, is the wild and crazy sister getting into all kinds of trouble. Throw in two old witch aunts, a long standing family curse, a ghost out for revenge, and the town's predjuces to witches, the outcome is an enjoyable fantasy you'll watch again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS","review":"The movie is awesome.

They are joined by the delightful Diane Lane and Stockard Channing, who steal the show as their mischievious aunts.

Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman do a great job, but the few scenes in which Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest appear are excellent.I especially loved the element of family unity that prevails throughout the story. Cursed they may be, but the Owens women are very supportive and close. Also wonderful was the fact that the very thing that saved Maria Owens from hanging - magic - becomes the healing factor that saves Jillian in the end bonded with the power of family and community. Good lessons abound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly bubbly brew.","review":"I love the book by Alice Hoffman and I was interested to see what the film was like compared to the book so I went to see it and absolutely loved it. The film follows the lives of a family of female witches. Ok so it's not always believable, and neither is the storyline always quite on the straight and narrow but it's good, quirky fun. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are brilliant as sisters Sally and Gillian and their duo really carries this film.

Instead of gliding from one scene to another it clumps along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry excuse for witches","review":"Although I found parts kind ofcharming and overall, for a \\"chick flick\\", I enjoyed it, I must say that for a movie about witches, the witches were lacking. For it's plot, witches weren't really needed. And even the witches that are present in the movie, they don't really do much. Nicole Kidman does nothing with her power but drug a psycho boyfriend so he can go to sleep and leave her alone. And Sandra Bullock seems to just have a spoon magically stir her tea/coffee and she can also can blow on a candle and light them that way. Take these useless scenes out and you're left with ordinary women.

It's absurd and there is no rational explenation for why such big names would make such a poor excuse for a film. It doesn't even have \\"it's moments\\". The script is badly adapted from a novel by Alice Hoffman, who, I might add, is a very talented writer. \\"Practical Magic\\" is slow and has no tention nor climax. Scenes happen seemingly at random and I found it hard to sympathize with the characters AT ALL. I expect this type of low quality from movies designed for the \\"Seventeen Magazine\\"- \\"Dawson's Creek\\" audience, but not from the big names who made there money not only by being talented, but by choosing well written scripts. If you have a choice, watch \\"Speed\\" or \\"Portait of a Lady\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Beg To Differ - Stick With The Book","review":"This disappointing film has none of the irony and wistful quality that made Alice Hoffman's book of the same name such a - well, magical read. The film instead is ruined by a rushed, connect-the-dots script that fails utterly to capture the nuances and charm that made the book such a hit when it was published.One reviewer characterized the film, which received mostly poor reviews, thusly: \\"Barbie joins a coven.\\" To be fair to Bullock and Kidman, the \\"Barbies\\" in question, there wasn't much they could do with the awful script. That aside, the review could not be more apt. A good cast, including Aidan Quinn, an actor I greatly respect, can't redeem the bad writing that reduces the original material to cute gimmicks and a dreadful ending that not only doesn't appear in the book, but runs contrary to the book's underlying observations about the relationship between desire and wisdom.I cannot recommend the book highly enough. I cannot recommend the movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched to hell","review":"I love this movie but when I tried to play it, my DVD player couldn't even read the disc.

The aunts interacting with Bullock and Goodman are the best parts. I loved the movie so much that I couldn't wait until I read the book. Books are usually better than the movie, but not in this case. The book is terrible. It is written in first person and is abruptly written. If you are a fan of the movie, don't read the book, as you'll probably be very disappointed.

Just watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Very Very Bad","review":"This movie was so bad, so pointless and plotless, so corny and ridiculous, I had to warn someone, even though there are already more than 230 reviews and most of them are glowing. Anyone who gave this a 5 star review is a very peculiar person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Get Me Wrong: I LOVE THIS MOVIE!","review":"I love this movie, I bought it on VHS and when I found out the DVD had commentary, I bought that as well. However, the commentary by Griffin Dunne, et al, is so rambling and boring I turned it off about 30 minutes into it. He rambles on through most of the movie about how great everyone was to work with (like I care) and comments more about \\"Addicted to Love\\" than the movie he is supposed to be talking about! The games you play are inconvenient to set up (you have to flip the disk over) and the other extra material consists largely of a wheezy list of other movies the stars were in. Otherwise the DVD is beautiful, and the movie is great, but don't buy it for the extra features."},{"rating":"1","title":"A yawn-fest","review":"This ranks as one of my least favorite films of all time. I have to admit, I'm not much of a Sandra Bullock fan. While I was entertained by her in Speed and While You Were Sleeping, I have found her mannerisms and acting EXTREMELY annoying in every movie since then. In fact, I find it hard to go back and watch Speed and WYWS now that I've seen her too many times.Normally I'm a big Aidan Quinn fan, but it appeared to me that Quinn just wasn't buying the plot and ended up mailing in his performance.Nicole Kidman was actually pretty good, but her performance isn't reason enough to rent this turkey.But along with Bullock's annoying performance are some incredibly stupid, embarrassingly contrived and excruciatingly boring scenes.I can't give a movie that I couldn't WAIT for it to end more than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is only one good part of the movie","review":"I think there is no magic in this movie. The plot is terrible and there is really no point to anything Sandra and Nicole do. The only good part of the movie was watching Nicole and Sandra when they were looking rather tasty. Especially the part when Sandra is bending over and tending the flower bed, that was nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate at all","review":"What they presented being a witch in this movie is not at all what it is like, it is not something you thake advantge of, it is a gift God gives to some, I would know."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"What a waste of excellent actors and any viewer's time! The main problem was not so much the senseless use of special effects as the utter boredom of the narrative. How I would like to see Bell, Book and Candle again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars, I gave up on it - half an hour of my life wasted","review":"My wife made me watch this. The story of witches curses had an appeal, and if it was like SALEM'S LOT, penned by Stephen King and not Alice Hoffman(how does junk like this get into print is one question!), it might have been OK. But it was overblown cheap sentimentality so much it depressed me. Call this comedy? I call it a worthless piece of cinematic rubbish that's not worth ten minutes of anyone's time. And a waste of Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. As if losing a husband is called comedy and having to suffer just like Sandra Bullock's character is entertaining. If she had grabbed a gun and killed a few witch-haters this would have been far more entertaining than impractical magic. PUKE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened??","review":"I started to watch this and thought wow I am in for a treat, and then it just fell apart. The romance seemed so fast, he was her ideal man in a matter of minutes (he came on the scene too late in the film). The townspeople got over their hate real fast (and during an exorcism??) it was unbelieveable. Something was just missing ... a better screenplay perhaps.

Long story short the power supply died and I'm not going to pay to ship it across the U.S. to C.A. to the only certified repair shop in North America. I had DVD's stuck inside so I just removed the 7 or so screws and removed the cover. I was able to remove my DVD's and I then proceeded to smash the insides with my foot out of pure frustration. As seen in the movie Office Space :) DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"I bought this machine with the highest of hopes. It worked well, not great for two months. Then it stopped working. There is only one place in the US that is qualified by Harmon Kardon to repair it. They are in California and not cheap. After repair costs and shipping I could have bought another DVD player. I bought my Mother a [less expensive] DVD player for X-mas. It had equal quality and more features. Plus if it breaks after two months I'm only out [$$]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"I won this DVD player off of a sweepstakes and the day it was sent to me, it worked great... for 5 minutes. It began having troubles reading discs and would continously try to read them unsuccessfully. The tray then jammed and would not open, holding hostage 5 of my best DVDs. I brought it in for repair under warranty, and they couldn't even diagnose and fix the problem and said that they found it worked great. It worked when I brought it home, this time for about an hour. I am in the process of sending it back for repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN it works, it's great.","review":"I never thought I would have made such a bad purchase when I bought my HK DVD 5. The unit is in for repairs more than it is playing DVDs. The worse part is that practically no one in America is qualified to repair these things so you have to ship your unit half way across the US to get it fixed (at your expense). Mine just stopped working for no reason at all. I eventually found out that the power supply went bad, after owning it for 14 months (the warranty was over). Strictly from a warranty / repair viewpoint I will never buy HK again. I purchased a Panasonic DVD player while my HK DVD was in for repairs and I swear the picture is just as good if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the discriminating listener and watcher","review":"I've had my DVD5 for a couple weeks, and it's true, the picture has gorgeous blacks and shadings, fab colour, red appears acceptable without being too glowing or neon-like. The sound quality is fundamentally crisp and clear with good bass response. This machine will play tough double-layered discs with no problem. No more freeze-ups! I was a bit worried when I saw that the remote is made in Korea, but, so far I've had no problem. Let's face it folks, if you don't have a lot of time to spare, when you watch and listen to dvds and cds, you want it to a great experience, don't you? Mine works and sounds fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Design--Poor Follow-Thru","review":"After purchasing this unit, I was put through the trauma of having to exchange it 3 times, before finally giving up. I think if someone was lucky enough to get one that actually was not defective in some way, it would be an outstanding player, but I have to believe that the good ones are few and far between, if I got 3 defective units in a row. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defect right out of the box from 6ave.com","review":"High expectations on the unit when it comes right out of the box and is being attached to an HK110 AVR. Plop the Shrek disk in, and hoping for nothing but net but alas nothing but disk error, incompatable disk and skipping - unfortunately not the disk. At times the reader would try to scan \\"forever\\" but alas the error reappears. Seems HK should provide much better out of the box quality - perhaps this is just an isolated defect but being the first one we have purchased who knows. Apparently there were reader problems when moving from a one to a two disk set. It does not play cd-r format although advertised that it did. Lots of features and fun along with the fun I go through doing an exchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"ah, the nostalgia...","review":"This brings back such great memories from childhood...

Before you say yes, read pages 205-217. Do you believe that the Christian doctrine of Salvation is a fair and just plan initiated by a god? Read pages 322-331 for a very different view.This book expresses some very harsh criticisms of religion which are based, not on historical or scientific incompatibilities, but on the intrinsic value of religious doctrines in themselves. It is an unusual approach seldom seen -- at least by this reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening","review":"Although I've been raised as a Lutheran and have many friends who are Catholic, I find that the older I get, the more I question religion, its teachings, and practices. I found this book enlightening in many apsects and was really glad to find out someone else (many, in fact) has the same questions and doubts about religion. While there is no absolute right or wrong answer, many ideas are brought to light and give cause to deep reflection to find your own answer.

Ford/Lincoln trucks have a small shaft that keeps the tailgate from crashing down when opening and requires that the lightbar be modified to fit. This required alittle work, but I was able to install. The 3M backed mounting strips are Mickey Mouse on this unit and are questionable if they will remain intact. I would suggest adding additonal tape or using screws when mounting. As for the lights they are as advertised, bright, BUT, when the turn signals are on not all the flashing lights flash with the same brightness thus looking cheap and Mickey Mouse. ALso when the brake lights are illuminated some lights appear more bright than others. I would not recomment this lightbar and would definately not buy this again. I would go with the Plasmaglow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"When I received the product it was defective and now I can't get my money back for 3 weeks...."},{"rating":"1","title":"49\\" or 60\\" ???","review":"Title description says this is a 60\\" lightbar but the product description says length is 49\\" and 60\\" is available under a different part number.

The bonus tracks are kind of a throw away, if'n you ask me, but that don't take nuthin' away from the greatness of \\"My Heart Still Stands,\\" \\"Shotgun Blues\\" and \\"Ghost Town,\\" among others.Relive the glory days of the short-lived cow punk movement (these guys are not really cow punk but somehow they got lumped in with bands like Blood on the Saddle, Tex & the Horseheads, and Rank & File, to name a few) and buy this CD.

After hanging outside on a cold Pennsylvania day I saw a squirrel hanging on it eating from the feeder.

I'm going back to a mechanical squirrel resistant feeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Our birdfeeders constantly get raided by squirrels so I decided to try SquirrelStop.

I have had my share of flimsy spatulas, and I wanted something that was a sturdier product. However, the size of this item is much larger and heavier than I expected or needed. Again, this is a great product, but expect something heavy and large. Perfect for grilling, not so much for pancakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This spatula is huge, shaped at an odd angle, and is completely counter to Oxo's 'Good Grips' claim. The handle is a thin sheet of stainless bent and hollow underneath. The rubberized handle part is not long enough to avoid gripping the sharp edged underside. As if poor grip wasn't bad enough, the spatula is extremely over-sized and the angle is such that it isn't easy to use for skillets and other stove top purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal is coming back","review":"With most of the new cookware now being able to use metal utensils, I made the switch back to the old tried and true metal.

However their music is a rare blend of rock and poppy keyboards that even the hardcore music fan can dance to when they're alone in their room. Not that I do that, or anything...Almost as geeky as Weezer, as catchy as Harvey Danger, and more fun than the All-American Rejects, this is definetely an album worth your money.

Just listen to the CD, and it'll speak - or sing - for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effortless pop-rock","review":"At least that's what they make it sound like on this record. Another thing that they hint at with this record is their talent. Although this album doesn't make use of it completely, it gives little pieces here and there where you realize this is just the beginning of something good that could eventually become great. What's refreshing about this album is how it seems to slide from track to track with a terrific flow that some albums never achieve even though they're constantly breakneck paced. Some of the songs are slow and contemplative, but extremely atmospheric and it's nice to see a band on a major label branching out their sound like that early in their career, let's just hope they continue this facet of their ability. I'm sure if you've heard of this band you've heard their insanely catchy singles \\"Get Over It\\" and \\"So Damn Hot\\" well, this album has more where that came from even though it doesn't sound the same. So if that's what you're looking for, here it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good tunes but they don't stand up to repeated listens","review":"Kind of blah power pop, with the slower numbers \\"Return\\" and \\"Shortly Before the End\\" the best, along with the catchy \\"There's a Fire\\". Most of the other songs are completely forgettable, especially \\"C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips\\" and \\"You're So Damn Hot\\". The keyboards and backing vocals sound pretty good, but the lead singer's voice has very little range or personality. I give them credit for selling this CD for a (somehwhat) reasonable price... but all in all it's just not that good. I'd recommend any Fountains of Wayne or Superchunk CD over this if you like good catchy power pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Hit Wonder!","review":"The hit single ''Get Over It'', is one of my favorite songs. Musically and lyrically it's near perfection. However the rest of the album is pretty much generic. I expect that a album has atleast 3 or 4 really good songs in order to be considered a good album. My advice is to get the single if it's available here on Amazon, or to spend $.99 at iTunes(if it's available there as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Culmination","review":"As they claim: Equal parts indie rock, stadium rock, and a mixture of Elliot Smith.

Carl Jung was influential in the development of the original idea for personality tests.As far as accuracy goes I would dare to say this book gets pretty darn close to what our core personality really is. If you answer the questions as honestly as possible the book will describe you almost in a nutshell by the time you finish. Very interesting! Once you figure out what anagram you fall under this book will also offer advice for successful solutions to work, relationship and leisure problems based on personality type.I highly reccommend trying this test at least once, it's fun, revealing and informative. The suggestions may also provide a bit of insight into a better fitting career and/or relationship as well....although nothing is set in stone.

It reads like a lost novel by Nabokov by way of Doestoyevsky and Henry Miller.Once you have learned Stalin's three great truths from this book, you will come to understand upon what rocks the Soviet Union was really established.The book is every bit as brilliant and imaginative as Stalin was evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"believable biography but unbelievable author","review":"This novel simulates an autobiography of Stalin, over all centered in his obsessive fight against Trotsky, whose murder he's planning during almost all the chapters because he believed Trotsky was the only one that could snatch him the Soviet power. The book seems to me very credible although I don't know so many details about the real, historic Stalin, but as it were I think is good, although it has a trap, and that is the author can't pretend and I think he doesn't, that a cruel dictator and a criminal as Stalin, although very intelligent, could have the sensibility and writing abilities to make an autobiography as this. Perhaps truly Stalin could attain to understand all these that happens in this novel including external facts and internal thoughts, but to expose all these in an intelligible, attractive book, ever for his private use only, is another very different thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A laugh riot!","review":"Although Joseph Stalin is known for his brutishness towards his countrymen and ruthlessness towards his colleagues, this fictional autobiography reveals those tendencies as well as a wry humor to back it up.

Succinct and readable, it draws the reader in to Stalin's paranoia of his friends and especially his rival Trotsky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autobiograpghy? I think not.","review":"Does the truth of the words we use mean anything anymore or has Clinton put the nail in that coffin. Why not call this a videogame or a hat.

Am I wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Written","review":"Lourie's \\"Autobiography\\" is an extremely well-written journey, albeit fictional, into Stalin's heart of darkness. It is compelling. This piece of fiction evokes the nature of the beast in ways that straightforward biographies (Volkogonov, etc.) sometimes do not. True, Volkognov's \\"Stalin\\" masterfully details the life of Stalin. However, Lourie's fiction, in my opinion, seems to have found that withered spot that passed for Koba's soul. It is no wonder that Lourie's preface reads \\"To whatever sprit possessed me to write this book, may it be gone forever now.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Wow this movie was really great.

I read the other reviews (most of which were negative) and strongly disagree with them. I think Meg Ryan was wonderful, likewise Charles Dutton and the other actors. I am not a boxing fan. That doesn't matter. This movie is good entertainment. It is based on a true story of a female boxing manager who lets fame go to her head, makes some bad choices, and eventually...discovers what really matters.

Just make sure you have a good video card. When I was looking at the store display model, the image was blurry but when I plugged it to my computer, things were quite different: the image was crisp and clear.

One can't fault the choir for the recording. The fault lies with the director, arranger, and producer. The instrumental accompaniment over shadowed the boys singing.

The Back Street Boys are bad enough on their own--to hear them \\"interpreted\\" by one of the most prestigious a capella ensembles in history is to be stripped of one's dignity. And I'm just talking about the listener. The members of the administrative team (there's no point in blaming the singers who probably understood the shame in providing their exquisite voices to this disaster but were powerless to plead otherwise) that greenlighted this project should be hanging their heads low enough that even the most inflexible of humans is not deprived the opportunity of delivering a swift kick to the skull of at least one of these idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"What horrid crap!","review":"My God!

One day, I had an insight/ inspiration in the matter... and this book made it all so much clearer for me when I found it about a year later.* It's a shortened version of all the more traditional methods of consciously creating your own reality. It makes ritual more internalized, which means ordinary men/ women can afford it.* I recommend the book.

Once this happened, a series of backordered parts for repair, incompetency, etc. prevailed, and I still do not have a functioning TV.

The acting is suitable to the theme and the characters involved in the story, \\"live\\" and \\"robotic\\". Given the film literacy of the creators, many sources are acknowledged within the film and many more are knowingly alluded to; this is not plagiarism, it is fair use in maintaining traditions as well as seeking to give them a fresh look and thus perpetuate them.

For example, William Hurt's character is given exceptional lengthy, monotonous speeches in a demeaning attempt to \\"explain\\" to the audience what is happening. As for the movie's arrogance, it ends with the sentiment that humans are this wonderful, admirable, perfect species, even though most of the humans portrayed in the film are selfish, unforgiving creatures incapable of love or understanding..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever!!!","review":"I saw this in the theater. Now I'll admit, I'm normally a pretty easilly entertained audience member, but this was terrible. I get angry just thinking about how bad it is. The plot dragged on forever and there was barely even a climax. I would have walked out, but I kept hoping it might change and suddenly be good. That time never came.

This movie is a waste of time and money. The plot is tedious at best. The roles are not played convincingly, I did not care for any of the main characters, in fact at times in the movie I was hoping for their demise - just to end the pain. We hung in until the end just in case there was a payoff, unfortunately, we found none.

We had the movie about 2 years after it came out and I sold the movie to FYE when they were still around. Fast forward to 2011 (thats when I bought the movie again, im just now doing a review)the movie wasnt as good to me as it was back when I was a teen. It was boring and I wished I never bought it but I believed I paid 5 bucks for it used so no big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has its moments","review":"When Spielberg isn't rewriting World War II, he seems to be trying to resurrect the insight, heart, and imagination he brought to his early, wonderful movies like ET. But when it's gone, it's gone. AI is watchable only for the remarkable Haley Joel Osment (who isn't seeing dead people in this movie, but he might as well have been) and the always splendid Jude Law. Hey, even the Teddy (as in mechanical teddy bear with functional intelligence) was good. The first half of the movie isn't terrible; the second half sinks like a stone. No amount of acting talent could rescue this turgid, overlong melodrama. Not even the return of those onion-headed, big-hearted stick people (from Close Encounters. Remember them?) could rescue this story. It's worth seeing for the special effects, and for Haley Joel and Jude Law. It has few other redeeming features. The Pinnochio theme gets worked to death; the adults are all dolts and so are most of the kids. Only the mechanical people have hearts. Duh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of two hours","review":"This was a big yawner. The annoying child star who is in every movie requiring a child star shows up again here.

We are then subjected to an eternity of him chasing after The Blue Fairy who will make everything right. Interjected of course with Jude Law's appearance as a Sleaze robot. Yawn.Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"POO POO","review":"If this movie would have ended after just hours, it would have only been awful.

However, it really fails to explore or develop these characters in any significant depth. Ultimately, the film's downfall is that it contradicts itself repeatedly, which destroys all continuity rendering it impotent of any legitimacy. Ultimately the denouement is an insult to all of us.

But really, with the limitless scope of a concept like Artificial Intelligence, was that the best the writers could come up with? Blue Fairies and Wannabe Boy Robots? Yes, the film has several layers and I get the idea of our creations inheriting the Earth while we fizzle out from uselessness... \\" a whimper, not a bang.\\" We could have had concepts such as AI in the workplace, AI in the church, AI in the spiritual life, the real human arena. What does it mean to be human and who created us? Those would be grand topics to pursue in a film. Not this.

The storyline for this movie ..is almost interesting.. (just almost). The scene was set in the future and the story is about a cute robotic boy who was trying to be a real humam.. He believed if he's a real boy, his mommy (actually was a person he was programmed to love ) would love him in return.. So he's searching for a blue fairy who he believed can make his dream come true.. At the very end, the hero turned out to be a group of high-tech futured creatures... Well, the story can't really make you feel anything and now and then, it made you wonder why it didn't come to an end yet... Anyway, good special effect though..specially the nanny robot and Jude Law's robotic play boy..

Some have called it an art film, I think it looks more like the film makers were smoking acid when they made it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tale of two stories","review":"Lets get the technical stuff off the table before reviewing the video. Great look, wonderful sets, Fabulous production values, CGI and special effects. The actors are superb, the characters are complex and multi-dimentional, rich and believable. The story line is engaging, surprising and entertaining. So why do people seem to either hate or love this movie. Because underlying the entire movie is the theme that human beings, in general, are an evil disease infecting the universe and should be eraticiated. Every human being featured is a degrading, psychopathic monster with a civilized veneer. The final scenes are horrific in an emotional sense and deeply disturbing as well as intellectually false. Do not let your children watch this movie. No matter how artfully done, I wouldn't want to watch someone torture a being (organic or artificial) to death. This video is the intellectual equivalent of bear baiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely artificial","review":"This movie, quite simply, is a poor re-telling of Pinocchio, ruined by Spielburg's inability to leave things alone. There's an obvious break in the story, where it goes from Kubrick to Spielburg, from jagged and interesting, to formulaic and cliche (it occurs once the boy is left in the woods by his mother). Instead of something truly thought provoking, we're left with a visually stunning (except for the ending that was tacked on), yet utterly hollow film, one that anyone that's ever taken an introductory philosophy or film class could make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial Movie","review":"Artificial Intelligence comes across to me not like a movie in the usual sense. To me it was more like Spielberg spending 2-1/2 hours worshipping what little is left of his creativity. And why is this clunker so excruciatingly long? Simply because Spielberg couldn't figure out how to end the thing. As a modern rehash of the old Pinocchio myth, Artificial Intelligence is a complete flop. The special effects are interesting (thank God for special effects!) but Spielberg spoils the fun by applying a thick layer of cheap sentimentality to everything in sight. Haley Joel Osment is incapable of doing anything other than whining and making spaniel eyes at everybody. The single bright spot is provided by Jude Law who sparkles in his role as a sex worker robot. Who should see this movie? If you are among those who think that drug store greeting cards provide interesting reading, you should definitely see Artificial Intelligence. All others should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A.I. = Absent Intelligence","review":"This was the STUPIDEST movie I have ever seen other than \\"Crazy People\\"! What a disappointment!

For a start, where's the problem? The kid is horrible. Haley Joel Osment should be packed up in a sealed crate and left to rust! Who would want the pathetic disturbing guffawing little idiot in their house in the first place?And worst of all, there's a revolting Christian feeling to this movie's lazy morality that will have all intelligent beings vomiting popcorn before the first hour has passed. If God existed, even he (in his 'infinite mercy' - don't laugh) would have struck most of the cast down on the spot. A tragic end to a legendary movie career."},{"rating":"1","title":"undoubtedly Speilberg's worst movie","review":"usually i enjoy Speilberg movies, some of them are among my favourite movies but AI will never be one of them. Occassionaly a movie comes along that is just so awful from start to finish (in this case especially finish) that it almost defies being reviewed. there are few or no redeeming features of this movie, of course the effects are excellent, of course the performances are good, of course the pace is digitally perfect but the film has no soul, ultimately its at lifeless as the characters it reflects on. therein lies the critical flaw of the film, it is itself totally artificial and dead. whilst on a purely intellectual level that is intriguing its not enough to sustain a feature length movie. what would have made a unique and probably award-winning short movie fails to succeed as a feature. finally it leaves one feeling sad that so much talent and effort were wasted on one bad idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"A good movie and a good DVD treatment.

The movie-going public has been conditioned by \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Alien\\", \\"Men in Black\\", etc. to expect nothing from science-fiction movies except awesome special effects and outrageous action scenes, and to be disappointed/confused when they are offered more. Yes, \\"A.I.\\" has its flaws, but the basic story, as with the best of SF, makes us think. When we, as a society, have the power to create intelligent beings, what are our obligations to them? \\"A.I.\\" is worth watching for its exploration of this theme alone. See \\"Bicentennial Man\\" for another take on the subject. Both movies are based on written works by masters of the genre. The basic premise cannot help but show through any flaws of the movie-making process. \\"A.I.\\" is no \\"Citizen Kane\\" but both movies make an assumption of intelligence on the part of the viewer, an assumption that seems lacking in most movies today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed but worth watching","review":"After finishing AI, I felt both moved by the story and sick of Spielberg shoving emotions down my throat. I found the ending brilliant, despite taking way too long to get there. It would have been moving enough without being drenched with gushing sentimentality. Still, give Stephen credit for doing something different, and give credit to the cast for delivering terrific performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kubrickian Vision Fails in Hands of Fantasy Pulpmeister.","review":"....you could just about tell what Spielsberg took from Kubrick's storyboards and what is pure Steven Spielsberg. My problem with this moovy is that such a drama and collaboration would have gone over bigtime 10 years ago....pre 2K, dig? But certain things in the moovy seem forced. Jude Law doesn't seem to really form a bond with the Boybot (or is this the closest thing to bonding Mechas do?), the teddy bear was it supposed to be more humorous? Osment comes off as being creepy, period. Particularly in that scene where he's trying to mock his 'mom' eating and laughs at strands of noodles in his mouth.C'mon folks. Had Kubrick lived to flesh out his darker, thinking mans' vision, it would have been a masterpiece a la A Clockwork Orange or 2001. This product, however, failed to live up to it's great promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible but definately not great either.","review":"This movie is a twisted Pinnochio story. I was kind of disturbed by the similarities actually. I was expecting to see something more than that but that's all this really was. Don't get me wrong, the visualizations were amazing and the actors did a good job but about half way through the movie I found myself thinking, \\"This is just rediculous. Is this over yet?\\"One thing I will say, you can tell exactly at what point in the story Kubrick left off and Spielberg took over.Bottom line, in my opinion, if you want to see something for it's great visualizations then this isn't a bad choice. If you want to see a movie with an amazing story line, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly drawn out ending.","review":"I don't like precocious child actors, because they usually can't act. Haley Joel Osment is an exception, he can act better than most professional adult actors. He did a tremendous job in this movie, but the film was dragged down by the dreadful plot.This updated Pinochio story started promisingly. It then reached a point where having built up everyones emotions, the storytellers didn't seem to be able to find a satisfying ending. So it dragged on, and on, and on, and then there wasn't a satisfying ending at all.Surely a better ending would have been to create a whole android family (inc. 'mummy'), using the new technolgy and to adjust the audiences and android's perception of what being real, really means."},{"rating":"2","title":"A.I. Artificial Intelligence","review":"I just saw this movie and it is compelling and heartfelt. I thought Haley Joel did a supurb job. I not sure why anyone who has ever seen as Kubrick movie thought that some of the scenes would not be disturbing... I do agree that it was a bit disjointed, but I think it helps the plot, not takes away from it. David's \\"life\\" is disjointed... he is made to love only who he imprints on, then just like life, the one he loves the most turns on him ans sets him free into the world. A world filled with humans... who for some reason created all of these \\"Mecha\\" but never found a place in thier hearts for them, so you enter a technopunk slaughter house for Mecha. I think the concept is quite profound and telling... this is the truth about humanity.Look at our world today, how could you not feel what this movies is trying to say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oedipus Rex","review":"An awsome spectacle...truly captivating movie that one will either love or loathe. Ignore the too obvious analogy of Pinocchio - this is much more akin to Oedipus.First rate performances all round, and a story well told on several levels. The only mildly distracting mechanism is the clear shift from a typically thought provoking Kubrick feel to a Spielberg \\"ET\\" like theme. It works, but is a bit too contrived. Truly a richly textured and thought provoking movie - which is perhaps the major reason it clearly divided the audience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just My Thoughts","review":"I won't go into detail about this Pinocchioesque storyline, as other people here have already done that. It was truly amazing. The visuals are spectacular. The only place the movie fails is in the last half hour.

But I keep coming back to the sadness. It's not the type of downer sadness that pushes those buttons that films find so alluring, but rather it deals with death in a way that gives meaning to death. Not in the usual way of \\"rebirth\\" or even alluding to God and a new existence (another form of \\"rebirth\\", anyway) but rather absolute and final ENDING which has a beautiful closure and brings nobility to fatalism. I wasn't crying for the loss of things, but rather for the acknowledgement of truth. That being that even though life is a futile attempt at happiness, and is in a constant state of decay and entropy, when all is said and done maybe there is hope that even though things are not eternal, at least beauty and meaning can be experienced while life is still present."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was very bad!","review":"I was very dissapointed by this movie.

Time to grow up, Stevie, you're past senior citizen age!Most of the movie seemed to be a bunch of personal dream sequences strung together. Dreams may mean everything to the person who has them,but they don't mean much to the rest of us.Spielberg has become too rich and famous and, like all before him, is drying out creatively.

Kubrick felt Steven could do more with the movie than he could he gave it to him because he know he could pull it off and he did. People think kubrick would of did better with the movie. But what people don't understand is he gave the production to Steven because he didn't want it because he was having such a hard time with it so thats what I heard. As far as the DVD goes its one of the best out right now. I named the A.I. the best film of 2001 and is and may very well be the greatest sci-fi film ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa...

I will admit the story kept me interested half-way through. Wondering what would happen next to our robotic boy-wonder. Then it was all down hill from there. As soon as I realized they were ripping off Pinochio, I began to slouch in my chair in disgust. Then when boy wonder gets where he is supposed to go. There are a bunch of plot twist (if thats what you can call them) that make absolutely no sense. For example when he enters the studio and destroys another robot because he thought he was unique. I wonder how long it took them to think up the very ending-because it looked like they were struggling for a conclusion.

Needless to say, we expected much more from both the director and the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and ridiculous","review":"If you'd like to loose all faith in the human race...If you want proof that the only real monsters in this world are children...If you want a contrived plot devoid of an inspiration...If you want reassurance that the only happy ending can be death...Well then, by all means, watch this movie.If, however, you'd like to avoid feeling suicidal for a week, stay away from it.Someone made some very clever commercials to promote this movie. Unfortunately, the commercials far outshine the movie itself. I expected a story about androids (\\"mechas\\" as they are called in the film) in which they rally around this new-age child--a robot with emotions! A robot who can evolve and take them all into a brave new world where mechanized life is recognized and free.Umm... No. The message of this film is: PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A\\" Why?","review":"For a movie that's almost eight hours long, it sure only felt like it was six and a half hours long.When the sole redeeming quality of your movie is a talking teddy bear, you might want to reconsider things. I'm tired of the Spielberg-buffs saying that this movie is \\"brilliant\\", \\"visionary\\" and that people are \\"missing the point\\". Last time I checked, a movie must HAVE a point in order for me to MISS it. And if you're hoping that John Williams' score will help this movie, think again. It's buried so deep in the mix, you'll hardly ever hear it.Rent \\"Pinocchio\\" instead... you won't want to check yourself into a psych ward after watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Much Potential...But Doesn't Work","review":"For any mature adult or person, they can see no doubt that this movie has so many in depth and profound themes that are somewhat haunting and intriguing, and yet beautiful and a bit ambiguous at the same time. I give 5 stars for the originality and message of this film. The only problem is that it eventually goes from being...interesting...to... okay...to... is it over yet?..then to... C'MON, WE GET THE PICTURE, WHEN IS THIS STORY EVER GOING TO END! This movie is just too slow and too long. It eventually becomes quite a bore, and gets kind of silly, weird, and just pointless. This movie had so much potential, the conception of it is brilliant, and yet it comes off as being disappointing because 1) it's not complete, 2) it's not comprehensible all the way, and 3) eventually you lose interest in the movie all together. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robot Boy? Not!","review":"Lots of people expected David to be played using special effects. They were right. Haley Joel Osment must've had special effects! In the whole first half of the movie he didn't blink once!!!! How did our boy do this? Pure talent! That's what! I loved the movie and I hope you enjoy it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dang stupid","review":"i highly awaited june 29th 2001. the day this came to theaters and i was first in line to see it at my local theater. it sucked. you didnt need that ice angel scene did ya mr. spielberg. i mean for 15 - 20 he sits there staring at an ice angel. this started off great but turned for the worst. do something funner like clip your toenails. just please do not see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad movie, but never let kids watch it.","review":"The thought behind A.I. :Artificial Intelligence was interesting, but the plot could have been better. I have basically two complaints about the movie. First, it's very idea was incredibly insulting to children. The movie made it out like children are just their parent's dolls, to be purchased and sent back. Second, the entire movie was ruined by the arena scene. In my opinion, no one should watch this movie, because that scene will stick in your mind and haunt you for days. After reading this, if you still want to see it, hey that's your business. But if you have kids, under no circumstances should you let them watch A.I. :Artificial Intelligence. If they have to watch it, at least do not let them watch the arena scene.I give this movie two stars, because of Steven Spielberg's directing and Haley Joel Osment's acting. (Which were both phenomenal, as always.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multiple Personality Direction","review":"This film will surely hold up well historically. In 2099 when the reviewers are doing their \\"most influential films of the century\\" reflections I'm sure this will be on many lists. Both Kubrick and Speilberg annointed this film with their own special genius. It's an uncomplicated remake of any \\"I want to be a real boy\\" story filtered through very complicated visualizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sci-fi","review":"If, like me, you judge how good a movie is by how much you think about it for days after, then this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. obviously, the special effects are good and all that, but the raw emotion is the real centerpiece of the film. I found myself at times having to remind myself that it was just a movie. I am in wonder at how this movie was so completely ignored by the oscars. to many people without children, teenagers, etc, the impact of this movie is undoubtably lessened. If you're a parent, however...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, not so good execution. Lots of peole have","review":"an opinion so here's one more. It was just a bit disappointing. I was waiting for a \\"pay off\\" that never came. It just ambled along, very slow in some parts. The movie started with really possible scientific development that will happen, probably in the relatively near future. Then it concludes with something totally different. It was if the producers didn't know how to end it. 20 years ago ET was great. Today AI not so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of it's time","review":"A.I. was a wonderfull movie, lots of good fx, with a bold teaching story to it. Great casting! A very moving picture so bring the kleenex to this one, you'll see what I mean. Haley did such a excellant job acting! Speaking of which in some sences you can really see the true emotions overwhelling the actor or actress, watch for real tears starting not fake in some sences which makes this an even better film! Once again Steven Spielberg proves the he is one of hollywoods very best. There were some small holes in this movie but with a huge subject like this it's hard get everything right, still you can understand what the point is. this film will make an impression days after! anyway rent or buy this one, trust me it will be worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the vein of I, Robot","review":"I feel incredible sadness. David's uniqueness was also the source of his alone-ness. How cruel then to program this being to love and seek love in return from one other, Monica. Longing for love is particularly poignant in a child. The power of science fiction to prolong this longing over a couple millennia shows David's extreme sincerity of his longing. I thought it particularly sad that David was able to accept the love of a facsimile of Monica (admittedly a very close facsimile) which I as a human did not find as cathartic.Although the story at times came across as contrived, the movie works on the strength of the performance of Haley Joel Osment as David. It also benefits from an unusually strong supporting cast, which included William Hurt and in particular, Jude Law.The science fiction is in the vein of Asimov's I,Robot stories. I thought it was wonderfully brought to screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible film","review":"It should have ended approximately one hour sooner than it did. The story just dragged on and on, it was really painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"no action but lots of thought","review":"This one fascinated me. The whole story developes an unexpected way and is deeply thrilling giving new brainfood any time it turns. The professional visuals fit in very nicely, not destroying the atmosphere by launching killer-effects or high-end-pyrotechnics any second.Some people said they found the movie wasn't \\"dark\\" enough. I thought it was very dark - and cold. And all was done very subtle. The acting didn't convince me completely, but it is all solid work well done.Not my favorite Spielberg but among the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your time.","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am not too upset about wasting [money] on the DVD, as the video and sound quality were excellent. I do feel like I wasted precious time by watching it. My fiancee and I were overjoyed when the little robot boy finally found his Mommy - not because it was dramatic or tear-jerking, but because we knew the movie would soon be over. This movie [is not good]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Intelligence","review":"This movie was a no brainer. If you have no brain and plenty of time to waste then this movie is for you. After reading who was in the cast and who was responsible for directing the film I expected to be entertained. Instead the audience was treated to a boring, unbelieveable farce. This film ia must to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie","review":"Dark, Dreary, Depressing are just some of the words used to describe this bomb of a movie. This is truly a movie to forget. I expected a light hearted E.T. type of movie. Instead I got a movie that at times bordered on the psychotic. I could not and would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy and would not recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two greats don't make an even greater","review":"The effects are very cool, and Jude Law is fun to watch, but this film overall is just plan lame. It's as though Spielberg tried to direct as if he were Stanley Kubrik, which he definitely isn't. The two directors' styles clashed severely and ultimately hurt the vision of the film.I've never walked out of a movie in the theater but by the time the 2nd hour was up (with much more to go) I was ready to split."},{"rating":"1","title":"AI suffers from a lack of intelligence and interest","review":"Bicentenial Man is a far better choice of movies if one has an interest in this basic plot premise.This movie never goes beyond the most basic of premises and never pulls you in.No surprises... within 10 minutes you already know the whole film.With some movies, you sometimes get pulled in, emotionally involved and almost forget it is only a movie... NOT IN THIS CASE.AI is so stiff and artificial you simply never care about any of the characters or what happens to them.With all due respect to the hard work people must have spent on effects and scenes for this movie, it suffers from the common Hollywood ailment these days......... 95% special effects and 5% story telling.If you want to spend 3 hours on human studies... rent and watch Bicentinial Man and the Straight Story back to back, but I can not recommend this movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying and boring","review":"Is this Disney, a chickflick or Sci-Fi? The only good parts are the futuristic eye candy which I wanted to relax and enjoy but kept getting annoyed by the obnoxious kid who sees dead people. And I wont even talk about that stomach churning scene where the two brats are shoveling spinach into their mouths and showing their chewed up food. This is the great Spielberg?!! Keep the barf bag handy... In its many components, it tries to have something for everyone and instead has nothing for anyone. Whats with this teddy bear, is it Disney? No cause it has sexual scenes such as the boys in the car being magically touched in the crotch. What is it? [junk]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Well, I think this movie wasted 3 valuable hours of my precious life, and now I can't get them back! Arg! I was utterly bored throughout the entirety of this movie. That actor, Haley or whatever looks really funny, and annoys the hell out of me. If the robot kid was portrayed by some other child actor, I would maybe have not hated this movie so much. The movie drags on for way too long, and I found myself watching the seconds slowy tick by on my watch more entertaining than this movie. The acting didn't come off as very good either. Overall I would say the only thing worth seeing in this movie is Teddy, the talking robot /toy teddy bear. ROCK ON TEDDY!!Meh don't buy this, in fact don't even rent it unless the video store is so desperate they give it to you for free, and even then I would advise not taking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A.I. --The Movie","review":"Perhaps, perhaps the DVD version might save this movie!! Please don't waste your time buying it. My advice is to rent it first. You may only be able to get through it once. I am a HUGE Sci-fi fan and was excited to see this movie. I was soooooo disappointed in it. Some parts of did not make sence whatsoever... Sorry...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long to sit through...","review":"this movie was mostly boring except for a few moments in the middle where more AI's were included in the carnival scene. The AI child's 'pet' being left alone at the long drawn out ending is what made my 12 year old sad. She didn't care for the movie at all except for the kids teddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"2000 years - and it felt just like it !!","review":"Oh boy, what a boring movie! I resisted for the first 2 hours to press the fast forward but after that I could not take it anymore. The first half hour is not bad but after the imprint everything falls apart, the worst, falls apart v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y... I am filing this movie in the \\"Worst I've ever seen\\" category. And I've seen a lot! Do a favour to yourself and stay away from it. The best scene in AI is when the \\"homeless\\" robots dig the dumpster and get the best parts of other robots to build themselves. Oh yeah, that's pretty much what this movie is about. It takes the best part of other movies (Blade Runner, Mad Max, even Planet of the Apes) to make itself. And the result looks as bad as the homeless robots..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Story","review":"This is the first movie that I have ever walked out on. After the second hour past I couldn't believe that the movie was still continuing with what seemed to be another subplot. The movie moved very slow and didn't fit together very well. It was a very disappointing night at the movies for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lot of talk about nothing","review":"I went to see this movie with great expectations, I mean Kubrick/Spielberg two of the greatest directors of out times. But I was really disappointed with it. It was too long, I almost fell asleep, the whole Kubrick's idea just disappeared in too many plots. Soemtimes it seemed like Spielberg didn't know what to do in some moments, especially in the end with the \\"aliens\\" I think it's really the worst of Spielberg's movies to date"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!!!","review":"Combine the genius of the late Stanley Kubrick (probably the best director of all time) and Steven Spielberg and you get the must moving piece of story telling ever. This movie will outlast all the dumb criticism thrown against it. Truly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"AI The best movie","review":"I dont know why people hated this movie so much. This was a wonderful movie by Stephen S. They didn't refer to the Blue Fairy too much because that's what the story was about. He wanted to become real and had heard the story so he thought the blue fairy was real. It was a beautiful movie that had me and my friends upset for weeks. This film was not recognised as much as it should have been, the trailers did it no justice and were misleading. I love this movie, you should too. (p.s.) did you know he was not allowed to blink once this entire movie. that's talent.) While I love Stanley Kub. I thought the movie was beatifully made. The aliens that everyone was complaining about at the end were advanced robots. Good for you Stephen, one day people will appreciate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I really wanted to leave the theater and ask for my money backseveral times. The wife didn't want to, though. When it was all over she said she wished she had. The short story is interesting -- if if had been a 30 or 40 minute movie it would have been great. But instead it was plodding and idiotic. Don't be so darn smitten next time Stevey..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed attempt at a good premise","review":"A good story should have one or more of these: a good story, moral lesson, or emotional content. Spielberg's AI falls short in all of these. The story could be interesting but is not told well. You feel some sympathy for the character but it is more pity than understanding. If it's showing somewhere on TV for free it's worth a look, but it's very long and doesn't keep one's interest enough to watch it till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"The movie never ends. I saw this movie in the theater, and I want my money back. After about 3 hours of boring nothingness, I finally walked out. I had a very hard time staying awake through this movie. Speilberg just didn't know when to end it! There were so many parts when I thought the movie should have been over, because nothing was happening, but no. It went on and on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"15-Minute Plot In A 2-Hour Movie","review":"Absolutely the worst movie Spielberg's ever done. An overused story line with a sappy moral and absolutely no humor or action. It's \\"Water World\\" meets \\"Bicentennial Man\\", so if you loved both of those movies, this movie might be for you. Personally, I would have found it more exciting and thought-provoking if Spielberg had simply filmed the two-thousand years \\"David\\" spends submerged staring at the statue of the Blue Fairy in real time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ending of All-Time","review":"Though many might not agree, I feel this is one of the worst movies ever made and easily has the worst angonizingly prolonged unrealistic ending of any movie. The last 20 minutes of the movie will have any intelligent viewers moaning in disbelief and saying \\"they couldn't possibly make that plot twist\\" only to watch even worse, more emotionally manipulative sequences transpire on screen. I often rate other terrible movies by how many times I could watch them again before I could sit through A.I. one more time. No other movie has a score lower than 4, meaning I'd rather watch that dreadful movie 4 times in a row rather than watch A.I. again. I'd rather watch 16 hours of Jar Jar Binks doing a dance/song interpretaion of the U.S. Constituition than watch A.I. again. Please save yourself from this movie and get something intelligent, like La Femme Nikita, The Professional, Brother of Sleep, Welcome to the Dollhouse, Croupier, Rounders, Little Voice, or American Psycho."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad As It Gets","review":"It's not so much that I resent the waste of money so much as the waste of time watching it. Sappy and just plain dumb, (alot like Spielberg) this one is destined for the trash heap, even if you are a sci-fi fan. With this piece of garbage the average viewer must feel as if his/her intelligence is in question. Just say \\"No!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film was awful!","review":"I disliked this movie so much I wanted to write a negative review about it. I thought that the story was terrible and the acting wasn't much better. In the last 30 minutes I kept hoping that it would end, but it continued to drag on painfully. If you liked in in the theaters go ahead and buy it, but if you haven't seen it I would recommend renting and get some drinks because you'll have to be loaded to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill on the global warming, already","review":"Global warming for breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnite snacks enough already! People shouldn't be brainwashed into thinking what the director/actors think that's called being a nazi. Just because you have the money and resources to manipulate people dosen't make it right. Everyone should have a basic right to be able to think for themselves (free will) remember? Anyway, the one star is for Jude and the other is for Haley. This was a very good idea but Steven turned it into a sap-fest as usual"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photography, dull story","review":"2 of 5 stars for the sci-fi movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Frankly, I'd give this movie a 1 of 5 stars, however, it is really well made with great photography and clean special effects, so it gets a 2 of 5. Set in the future where a company made a mechanical boy. The kid who played the robot did a good job. The story is insanely dull and excessively long at 2h25min. If they cut about 1h from the movie it would be OK and get a higher rating. Sorry, I do not recommend this movie; BTW, I lasted 1h30 before quitting for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"Somehow even my 17 year old couldn't get into this movie.

Tried to contact shipper but got no response."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"This movie was ver steroetypical. Though the graphics were quite amazing, the story was just horrible, and quite depresseing at times. The caracters wree very unlikable, and the constant annoyance of the kid almost made me want to get up and leave. This move was very poorly written, and just dragged on for the 3 hours or so. Speilberg tried to make this an epic movie, but he failed. I don't even reccomend renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten things I learned from A.I.","review":"1. Humanoid robots can swim2. Steven Spielberg should stick to making movies about Killer Sharks and Giant worms, at least there's quality there3. The leather couch in my living room is good comfy enough for a good 141 minute nap4. Haley Joel Osment is only capable of rehashing past characters5. Contrary to popular belief, Spielberg CAN make a bad movie6. Parents can be ignorant enough to ignore rules about robot food consumption7. Robots can survive centuries into the future8. A single strand of hair is capable of human reproduction9. Every android movie must have a subplot about \\"destroying\\" the androids10. Spielberg won't make another movie like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete misfire","review":"This mess has no idea what it wants to be. Spielberg at his cutesiest and most annoying (yes, this includes the horrible Color Purple and ridiculous War of the Worlds). What WAS he thinking? And the cockatootie teddy bear. Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.","review":"If I hadn't been with a large group of people when I saw this movie in the theatres I would have walked out. Absolutely rediculous.. it just gets weirder and weirder as it goes until you are thinking to yourself \\"how on earth could this possibly have a happy ending, I mean unless space aliens come down in their magic space ship and... oh... really??\\"I was writing some reviews and having a little fun and I thought to myself.. what's one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my life? Oh yeah, when I went and saw that pinochio space alien movie.. I'll go give that pile a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, droll, depressing, unentertaining drivel.","review":"I remember when Spielberg's name was synonymous with quality filmaking (I gave him a Mulligan for Close Encounters) but I think we've just witnessed the demise of one of our generations great directors. Seek the spotlight and the world has a way of humbling you. Karma dude! This movie sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Real this Movie Sucked!","review":"How can you people even give this movie 4-5 stars. Come on the plot was choppy and the flow of the movie was slow. The kid wandered aimlessly. The conclusion is ridiculous, especially the way things are reolved. The last disasterous movie of this magnitude for Spielberg was 1941.My advice is rent the DVD at BlockBluster. If you like it, buy it. If not then you've saved [money] or spared yourself the annoyance of trying to sell this [stuff] on ebay to recoup your losses."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, PLEASE MAKE MOVIE STOP!","review":"I GUESS WHEN YOU ARE Spielberg OR KUBRICK YOU CAN MAKE ANY PIECE OF GARBAGE YOU WANT.NOT A GOOD STORY.

THIS IS MADE FOR TV MOVIE STUFF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen.","review":"Not one part of this movie is at all believable. It it poorly written, and should never have been made in it's state. The acting is great and the SFX are great, but the story is so dumb, insulting, idiotic and contrived that I would've walked out of this movie, had I not needed a ride home. TERRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece or Mess?","review":"When I saw \\"AI\\" in the movie theater I loved the first act -- I was completely \\"there\\" -- but by the time the 3rd ending rolled around, I was staring at my watch, more that bored -- I was mad! I felt manipulated, and I couldn hardly wait to get out of the theater. Masterpiece? I don't get it. The most interesting character is \\"Snuggle the Fabric Softener Bear.\\" And one more thing -- I think most people would agree that if a child is lost and friendless, what should he do? Why, hang out with a male hustler, of course. Kubrick was a genius. Spielberg is brilliant. (And the story is fascinating.) But together, they've created a peanut butter & pastrami on raisin bread sandwich - somethimes things that are great separately don't fit together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected...","review":"I purchased this movie hoping to see yet another spectacular Speilberg flick. Boy was it a let down. I suppose if I were a bit younger (Like 12 perhaps) I may have enjoyed it. It was very predictable and almost a paste together of a bunch of borrowed ideas. The Pinocchio concept was a bit far fetched, but it did make for interesting thought. Overall I was surprised at how bad the movie kept getting and wished it had ended 1/2 an hour sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea Wasted on a Bad Movie","review":"The basic idea for this movie is excellent, and so are the special effects and the actor who plays David (Haley Joel Osment). However, the plot is more like a brainstorm of how artificial intelligence would affect the future than it is a story. The movie spends an insufficient amount of time developing the characters, and too much time preaching about the consequences of artificial intelligence. This film was frustrating because it could have and should have been much better than it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this guys.","review":"I rented this movie hearing all of the great reviews expecting a pretty good movie. I watched it for a little while then turned it off after 45 minutes. I just couldn't get into it. I think Haley Joel Osment is a good actor but to put it short..."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for Haley's acting but the rest is a waste of money","review":"The movie is based on the Pinocchio theme. The acting by the young actor Haley Joel Osment was great and it was the only thing good about the movie. The story itself was very poor where the child robot and the adopting mother were subjected to a very emotionally challenging situation. The child robot is driven to a hopeless situation where it ends up jumping off a side of a building. As the viewer, we basically see a child try to commit suicide. I would definitely not recommend the movie if you have young children of your own. Steven Spielberg might have a lot of power when it comes to movie making but putting his name on the movie credits does not guarantee that you will be seeing a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCK is to VACCUUM as A.I. is to BLACK HOLE","review":"I cannot believe I wasted over 2.5 hours of my life watching this terrible movie. I was taken aback at the lack of creativity, as well as a total sham of a plot. The movie had no direction at all, it was nothing but a downward spiral towards the unsatisfying and completely lame ending. I am a serious fan of sci-fi and action, such as LORD OF THE RINGS and STAR WARS, however AI was completely blown out of the park by the mentioned films...Have a more enjoyable time drowning yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours and 20 minutes you will not get back","review":"Maybe I saw a different film from the people who actually liked \\"A.I.\\", or maybe I should lower my expections. Either way, this movie was simply awful. It starts off silly and goes downhill from there. And just when you think it can't or won't get worse, it does. The acting was weak, the story was weak, the ending was horrible, and what's with that bear? I beg those who have not watched this -- DO NOT waste your time. It's too late for me, but it's not too late for you. Save yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Magic","review":"One of the most misunderstood movies of all time. David is a robot that develops a \\"bond\\" with his \\"mother\\" A perfectly crafted movie from the brain of Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. It's a movie that will make both of them proud.This is a movie that frustrates more than it profounds. It's a delightful movie with a wonderful performance from Haley Joel Osment.This Two-Disc Set is definitely worth it. It includes hours of features and some nice interviews. Plus the movie looks amazing.It's definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"More is Less","review":"Two famous directors, lots of big name actors, Great Special Effects, 140+ minutes... and you end up with this dreck?? Sometimes you can tell a big story in a small way..you don't need to span thousands of years, toss in a new evolved life form (unless your on UPN) and have honky tonk robot cities.. a smart story, script and believable plot would have worked out better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgot to use the edit room?","review":"Very long and for no good reason. The first half hour was OK with its human interaction but this soon ends and you have to sit through 1:50 minutes of robots and such to reach the finish line. At best Speilberg could have saved his movie and used a lot fewer special effects and tryed to keep a far more interesting plot going. Its just another low budget screen play that relies on just the visual effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you Ready","review":"Clearly every movie is not for everybody. A.I. brings me back to movies like Dune and Mad Max. Yes,it is a long movie, but if you have a long attention span, I am sure it will be well worth it. Every scene in this movie is essential. The graphics are great and the human nature that comes through in this movie is heart breaking.So if you are open minded and fairly smart you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed!","review":"I wanted so much for this movie to at least be enjoyable, well it didn't even close. If you haven't seen this movie please rent it first and don't waste the $20 buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Woody dies maybe Oliver Stone can complete his film","review":"A truely horrible attempt. These two directors have nothing in common, and I have no doubt that Kubric is spinning in his grave over this one. Some of the special effects were SO cheesy - like the wolf-head motorcycles and the baloon shaped like the moon. Nice cinematography, beautifully shot, but a rambling, incoherent, overly-sentimental piece of dogy doo. One of the few movies to cause me to audibly groan in a movie theatre. (\\"And then...2000 years passed\\"...argh!)To the reviewer who compared those who didn't like this movie to their parents who didn't like \\"2001\\"...huh? 100's of years from now 2001 will still be a classic while AI will be collecting dust along side Ishtar and Howard the Duck.Again, to review, a very bad film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Movie","review":"Stanley Kubrick had something to do with this story, and Steven Spielberg was very involved in making the film, so you know it's going to be interesting. Haley Joel Osment plays a highly advanced robot looking to receive love and so goes on a quest to become real so his human mother will love him. He believes that the blue fairy from popular children's literature actually exists, and can transform him. Along the way he teams up with Jude Law's character, also a highly advanced (a lover model) robot, and Teddy, a stuffed bear supertoy that can see, hear, walk, and talk. Rather than tell you what happens every step of the way, let me just say that this movie is brilliant, and tugs at your heartstrings in a big way. I cried, saw it again, and cried again. It helps if you are a Sci-Fi fan, but if you are not, you will probably still enjoy it. The ending is quite unexpected, but goes extremely well with the movie. I know I will see this movie again, many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me feel, the best movie I have ever seen.","review":"This is a marriage of Kubriks Brain and Spielbergs heart. Kubrik sets a tone of the cold and artificial within and against which Spielberg urgently struggles. The sadness and beauty of the end is trancendent, just unbelievable how Spielberg follows an emotional logic. No it feels impossible to talk about it.

We were all excited to see Spielberg's newest masterpiece. Sadly, we were all disappointed as we watched a movie with very cold characters. There was little or no love here.In addition to the coldness of the whole movie, the lack of a believable, or interesting, plot was too much to bear. The entire movie was a series of anti-climaxes. Just when you thought something interesting and exciting was about to happen, the scene was over.Just not a good movie.... 1 star? No stars in my book. A thumb to the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor; skip A.I.","review":"In all honesty, A.I. was one of the worst films I've seen. I was very disappointed to see that any of Kubrick's bright ideas were overshadowed by lengthy and excessively corny Spielberg scenes. I felt myself not caring about any of the characters and wishing the film would end (which it takes a very long time to do.) Finally, towards the end of the movie you are in for a surprise when you think that it is over and instead it launches into the final scene. This is when I turned from simply disliking the movie to utterly hating it. Please save your money and your three hours. And if you absolutely must see it, don't say I didn't warn you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids under the age of 15 should not go see this film.","review":"None of the reviews that I've read make a reference to another nuance in this film; the robots are treated the way our society treats others not deemed to be part of 'normal' society; the misfits, the gay people, the not so slim folks. The pool side scene with the kids made me cringe; I could imagine kids hassling a gay companion that way. Also: who in their right mind would allow a child to sit and watch the red necks pouring acid on etc. and other wise mutilating robots? I had to turn my face when the nanny was being murdered. Too much. This is Spielberg? I do not want to go see another one of his movies if this is characteristic of his work. I for sure would check a movie of his out before I would allow a child to see one of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spielberg misses big time","review":"Considering the budget and effort, this must be considered one of the worst movies of 2001. The whole movie ultimately revolves around the relationship of a robot child with his human mother and is told (in particular during the second two thirds) completely from the perspective of the child. In doing so, the movie loses its audience after the first 30 minutes or so. The intersting part ends when the kid is abandoned by his human mother. Up to this point the viewer could at least attempt to identify with the human parents. What makes the movie fail subsequently is the fact that the viewer is unable to find any identification points. The child - as emphasized by the movie, remains a machine, ultimately with an off switch. All that is left is a bad version of Pinochio.Maybe this movie might have worked 100 years ago, but not in the year 2001..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steven, how could you?","review":"Steven Spielberg + Stanley Kubrick + ILM + a great cast... This movie should have been fantastic. And, to be fair, it does start out that way. However, as the plot moves along, it quickly goes from fantastic to mildly interesting to vaguely silly to PLEASE GOD MAKE IT STOP. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The fact that it was directed by Steven Spielberg, widely regarded as one of the best in the business, makes it even more of a tragedy. I realize there are a lot of people who think this movie is magnificent and wonderful. Well, to them I say this: That's what the townspeople thought of the Emperor's New Clothes. I think this movie is absolute garbage, and a must to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful, awful movie","review":"Two things:1) This definitely goes on my personal 10-worst-movies list.2) The only good part of this truly, truly awful film is a close-up of Jude Law's eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh, what... ?","review":"It's difficult to believe this movie would have been released, in this form, at this length, with this ending had the name \\"Spielberg\\" not been attached to it. Yes, the film has a few bright spots - the visuals are quite striking at times, and Jude Law gives a wonderful turn as a robotic prostitute, but on the whole, the film just rambles (at considerable length) without going anywhere. It's a lot like a dream - filled with physical impossibilities, emotionally wrenching at times... but then, in most dreams, you don't have to wait 45 minutes for what you already know is going to be an unsatisfying ending. Better you should rent Disney's Pinnochio, or read the book... you'll get a better ending and possibly enjoy yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love this film.","review":"This is an amazing film you may not be open to.

There is nothing original about the entire story. It is a hodge-podge of plagiarism drawing from numerous sci-fi and fairy tales. To name a few: Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Robot Dreams, What makes this terribly bad is that these sources don't even seem to be disguised at all. It is like there is a blatant reference to all the original stories.The characters are extremely un-captivating, which leaves you with sense of not identifying with nor caring about their plight. But wait, it gets worse the lighting throughout the film is terrible. What should be lit isn&#65533;t and what should be dark is lit. It seems like the back ground was more important that the actors. I guess it was to draw the viewer&#65533;s attention away from the thin story line. I found myself just wanting the main character, David, just to die, or better yet rust away.Do yourself a favor, and save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever - Avoid It - Wish I Had Been Warned","review":"This movie was audio/visually stunning. Unfortunately I didn't follow my instincts and turn it off after 30 minutes... the film should have been named \\"Abuse of A.I.

I highly recommend avoiding the film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"This movie is BORING. The story is trite and the movie should have ended atleast half an hour before it did. The DVD isn't worth it because the movie sucked. PASS on it. It's just not worth the money or the time. The only redeeming factor was the brilliant acting of Haley. He is a natural, but it can't make up for a bad script, 1-dimensional characters, and choppy pacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I saw this with my 18 year old son. I was so excited to see it due to all the hype. I was disappointed and wish I had just left before it finished. I have never done that before but we both agreed it was a waste of our time. It was long and not what I expected from the beginning. I took my son to see Tomb Raider and we both enjoyed it. I like the director just not this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Kubrick film","review":"This is not a Kubrick film. A Clockwork Orange and 2001 are Kubrick films. Casting a dark, brooding and a baleful eye upon humanity, Kubrick was a master moralist, depicting humanities excesses and the horrible extremes to which they could lead. While this movie has Kubrick undertones, it is after all billed as a combination of both Spielberg and Kubrick, the film quickly descends into a sugary, ET-ish drive to go home. Please do not desecrate Kubrick's reputation by listing this as his movie or claiming that this movie went over the audiences heads. Spielberg went straight for the heartstrings with this gooey, botch job of a good Kubrick idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not something for everyone, but might be everything to someone.","review":"First off, this film is not for everyone. I understand the dissapointment upon theatrical release. People saw the Spielberg name and cool visuals and instantly thought it would be an exciting family film.That's not the case though. This is a very dark and very emotional movie. It deals with subjects rarely touched upon by most modern films.Without spoiling anything, this film brings philosophy and spiritual thinking to the science-fiction genre. It is amazing to look at thanks to the brillant art direction, cinematography, and lighting along with the excellent direction by Spielberg himself.If you can surrender yourself to its story, you will be rewarded with a film that is truly beautiful in both appearance and story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FLAWED GEM","review":"I love both Kubrick and Spielberg, but this film should have been one, or the other. The gadgetry, and CGI visuals are superb, and Osment, and Law are simply outstanding as David, and Gigolo Joe respectively, but the plot was over-burdened, and tedious at times. I loved PINNOCHIO too- when I was eight, but I think fairy tales for people beyond that age either need to not take themselves too seriously, or have to have the edge that, say, Scott's BLADE RUNNER did. Unfortunately, this movie didn't retain Kubrick's darkness, and I personally think it needed that. This said, Osment imbued his robotic character with such heartbreaking warmth, and yearning that one couldn't help but be fascinated ( or possibly 'repelled' ) by him.Despite the lapses in logic this movie still entertains, and not because it's uplifting. It's far from upbeat. It does make one think a tad, and feel, and perhaps yearn just a bit oneself- for what could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie with a Message","review":"A. I.--Artificial Intelligence is the best movie I have ever seen. In it Osment--as a robot boy--is symbolic of children who are \\"different\\". Whether they have physical, mental, or educational problems, they do not meet parental expectations. David (played by Osment) is an unconditionally loving, innocent child, but is unable to be what his parents want (in this case, human). The moral of the story is, though people dream of loving, empathetic children, when some are blessed with them, not only do they not appreciate it, they do not recognize it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Artificial Intelligence","review":"Received DVD in the condition advertised and prior to the date it was estimated to be received.

The effects, the acting, the music, all wonderful. The plot was very well written. It has lots of actions in some scenes but the main ojection is the love David has for his mother.

The acting was fine, the special effects were decent but not enough to make me appreciate this film. Yes, the movie's theme, \\"What is real?\\" gives you something to think about but I didn't need two and a half hours to come up with the answer. The plot did not flow and the ending was pathetic. While some people felt that the closing scenes of David and his mother were heatwarming, I felt it was fake and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally stunted, dull and way too long","review":"I really was hoping for a good time when I sat down with this movie last night. What I got was a complete waste of over two hours. While A.I. is visually interesting, the uber-depressing plot rambles here and there with no solid direction. I think this must have been a \\"movie by committee\\" where everyone involved threw in their ideas on what the characters should do and no one bothered to say \\"No, that is silly\\" or \\"no that will make this movie even longer\\". I was even underwhelmed by the usually fantastic music by John Williams. I think this is the first time I ever saw a movie with music by John where I wasn't enthralled with the score and couldn't walk away humming the main theme. This movie was a terrible dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a JOKE!","review":"Ok, just because a director is popular doesnt make their movies fundamentally good. Is a good piece of art good because of the hype behind it or because of its cohesive / coherent message and content? This movie displayed so very little cohesivensss and coherency. It looks like pieces stollen out of 4 to 5 movies most people have already seen (wizard of oz and 2001 to name a few). Unless you just want to see this for some occational special effects and dont care about things like content, Id recommend passing on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seek and ye shall find","review":"Spielburg and Kubrick are kindred in \\"AI\\". Conceptually Kubrick presents questions like \\"What is it that makes a human conciousnous?\\" and \\"What difference is their between love and adoration.\\" These conceptual questions could never be presented by Kubrick for this film (as many times as he tried). The Project was missing one ingredient.Spielburg and his time tested genius for showmanship new the angle. He presents the film from the view of a child. He shoots a film in which he actually seeks to define, Love, Life and humanity. The audience has to come without pretense in order to hear the voice of the future and the cry of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling this film \\"horrid\\" would be kind","review":"Speilberg had a choice to make.

Speilberg chose \\"A.I.\\", and he chose wrong. \\"A.I.\\" is not only long and boring but its' themes are pure plagarism from other and better made films. The film steals from \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Bicentennial Man\\", among others. In fact, if you've seen \\"Bicentennial Man\\" then you've seen a better film.A.I. is sappy, sentimental, boring, slow, depressing, and full of plot holes. Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoy sentimental and sappy stuff but this just simply stunk.The idea that the polar ice caps have melted and have flooded coastal areas, including Manhattan, works to the contast of the films' attempt to create a sense of reality..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, slow, and unabashedly melodramatic","review":"Let me start with the ending first. This part was a total unnecessarily drawn out, and over emotional part of the film. I agree with another reviewer, stop the film when the boy finally finds the blue fairy. That was his goal throughout the movie. There were few moments of joy in this robot's immortal life, all the pain the we are forced to witness just makes you emotionally numb at the end and checking your watch waiting for the ending (if you haven't turned the movie off already). It started promising enough, with a good concept, but Spielberg made it too hard to bond with the little creature that was nothing but an embodiment of pain and loneliness. The film is visually beautiful, but without a strong story, it is an overall disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Talent","review":"The outstanding performances by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law cannot save this appalling movie!

With a transitory plot (staying nowhere long enough to finish a story), obvious and predictable \\"tear-jerkers,\\" this movie strives for meaning and misses.

Well.....that's just about A.I. Spielberg proves what a mess he is capable of making of a poorly realised Stanley Kubrick project adapted from a feeble short story. I like Kubrick and Spielberg has made at least two great films. A.I. doesn't do justice to anyone or anything. All the above films were great and somehow brought freshness to old ideas. This film is a stale hotch-potch of all the above and hasn't an ounce of originality to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless Waste Of Two Hours","review":"I'm sorry, but this movie tops my list of time and money wasting movies. This was a movie that lacked that \\"certain something\\". Haley Joel Osment did a pretty good job, but that was about it. The plot was thin, and after a while you have no sympathy for any of the family members. It was so bad that I just had to walk out. I think that the best part of the movie was the little mechanical teddy bear that the boy toted around wherever he went. All in all I think that Steven Speilberg was trying to make a modern day ET, but it horribly backfired into a plain, boring, and flat out bad mish-mosh of lines simply composed. I love Steven Speilberg but this movie just fell terribly short of my expectations. Think twice before buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to write a review about this movie...","review":"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. I am a fan of both Kubrick and Spielberg.

I only gave it the one star and that was for Jude Law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunity Missed!","review":"The premise of the movie was good but after the first half it dissolved into unitelligible nonsense. Looks like the writer ran out of any ideas as to what to do with it at the end and dreamed his way into nothingness.

Was it a fairy tale? A dark twist on that genre? It alternated between polar opposites too drastically to be coherent, and managed to be boring all the while.Other elements came out of left field (\\"Then a thousand years go by and hyper-intelligent robots make everything all better!\\") interrupting what little narrative flow there was. I like to be surprised, not flabbergasted.Another Steven Spielberg film, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" is my favorite movie, and one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. The consensus is that Spielberg has decided to stop making crowd-pleasing films.Mission accomplished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really creepy and manipulative.","review":"This is a retelling of Pinnochio that has great special effects and disturbing emotions.

The movies affects were really cool and a neat glipse of the future, but for me, it was a bit dark and seems to constantly just keep sliding down adn down into a sadder state during the film. It is a story about a kid robot (the first robot that is able to Love) who is later discarded by his parents. So starts his journey to find a blue fairy (fairy tale) which he never finds, to become human. The ending is sort of cool, but the movie from starting out on a positive note, jst keeps sliding down and making you more depressed and upset over this robots plight. It is an ok rent, but I wouldn't buy it unloess you are inot sadder movies and or a Sci-Fi bone in you.

Artificial Intelligence is the story of a robot boy named David who loves his human mother so much that he wants to be turned into a human boy like Pinocchio. Both Haley Joel Osment (David) and Jude Law (Gigolo Joe) gave excellent performances. It's not their fault that the story was not worth the work that they put into their roles. The other character that I should mention was \\"Teddy\\" a robot bear who seemed smarter and more compassionate than the humans in the story. I thought that the so called \\"humans\\" were a miserable group who had lost their humanity.This movie was like a bad nightmare and I can hardly believe that Spielberg made this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Watch","review":"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.

Much of the film's imagery is beautiful, but the plot goes from fascinating to ludicrous rather abruptly (two-thirds of the way through). By the end the audience was laughing, what with the teddy bear that has miraculously saved a lock of the mother's hair and the valium-voiced aliens. And talk about Oedipal endings! Certainly an embarassment for all parties involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and evil film","review":"Given the title, I would guess that Kubrick's intention in starting this project was to introduce the film world to the metaphysical and ethical questions that life-appoximating machines would raise. The only philosophical question raised by Spielberg's product, however, is whether artificial intelligence might one day correct real stupidity. While I'm sure Teddy, the talking teddy-bear, was Kubrick's idea, (yeah right), I doubt Kubrick would have approved of the Chris Rock and Robin Williams cameos (which say it all). In my view this film is a cynical insult to movie fans. But as would be Ricky Martin finishing a Beethoven score, it's a triumph for false consciousness everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst movie.....ever","review":"It is difficult to describe the physical pain I experienced when watching this movie. Haly Joel Osment's constant whining completely ruins this film, the only thing worse than it are those ridiculous aliens at the end of the film. Do we really need a film about a robot wanting to be a \\"real little boy\\"? Didn't they already come out with Pinnochio ?

Technically flawless, but a perfect example of a Hollywood director/writer coming up with what seems like a promising idea, and then not knowing what to do with it. A wandering, meandering mess.

So I give this movie 5 stars. Way to go Spielberg!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have ended when...","review":"Too bad Spielberg felt the need to add a hokey 'Close Encounters' ending onto the film. The natural end point of the movie is when David realizes the nature of his existence and there is a beatiful and tragic moment. Then there are are at least 3 more endings which depart from the tragic storyline to create a more friendly 'hollywood' ending. The movie would have been more powerful without this ending that explains the motivations of David for those who were unable to grasp the similarities to Pinochio."},{"rating":"2","title":"People either love it or hate it.","review":"There aren't enough future technology morality movies made and this is a prime example of what we need more of.

Those cute pet type dogs in the picture aren't what's on this DVD. If you're looking for a show dog this might be an okay (and funny) DVD to watch.

I build furniture and needed an extension cord with multiple outlets. Perhaps I received a faulty one but there are so many flaws I can't believe they all happened to mine.Forget about running more than 1 item at a time or the breaker trips and you will have to push the reset button until your fingers are sore to get it to reset.The case broke the first time it fell on a soft wood floor from 30\\".Reeling in the cord you'll think there's a marlin on the other end.Cords don't stay in the outlet. The slightest pressure on the cord cause it to slip out of connection and you will need to go wiggle the cord to get it going again.All in all it is more work than plugging and unplugging from a standard extension cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"The Bayco 25-foot cord reel. Appears to work great. However, the black center on two of the reels that we have for our guild is broken. This makes it very difficult to reel up the cord.

This reel has a 25ft cord sure enough. But the shell is made from thin, brittle plastic. A very poor choie of material considering it has to hold a rather heavy cord. One or two small events and the outer case will be cracked and worthless. And then I will by another, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked old Passport","review":"...you will be pleased with how consistent Doldinger remains. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was to leave some headroom for my all-time greatest albums. Relative to the '90s, however, and to most post-'70s fusion music, this is easily a top contender. Contemporary sounding but without that \\"smooth jazz\\" blandness you find on commercial radio, \\"Paradise\\" has inspired me to go out and buy all the old Passport records I can find. Amazingly, more than 20 years into his project, Doldinger manages to stay fresh and interesting without abandoning the sound and style that made Passport great in the 1970s. And from someone who thinks that most contemporary jazz went downhill starting around 1979, believe me, that's saying a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Dale Brown book and I liked it!","review":"I am not a big novel reader, but while at Wal-Mart I picked this one up because I wanted a change from my normal history books I read. I thought the book was well written and I really enjoyed it. Sometimes it was a confusing read with all the military jargon, but none the less I liked the story. Like some of the other reviewers it seemed like it would never happen in real life, but this is fiction so it is supposed to be far fetched. I will pick up more Dale Brown books because of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low brow thriller","review":"I give this book 2 stars because there is a good story there just trying to get out. The basic political premise is a good beginning but as many other reviewers have pointed out the book has many problems, arcane military terms, detailed descriptions of things we suspect Brown is desperate to want us to understand and ridiculous furturistic weapons that are just impossible (a woman wearing an power assisted exoskeleton shoots down a hypersonic missile with a computer controlled rail gun which fires a bolt that in flight is molten but somehow is guided). Somehow the airforce has taken over the role of the marines and army.The characters are superficial and not believable at all. The soldiers and low ranking officers are all highly skilled and work extremely well together. On the other hand the generals are incompetent and hate each other.Brown writes books the way an army drill sergeant would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Gee-Whiz, Not Enough Story","review":"I read a lot of military/techno thrillers in the Tom Clancy vein, so I was excited to pick up this book. I was barely able to get through it. I like \\"tech\\" as much as the next guy, but in this book Dale Brown seems to pile the technical details of weapons systems, satellites, and aircraft (and futuristic toys) on top of each other just to demonstrate how smart he is. The details frequently do little to advance the story.I found the characters to be without nuance. The \\"good guy\\" is always right, the \\"bad\\" guy is always wrong. Brown's depiction of how senior military officers behave towards one another is, in my view, far fetched. These are Generals, not boot camp trainees.All in all, a clever premise for a major military conflict that left me unsatisfied in the telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to force myself to finish this book","review":"One of the first books I fell in love with a few years back was \\"Day of the Cheetah\\". I was riveted and couldn't put it down.I was so disappointed in \\"Plan of Action\\". I wont bother re-iterating all the flaws in this book as many have already done so here, however I will say that I had to force myself to finish it.I found the \\"plot\\" unbelievable, got bored of the techno-babble after the first page, and desperatly wanted to court-marshall \\"Muck\\" myself. When the hero is a pompous ass, how can you enjoy a book.I am a fan of Dale Brown's early work, but this novel was as cardboard as the cover it was bound in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Techno-Drivel","review":"I'm used to being disappointed by authors that I'm not familiar with, but this one is a real shock. It's incredibly bad. I'm not a literary snob - I've read and enjoyed most of Tom Clancy's books. But really, someone who pretends to be a writer of novels should at least try to write something that has the basics - like plot, characters, and intelligible writing. It appears that Dale Brown has written quite a few of these books, and some people have actually read them. What a waste of time and trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patrick McLanahan saga is so predictable","review":"This is the second Dan Brown's book I have read. The first one is Fatal Terain, telling US conflict with China. The story line is so predictable. I kind of enjoy the military technology stuff, but honestly speaking it is a bit too long winded and it does not enhance the storyline. Dale Brown & Michael Creighton are much better writer who are able to infuse tech stuff seamlessly into the storyline and create a great suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear God, this man should not be allowed to write again","review":"I can't actually quote the final line in this book, because I'd begin hurling -- but it goes something like: \\"His hand touched hers on the controls of their Vampire bomber.\\"This garbage is like a Harlequin romance for military wannabes.Please stop, Mr. Brown.

Unfortunatly, there is no naration and very little information as to where the video was shot. Some maps would have been nice. I was going to give this one star, but since it did show Lake Tahoe, which my wife and I adore, we gave it two stars. Mainly because of the scenery. Otherwise, this was a waste time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry acoustic diminishes these recordings","review":"Unfortuntately, this recording is an example of 1960s sound engineering at its worst. The instruments are miked so closely and the sound is so bone-dry that the performances can scarcely be enjoyed. It's as if the quartet is sitting in a small room with those noise-reduction panels lining the walls, ceiling and floor.I recommend listeners look elsewhere -- there are plenty of recordings to choose from for these great pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlet Pimpernel - Original Broadway Cast","review":"Buy this for Terrence Mann's performances alone. His rendition of Falcon in a Dive is filled with passion and power. Where's the girl is also truly wonderful. Douglas Sills and Christina Andreas are both perfectly casted and their voices are beautiful in their respective songs. The ensemble pieces are great too. But for me, I can't get enough of Terrence Mann's baritone voice and wish he had even more to sing.Overall, this is a wonderfully composed and scripted musical and we should hear it more than we currently do. This cast is just perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any fan","review":"Any moderate fan of The Scarlett Pimpernel, musical, book or movie(s) should own this cd. I absolutely love the songs \\"Believe\\" and \\"Vivez\\" which are not on the Encore cd, and this disk is worth owning for them alone. I'm not crazy about Chauvlin's voice on this disk, which is a bit pinched and his phrasing is awkward at times. For great Chauvlin tracks (like Where's the Girl) you definatly need to buy the Encore cd. Christine Andreas's renditions of \\"Only Love\\" and \\"You Are My Home\\" are also more dramatic and truely broadway versions on this disk whereas on the Encore disk these are pop-versions sung by people who were not in the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel: A MUST HAVE for any Music Lover!!","review":"One of the Best Musicals I've ever heard. There are 3 versions of this musical on Amazon.com and I recommend you buy each one. They are similar but at the same time, different. Frank Wildhorn has my vote for the most talented writer to grace us in a long while. He's in a class by himself. This musical along with The Civil War and Jekyl and Hyde are my favorites and must have's for your own personal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is an excellent soundtrack and an amazing show, but it does kind of lose you if you have not seen it. I am not suggesting that you not get it, but I am suggesting that you see it also, and then it'll make a little more sense. But, the voices are wonderful (almost as good as the present broadway cast), the music is touching and funny, and it is VERY creative. And who doesn't like \\"The Riddle\\" (track 14)?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible","review":"I bought the Concept Cast Album many years ago and fell in love with the music. Unfortunately my CD was broken and I decided to take a try on this recording. Andreas completely ruined it with her terrible vibrato and ridiculous accent.

He will slap you repeatedly with it until you promise him you'll go see a voice teacher. A GOOD voice teacher.Also...this show just blows in general even though it's definately one of Wildhorn's better shows. I hope the revised version is better, because this one couldn't be any worse. Thank god Douglas Sills is in it, because after listening to Christine Andreas' voice for that long, it is refreshing to hear somebody who can actually create an acceptable form of resonance.This show needs tons of work, but the potential is still there.Start here: Get a new book writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of the dialog is here","review":"This only has the songs. I had hoped to get the funny dialog with the soundtrack but it only had the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words can not describe how good this is","review":"Listening to this CD was what got me into Broadway music. It's WONDERFUL! All of the songs are wonderfully sung, and are very diverse. There are some heartwrenching songs as well as some downright hilarious ones. \\"Where's the Girl\\" and \\"Who is the Scarlet Pimpernell\\" are perhaps my favorites, but you can't really pick a favorite out of this wonderful collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT SONG AND VOICES","review":"The most underrated musical of the season.

All the songs are either poor ballads or numbers that try to be fun but fails. All the lyrics are bad. As is the plot, which is a weird twist on the original strory.If you want French revolution, buy La Revolution Francaise; if you want romance with a stench of blood, choose Sweeney Todd or even The Phantom Of The Opera.Allthough it tries to be, this is neither Les Mis nor POTO, just a cheap attempt to get om a stage and sell singles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"As momma used to say:You can dress a pig up in beautiful clothes, but it does not make her a lady.(I've given it one star, because there is no option for zero stars)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully entertaining","review":"I escorted seven teenage girls from a small town in Mississippi to New York for the first time, and they were blown away by The Scarlet Pimpernel.

Need I say more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally fantastic","review":"Christine Andreas will amaze you. Her loft and passion is absolutly unsurpassed.

You will find yourself listening again and again!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly unforgettable and stirring musical","review":"Just the other day, I saw the Pimpernel for the first time on Bway, and I was totally blown away. This has to be one of my top 5 fave musicals of all time. This is a great recording, and all the performances are wonderful; HOWEVER, I really feel that A NEW BROADWAY CAST RECORDING SHOULD BE RELEASED! Doug Sills, Rex Smith, and Rachel York are all absolutely sublime! And the 'new' version of the Pimpernel seems to be even better than the first, in my opinion. So, buy this recording and GO GET YOUR TICKETS TO THE SHOW! YOU'LL THANK ME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best play I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this play and the music!! The music is so unique . Douglas Sills, Christine Andreas, and Terrance Mann are magnificent! I recommend this CD and to see the Broadway play. It takes you on an adventure you won't forget!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the \\"Concept\\" recording","review":"This recording has two faults. It is missing two of the best songs, and it is missing a leading lady. Let me set one thing straight, Linda Eder's (Concept recording) singing puts Christine Andreas' voice to shame. Ms. Andreas must have gotten the part because she is a good actress. A diva she is not! Her \\"crooning\\" lacks the power, control, and beauty that Ms. Eder's voice exudes. I suffered through Ms. Andreas' performance on \\"When I look at you\\" just hoping she would sing her way into the number. The singing was flat and powerless.I will never understand why the Broadway version has taken out the two best numbers (\\"I'll forget you\\" and \\"Now When the Rain Falls\\") Maybe, they were not suited very well for the stage.Don't let this review stop you from seeing the show! However, if you want a recording, buy the earlier one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful!","review":"When I hear the song 'Only Love' on Linda Eder's 'It's Time', I wanted to hear the soundtrack. When I read the book, I HAD to hear it. I can in all honesty say that it equals and/or surpases anything I've ever heard before. 'Madame Guillotine' and 'Falcon in the Dive' and 'Into the Fire' excited me. 'Believe', 'When I Look at You', 'Only Love', 'She Was Here', 'Lulluby', and 'You Are My Home' made me cry. 'The Scarlett Pimpernel', 'The Creation of Man', and 'They Seek Him Here' made me laugh. 'Vivez!' and 'Storybook' made me dance, and 'Where's the Girl?' seduced me with it's magic. There is only one thing to be said for this music; Beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christine Andreas, Terrence Mann and an underrated score","review":"THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL made history as the first Broadway musical to be re-tooled and re-cast during its run, following scathing reviews and waning box-office. This album features the original Broadway cast, headed by the lovely Christine Andreas.Frank Wildhorn's score contains a veritable treasure-trove of delights including \\"Where's the Girl?\\", \\"The Creation of Man\\", \\"The Riddle\\", \\"You Are My Home\\", \\"When I Look at You\\" and \\"Only Love\\". \\"Storybook\\" looks set to remain a constant in the repertoire of every self-respecting cabaret singer.The cast includes Terrence Mann (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST), Douglas Sills (LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) and Christine Andreas (OKLAHOMA!). THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL is a fine musical and is worthy of a production that will do full justice to its sparkling score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrence Mann & Co.","review":"I would change my name to Maguerite if it meant that Terrence Mann would sing me Where's the Girl. This is an amazing show, and the cast definitely does its music justice on this album. The entire thing is an excellent balance of humor and drama. Having heard other versions (namely, the Encore!), I still recommend this one. And Terry, if you're reading this, look me up. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pimpernel Forever!","review":"An amazing musical re telling of a beautiful story, stunning music and lyrics that bring it to life. Wheather you're a fan of the musicals or not, you'll love this. When I first listened to this soundtrack, it seriously blew me away. Douglas Sills is the ultimate Percy and the rest of the cast wowed me too. I was worried at first that the accents wouldn't be right, but the English charachters sounded English rather than American and Christine Andreas was so deliciously French, Hallelujah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this musical had it all","review":"Hello i just saw this musical this weekend and it was one of the best musical i ever saw. it had everything: good singing, good acting and the comedy was even good. so now i'm gonna buy the cd.

I rated this 5 stars, but really I'm just rating this song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two out of three leads make this musical fantastic","review":"Douglas Sills and Terrance Mann are impeccable in their character creation and vocal talent. They cause the soul to stir and the heart to laugh. I could listen to these two gentlemen sing 24 hours straight...and then some.Regrettably, Christine Andreas is less than spectacular. There may be some who enjoy vibrato in excess, but to me it sounded like she was suffering from eternal stage fright, lacking in breath support. I can only stand to listen to \\"When I look at you\\" because of the music and the words... Andreas is tolerated, not enjoyed.For those who are in love with Les Miserables, you'll find a similar tone and tempo to the songs. And if you ever feel heart sore, listen to \\"Prayer\\" for empathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and fun","review":"We have seen this musical in New York (new version) and Dallas.

This book is absolutely horrible at addressing UI design. Half of the book is C code for GTK applications that could have been made available on a companion disk or on the website. And most of Stucky's explanation of things comes in the form of very brief comments embedded within the code. Lots of typos. Lots of butchered examples. No general GUI concepts covered. No coverage of multithreading issues. You're basically getting three non-real-world examples' code bound in a book and hardly any coverage of general user interface design concepts and ideologies.

Unfortunately, Routledge has priced the book staggeringly high. No scholar with just a casual interest in the field and without very deep pockets could afford it. Consult it in the library--if you can get your library to buy it. The only flaw I find with _The Uralic Languages_ is the lack of a chart setting out the traditional Uralicists' phonetic transcription system. Knowledge of this system is indispensable for reading older Uralic scholarship, and a survey like this would have been a good place to include it."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the funniest jokes I have ever read.","review":"Everybody needs a good laugh once in awhile. \\"The Dirty Joke Book\\" Volume 1 - Pig Laffs contains the funniest jokes I have ever read.

This is not a book for kids! Actually I would never read it myself! I warn you parents, the eyes are a lamp to the soul. Steer clear of books like this! Pay attention to the books your kids bring home from school and the library.There is amazing fiction authors out there who write with a light heart, my favorite is Neal Shusterman- Everlost and Downsiders are great age appropriate books, C.S.

This is a mid-line reissue of what was originally a full-price CD (strangely still available) featuring the Cello Concertos of Dutilleux and Lutoslawski, conducted by Serge Baudo and Witold Lutoslawski himself, both leading the Orchestre de Paris. Both Concertos were completed and premiered in 1970, recorded here in 1974 and written specifically for Rostropovich. These are without a doubt the definitive performances of these works, and while they will prove hard to listen to for some, will be thoroughly enjoyable to those willing to give themselves over to this powerful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for nothing more than a dvd & thin plastic mat","review":"This is not quite what I was expecting - I'm not sure why they even have the mat, since it contributes nothing and the moves on the dvd have nothing to do with the mat.

I read the whole book and was still waiting for the information that would let me know that our pets are in spirit and wait for us in heaven. I felt that Mr. Kurz continually appologized through the whole book every time he mentioned a more spiritual way to look at this subject. For example he brought up some Eastern philosophy, but appoloqized that he didn't really believe in it, and the idea that our animals can really talk to us through mental and emotional feelings. And because he is a bible study teacher, he continually appologized to everyone that he would mention something that would not be directly explained in the bible. It made me think he was not too confident in anything he wrote in the book to begin with. There are many books available that are written by animal communicators, and other spiritual people that definitely give you more hope and understanding on this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love our animals and want them in heaven with us.","review":"What a great point by the author in that we all love our animals and want them in heaven with us.

It helps connect you with a new client and helps when former clients lose a love one. I refer to it all the time now that I have the reference from this book. It is what helps comfort those in need of a very painful time in their life.The book is total confirmation that our pets will be in Heaven waiting for us. Having this information is a great healing gift for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solace for those who are hurting","review":"The loss of a beloved pet can be a very difficult experience, and this book provides solace for those in the midst of grief. It's particularly difficult for pet-lovers because non-pet-owners just don't understand the love that grows between us and our companion animals. Thanks for a lovely book.--by the author ofWe Thank You, God, for These: Blessings and Prayers for Family Pets"},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt that Rusty is in heaven","review":"I ordered Gary's book the day my little Rusty passed on and there was no consolation because his passing just seemed so final. Cold Noses erased all doubt from my mind and I was assured that he was now in heaven and waiting for me. Gary gave me so much hope and did that with proof from the Bible and about God's plans for his animals and it all made perfect sense. Anyone who believes in heaven, will find great comfort in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Helpful Read","review":"My wife and I recently lost our beloved cat of 13 years. After hearing stories that animals, specifically pets, do not goto Heaven it brough a lot of confusion and anger to us both. This book really put things into perspective. The author writes clearly, however not 5 stars because at times he rambles on and on. Get to the point! Overall it was a good book and really made us both feel better about animal existance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author argues creationism but knows nothing about evolution.","review":"I picked this book up thinking it would be something that I, a total pet lover, would enjoy. I'm glad I scanned some pages, I could not get past his insistence on creationism, his (as another reviewer said) passive aggressive attacks on people who do not believe it, i.e. \\"papa Darwin\\", and lastly one sentence about evolution stating that it contains the words \\"should\\", \\"may\\", \\"could\\". He also states he has studied the theory extensively, and in the next sentence says that it promotes survival of the strongest. This shows me he has studied nothing, and brings the baggage of creationism to the table. \\"Survival of the fittest\\" does not by any means mean \\"strongest\\", it means the most adaptable (i.e. the most fit to survive in a particular environment). His intentions may be good, but he's totally off the mark in proving his point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for very religious pet owners not for the grieving.....","review":"Unfortunately this book was not for me. The author spoke more of Gods \\"word\\" than of the grieving pain I'm feeling for the loss of my beloved \\"Mariah\\" (beagle). He spoke more of scriptures in the Bible, which don't get me wrong are wonderful but I didn't see how his interpetations of the bible were helping me to get through my pain. At the end he speaks about loving your pet and taking care of them......Why does that matter? My dog is now gone. I guess I was hoping that I would read more about grief, and the presence of my dogs spirit and knowing that I would see her again. Unfortuantely, I didn't \\"feel\\" any of that from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"I actually found this book in my bookshelf several days after my beloved little dachshund died. I don't remember buying it, but there it was! Anyway, I was terribly disappointed in it for most of the reasons that have already been cited in other reviews.My main complaint is that he effectively dashes the hopes of readers who are not Christians by stating that while God created us and loves all humans and all creatures, only those who accept Jesus Christ as their savior will see their pets in the afterlife. To my way of thinking, If God loves all the creatures He created (as stated in the book and the Bible), He will accept all His creatures into Heaven. To say that God will only accept Christians into Heaven is an insult not only to the billions who are not Christians but, in my opinion, to God Himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"This book is nothing more than a preachy, highly insensitive and seemingly never-ending rambling-on by some self-righteous know-it-all blowhard. Clearly, the book is intended only for people of the Christian faith, and being agnostic I found it to be a load of rubbish. Get \\"Animals and the Afterlife\\", by Kim Sheridan instead. It's a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have been in so much pain over the loss of my pet, that when I received this book I couldn't wait to get started reading. I was so disappointed. I might as well picked up the bible. Gary Kurz didn't tell me anything I hadn't heard at Sunday school. I needed comfort not a lesson in religion. I am hoping the other books I have ordered will be of more help. If you were looking for comfort from the loss of your beloved pet don't bother to get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I had recently lost a cherished pet and this book had recommended. It did very little to comfort.Although I found some comfort in author's belief that our pets may be in heaven waiting on us, there was far too much rambling to get much else from the book. This is not a book I would recommend to a grieving friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't answer the right question.","review":"I struggled halfway through the book hoping the author would eventually give the \\"hope\\" as stated in the sub-title, which at this point he did not. As another reviewer stated: I should have checked other reviews before I bought the book. It's not worth the money or the time to finish it. There are so many other books out there, but I kept reaching for the one which would give me comfort after my dear companion died last week. I'll quit looking and find my comfort within my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed - expected much more than I received","review":"This book was quite a disappointment to me. I have had many pets over the years, grieved for each one I lost as if it were a person because to me it was. I, too, am a Christian, as is the author, and had already found the references he gives in the Bible. I just expected so much more comfort than I received. The author just seems to ramble on and on and doesn't quite get to the point that I needed to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time and money","review":"I bought this book looking to reinforce my belief that my beloved dog that I just lost is waiting for me in heaven. I was hoping for inspiration from the scriptures. What I got was illogical ramblings. The author spent more time apologizing for what he was about to write, than writing anything of substance. He wrote about how he further explained some of his ideas in another book he wrote. Big deal! I bought this book, not your other one. If you are looking for logical support from the scriptures, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates","review":"The intentions behind this book were honest and sincere. He seems to be a very caring person. However, he spent a lot of time rambling on about things that related only to him and sometimes got way off course! He also spent a lot of time apologizing for his views before he even gave them. He needs to study the difference between the words \\"then\\" and \\"than\\"! Got those mixed up a few times! If he got an editor, a publisher and an illustrator, I think he could have a best seller on his hands! Also, constant references to answering the scriptural questions in his next book was distracting as I felt this book was supposed to answer those questions. I was looking for scriptural \\"proof\\" and instead got a lot of rambling on, apologizing, and was pushed towards buying his next book \\"if I really wanted the answers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This book was a waste of time and money. There was no meat, no substance, no evidence of any kind. It was all about this mans religious beliefs and hopes for the animals. I didn't buy this book to read about his beliefs or hopes or feelings. I didn't even recycle it. I simply threw it out when finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comforting Rather than Convincing","review":"I should begin by saying that my viewpoints and worldview tend to be more liberal than this author's. For example, I do not believe in the Creationist's viewpoint literally or believe that the Bible is word for word the word of God, although I do accept its basic message and teachings. With that said, I do think the author genuinely loves animals, and I thoroughly enjoyed his anecdotes and stories, as well as his down to earth writing style. Everything he says is meant to comfort and reassure, and the overall message is one of compassion. Those who do have a more fundamentalist bent may find the \\"Bible evidence\\" convincing, but I was more comforted by the author's conviction than convinced by the \\"evidence.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"getting over the loss of your best friend","review":"I thought that this book was very good. The author is very knowledgeable and the things that he says makes sense. I would encourage anyone who has lost a beloved pet to definitely read this book. It's helping me to cope with my loss"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I bought this book along with \\"Goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a Pet\\" by Gary Kowalski after my 13-year-old English Setter died. It was extremely helpful in my dealing with the loss... Much more so than the other book. I even emailed the author and got a reply back very quickly! Overall, I thought it was good enough to hold onto for the future(I have more dogs), whereas I donated the book by Gary Kowalski to my local library. I figured maybe the other book could help someone else out, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendously Helpful Theological Book on Pet Grief","review":"I THOROUGHLY enjoyed this book. I bought it the week we had to put our 14 year old Vizsla to sleep. I struggled when she went with the questions \\"where is she?\\" \\"Will the Lord take care of her?\\" \\"What about the critics that say that animals don't have an eternal soul?\\"The author says he struggled with the same questions, which led to the writing of this book. In all of his research of scripture, he became convinced and comforted to know that his precious pets do have an eternal soul and will be taken care of by the Lord in heaven. I loved his research style and I thought his arguments were solid. There were several arguments that prove that indeed animals do have eternal souls. I am seeing life for both animals and humans differently now.The comfort this book brought to me was tremendously real and helpful in the midst of my grief. I am going to purchase this book for several of my friends. I wish I had read it before our sweet girl passed away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"This book is beautifully written and was the only thing that got me through the most difficult time of my life. Gary Kurtz's comforting words and explanations of how and why our pets go to heaven were the answer to my prayers. He lays everything out in simple terms to prove his points. But he also includes the most heartwarming stories of pets and their relationships with people as well. This author is the most perceptive I've ever read- he understands exactly what his readers need, especially since he, himself, has gone through the same agony, and gives them great hope and optimism at the time they need it the most. I would absolutely recommend this as the first thing to reach for when anyone undergoes the loss of a beloved pet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"My boyfriend and I lost both of our dogs a few months ago, each within 3 weeks of each other. I've needed something to help with my mourning because it was overtaking my life and I didn't want to go to counseling. I attempted to buy a few books based on ratings to help in this and they have helped me a lot. This book was nice in it's personal stories. It relates a lot to Bible passages which is nice even though at times it gets a little repetitive. Multiple times within the book the author says how he's not trying to convert anyone and tries not to put his opinion in but does anyway. I didn't mind it at first but the constant reminding made me start to skim instead of actually read the book. However, it's nice to know that those who know more about scripture and it's meaning can decipher that animals do go to heaven and they will be awaiting us. Very comforting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not what I thought it would be.","review":"Before I bought this book, I used this \\"preview\\" feature to see sample pages from the book. The sample that I saw was a heartwarming story of someone's experience with their pet. I mistakenly thought that this book would be filled with these little stories of personal experience, of situations that seemed out of the ordinary and hard to explain, causing us to believe that there are forces beyond our understanding at work. The book was NOT a compilation of stories, as I had hoped, but that is my fault for not reading through the description carefully. I just wanted to write this in case someone else uses the preview and makes the same assumption that I did! It still offered a comforting message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do they?","review":"Book deals with the question: do animals go to heaven? The author makes a pretty convincing case - quoting many Bible scriptures, both old and new testament. Helped me when I lost my beloved Sasha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comforting at all","review":"My mother gave me this book after the loss of my very special dog. I began reading the book, looking for a comforting story and instead I found the author using the book as a means to spread his own religious beliefs and explaining why anyone who doesn't agree with him is wrong. Rather than find comfort, or smiles, I found myself annoyed at the author's arrogance about his inside knowledge of God and Heaven. I'll look for a better book. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious. Heaven afterlife.","review":"This book is about the loss of pets and afterlife. If you are religious, you may find comfort in the book. If you think our pets will meet with us in heaven, you may like the book. I couldn't read all of it. I cried too much and the book went into the bookshelf. I found more solace in Gary Kowalski's \\"Goodbye, Friend\\". I get that book out for relief more than any other. In Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates, the writer Gary Kurz states that God knew what he wanted to do in regard to creation, had the power to bring His plan to pass, created a perfect environment, created man in a perfect state of spirit, mind and body, created perfect animals to share perfect mankind's perfect domain, and intended for this perfect situation to continue forever without death for either human or animal. (pg. 32). What happened to that perfect world?Too much on religion and too little on loss. I'll let you draw your own conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Again","review":"I ordered this book last year after I lost a beloved dog. The title attracted me. Unforunately, the title is all that I enjoyed. I found the book boring and one particular story, upsetting. Instead I would recommend \\"Will I See Fido in Heaven,\\" and \\"Angel Pawprints,\\" a wonderful book with poems, and writings that date back a century."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comfort at all....","review":"I thought that this book would be inspiring but instead I am left with the biggest headache I have ever had. His disection of all things and all part of religion, spirit, souls, creation, evolution were just exhuasting. I felt like I was back in college reading a dissertation on life and religion!!! This is NOT a book that will help guide you through your grief, it will not bring you comfort or teach you how to cope it will instead cram theories into your brain to make you feel that through all of this research that has been done by Kurz via the bible that your animal is in heaven. Look.....either you believe your animal is in heaven right now or your don't. You don't need to read this 300 page theory overload to find that answer. For me I already know my beloved dog is in heaven, no need to read this book to convince me of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill after the title","review":"If you believe every word in the Bible is gospel, don't mind improper sentence structure and lousy grammar, and are willing to pay to read someone's circuitous ramblings, this book is for you.The title is wonderful. If only the author had stopped there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to read..","review":"I normally don't like to write a review of any books I read, because my likes and yours will most likely be diffrent. But this book is special. If ever you lost a pet you surely have felt bad or you never would have had the pet in the first place.. Gary makes you feel that comfort of knowing that you will indeed see your pet again. Just as you know you will see a grandparent, child, or any loved one who has left us. I found the reading quite easy to read. The section on where Gary writes about his own pets, brings back memories of my pets..and after all that is what we cherish the most, the sweet memories. Thank you Gary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I would highly recommend this book. I found the author to be geniune, caring, thoughtful and well researched. For anyone who has lost or pet, or for pet lovers in general, it is well worth your time to read this book. The other great thing about this book is that the author cares so much about his readers and what they are going through, he gives an email address where you can contact him. I emailed him, and had a response back from the author within 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book--Very comforting! Highly recommended","review":"When I had to put my dog down due to Cancer, I was so depressed, and a friend told me about this book, I thank God that I got this book, If I could sum it up in 3 words..VERY WELL WRITTEN! Gary uses Bible references in the book, even if you are not religious I would sill recommend this book, Its such a comfort after losing a pet! Gary is a wonderful man, he even emailed me a couple times to see how I was doing! I really recommend this book to anyone who Loves animals, and who may have a hole in your heart after saying good bye to a pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book that I might receive some comfort for the loss of my precious pet and some assurance for afterlife for my present cat someday. I received neither of these as the author rambles on and on about nothing most of the time, cites only a few scriptures in which he doesn't have much opinion on, and leaves me with no hope for animal afterlife. I've read a few other books on the subject and the best one I've found is \\"There Is Eternal Life For Animals\\" by Niki Behrikis Shanahan. This book details scores of Bible Scriptures that show how much God loves ALL of His creation and proves from these Scriptures that they WILL be in heaven. Most people want proof from the Bible rather than some person's opinion on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Having lost several dear pets, and knowing the pain, I was intrigued by the title \\"Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates\\", and felt that having been written by a minister and long-time student of the Bible, it should be a good bet. I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in the writing style (or lack of it). It was more of a rambling through only a VERY FEW legitimate points. Only 3-4 references to actual scripture concerning animals in the entire book, and lame interpretations of these at that. MOST paragraphs were apologies for what he was going to write about next, or what he just got done writing about. There was at least one entire page where ONLY apologies for the past or next idea were presented! How can a book addressing the possiblity of life after death for animals contain self-referencing \\"I\\" in so many paragraphs!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"author should stick to non-controversial topics","review":"I was initially very excited to see the title of this book and the subject matter. I was very disappointed, however, to find that the author decided to address the topic of evolution as part of his justification for his ideas. There was no reason to insert this controversial topic into this book. After reading the author's opinion on evolution, which I disagree with, I was totally turned off and could go no further in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware -- for Christians Only","review":"I bought this book because I was devasted by the loss of my cat, and was hoping for comfort. What I got was the opposite -- a preachy religious book obviously for Christians only (of which I'm not). I could have dismissed it as a helpful book for those with the same beliefs, but one part of the book extremely distressed me. The author claims that all pets go to heaven, but if you are not Christian -- you won't go to heaven and therefore you'll never see your pets again.Now thankfully, I'm strong enough to see this for what it is. But it was extremely upsetting to see that in a book that people are buying because they are desperately looking for comfort. To tell non-Christians that they'll never see their pets again when they are already devasted is insensitive and cruel.If you share the authors religious beliefs, you will probably find comfort in this book. If not, you'd probably be best to avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great a consolation!","review":"Mr. Kurz's book really got me over a rough time when my Spike passed on at almost 20 years of age. A friend recommended his website to me and after recognizing his empathy, I ordered his book. I was unable to sleep, could not think of anything else and although I read the first 70 pages through my tears, I can only say that one more time God sent what I needed into my life.

The Grit Guard insert's surface will eliminate contaminants from wash mitts and put the deposits at the bottom of the bucket. The X-style/grate design of the Grit Guard then keeps the dirty water from sloshing around, mixing with your clean water.

By the 6th day, all 4 young healthy cats were sick. I stopped feeding this and went back to Iams. All were better overnight. This has happened to my cats before with \\"generic\\" brand foods.

Up until the point I bought this, she'd eaten Whiskas, Friskies, Meow Mix, & all the rest.At first, she ate the food. But as time went on, she began eating less & less of it & subsequently was not using her litter box as much. Very worrying. So I mixed in some new cat food from the supermarket. She gorged herself, got sick, & after making her wait until her stomach had settled a little before I put her dish back down, all she would eat was the supermarket food. If she got a mouthful of this cat food, she'd spit it out & eat ONLY the supermarket food. This went on until recently, when I gave up & dumped out the remainder of this bag & switched back to her favorites.Now she's happy, & that's all that counts, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"He loves it","review":"My mother's oldest cat had a hard time eating and basically refuses all foods, except for this one.

Season 7 is the worst by far, and this trend started in Season 6. One minute you are in an intense scene, then you have missed a major portion of what has led us to another scenario. The voices seem out of sync with the characters apeaking.We will of course purchase the remainder of the seasons just to complete what we have started, but the negative reviews of the quality I can now no longer disagree with.

Except for the episode \\"Divorce, Walnut Grove Style\\" and when Laura announces she is pregnant, the series took a serious nose dive this season and NEVER recovered. What was Michael Landon thinking with the 2 part episode \\"Sylvia\\" which involved child rape!!! It is a scary and violent episode that is NOT AT ALL appropriate for children. Then we get introduced to stupid James and Cassandra whom absolutely ruined the series with their terrible acting and even dumber story lines which always seemed to involve them running away from something.

I must state that this is a great collection of guitar music that few others will be able to duplicate any time soon! Bream has been criticized for a technique that is some-what sloppy and values interpretaion over perfection. I do not hear that anywhere in this recording! Take for example the Bach fugue in A minor! This track is without a doubt the best classical guitar that I think I have ever heard. There are only a hand full of artists that will even acheive this level of performance skill.This is a collection of guitar pieces form one of the greatest periods in Western music. A true \\"Must Have\\" for the lover of classical and guitar music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Listening to this CD has taught me how powerful the classical guitar is as an instrument of human expression.Thank you, Julian, for enlightening me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away...","review":"I cannot agree more with all the positive reviews of this disc. I am a baroque nut and a huge admirer of classical guitar music, and this disc combines the two in splendid fashion. Julian Bream's playing is astounding, especially on the Sor minuet and also the lesser known pieces (to me) by Weiss. Overall, the selection of music on this compilation is great.There is a fair amount of background hiss, as can be expected in an analog recording from the 60's, but the musical quality and interpretation Mr Bream lends to the music here would make any amount of background noise worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bream does a superlative job","review":"Bream was one of the best guitarists in the history of the instrument (was, since he retired a few years back). This may sound extreme, but nearly all his recordings bear witness to this. In addition to impeccable technique and musicianship, he shows a control of color and shading second to none. He is somewhat less romantic than Segovia, but his range of expression is just as varied. In some later recordings, Bream sounds as if he chooses beauty of sound at the expense of using slightly deliberate pacing, but in all earlier outings (like this one), he combines tonal beauty with perfectly chosen tempos (or tempi if you prefer), a great sense of enjoyment, even of fun when appropriate. Bream always reveals something remarkable in the music that goes beyond nearly all other players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olu is a great all-around musician.","review":"Olu Dara has made a name for himself in the jazz underground and with his first CD. I was a little disappointed that he didn't play more trumpet, because he is such a great trumpet player. He did mostly singing. He is a good singer, but his trumpet playing is really excellent. But, there are some great tracks like \\"Harlem Country Girl\\", \\"Jungle Jay\\"(featuring Olu's son, rapper Nas), \\"Natchez Shopping Blues\\", and \\"Rain Shower\\", although the small amount of trumpet playing lowers that rating to four stars. Very good Olu Dara debut. If he makes another one, you'll have to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"like father like son","review":"Im fairly young, so I grew up listening to Nas(olu Dara's son).

I purchased the CD when it was originally released several months ago, and have listened to it many times. Watching Brian and his spectacular Band, which Brian has molded together over the past 15 years, play each track to perfection, is a experience we rarely get to enjoy in todays musical climate. As a bonus, one of the extras on this DVD is another high quality recording of Brian and his band performing several live tracks including a few Beach Boys numbers.

It is good to know that one of the most influential song writers in the history of rock and roll (or any other medium) continues to make music that can move you!

And judging how good \\"Arriving\\" was, Chris Tomlin has proven that he is the real deal. He has a great voice, great song structure, and you will always find a bible-centered message.

More disturbing, why don't any of these starlets recognize Sydney, the head of a major studio, at restaurants or bars? I just didn't sympathize with Heyward, the protagonist, at all. I thought he was a complete loser and struggling to come to grips with being a homosexual. (A 'colorist'??) He is a \\"struggling\\" writer yet spends the better part of a week doing nothing but planning a party and then, thinking the party is a flop, is ready to plunk down $1,000 for a plane ticket to N.Y. to run away?

Maybe it hits too close to home for Angelenos who (I have found) overestimate their cultural and intellectual significance. As well as being completely full of themselves.I read this book long before I came out to Los Angeles, and would like to read it again now that I have been here a few years. Back in a rural area of the East Coast, I thought it was a hilarious book that I could not put down. It is one of those books you are disappointed to have end. Sadly, some (a lot) of the book is true of the Hollywood scene.Ok, so it's not some grand philosophical treatise, but it is a very witty and sharp view of Hollywood. I have read other Felske books, and they do not compare to clever writing of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hip For Its Own Good","review":"This book thinks it's oh-so-clever, filled with so many \\"unique\\" references to Hollywood in- and outsiders and wannabes. In essence, not much happens in it. It's about a screenwriter trying to make it in Hollywood, yet every time something writing-related happens, the narrator tells us he's not going to dwell on that because it's boring. Instead, we must endure countless scenes of him doing what becomes his primary job: pimping for a successful studio executive by throwing his unsuspecting female friends at him. Nice guy, this screenwriter.

It's also filled with interesting vignettes from movie set. The book roughly parallels the movie in that its chapters work backwards toward the source material, Nolan's brother's shortstory Memento Mori. However, its primary focus is on the construction of the movie itself, and how the disparate elements (acting, direction, writing, sound, music) came together to form the first truly great film of the 21st century. Mottram's writing style is clean, focused, and never overwraught. He doesn't make the mistake of overintellectualizing or overinterpreting the the film. This is a must have for Memento fans and offers keen insight as to how independent movies are made."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy doesn't know anything","review":"First third of the book provides unfounded, fallacious and misleading theories, subsequent two thirds is boring production details like what was shot on which day and obvious production details like the cast and what not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Thoughts","review":"As a family doctor, I know how important communication and intuition can be in patient care, and was looking forward to learning how another clinician uses these \\"soft\\" tools.

It is very easy to use, and it produces awesome sound. I have had 2 discs get messed up; I'm not sure if that is the CDR-2's fault, or the disc. Anyway, it was just one song-and the original was old. Beware though, if you want to mix and match songs, it takes as long as all the songs put together. Just because it can record at 4x doesn't mean it will record everything at 4x. Only if you are recording a whole cd (say to give to somebody, or copying theirs) will it dub at 4x. When mixing, it goes at 1x, the speed of the song. This isn't a bad thing, no other recorder lets you go any faster. It's a good recorder and one that will do almost anything you ask it to.

If so, then the first one would have the Johnny Bravo Valentine's special and two of the Eds' episodes involving the Kanker sisters; and the second DVD will have the Eds' \\"Hanky Panky Hullaballoo\\" and two of Johnny Bravo's episodes.

Some would call it an operetta and indeed sometimes it sounds a bit like one but it is still operatic in essence. The story is very similar to La Traviata but more bitter-sweet than tragic in its conclusion. This set is well worth considering for any puccinian or Anna Moffo devotees. She is at her most seductive and affecting as Magda, a courtesan with a heart of gold, and is very well supported by the rest of the cast, Sciutti and De Palma making an especially delightful couple. Chorus and orchestra are excellent and Molinari-Pradelli conducts in a lively and elegant manner, with good atmospheric sound, this proves to be a highly enjoyable set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kubert''s Ghetto","review":"Joe Kubert has created war stories for DC comics.

The Chocolate Cherry, however smells like vinegar, and while at first the flavor is fine, it soon turns into bitter cherry, a bit of a rum flavor and then you guessed it, a strong vinegar like after-taste. I can get used to it, as frankly I have no other options due to milk and soy allergies, but some sweeter cherries and maybe some organic molasses in the mix would not hurt, maybe a bit of almond oil for added sweet flavor.

There are no establishing shots, characters are not introduced, and the scenes are edited together randomly, without following any chronological sequence or using any of the typical cues - dissolves, titles that state the time period, etc. - that might help the viewer understand the order in which events take place.With great disappointment I have to say that this movie now stands alone in my mind as the worst film ever made.

Iaon Gruffud made a decent effort playing William Wilberforce but was overshadowed by both Rufus Sewell and the actor who portrayed Prime Minister William Pitt and Albert Finney. Though the charisma Gruffud displayed for Wilberforce seemed a bit uppity and off at times, the solid dignity that is portrayed in his face does more than capture the screen. Gruffud is a decent actor but a bit too all over the place with his movements, a lot of overt theater habits still apparent on camera. His face alone carries remarkable expression. If only he made more use of this quality, he'd be a wonder to behold. This is an actor with Oscar potential, he just needs to fine tune his abilities.A good film with a bit of a slow start but a powerful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historic drama from the heart.","review":"An amazing historic drama inspired by real events that brought a great song and a great cause into the forefront, helping those wishing to put an end to slavery change minds, and hearts.

It has some sensitive matters about how slaves were imported to the various countries. It has a love story and historical features. My family loved it. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need I say more?","review":"I grew up in West Africa, which makes this movie very personal to me. But, more than that is the fact that William Willberforce was a man of faith and character. I wish those two traits coincided more! This movie is worth seeing not only for it's well produced filmography and excellent acting, but also for it's edifying qualities. How often can we say that about Hollywood? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational story. A must see for all!","review":"I loved this inspirational story of the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire. It is very humorus in parts, and even shows Mr. Wilbeforce's love story with his wife. A very well put together film. Great acting, great story line and a wonderful message of perseverance and the equality of all human kind. A must see for everyone! The descriptions may be grusome for the youngest of children (8 and under), but then they might be too young to understand those parts anyways.I love hearing the stories of the ordinary (or not so ordinary) people who changed history that are often neglected in history books. This movie is also pretty historically accurate. It would even be a great study for middle school or high school social studies classes.This movie has forever changed how the song Amazing Grace for me.

Americans do not play baseball in great numbers anymore hence the low TV ratings for the World Series (actually lowest ever in 2006). Also, look at the \\"international\\" aspect of MLB now--Japanese, Koreans, Chinese (via Taiwan) as well as the usual Latin Americans who are now greater in number.A more relevant comparison would be football (as in the NFL and college) and soccer. Anyway, more Americans play soccer than, say, the nation of Britain, if we are talking sheer numbers. It's just it's a recreational sport and always will be because soccer is flat-out too slow, low scoring and has too much diving in it.Personally, although the writing is there, the research isn't with this book. A far superior book that understands soccer and North American sports is: Offside by Markovitz and Hellerman.

Both dance version and orchestra version are outstanding. A fantastic melody with an excellent instrumental arrangement plus an unique male vocal by Neil Tennant. An very attractive orchestra intro gives a great atmosphere of fairytale contrasting the mysterious string ending. 2 different b-side songs are also very good. DISCO POTENTIAL is a new try for pet shop boys, with a very strong 'prodigy' feeling. A VIEW FROM YOUR BALCONY is an easy listening song, a nice percussion arrangement intereacting an irresistable melody.It's probably my favourite 2CD set single and is also a best buy for every pet shop boy's fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet Shop Boys + Broadway Don't Mix","review":"I have loved virtually everything the Pet Shop Boys have done and can't say enough good things about them. That much said I can find nothing redeeming for their cover of Sondheim's \\"Somewhere\\". This isn't the first time PSBs have delved into the realm of Broadway...who can forget their screeching shuddering version of \\"Losing My Mind\\". They were best off leaving that for Liza on her superior version on the \\"Results\\" CD. But no, the PSBs can't leave well enough alone and have to make another go at Broadway. Their version doesn't add anything to the Broadway mileau and frankly Striesand's cover version is superior. It's only worth it for completists (like myself...although why I'm not sure) or obsessives (myself again). It's only worth one star and that's only for the other tracks on the single.

For the price, this is not worth it, unless you only want to use it once or twice (not typical for a binder). I found one for a quarter of the price I paid here at a big name store, an Avery Heavy Duty, which will serve my purposes. Save your money, get Avery."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR MONSTER FANS LIKE ME","review":"This is a difficult one to review because its all build-up to the final reveal and some will like it and others will be thoroughly disappointed. Right away I must warn those looking for a monster book that this isn't the typical monster-on-a-rampage book that one might expect. Most of the action takes place after the few attacks and the story mainly focuses on how the news of a possible monster on the loose affects the town and its sheriff. Me, I'm a monster fan. I want to know what the monster is/looks like and I want it to make many appearances and be the source of much gory mayhem. This is more of a mystery in the vein of an \\"X-files\\" episode (\\"Quagmire\\" comes to mind). Therefore, the writing was good, but I'm not a fan of the story or the resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Reading","review":"I did not like this book since it seemed so disjointed.

But it went downhill all too soon. The characters were never fully developed leaving the reader in limbo. There are too many loose ends. Relationships are left hanging.

If I say that Wales is the true protagonist of the triology, I may leave the wrong impression, for there is nothing impersonal about Penman's triology. You will admire, love, and mourn Joanna and Llewelyn, Simon and Nell, Elen and Rob de Quincy, Ellen and Llewelyn II, and yes, Elizabeth and Davydd. But, over and over, you will grieve for Wales and the Welsh people, and yet Wales and its people still endure-to our joy and admiration. I have never been so moved by historical fiction. Please read this triology. Begin with Here Be Dragons and I guarantee you will read Falls the Shadow and the Reckoning.

All three men had great faults (More was a strong proponent of burning protestants at the stake; Beckett had a high martyr complex that exacerbated his problem far more than Henry ever did). Penman shows us how great a man Simon de Montfort truly was, faults and all. The accuracy and attention to detail is what makes this book truly great (although Edward was a great king in real history)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"Penman has done it again. Her descriptions of the machinations of the King John of Magana Carta fame and the richness of her Welsh portrait make this a wonderful book.

Wales and the happenings of Llewelyn ap Gruffydd are also key to the story as loyalties are tried, tested and ran through and the hope of a better tomorrow are dreamed today.Sharon Penman has the ability to transport the reader to the place and time of the events in her books.

But the boy was as happy as ever. \\"The Assassination Bureau\\" is clever and witty, and the actors are clearly having a great time. Oliver Reed, normally a bit of a sourpuss, actually performs with humor and style for once. But the movie's greatest asset is Diana Rigg, the first actress I ever had a crush on. Maybe if you're a Baby Boomer like me, she'll always be the one for you. In this movie, as in the great neglected James Bond film \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\\" she is droll and sexy and somehow very moving, and in both she has a particularly funny rapport with villain Telly Savalas, barely containing her disgust for him.

It's a race around Europe with the assassins and Sevalas in pursuit of Reed and Rigg. R & R use subterfuge to dispatch Sevalas and put the Bureau back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"very droll - fast paced and witty","review":"Lively and quick-witted humor make this a really fun little movie to watch. I'll refrain from discussing the plot or scenes, because the less you know about it before watching, the better.Oliver Reed, in a departure from the dark and menacing roles we usually see, is charming and debonair in this rather zany comedy. Diana Rigg is delightful (surely a little over-acting can be forgiven in a comedy?), and Telly Selvas surprisingly light touch is just right for his role.The pace drops off a bit in the second half, and the comedy becomes broader and less subtle (yes, even slapstick as noted by another reviewer).Still, taken as a whole, it's a clever, funny movie and very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful fun, with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor","review":"This movie combines the best of English character actors with a riotous story of an \\"assasination corporation.\\" The only unfortunate part is the implied sex scene between Diana Rigg and Oliver Reed in Venice -- his seduction of her isn't terribly romantic. But their byplay in the rest of the movie makes it worthwhile -- she's perfect as the ambitious suffragette fighting to get ahead. Telly Savalas makes a wonderful villain, and he and his henchmen (especially Curt Jurgens as the manic German assassin) are fun to watch. It's a great movie for the whole family (the sex scene isn't really) -- a British dark comedy handled by capable performers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, useless school textbook","review":"A boring, useless school textbook. Do not buy this unless you have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad...","review":"First read this upon it's initial release when I was in high school and absolutely loved it. Horror, action, ancient mysteries, occult, plot twists- I couldn't put it down. Then I forgot about it. 12 years later I was recently going through some boxes at my mother's place and found an old, tattered paperback entitled 'Rune'. So what did I think after re-reading? Well... still lot's of fun but... the characters are, unfortunately, incredibly stereotypical. The two detectives on the case are older gentlemen and one of them is about to retire. Whoa, original. And the protagonist's girlfriend is so stereotypically, frigidly perfect that it is a wonder he sees anything in her at all. I'd have killed her myself. Anyway, still an engrossing read, but I certainly see flaws now that I didn't as a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this dvd !!","review":"Researched this dvd.

The dvd case was broken, the 2 dvds were SIGNIFICANTLY scratched/scuffed. NO liner notes. That alone merited it being returned to Amazon.2. More importantly (and this is why Amazon should remove it from their listings) - even though the dvd outer notes boast \\"includes the full-length Robert Altman documentary\\" - NOT !!!

Although there are some sizzling scenes in Stars, they don't compare to those in Butterfly.The one thing however, that Harvey does give her readers is a picture of women who grow or stay strong. Through these women the reader gets the message that a woman doesn't have to be a Hollywood star to be happy. These are women who stand up for themselves. One of the things I liked about both books was seeing women who stood up to intimidating males. A woman doesn't have to be young or thin to be in a happy relationship. I loved seeing some women who were able to break away from abusive relationships and emerge like butterflies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap!!","review":"This is not a book for anyone looking for a halfway decent light novel to read.

This books provides an excellent overview of the development in this direction so far. It teaches many very important concept without getting tedious in technical details. This also serves as a very good text for students interested in learning dynamic programming and structured policies. This book falls short of (my) expectations as its approach in describing the problem solving is very legality oriented.

What I got was not at all what I'd hoped for. I loved \\"Greek Wedding\\" and previous reviews had mentioned humor, so I figured it was worth a try. The Greek in this novel was heavy-handed and \\"in your face\\" and I was still looking for laughs on the last page. The characters were okay, I suppose, but one can only care about the creepy almost-husband and his infidelities for so long befoer the story of his misbehavior becomes tiresome. Sophie talked about herself more than she concerned herself with solving the mystery at hand, and she just wasn't interesting enough to maintain momentum of the novel for 280 pages. The only one laughing out loud here is the author. If you're looking for laughs, I suggest you try Sarah Strohmeyer's \\"Bubbles Yablonsky\\" series. She's a funny character with a fun story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Stale Coffee","review":"This book had great potential, but seemed to sink about halfway through the story. The story is about Sofie Metropolis, a Greek girl who has gone against the family restaurant business and entered into private investigations. In this story, she's on the trail of a cheating wife, a missing dog, and a potential murder. I didn't like Sofie as a character - she wasn't funny, or smart, or pretty, and seemed to lust after someone for no apparent reason. Her familial background, and descriptions of foods are probably what kept me reading as long as I did. I made it 75% of the way through the book before deciding that I just didn't care about Sofie or her exploits. You can tell, without a doubt, that 2 different authors are writing this book (which they admit to), because the writing doesn't 'flow' from chapter to chapter. Very unimpressed - the book was sort of a Big Fat Greek Wedding takeoff, but not even close to as funny or charming. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least she doesn't blow up the Mustang...","review":"...but otherwise Sophie is a Greek version of Stephanie Plum.

And it just gets more obvious with the second and third books in the series.If you like the Stephanie Plum series you might vaguely enjoy this as a weak filler while you wait for the next Evanovich novel. I, however just got distracted because the Plum parallels keep coming up to slap you and give you a sense of deja vu.These characters aren't very strong and neither is the plot. There are quite a few loose ends which I suppose are left dangling purposely so they can be woven into future books. Just for the heck of it I read up to the third book and they're still dangling.Read this if you need a quick fix while you wait for the next Stephanie Plum novel, but don't expect too much.

This one is surely the best. The orchestra, chorus, Mehta's interpretation, are all outstanding. But the quartet is the best I've ever heard, and no wonder, Vickers, Horn, Price, and Salminen. Few operas at the Met have such a wondrous cast. As for the sound, not having read the CD jacket, I was startled to hear applause at the end. No other hint 'til then that it was live.

The tempo is on the brisk side and the musical pulse is strong. Mehta paints the music with thick brush and the orchestra responds with a big heart. This is a bold playing and I like it. The first movement moves swiftly and excitingly. The second movement also swaggers powerfully. The third is still moving forward well without slighting its lyrical element. The finale has a sense of a live occasion and it gives the music a festive and joyful feeling. The chorus and soloists sing their hearts out and the music ends with a tremendous power of celebration.It is on a bottom-priced CD. But the sound is big and bold, just like the music making.

Well sort of...I just bought a couple since they are cheaper than the others and I found out why they are not used much.They are too tight. I had to use a hammer to slide it on.They also are poorly designed compared to the other clamps that fit this rack (The PC-50, PCX-100 and PCX-200 all fit and I use them all without any problems). My advice is to spend the extra five to ten bucks for the better clamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"first of all the old edition we had was the whole country and I do not see why they split the country other than to sell two books instead of one.

If you just follow the instructions you would most probably not get your code compiling.Author omitted many things that you need to know. He states, for example, \\"create SDI project\\" in step 1. In step 10 or so you find out that you had to give it a specific name which he failed to indicate in the beginning. Same with IDs and so on. Author also fails to give the code for the header files and you just need to think what each variable does (and still write the header file code, of course) or download the solution from the web.Also, author asks to call the function with one name, and in the code he changes the name to a different one. Adds confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The source code is incomplete...","review":"I bought the book and found a lot of interesting discussions in the book. But when I tried to run some examples I found that some source code are missing from the web site to back up the explanations in the book, although the book clearly indicates source code is available for download from the web site. The list of source code from the web site is very incomplete. Besides, the book advertises that the authors' web site has a supporting material for this book, but I found none, not even a mention of this book. I wrote an email to the authors for more information, but got no response. Without a more complete source code to accompany this book, it would be difficult for most of the readers to use this book to its full benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Phil has provided a terrfic handbook of essential tools and messages for the emerging and aspiring customer support leader. Very readable and full of valuable insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christian Fantasy","review":"This book starts off as a rather normal fantasy, complete with the standard average-young-man-who-discovers-he's-got-a-destiny main character. But the author skillfully builds the story into a gripping fantasy with a touch of romance. Joraiem's struggles are believable and relatable for fantasy fans of both genders. Tense battle scenes are balanced with emotional struggles.The only problem for first time readers is the shocking plot twist at the end. Those who preserve through the entire series will come to understand it, even if they never are satisfied with the ending. My only other recommendation is to check the entire series out at one go. Once you read the first one, you won't be able to sleep until everything is resolved in the fifth book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Boring and trite. I just didn't like this book. I wanted to, but the writing was mediocre, the character development was not so good, and the evil agents were just boring. There wasn't any tension in the book. I will say that the ending was pretty surprising though."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting at times but lacking somehow","review":"I've not studied writing in academia - I may be unqualified to write this - but despite some interesting points in the story I found the plot thin and underdeveloped, as were the characters. Everything seems to happen so simply and quickly that I never found much of it believable, nor could I get into the story emotionally.The basic ideas behind the story are interesting, but the actual implementation is somehow lacking (to me). There is seemingly very little build-up. Major events just up and happen. A potentially interesting story never really grew into what it could have been, I think.You can see many of the story's events coming as you progress through the book. Perhaps this book is more geared for younger folk.Considering what I spent on this book I found little return."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my time","review":"I bought this book based on the raving reviews. Usually that many sci-fi lovers aren't wrong. THEY ARE THIS TIME. The beginning of the book is mediocre. There is nothing special about Mr. Graham's writing style. The plot in the middle of the book grabs your attention. It kept me reading to see if I would love the end so much, I would decide to keep the book. Well, I HATED the end. It was much worse than the beginning. Even if Mr. Graham redeems himself in the second book of the series, I probably won't be reading it. It's a shame. The story is...interesting at least. But, unfortunately, it's also one I can leave and never pick up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly deep but not boringly so","review":"5 star book for sure. It's got enough of a back story to make you a fan, but not so much that you lose interest in reading long enumerations of historical facts. The characters are in the same way well-written.The plot has disappointed some, but after reading the second book, Bringer of Storms, everything seems necessary and falls into place nicely. Think of this book as a prologue to other four (three are as of yet unwritten)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"It usually takes an author 3 books to complete a series. This one is 5 books and the last one isn't even out yet. Wait to buy until all 5 are done because the first one leaves you dangling and the the next 3 are cliff hangers. I guess the author has learned well from Terry Brooks. This one to me could easily have been completed in 3 books.In general I don't like books that don't end. I paid good money to get innvolved in the story. I invested my free time to read it. Then when I come to the end that is no end, I feel as if I have been cheated. Karen Hancock does it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent novel","review":"'Beyond the Summerland' is an excellent novel whose pages turn faster than you can imagine. If you enjoy Tolkien and the fantasy writings of C.S. Lewis, you will most certainly enjoy this book. The characters are so real and full and vivid, and the action sequences are intense. (During these sections I was incapable of releasing the book from my grip!) It left me eager for the release of the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Christian fantasy","review":"A very good book! I'm more a fan of the classic fantasy (Lewis, Tolkien)which is why I gave this 4, not 5 stars, but as far as modern fantasy goes, this is probably my favorite. The allegory was simple and clean, not overpowering; after the prologue, it disappeared almost entirely. The story captivated easily, and I'm very glad to find where the characters act and speak sensibly by modern standards, not another Shakespeare wanna-be whose dialogue you cannot follow. If you've gone through the Lewis and Tolkien (that I so adore!) I would definately reccommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good combination of history and romance","review":"Well written account of a fascinating piece of history. Gives good insight into actions and thought process through use of a variety of sources. The detail regarding the politics of the time all help to understand Eva's actions.

The author takes the relationship of husband and wife out of fantasy and into reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Amazing","review":"This book is by the far the best Evita Peron book. As a huge fan of the life of Eva Peron, I have read all the current books on Evita, and this one is the most imformative. I love all the pictures in this book, and the information is great. This is a must for anyone who loves history, and especially, Eva Peron."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult read","review":"If you want to skim for info, this might be OK, but overall I found it to be confusing. Perhaps too much information and minutia is presented... presenting one side, then another side. This is not ancient history so it is surprising that there is no clear, well connected story line. Unless you are desperate to get some information on Argentina, I would certainly try another version of her biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"I.M.","review":"When a young nurse is accosted by a man needing blood late one night, a series of events is set in motion that years later, her daughter will not be able to stop. That daugher, Lily, grows up with a constant yearning for love that she only finds on the internet. Her ideal man seems to be a guy who calls himself Batt, and he has a lock on her soul that not even her closest friends can break. Batt is a vampire that her own mother created, and now that he's entered Lily's world; he is hungry.Fans of happy endings need not apply here. Inconsistent characterization and a rather depressing ending detract from the potential interest in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Internet Message","review":"I've always hated knowing that the good guys are going to prevail, and that the bad guys always get what's coming. I rooted for the machines in the Terminator movies. So I was pleasantly surprised to find a twist on that old formula when I read Internet Message. Our heroine is not saved, as we suspect she will be. Lilly is the token innocent, virgin, reluctant victim, and we are sure she will transform into reluctant hero. Instead, to my surprise and delight, she transformed into a nasty blood sucking mistress, as powerful in her badness as she was shimmering in her goodness. These characters are fun to read, but what makes Internet Message stay with you is the unique spin Woods puts on it; the nice guy does NOT get the girl, the ultimate heroes are not who we think they will be, and there is no sentimentality sparing the lives and undeaths of our main characters. In vampire transformations, Woods left barely a soldier standing, and it was good, unclean fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voigt is probably one of the finest young adult writers...","review":"Wilhemina Smiths (Mina), wants to dance. She's got liveliness, intelligence, zest for life, and determination; but she is also black. Voigt produces her usual not-out of the ordinary kaleidoscope of REAL people...and this is precisely what makes this book out of the ordinary. She presents Mina's emotions beautifully and level-headedly: her love of ballet, her keenness, her crush on/fascination with Tamer Shipp, her relationship with Dicey. The concluding sentences of the book are wonderfully ambiguous (at least a little). There's disappointment, triumph... It's just great.Characters and scenes from the other books in the Tillerman Cycle overlap and are introduced through her own perspective. I'd recommend this book far more than \\"The Glory Field\\", and feel that it lived up to its potential and even surpassed my expectations.Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Howdy Old Folks","review":"This reminds me of when my mother fell down the stairs and broke her bottom bone.

I have loved Paul Rodgers work since Free and Bad Company and so I took a chance. His solo albums are just superior to even the cream of the rest of my collection and thought it would at least round out my Rodgers \\"library\\".Man, I was amazed. I don't know where this was recorded but it may be at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Don't know why I think that but it is just a hunch. In any event, this is one fun CD. I don't know what is so \\"extended\\" about it; but don't let that bother you. Rodgers pipes are just as strong as when he was in Free and his band is in top form.

What is seen is not acting - I doubt that any of the \\"actors\\" has ever been in an acting class - it is so bad it is not even funny. The end of the film is a band playing at a school prom that goes on forever with a piece that is not even musical. One of the characters wears glasses and is continually pushing them up on his nose until it is so irritating that you want to super glue them to this face to make him stop.The pacing of the film is so slow that it seems to be filmed in slow motion.

Their sound has gradually become more polished and classic giving B-tribe a more unique identity. And for the first time I actually like the guy singing on this album (the female voice can sound a bit cheesy but you don't hear her much at all throughout the cd.) If you like Gypsy Kings, this is more sensual and ambient with some Enigma overtones - mostly in the atmosphere though, not the actual music. This isn't an album I sit and listen to on the headphones though, rather it's better to have playing in the backround or before going to bed. It's also great music for a candlelight dinner.

By the time I was a few pages in, however, it wasn't a problem any more. The style is quirky and evocative, the characters are grandiose and fun, and the black-and-white art is easy to make sense of (sometimes I find that comic styles confuse the action that's going on, at least for me). The story of vampires, vampire hunters, Catholics versus Protestants, and plenty of large weaponry, is deliciously outrageous.

In most ways, this is a book about adding an apartment onto your house. The plans are rather dull to look at and a lot of the advice is rather commonsense but they are a useful place to begin research if you are interested in such construction.

A young girl in Northern China is sold into what she and her father presume is marriage in Gold Rush-era America. In reality, she has been bought as a prostitue, but her values and strong will keep her from such a fate. Polly, as she becomes known, challenges the locals' views of Chinese and changes the lives of everyone who meets her. The story is based on fact, and stays pretty close to the truth, even employing some actual events and dialogue from the main character's life. As in real life, there is some humor within all of the drama. This makes an enjoyable, well-rounded movie. The location shots are beautiful, and the recreated towns and period clothes give a good, accurate feel for the history of that area. It's well-cast, and well-acted, and gives a marvelous look into events in a time and place about which few people really know very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmm...good!","review":"I just made the Egg and Lentil Curry; I have no words to describe how good it is! The recipes in this book are all easy to read and VERY easy to eat! Some of the spices I can only get at my local natural foods store, but since that's where I shop anyway, it's not a big deal. I'm a vegetarian and have found that Indian food is one of the easiest types of food that will accomodate my needs. Although not all of these recipes are vegetarian, the ones that aren't make it easy to substitute tofu or beans or veggies or whatever you want. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dishes, easy to prepare -outstanding amateur chef","review":"The curry recipes in this book are simply exquisite. My favorite is the Tikka masala, which is a rich and creamy suace with a little bite. My fiance was absolutely blown away by it and asked me to cook it twice in the same week. If you have a food processor and a store near you, these recipes will all be easy to prepare. This is one of my two cooking bibles along with Thai Home Cooking by Robert Carmack. If you have any inclination of making Indian curries, and want to do so as good or better than a gourmet chef, this is the perfect book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WW2","review":"this i purchased for an 88 year old neighbor who during ww2 flew B24 airplanes.

This one is and also has some settings you will find new and interesting. At times I was reminded of \\"When Gravity Fails\\" but, that was not a bad thing.

The photography is exceptional, with hundreds of examples of dinnerware pictured in each of the four main categories, along with copies of period advertisements and brochures. Each section also includes a painstakingly assembled collection of hundreds of logos to assist the collector in identifying the company the dinnerware was produced for. A must-have reference book for the serious restaurant, airline, ship and railroad china collector! Pair this book up with Volume 2 of the series and you can push all your other books to the back of the shelf, you won't need them anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Not So Good","review":"I was referred to this book for price and identification and was sadly disappointed to get the book and look up the china I had to find that it had some of the pieces and history but by NO MEANS is a complete guide. The China Company I had was in there but it didn't have the history from the year the company started but it did have the identification stamps from the year the company started go figure. The price guide consisted of showing a few pictures of china this particular company producted and gave a few prices. I couldn't believe it.

Oh well I'll know better next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forensic Sscience","review":"Huge book, but an easy read. The chapters are outlined and written in a simple format.

It is basically and individually wrapped candied sweet potato. It is a unique product I had never had or seen. It is satisfying to eat one. That is really nice about this asian candy like many others. My pug really wanted a taste, so I gave him at tiny bit and cleaned his teeth afterwards. It is sticky and on the hard side, but really great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's called the pentatonic scale","review":"This recording of the Borodin b minor symphony is excellent, and the colorful orchestration that entranced Debussy and his colleagues is easily heard due to the clear sound (too clear in the first movement, actually - one of the cello players sounded a little tinny to me). The first movement, with its blatantly nationalistic motto theme, is balanced with a sparkling scherzo and an andante with an achingly beautiful song-like theme. The finale, with the exuberance characteristic of Borodin and of the Mighty Five in general, is sprightly and cheerful. Its main theme is pentatonic (consisting of a five-note scale), like most music from folk sources (yes, including America, which does not mean that we \\"ripped\\" it from anywhere, simply that it is the single most pervasive system of tonal organization in the world). This recording is highly recommended, as it represents the vast majority of Borodin's orchestral output, and not badly, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borodin's 2nd symphony","review":"I played Borodin's 2nd with the National Scout and Guide Symphony Orchestra, having never even heard of borodin before, let alone having played the symphony! I quickly fell in love with it and its wide range of themes. I particularly enjoy the 3rd movement and the way it changes from gentle sols at the beginning to a rising climax with a rising passage introduced by the violas and being built up by the orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Plaster--A great thing for pain","review":"People know very little about this product, because it isn't advertised and is rarely seen in pharmacies, but it is a great product to have on hand for muscle pain. I have used it, to good effect. My family has always been aware of this product, and kept some on hand for use.The beauty of it is that it can be cut down to size, so as not to waste and to tailor-make it to the sore area.To use it is simple. make sure the area where you are putting the plaster is clean, dry, and has no lotions. Estimate the size you need, and cut.Peel away the plastic lining(just as you do with Band-Aids) and press gently to your skin. You may leave it there until the next day, but remove it before you shower.That's it. No dosing, so smells. And, for me, it works.I hope this review will help others when they look at this product here on Amazon.

Stravinsky's Rite of Spring is such an emotional ride because of it's strong rhythmic qualities. The first time you hear it done right, you feel wrong. It's freakishly piercing at a primal level, which would explain why its the most famous piece of Primitivism. Those qualities are dumbed down to a measure that makes the piece seem more annoying than involving. This recording gets its 2 stars instead of what would be one because I cannot be too hard on the Firebird Suite, as this is the first I've heard it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy","review":"This book was sooo boring. There's is no metion of any of the old characters.I can't believe Bryan would leave Nina,that's to unrealistic.Jessica is all intent on being good,but that's not her personality.Liz and Sam arguing all the time is annoying.I don't really like Chloe she seems really spoilt,it was really stupid when she made up that Tom Watts was her boyfriend.I can't believe Tom is giving up everything he worked for to be back on the football team.I think Francine Pascal/Laurie John should write a third Lifeguard mini-series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, But So-So Writing","review":"I remember enjoying the Encyclopedia Brown solve-them-yourself mysteries when I was a kid.

Otherwise, I'd give it away or even throw it away, because after several months it still smells terrible. At first I thought it was just out-gassing and that the smell would go away -- but it hasn't. It still has that awful \\"made in China\\" odor that some things have. It smells toxic, really bad. As soon as I can replace it with one I can buy from a store (and smell first) I will.

For what I paid for it isn't worth returning. The remaining punches punch holes pretty good now(hence the 2 star rating), but I question how this tool is going to work as it ages. The brass anvil on the punch will most likely dull the punch dies quickly. The rotating punch selector works well. The punch came in a piece of crap plastic pouch that was already tore and was basically garbage. If I was a professional or an advanced hobbyist I would not purchase this item.

I still went ahead and watched it, and it was a complete waste of my time. Edward Furlong drives me nuts. There is just something about him, his walk, the way he delivers his lines, that just really bothers me. The plot is prety thin and the acting isn't that great.If you're desperate for a movie then I would consider it, otherwise, don't waste your time on it.

I've always thought those two weren't used enough.the olivia role is fine and mariska is doing fine with it.as to this episode it involves a couple who have just driven into NYC. they claim their baby was hijacked along with the car. the police immediately suspect that one or both of them has murdered the baby instead. instead of doing the predictable plot arc with this story, I was surprised to discover that there was a rather new plot twist I hadn't seen before.

There are also introductions to the composers Mozart and Beethoven. There are about 3 different activities suggested for each song so it can be used in different ways to reinforce different musical concepts in different lessons.

Its my music find of the year (I am an iPod addict). This is a Sax dectet (1 Sopranio, 2 Soprano, 2 Altos, 2 Tenors, 2 Baritones and Basses) and then they throw in drums, piano, and bass guitar. My ears feel massaged with sound. I will only quote some review from the net:\\"The dectet of saxophones plus piano and bass guitar that is London Saxophonic is staggering... sounded like an Arvo Pärt choir jamming with the Bulgarian National Assembly of Throat Singers, yes it was that good.\\" The Independent -- Believe this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soothing exciting trip.","review":"Some of these tunes surprise me every time I listen to them.

Personally having searched for close to five years for an original album with the lament, I am finally at peace -- this will do.

The speaker often has to refer to her notes, repeats herself and talks to her audience (potential babysitters) as if they were small children rather than pre-teens or teens. I felt totally ripped-off after I bought this and don't want anyone else to waste their money as I did. The information in this DVD can be found in any book on babysitting; there is nothing unique or exciting. I cannot imagine a teen or pre-teen sitting through this extremely boring DVD.

Still the effects were fine for the 90's. Which was the audience this was intended for , but it was a disaster. As A lover of bad b movies I can't even recommend this one.

Unfortunately, to me it seems to give the wrong impression of death. People do not come back after they die to help those they love cope with it.

I could watch it everyday till the day I die and never get sick of it. The soundtrack I even like. Micheal Keaton is amazing in everything. I must warn you though, bring the tissues. I cry like a baby during this movie. It's sad. A struggling musician who dies when his son Charlie is 11 on christmas. Then a year later things are hard for Charlie and Gab (the wife). Jack (the dad) comes back as a snowman and freaks Charlie out. It gives a good message. You can always talk to someone when they're in your heart. Never let go of that. One of my personal favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Frost is agreat movie for Kids and adults!","review":"Michael Keaton & Kelly Preston are great in this comedy/action drama.

Because it was unfathomably awful.The plot's inherent creepiness -- absentee dad dies, only to be reincarnated as a talking, ambulatory snowman who learns what's really important about life, etc. -- is matched by indifferent acting and a general sense of cheapness (from the shoddy studio set to the lighting to the Hanna-Barbera quality special effects).Keaton tries his best here -- he's by far the most charismatic actor, but he is dispatched quickly. You get the sense Keaton acted all his scenes in about a week and then did voice-over work for his snowman dialogue on a few off weekends. In retrospect, he had the right idea.

He dies in an accident and comes back as a snowman...yes, a snowman. Then he is suddenly trying to be father of the year..ah, er...snowfather of the year.

Claude Bernard, a French physiologist, Guenther Endelein, a German bacteriologist, and Antoine Bechamp, a French MD.,chemist, and pharmacologist all did work on chronic disease proving that all disease is mycosis and all illness is from incorrect nutrition.

All three are Asian Beauties. The scenery, costumes, music (except for the opening credits) is very good. There is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor in the movie, as well as great one liners. Even though the movie has English subtitles, the translation does not seem to take away from the movies script.

He has memorized the song and sings along with them each time it is played. I recommend this CD to anyone who is a Bluegrass fan of any type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well compiled","review":"I enjoyed this CD very much after hearing their music on Yahoo radio. I liked all of the songs except for \\"Viva Las Vegas\\". Not their fault though, I think thats just a stupid song and making it bluegrass didn't help it any. I feel they are a strong group and hopefully will continue to put out lots of great songs. They have a good full sound and their music is fun and inventive. You will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"very promising","review":"This is some discovery. Sure, Bluegrass-style bands come by the dozen but this one is really worth the trip. The Grascals consist of six musicians, performing 13 superb songs. The voices, as so often in bluegrass, sound impressively right but the individual level of the musicians is also excellent. A kind of Union Station 2! Note Dolly Parton's participation in \\"Viva las Vegas\\". All the melodies are splendid from \\"Mourning Dove\\" to the traditionnal \\"Sweet By And By\\". A lot of energy, traditional country music, modern sound, the perfect example to bring people to bluegrass or, as they themselves say: \\"Nashville bluegrass\\". The album was produced by the Grascals themselves, and they are no doubt a promising band on which to count in the future.FACM ( French Association of Country Music - )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grascals","review":"What can I say..this cd is great the band is great..if you ever get the chance to see theese guys play do it...the cd rocks cuts like me and john and paul..to saro jane to white lightning and viva las vegas..you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"One of the best groups going!

A young A.J., Karch Kiraly pre-pink hat, and of course the Hov at his best. This is a fun video hosted by Chris Marlowe and supported mostly by NBC quality coverage.

I loved Stereotype Be because of Kevin's beautiful voice with his worldly sound. Very excellent album. On this release, he has completely outdone himself. Kevin has one of the most beautiful voices in modern music, period. The shining moment on this album for me is his cover of Bob Dylan's \\"When He Returns\\". His rendition is truely amazing, mind you that Bob Dylan is a difficult artist to cover. Many people have tried it, but few have succeeded in making the song their own. Kevin Max really shows you his beautiful voice on this song just sung over piano. The only track that I tend to skip on this album is the second one because of the 80s synth feel to it. If you liked Stereotype Be, this album is heads above it. One of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful insight for Algren fans","review":"A fascinating transcript of conversations, circa 1962-64, with my literary hero.

The description is misleading where it says 3 speeds and four temperature settings. It only has one control, so low speed is low heat, medium seed is medium heat, and high speed is high heat. There is no way to have high speed and low heat, so it really only has three settings and a cold shot button. I would not have ordered it if that had been clearly stated in the description. The LCD display does not work, and sometimes the dryer cuts off like it has a short in it.

One has to flip back and forth through pages to figure out what exactly its talking about because the paragraphs changes topics in mid sentence...literally!! It begins on one topic and jumps to an entirely new subject and then ends with...\\"we'll discuss this topic later in chapter so and so.

She has written so many wonderful books, but LEONARDO DA VINCI is a book that I do not feel comfortable recommending or sharing.In addition to focusing on some issues which might be controversial to introduce to a younger audience, the book lacks end notes or source notes to validate the material in the book. Although Krull is always using quotes, she never tells specifically where she is getting her information. A long bibliography is essentially useless for doublechecking facts since I have no intention of reading twenty books (two specifically speculating on Leonardo's sex life) to find out where she learned that Leonardo hated having dirty fingernails, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Inappropriate for Children!","review":"Please be careful before purchasing this book for elementary or even early middle school children.

Shame on you Katherine Krull. I dont care if you support homosexuality or not, inserting this topic in a childrens book is inappropriate. Do kids need a whole chapter on Da Vinci's possible homosexuality ?? We dont discuss peoples' sex lives with our children, in our house. I urge others, not to buy this book. I obviously will need to censor even childrens books for my kids before they read them. Maybe Katherine Krull should write a book about Alexander the Great and devote a whole chapter to his sex life."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a children's book","review":"This could have been a great book if chapter 4 had been left out. There was some great and easily accessible information that would make it an enjoyable read for children from ages 9-14.My daughter chose this book for her biography book report. She was extremely upset when she came upon the adult theme of homosexuality and didn't want to read past page 36, the 1st mention of the allegation. And to the previous reviewer, Colleen, you should have been more honest when reviewing...his alleged homosexuality and the investigation is the theme of chapter 4, not just page 38 as you said. This was very upsetting to my 10 year old daughter who didn't want to read about that kind of stuff. Why must children have to deal with these issues? This book is definitely NOT for middle grade age students! I'm very disappointed in the author's choice to include this in a children's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a bad read","review":"I really love free Kindle books and have downloaded several from this author, Sax Romer.

The language is a little stilted, like the Sherlock Holmes books, but the mysteries are interesting and I enjoying trying to solve them and always being wrong.This particular story was very interesting because the item involved is a slipper reportedly worn by Muhammad. A fanatical group devoted to protecting this relic is determined to return it to its rightful location, and the hero gets caught in the middle trying to protect it for a museum.

I had fallen asleep and woke up to the driving fourth mvmt. playing on NPR. I was hooked immediately and couldn't wait for the DJ to say who it was. I went out that night and bought it.

Ruby joins the Jewish mob during the Great Depression and falls into a predictable spiral of violence. The story of lost innocence and the inevitable ending feels familiar, yet fresh.This entertaining graphic novel is part of what I am calling the \\"Depression Era New York\\" school of stories - \\"Kings In Disguise\\" and Eisner's \\"Contract With God Trilogy\\" are among this group of works. This story is not as powerful as those, but a worthy member of the serious graphic novel genre. This powerful short novel is another display of how much the Great Depression affected an entire generation of artists. With fine artwork and a fast-paced story, this novel has me writing it again: we live in an incredible age for the comic medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Groups Biggest Hit","review":"Cleveland, OH's, Rude Boys racked up their biggest hit, \\"Written All over Your Face\\" in 1991 (no. 16 pop). The number has a Philly Soul groove (reminiscent to the O'Jays' \\"Use Ta Be My Girl\\") and seductive vocal harmonies. Like most late-'80s and early-'90s R&B, the track is set to a modified hip-hop beat, but the quartet's delivery nearly outshines the bouncy groove. Banks and Little convey an emotional testimony. Nothing else the foursome touched entered Billboard's pop 100, let alone the Top 40. The now-defunct quartet is billed as one of New Jack's finest one-hit wonder bands, but the entire group seemed too good for their own careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuba Concerto","review":"This is the definitive recording of the Vaughan-Williams Concerto.

It should work for Power steering and transmission also, at least on Car/trucks that's not hard to get to or down load were access is bad. The design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it! For under $5, not a bad deal. Hang it up out of the way when done with it. It's able to fit into your Transmission Dip Stick tube, so it has to be small enough, so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once!!! It's small and doesn't hold all that much.

THe length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopkins Flo Tool Spill Saver Multi-Purpose Funnel","review":"While this is a simply plastic funnel, its uses are allot.

It uses a mid-sized orchestra and chorus that produces a romatnic but not Victorian sound. As an alternative to the lumbering verions of the past and the anemic \\"period\\" readings to come, Davis's account satisfied on all counts. As so often happens with him, this later remake (1990) with the Bavarian Radio Symphony is tired and sluggish, a pale shadow of Davis's earlier triumph. The chorus is large and recorded in a cavernous space. The solo quartet shows ability but comes nowhere near the earlier vocalists in naturalness and simplicity. There are occasional signs of lfie, but overall this performance is its own requiem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of pretty pictures","review":"Admittedly, this book is a fun coffee-table read. I think that is all it aims to be.I found the scholarship hard to reference (I would have liked to have seen an impressive bibliography and had trouble sourcing both images and facts) but just thumbing through the book and looking at the clothing is sheer eye candy.Too much of contemporary dress is based on conformity, and seeing some designers having fun with textures, colours and history is a treat. The men wearing these designs would need not only sheer guts but a sense of fun, too.That said, this book belongs in the \\"for fun\\" category, but not on the scholar's bookshelf for the history of men's dress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Utterly Pointless","review":"Although most one-star reviews are written by those who have not read the book, this is unfortunately not the case with me. I felt compelled to finish this one based on the five dollars that I spent, but it would have been wiser had I just forgotten about the wasted money and gotten drunk instead. This may be the worst story ever written. It has no plot or redeeming value and was apparantly written simply for the purpose of depressing the unlucky readers who might stumble on it.Rape, child molestation, and graphic homosexuality run rampant throughout the book. Every character is an amoralist (as is the author, most likely) so there's no one to sympathize with.

I purchased it and was amazed at the making of this DVD. To see the process that they went through - the actors - the equipment and photography setup - was just plain great. Then to see the finished product - and the beautiful scenes that were produced - was well worth the price paid.

However, in this DVD, the slide show of the photographs is given secondary priority, very little time is allowed for viewing each photo, and it's impossible to discern the detail in most of them. The main feature of the DVD isn't the pictures themselves -- it's all about the production of the pictures -- very interesting in itself, but hardly what I expected, and certainly not the kind of material I would send as a Christmas gift.

I also found his method of teaching \\"whoa\\" and \\"heel\\" much easier than other authors recommend. Although he breeds, raises, trains and hunts Setters, Marti's book is \\"breed blind\\".

Where is the healing power of confession? I believe there is but you won't find it in this book.I guess I was wrong about this book. This book is for people in our culture who need to be entertained and cuttled back into a vital and necessary part of religious life.

Found this Canon flatbed scanner, with 30 Sheet feeder, for her office. It is perfect for our needs. It's FAST! It's easy to use (even SHE has no problems). A 14 ft. USB cable keeps it just far enough away not to crowd her work space. A dedicated electrical outlet is advisable. No paper jams thus far, as noted on some reviews.This scanner was hard to find!

The scanner is supposed to have the ability to set up 50 \\"one touch\\" jobs that scan directly to email without going through the client app. I cannot get this to work to save my life. There are only a few options to set up and looks to be easy, but it just won't work. The scanner will display worthless error messages such as \\"send failed\\". The documentation gives ZERO support in this area and nothing at this moment exists on the web for solving issues. Some error codes and a list of trouble shooting them in the manual would go along way in trying to resolve this issue.

I agree with the ease of use but the quality was not there in doing color scans. Her older scanner was an HP ScanJet 7400C and it produced better color head to head against the Canon. Scanning directly to a Canon I9100 Printer the HP reproduced the colors more accurately than the Canon DR1210C. I was disappointed and could not justify the cost of the Canon.

A lot of it's pages are only half filled with text, which makes the book maybe only forty pages. You might as well call it a small guide. Most of the chapters are only one page long. That should tell you a lot about this worthless book. It tells you absolutely nothing on what you need to know from a young woman. NOTHING! Save your money!

I didn't bother to count, but I'll bet there are fewer than 200 sentences in the whole 'book'. Let's call it a booklet. And there is nothing insightful about the observations it contains.

But I'm a sound/music guy and know what I hear. First I used to love Styx when I was a kid. Haven't given them much though for 20 years really. So... my report:Sound quality is very good compared to a others I've heard. Styx is kind of weird music generally - dramatic scores and things. But I still like it. This is different than the old Styx and has some really cool stuff - not super poppy but has some catchy tunes and generally solid songwriting.Besides Gaucho, my favorite DVD-A so far. My 16 year old girl likes it a lot, to my surprise. She really likes the carrot theme too... thinks it's funny. You'll see what I mean if you buy it.PS - one of the best Dolby 5.1 experiences is the soundtrack from Team America - World Police. It's funny, beautifully engineered etc. The movie rocks too - funny but definitely rated 'R+' and NOT P.C."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't even LIKE Styx... but dig this DVD-A!","review":"Not a big fan of Styx, but with the extremely limited DVD-Audio selections out there (at reasonable, non-eye-gouging prices), I gave this one a try.This DVD-A is very liberal with the rear channels. Songs 2, 3, 6 and 7 are especially good, even if a bit \\"musical theatre\\" for my taste. Regardless... when the chorus vocals kick in on these songs, my car's 7.1 surround sound system envelops me.Am I a Styx fan now? NO. Do I like this DVD-A? YES. Very much so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing! Buy the Rough Guide instead.","review":"After using the Thailand Lonely Planet guide (also written by Joe Cummings) extensively this summer (it was extremely helpful), I found the Laos guide really disappointing.Laos is changing at an alarming rate and a lot of the information in this guide was out of date. Also, unlike the Thailand guide which is quite detailed, I found this book to be kind of skimpy. The maps aren't very good, a lot of towns weren't included, transportation details were no longer correct or not included, and because of the surge in tourism and high inflation rate, the prices listed were meaningless.Until edition 4 of the Laos Lonely Planet guide is published, I would recommend buying The Rough Guide Laos which was published in January 2000 and was getting good reviews from other tourists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guide to nonexistent restaurants, old residences, old hotels","review":"The problem with this guide is that, even though things have changed since the last revision, the guidebook hasn't.I would strongly recommend the Rough Guide and a curious spirit over the Lonely Planet guide to Laos, even the new 4th edition. Either way you're going to contend with some bad information, but at least with the Rough guide you won't have to put up with Cummings' writing. I'm sure he's a brilliant scholar, but there are other reasons people go on vacation besides research.Don't miss Luangphabang and the villages up and down the Mekong, whatever you do. Beyond that, everything in Laos is hit-and-miss. Relax and enjoy it. I've never had so much fun on a vacation in my entire life, and it was cheap as dirt, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Proud of It","review":"Lonely Planet has a bad habit of using grim Peace Corps Puritans to write their guides, and the one who wrote this one is even duller and more pedantic than most. He resolutely ignores all that might help you enjoy this wonderful country in favour of long disquisitions on Buddhist cornices. If you are touring Laos in order to learn more about the architecture of temples, this is your book. If you'd like to have a good time in Laos, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Book for travellers in Laos.","review":"Joe describes Laos as probably the most delightful country to visit in South-east Asia.

(So, you could stop reading my review now) But when planning a trip to Laos, one needs to do allot of research on one's own. You can't leave it up to a guidebook. But why would you really want to anyway? Of all the guidebooks on the market, I'd still pick this one as my top choice. It's respectful of Laos, imparts a firm sense of culture, history and identity with the reader and then let's you figure some things out for yourself. Laos is a beautiful country... but you need to relax and keep in mind the motto\\" LAO PDR...please dont rush\\".... same thing with any guidebook, relax, enjoy the read and let the journey take you where you need to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the cities and history","review":"If you are doing the regular two week route of Luang Phrabang - Vang Vieng - Vientiane, this is an outstanding book, despite the inevitable dating of hotel and restaurant info. You have got to expect this considering how much stuff is written about these three places and Laos in general, leaving only a third of the book to cover the other 99% of the country.The only really useful bits were the map and suggested itineraries where the authors actually offered their opinions.Generally the \\"around the area\\" sections are far less useful than anyone you would meet in the street of the town because of the emphasis on describing restaurants and hotels. As if anyone would have difficulty in finding the only restaurant or guesthouse in a one street village.Buying a map and talking to other travellers was far better, more fun, and cheaper than the LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a full update--Hua Phan Province info VERY out of day","review":"I bought this edition for a bicycle trip across northern Laos, but was very disappointed with the very old and inaccurate information on Hua Phan Province in the northeast of the country. It's a remote region, and probably on few travelers' itineraries, but it was on mine. I felt let down that the authors didn't provide up-to-date coverage. Neither author even visited the province! That's not good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very sad piece of work","review":"It appears that the more Mr Cummings writes, the worse his pamhlets degrade. If you have an intense interest only in how to locate the cheapest noodle stands and flea invested \\"Hanoi Hiltons\\" this book is for you.

Don't get me wrong- Joe Cummings does an excellent job in his Thailand books, however, in Laos, he falls short.

The spanish guitar flair, his incredibly strong melodies, lovely Christian lyrics without being cheesy or tired, and a really wonderful male voice.

The screenplay was so flimsy that there was hardly any dialogue spoken, and the film itself was so long and drawn out that it was difficult to sit through. What I hated most about the film, however, was the portrayal of Eva Kant. In the comic, Eva was an elegant, brilliant woman who was Diabolik's equal. The movie made her nothing more than a sex kitten and a damsel in distress-helpless without her man! I'm surprised that the filmmakers let her out of the bedroom.I know that the original creators of the comic Diabolik helped write the story for this film, but I'm curious as to whether they were happy with the end result. I can tell you, I wasn't! If you really want to honor the memory of Angela and Luciana Giussani, read any English version of the comic that you can get. Hell, even the animated series Saban's Diabolik was quite enjoyable-and the portrayal of Eva Kant was much truer to the comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've got to be kidding?","review":"I also saw this on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

You'll still need a book on Kanji and actually speaking the language, but for just Hiragana/Katakana this book is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool","review":"Remembering the Hiragana was an indespensible aid in learning the Hiragana. After completing the course, I probably had 90% retention, and it was 100% after practicing for only a couple weeks (I take private Japanese lessons). I also found a work book called \\"Easy Kana\\" that has good drills, converting sentances from kana to/from roumaji, which was very useful.I will agree with the others here that the Katakana section is not as good as the first. However, after I had a very good feel for the hiragana, it was not too difficult to master katakana as well.Definately recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit my learning style","review":"I agree with soreloser's assessment. Heisig tries to help you remember the hiragana by providing mnemonic devices (rhymes and visual images). They are hit and miss IMO.

Although I do know there're some transcendental spirits, sublimity and profundity in Beethoven's late music, in his sonatas, string quartets, Diabelli variation among others, he is not religious even till the end but perhaps the greatest music genius and artist. Author also explored Romanism in late Beethoven, which I took less pleasure in reading.

This product is great b/c it's very compact; it's essentially the size of a wall outlet. The fact that you can run the cable wire through it is an added bonus. As other people have pointed out there are 2 drawbacks. 1) you can only plug this into the top outlet which renders the bottom outlet useless. 2) If you want to mount a TV to the wall with a slim profile, this product probably won't work b/c it's too thick, especially when you factor in the depth of the TV's power cord. For what I needed, this was perfect but it won't work for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thick","review":"Hard to determine thickness of this, needs to have more pictures, but at 2.5 inches, it's pretty beefy when you are trying to place this behind a flat panel.

The 2 chapters when the Fellowship meets with Galadriel and when Frodo offers the ring to her are completely unreadable. Needless to say that it was huge disappointment.

Arwen shouldn't even be in the Fellowship of the Ring, she was hardly even mentioned in the books and they made her a central character (replacing Glorfindel, who always seems to get left out of things). They spend too much time on the cave troll, cutting out far more important things to make room for it, mainly plot stuff which I guess isn't as popular.

I was so hopeful when I bought this book, but the main character's voice is so unbelievable. No child of this character's age has the insights or identity development to say and do the things she does. I wish it had been the book I was hoping for. Very disaapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistically inaightful","review":"Fiona Cheng is an eleven year old American girl with a Chinese father and a Scottish mother. She is \\"half and half\\" as she puts it, but is starting to realize that her identity is more complicated than two halves making a whole. Performing in her town's folk festival, Fiona wants to represent both of her halves but scheduling conflicts cause her to have to choose a side. Fiona's solution to her problem helps her realize that everyone has something different to offer about their own unique identity. Namioka's chapter book depicts a struggle to fit in that her readers will relate to, however her reflections on being biracial are at times too perceptive. Fiona's sophisticated musings on her racial identity sound more like a parent's contemplation on her mixed race child than her own. Written in a sometimes tediously moralizing tone, biracial readers of Half and Half may not find a character they can truly identify with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"Very sturdy and high quality, looks fantastic.

I would decide to read a chapter before turning out the light. Three hours, and several chapters later I would force myself to put it down so I would at least get a little sleep before work. The writing is wonderful. It is a collaboration with Roland Barber, but the voice feels like Harpo throughout. The stories of his early days on the road with his brothers- their mother the dynamo keeping them at it- are fascinating to read. He had amazing, interesting friends, the Round Table folks, George Burns. His later family life is terrific to read about. It is a deep book, and a beautiful book. Funny, and touching without being smarmy. A great, great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read - even for the casual marx brothers fan","review":"Read the first five pages and you'll be hooked! I guarantee it. Harpo's autobiography is the funniest, most enjoyable book I've ever read and re-read (5th time now). It's not only an in-depth and personal account of the Marx brothers' careers and personal lives, but a fascinating record of turn-of-the-century vaudville, and the artistic and literary world of the 1920's and 30's. His stories about the Algonquin Round Table are priceless! Harpo Marx inspired laughter through his film and TV work, but it is through this excellent book that you truly get a sense of how extraordinary this man was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superstar of his day","review":"Good reading what a sensitive intelligent gifted person he was. You would only understand this if you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book, amazing man","review":"\\"Harpo speaks\\" is easily the best book ever written by, about, or relating to the Marx brothers. In his sweetly conversational manner, Harpo tells his entire story from growing up to growing old, and its a delight to read. For someone who never went beyond the second grade, it is an impressive effort. Then again, Harpo Marx was not an ordinary man. And in conclusion....(injoke, read the book!) A wonderful read, one you will read several times and enjoy every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and informative!","review":"This was a funny \\"read,\\" as well as a great view of the first half of the 20th century in New York and the 'entertainment world,' as seen by Harpo.

Who knew that Harpo was one of the first US entertainers to perform in Russia?Recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found the book humorous, informative, and entertaining.","review":"Harpo Speaks was an attention grabber.

I'm adding my 10 to everyone elses. I liked the candor and the humor. It doesn't read like a nearly 40 year-old book (I'm not sure what I mean by that but I think I mean something). Like some other autobiographies, sex is mentioned less often than it would if a truthful listing of priorities was made, but I wasn't reading it for that kind of an education."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Marx Brother","review":"Harpo has always been my favorite Marx brother. Although he always played a mute character who was not terribly bright, he was still the easiest brother to like because of his childish behaviour and his plain brilliance as a physical comedian. Since I became a fan, my greatest wish had been to here this master of pantomime speak, even if it was only one word. I guess his often hilarious, always brilliant book is the closest I can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harpo Speaks - Not Worth the price of admission!","review":"Harpo Speaks: Probably the most profane book I've picked up in a long time; I was expecting something written along the lines of the great comedic efforts they made on screen - Wrong!

Boy was I in for a treat. From the first sentence to the last he had my attention. I'm not an avid reader, yet every day I found myself looking forward to spending some time with Harpo. He had the most amazing life for someone who grew up poor and started making money selling junk at pawn shops and playing piano in a brothel. My favorite stories were his adventures with (and in spite of) Aleck Woollcott, living at the Garden of Allah and falling in love with Susan Fleming. When I hit the last few chapters I found myself dreading the ending, having to say goodbye to Harpo. His life was so colorful and rich, but the way the book is written you feel like you're hearing it from a friend. It's a shame that there aren't any good recordings of his voice ~ he surely had one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The one and only Harpo Marx....and also a very nice man.","review":"I found a first edition of this book around 1967. And I enjoyed it tremendously. For a man who never saved photos or press clippings regarding The Four Marx Brothers, the stories told about Aleck Woolcott, the Algonquin RoundTable, were incredibly detailed.And this is where I have a problem with Harpo's book.In Joe Adamson's book, Groucho, Harpo,Chico--and sometimes Zeppo,it was pointed out that Harpo's memories were not all that reliable--one, he was born in 1888,not 1893--and some of his accounts were refuted by eye witnesses to the same.This is still a fine book, I just come away from it now with a different viewpoint--Harpo wanted you to read an entertaining account,in that it is not true,but true enough for one to know.By all accounts, Harpo was a very private man and all the while a garrulous personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing English text about a great artist","review":"While I appreciate the efforts of the author, I am disappointed in the information put forth.

The film is powerful in an understated way, made particularly compelling thanks to excellent location work in many of the real locations, and of course, the suspenseful subject matter. Everything is well crafted, with lots of fascinating detail. My only minus was that I felt it was a bit heavy on narration. Nevertheless, the film will keep you riveted for 140 minutes, which can't be said for many current films. Sadly, the DVD contains no bonus features, which is why I couldn't give the product 5 stars. It would have been great to have a commentary about the real events, or even a little 10 minute featurette. Regardless, it's a worthy addition to your DVD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spy Thiller!","review":"William Holden has a great turn as a reluctant American spy who warms very slowly to the task at hand. He warms considerably when he meets his German contact - the beautiful Lili Palmer. The actors are great, as is the plot and the acting exceptional. One item gets overlooked when others speak of this film, and it is the music score. The love theme used to evoke Lili Palmer's character is one of the most hauntingly beautiful themes I have ever heard. This is a two cassette VHS, so don't let the price keep you from experiencing this great film"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie is Better than the Book......Amazing in every way","review":"I read this book back in the 1970's and I could remember it being one I just couldn't put down.

This is not the case with Once on This Island. Practically every line in Once on This Island is sung, so practically every line is on this soundtrack. Our middle school put on Once On This Island a couple years ago, and whenever I listen to the CD, I can picture every scene in my mind.

From the moment \\"We Dance\\" flooded the room with its pure joy to the final scenes of \\"A Part of Us\\" and \\"We Tell the Story\\", with their achingly beautiful music and lyrics, I was enthralled all the way.

I mean for god's sake, the leading character turns into a tree at the end. I saw this play at a high-school once. I must admit I cried at the end, but for god's sake, the use of scenery bothers me. I mean, I know it's supposed to be told by peasents, but atleast have a decent backdrop.The cast album is very, very, very, very strange. The orchestrations are fine, but the cast is weird. I really must admit I thought the two people playing Tonton and Mama have some of the worst voices and worst acting skills.The girl playing Timone is good. She's good, but the show could do without her. The team of Ahrens and Flaherty could do without this show, but hey!

I've seen it in several incarnations, the touring production, as a summer stock in my hometown of Rochester, NY, and as a collegiate production, and have developed more appreciation for it every time. As my title indicates, anyone familiar with the music will know that \\"Mama Will Provide\\" has to be my all time fave song from this score. And that is what makes me say that if you were to choose between the 1990 OBC and the London Cast, go for the Original. It is a more vibrant, youthful sounding cast. The soul which eminates from these performers is tangible; you can feel Timoune's pain at Daniel's refusal to part with his more comfortable wealthy lifestyle, and you smile along with the Gods' playful attempts to amuse themselves while toying with the emotions of humans. I put this in the CD player on my long drives back to NY from the midwest and instantly 2 hours are erased from the journey!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can love this soundtrack even if you haven't seen the play","review":"I first saw this play about 12 years ago produced beautifully by the Repertory Theater of St. Louis. It was wonderful! I have owned this music on vinyl, then on tape, and am now buying it for my MP3 player.The wonderful thing about this soundtrack is that it is the entire story told in music. There is no spoken dialogue needed in this play. If you listen to this music you will understand the entire story (and it's such a lovely story!)The other wonderful thing about this soundtrack is that the music is of the sort with which you can - and will want to - sing along, dance along, repeat some tunes depending on your mood, and hum in the shower. The performers are wonderful and the music is memorable and the story is timeless.This is a unique and masterful production. You'll never get tired of this music. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!!","review":"Once on this island is really an exquisite show. I recently preformed it and found myself humming the catchy tuns of the musical.

I have never been a big fan of action adventure books, finding that the visual description never does what it's supposed to. Dillon and the Voice of Odin is the exact opposite. Derrick manages to put the reader right into the action barely letting us catch our breaths before we are off on another adventure, running for our lives.Plenty of characters are brought into the action and good or evil, you become attatched to each.I think my favorite part of the book are random hidden references to some of the best cult and blockbuster movies. If you look close you'll see a few. I think my favorite is the Princess Bride reference.I love this book and if you read it plan to just sit down and read it, don't expect to put it down and come back to it. It's adictive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hodgson scores with haunted sea stories","review":"William Hope Hodgson, whose life was tragically cut short in WWI, spent years at sea while a teenager and young man, and his experience with that life allowed him a familiarity and ease in telling sea yarns. The stories do have a theme that crops up regularly, namely, the device of the Sargasso Sea, the seaweed 'island' that inhabits the mid-Atlantic. All of the stories are entertaining, and a couple are classics. You will recognize one of them as an old television episode. Some stories are more engrossing than others, but on the whole, this is a book you will have trouble putting down, if you like sea yarns and weird tales. The poems, while not great poetry, also pack an emotional punch, and I'm glad they were included."},{"rating":"2","title":"from the deeps","review":"while surfing today i realized a fear of drifting seaweed. these stories are affecting me just as the lovecraft did, maybe worse. i never thought cthulhu would get me, but something in the weed seems very possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"IRIVER review = rocks","review":"I think the IRIVER is far better than the i pod in any comparison...and your company supplying iriver products is amazing. thank you and keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH, I reallllly wanted to like this, but....","review":"Shannon was far too whiny and neurotic to take.

I just hope the main character has a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engrossing enough, but shallow","review":"I read the book pretty quickly and it held my attention at the time, but really, it left no lasting impression. No characters were developed enough to make me particularly care about them, including Shannon, the narrator. The dilemmas and problems she faced are familiar enough ground that to make her book stand out, she needs to have something more than just a recitation of life events, but alas, that's all this was. Can't say I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and original","review":"I enjoyed Welcome to my Planet more than Bridget Jones' Diary. Shannon seems so real - in fact, I was often reminded of one of my favorite books, She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb. I love her very original take on life, and her sometimes sarcastic and bemused comments. As a Minnesotan, I enjoyed the local flavor of the book - St. Olaf College referred to as Uff Da U, and mention of Southdale Mall, etc. This book is entertaining and touching - I LOVE Flo, her mom. I've been recommending this one to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author could do much much better","review":"There are some very clever turns of phrase in \\"Welcome to My Planet\\" and the choice and handling of narrative structure was interesting and masterful. The open-endedness of the 'conclusion' was not completely bad either, insofar as that seemed to be one of the themes of the book (getting Shannon to the point of recognizing all the possibilities ahead of her). Overall, however, despite some flashes of real character, the book feels shallow. The insights to which the psychologist leads Shannon are not earth-shattering, and even though the inescapable banality of Shannon's life seems to be another of the book's themes, the book's presentation of this life never really rises above triteness itself. With a richer subject, this author would certainly be capable of writing a much better book. The journey of self-discovery in this one, though, was too obligatory, predictable, and, ultimately, indistinguishable from so many other 'autobiographical' narratives."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland","review":"I too read this book quickly... devoured even. But it doesn't stick. I didn't like the main character... or hate her for that matter. I needed to feel one of those emotions. In my opinion, Shannon is a whiner (character not author). I couldn't figure out what her problems were. I wish that people in my age group wrote books that had some lasting resonance. This feels like a fad of a book that won't be remembered after a few years. Which is too bad, cause being a 30 something Minnesotan who attended the University of Minnesota and is a bit overwhelmed by life from time to time, I should have been this book's most ardent fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"OYE!!!","review":"I bought this book simply because I heard excellent reviews. I started to read it last year and the only thing that kept me turning the pages was from mere shock. In shock that the book didn't get better. I found myself skimming the pages--as if I had to read it for a class and was being tested. I read the book and had to put it away and came back to it months later--I finally fininshed it feeling way more depressed. Depressed that I had spent all that time reading this book! All in all, it was well written, and I would not be shocked if others enjoyed this. I simply believe it takes a certain type of sense of humor to enjoy such a novel. I suppose we read books to maybe get a better insight on life or to \\"escape\\" if you will from reality--this book did neither of those things for me. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting","review":"I started reading this book, and 100 pages in, i had to stop. Shannon is a huge whiner, and this book is just her ranting about how bad her life is. Personally, I thought it was a waste of time and i would not recommend it, even for a beach book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome To A Really Great Book......","review":"\\"Welcome to My Planet: Where English Is Sometimes Spoken\\" is a real delight and such a funny novel about a normal 30 something gal with a dead end job, LOSER boyfriend who sort of moves in without telling her, and a family who really adds comic relief. *Mom (called Flo) is hilarious. I loved her character. The interaction between mother and daughter is a running dialog of tenderness, comedy, and fear. I loved that about this book. What mother/daughter team doesn't represent all those different faces. This is an a well written book by a talented author who certainly has a voice and something to say. I found it intelligent, fun, and very enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"neurotic","review":"Sheesh. I feel sorry for Flo the most.

Quite often I wondered if I was missing something. I also found the main character to be quite annoying and wanted to tell her to quit whining.

I really love how personal Shannon gets in this book. She's honest, funny, and has some very legitimate life struggles. Whether you are 18 or 38 you can appreciate what she has to say. I often laugh out loud because she is just that funny... or has a knack with wording her ideas. Anyways, get this book and you might be pleasantly surprised. Especially if you like authors like Amy Rosenthal. =]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book I hoped it would be","review":"I completed agree with Jilly Bean's review.

It has been passed along to many of my friends and we all agree... So groovy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a surprise!","review":"I was wondering around the bookstore when I spotted this cute little book on the shelf. The cover was appealing so I picked it up and read the back. It was about a single woman,mid thirties struggling with boyfriends, job, mother and therapy. Sounds familiar I know but I was pleasantly surprised. I most enjoyed the bantor between mother and daughter it was downright, laugh out loud , funny at times. It's a little book I plan to keep on my shelf.I learned some things but more importantly I had some fun.

I just couldn't get into the story and struggled to finish it, but alas I gave it up. My tip: go to your library and check it out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly inciteful!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I took it at first to be a lighthearted story and found myself loving to hear what Flo would say or do and how it shaped Shannon. I did not pick up this book thinking that I would ever relate to the characters but in a way I did and found that I did not want to put it down. I read it in four days and I bet I would have finished it in one day if not for other responsibilities. I just thought it was a fun book, but laced with little incites to wake you up or remind you of things you know but forgot or maybe never realized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, bad ending","review":"I read the excerpts (...), and I thought it would be a lighthearted and insightful book. Instead, it left me depressed. What does this say about 30 year old women? Not much, I'm afraid. No character in this book was anyone you could root for. I kept wanting something extremely good or extremely bad to happen, but it never did. I can't wait to go sell this book to Half-Price books. It is not even worth shelf space in my library. I would only recommend this book to those who would like to be depressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Endurance","review":"....look to Shannon Olson. Hers is a voice that we will surely hear more from, as she catapults toward the writer of distinction she is and will be. I'm only to page 49 and I had to set the book down and write a review, to spread the word on this exceptional debut. Her dialogue is crisp, funny and insightful (feh to Kirkus) and I was also touched several times, seemingly from out of nowhere. Now I must get back to my reading....Ms. Olson, I applaud this marvelous effort....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Conceited","review":"I'm a little uncertain as to how to describe this book... thinly veiled autobiography or work of fiction? I found it disconcerting that the author couldn't find it in her to develop new characters and used her own name, occupation, habits and quirks, as well as those of her parents. The ending suggests an slightly fictionalized autobiography; in which case this book is a rather unimaginative tale of \\"woe is me.\\" Definitely not a lighthearted read. I, too, would suggest the library version. Not something to read over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"This is yet another angst-ridden (but trying to be funny) account of a directionless woman dealing with approaching thirty spawned by Bridget Jones. This territory has been covered before with more wit, style, originality and humor (by Elinor Lipman and Laura Zigman for example). Unlike other readers, I could not relate to Shannon at all despite sharing many similarities with her. I found her boring and irritating. Based on the other reviews, I had been hoping for and expecting much more. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Disappointing","review":"From the title and the book description, I was hoping Shannon Olson's \\"autobiographical novel\\" would be witty and poignant, and speak to me, another newly 30-year-old, in a way that was relevant and entertaining. Was I wrong!Instead, this is one of the most DISAPPOINTING books I've read in a while. Olson tries so hard to be funny, but she rarely is, and the few times that she almost succeeds, she repeats those jokes, like a bad sitcom rerun. More important, though, Shannon (or her alter ego)is unlikable, self-centered, whiney, annoying, and stupid -- and I just didn't find my own or my friends' experiences in this book. She/the character fails to gain any meaningful insight, and the whining never stops. I kept reading thinking it would get better, or she would CHANGE somehow, but I finished it thinking, \\"And that was it?\\" Yep. Not entertaining, not insightful, and boring. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely fell short of my expectations","review":"I, too, really wanted to like this book. But how can you like an eternally depressed woman with nothing interesting to say. The main character is so lame, as a matter of fact EVERY character is so lame and uninteresting. I really didn't get the point of this book. It tries to be insightful (I'm assuming it is, it must be trying to say something) about a young woman's search for a life, but it's way too pathetic. She has no female friends, no clue about what she wants, I mean I can't stand her! The book isn't even written with a sense of humor. If you want a funny, endearing story about a woman's \\"coming of age\\", check out Anna Maxted's Getting Over It. It blows this away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put off in Portland","review":"Weak on character, strong on packaging, Welcome to My Planet promises comedy but delivers cliches. I was very disappointed. At times, Olson rises above glib quip to real insight but these moments are few and far between. Essentially plotless, Welcome to My Planet seems a sad example of publishers' efforts to cash in on Melissa Banks' well-earned success by churning out wannabes. If this is Shannon Olson's planet, I don't wannabe there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time!","review":"I loved Bridget Jones, and Jemima Jones, and thirty-nothing, and expected a great read because of this book's adorable cover.

The dust jacket describes the book to be full of mystery and endeavors. Rather, it was a retelling of events. I finished the book unsatisfied. It's about a fourteen-year-old boy who recounts the story of the most adventurous summer of his life.

Jujutsu DVD","review":"I got this DVD, primarily, because it was inexpensive. The content is OK, basic. I've studied just enough Japanese JJ to know this instructor is qualified. You can argue about whether or not his techniques would work under duress -- an argument you could make with any martial art -- but what he is teaching is standard Japanese JJ. Like any other martial arts DVD, you can pick up some good techniques and ignore what you think doesn't work.The production quality, lighting, sound, is pretty amateur, as if the instructor borrowed a friend's video camera and shot everything on a Saturday morning. It's not bad enough to be a distraction though, and you are able to see the moves. But this is clearly low-budget.Biggest complaint: The title: \\"Fear No Man!\\" is as dumb as it is arrogant, and that is a dangerous combination. After watching this DVD, if you honestly feel that you can \\"fear no man\\" then you should book a room in advance at your nearest ICU."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jointer","review":"I cannot get the fence to be square on both the infeed and outfeed tables.

When you find the hero's ex more likeable and when the attention veers toward other characters, I'm going to lose interest.

This author writes with warmhearted humor about REAL people dealing with REAL flaws, just trying to get by.

The appearance of another man in her life was a great plot point and a way for her to find her way back to Jeff. It made their reconciliation much more believable.

There is no way that someone so unable to get along with others or to take an introspective look at herself could be a sucessful psychologist.Jeff is a great male lead, and should have her head over heels in love.

The hero deserved better and so do we."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Fooled","review":"Don't be fooled by the cute cover and interesting description. I was so disappointed with this one.

Then out of the blue a third character is introduced who is supposed to be Kate's perfect man and she starts dating him and falling in love with him. Meanwhile Jeff has realized that he's in love with Kate and he thinks there's something fishy about this other guy. So here I am wanting to read scenes about Jeff and Kate and all I'm getting is Kate and the increasingly suspect other man.

The book is 375 pages of sweetness. Verity is sweet. Her love for the dark forbididng Lord Harkness is sweet, his feeling that he is too crazy/dirty to offer his love is sweet. Yada, yada, yada...I don't know - the village folks are terrified of him yet no one leaves. He gives them homes, jobs, food and they are cruel to him. And he stands for this? His mother-in-law, well, she is a nut case and he puts up with it? Yes, there is the whole guilt thing but did anyone else note he never, ever mentions his dead son? Does he visit the grave? It was like a non-event. And he is Lord of what? Is he an Earl, Viscount, what?? Only diehard sweet regency readers should read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark hero and a bride sale????","review":"Interesting story line that I had not read much about before. The hero (James) has gone off to the war in Spain and when he comes home he obviously has posttraumatic stress syndrome, which of course no one including him understands. At the same time, the heroine (Verity) is being sold, by her husband at an auction in a little town square. One thing leads to another and James ends up buying Verity from her husband. It is interesting to see how things progress. Verity is not made into his mistress instead she is introduced as his cousin, though many know differently.The story progresses as you find out what happened to his previous wife and see how Verity comes to care for the town and those around her. Including the bad tempered James.I enjoyed this story and recommend it to others as not the normal romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK!","review":"Oh, you'll flip through the pages alright!

Once I finished the series on DVD I was looking around for a \\"season 2\\" when I found out that there series was based on comic books. I went to a store and bought vol 1 and read through it really fast. It draws you in and entertains you, and keeps you in suspence with its great illustrations and dialog. The irish and germans in the story are noticed as their accents just jump of the page at you. COnsequently I bought vol 2 + 3 and I am eagerly waiting for volumes 4, 5,6 and however more there might be in the worksIf you are new to manga comics this might be a bit of a learning curve (as it was for me) but I did not mind as I was quite entertained.Kudos to the author and the team that brought it to us in english!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little vengeance between friends","review":"Ned Maddstone is a blissful young man whose life seems destined to be perfect. He has a marvelous girlfriend and a promising future, but he also has a few so-called friends who wish him harm. A seemingly-innocent promise made to a dying teacher combined with a mean prank on Ned avalanches into a series of events that lands Ned on a remote island as a sort of political prisoner. Separated from all he's ever known, Ned nearly descends into insanity, until a fellow inmate befriends him and helps him to find a way to escape. And he does so, in order to revenge himself on those who destroyed his life. Originally published in England under the title \\"The Stars' Tennis Balls\\", \\"Revenge\\" is a retelling in a way of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". Fry's writing here is enthralling, and while I do like his \\"Making History\\" better, this book is worthy of recommendation for its potent renderings of the nature of vengeance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other Stephen Fry","review":"For fans of Fry's first novels (and I am fully in this corner), this is an unexpected departure. Yes, the stylishly wry writing is served up to some degree, but here he devotes more energy to plot than turn of phrase, social comment, and dry wit. His adherence to the Monte Cristo storyline doesn't blunt the surprises; in fact the vengeful acts are so unexpected, so grimly dark, that they seem almost unFry.I miss the droll Fry, the upper-crusty Fry, but this new novel certainly offers other quick-read pleasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fry's Dark Side","review":"This is definately not the usual laugh out loud Fry novel. Still enjoyable! Fry definately has a gift for words...My only complaint is that I had a hard time being sympathetic with any of the main characters. Ned Maddstone, who were are supposed to root and feel sorry for, I think, actually becomes very unlikable after a time and the rest of the characters I was either neutraltowards or hated, such as Ashley Garland.Worth the read even if short on the laughs I'd come to expect after Moab is my Washpot. Fry is a mixed lot, and can apparently write a pretty serious novel too, complete with descriptions of an asylum, a bloodthirsting for revenge, and diabolical, and dirty politician whose sins have gone unpaid too long. Read and enjoy the dark side of Fry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor clone of The Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I heard the author interviewed on the radio and he said he'd written a chapter and a half when he realized he was writing the Count of Monte Cristo (but since Dumas stole the story he figured could to).I should have re-read Dumas's classic instead. This isn't a classic. Somehow it isn't as rich in details. The original was very complicated. This is thin, flat and unsatisfying. Somehow Fry's story has more white space in the text, you just feel you are missing out on the beautiful details and plot twists and complexity of characters.Dumas made each act of revenge seem fitting. Fry makes it seems just dirty and petty. Dumas had characters with doubt, Fry has characters too flat to doubt.Go read Dumas, the (original) book was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't finished it yet, so it could be 4 stars or 10 star","review":"When I first started this book, I thought \\" Oh, no, a book about young school boys, which I don't like.\\" (the boys, not the book)However, within a few pages Mr. Fry reeled me in and now I can't wait to see what happens next, especially the revenge.I am 70 years old and find it very difficult anymore finding good, juicy books.Upward and onward. If I don't like the ending, I'll revise my review, but I hope I don't have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is a movie waiting to happen","review":"If the Count of Monte Cristo was not recently remade into a movie, this one would be destined to be made into a movie staring Matt Damon next year. The writing was enjoyable and and it was a quick read but it was such a direct take off the original Count of Monte Cristo that the suspense was never there. The only difference was it tried to add a \\"feel good\\" ending that did not really work.If you have never read the Count of Monte Cristo or really like classics that have been updated to include cell phones and the internet, this is not a bad book. If you prefer original thoughts and themes - get the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fry's one mistake","review":"Everyone should be allowed to make a mistake now and then, so let's forgive Fry this mistake, albeit a big one. I really am a fan of Fry's books and my advise is : buy all others, but leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate","review":"It has some amusing bits, but the author trudges through the plot with little grace or style. The idea of updating the classic revenge novel has a great deal of merit, but this is not the book that pulls it off. The ending is classically and depressingly modern British and as such is unsatisfying to anyone who does not have bad teeth and live in an awful climate. Perhaps the audio version will benefit more from Mr. Fry's excellent sense of comic timing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fairly stupid tale","review":"Mr.Fry's Revenge tests the credibility of the reader to the extreme. His character not only learns seven or eight languages from his tutor as easily as you learn to chew gum, but he can speak those languages so perfectly and without any accent, that he can pass as a native wherever he goes. He also acquires an amazing proficiency in business which would provoke serious jealousy to more than one executive of Enron. Not to mention that the character shows up in England out of nowhere with a misterious identity which no one can blow wide open , as if such thing would be possible nowdays (try to sell this idea to to Britains tabloids!). I frankly think that Mr. Fry found in \\"the Count of Montecristo\\" tale an inspiration for making some good money writing a book without putting much effort on the task. That is brilliant!. And fraudulent also!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this junk","review":"I ordered two, thinking it was a great design. The idea is great, but somewhere this went really WRONG! I can't tell if a made in China issue or if the design is just that poor. The force required to turn these two was just crazy, they wouldn't stay on the bottle. I sprayed one with Silicone as that will usually do the trick with a plastic on plastic part. No luck! Hopkins needs to find the source of the problem and fix it or just not sell this model at all. It's total JUNK and I can't rate it lower than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even try to use, hard to turn","review":"I bought this thinking it would be a nice way of adding oil to my airplane that would avoid making a mess and would be easier than a funnel. However, when I received it and start playing around to see how \\"easy\\" it would to be use, it was actually not that easy to turn the flow valve mechanism. I even tried gripping with a pliers and working back and forth a while thinking it would losen up from being new, but no such luck. I figured once I got oil on it making it more slippery it would become even more of a challenge which is why I just returned it.I gave it 2 stars rather one because I suppose it will probably work, but I just didn't like the design so I didn't try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildly imaginative and a real hoot!","review":"I read Tex & Molly a couple of months ago and it hasn't left me. I wish I had a copy here right now as I submit my review to accurately cite some of the cooler parts, but I've passed it along to too many people who are enjoying it just as much, if that's possible. The book was wildly funny, incredibly imaginative and rife with characters I could recognize from my own life. Tex was particularily loveable as the idealistic hippie who's still trying to figure out what he wants to be when he grows up. I particularily loved the \\"afterlife factoids\\" interspersed throughout the book. I got quite a few funny looks from people on the bus because I had to sputter to keep from laughing out loud. Thanks, Richard, for a wild ride. Best lot of characters I've seen in a long time. You've written a book for crunchy pagans like myself.

I know that many Judeo/Christian movies tend toward B quality and I choose to rent them anyway however I do feel I was a bit mislead about this one. I tried to watch it, really I did, but alas after 25 minutes I had to turn it off. I think it was the props that did it. I just couldn't take it seriously. The makers meant well and I admire their initiative but to agree to rent it out on Amazon surely wasn't a good idea. The movie description should clearly state it is an amateur film.

This movie has about 2% Biblically-sound material, and 98% of stuff that was either made-up or perhaps 'based on some extra-biblical writing'. The acting was bad, the cinematography was horrible, and the plot was a train-wreck. This film was so bad, it made me laugh (sadly). It is NOT even remotely close to the Biblical narrative, so if you were hoping for something based on The Bible, RUN the other way.Sadly, this is the WORST movie I have seen in a long time.

The carbide tips can be sharpened with sand paper or a dremel tool many times before they are shot. Bits like these are great for making joints. Having the joint stepped is actually better than just a Tongue & Groove joint because there is more surface area to create friction, or to coat with glue if you wish.

So much more attention is/has been given to medicalization of women's bodies, especially women's reproductive health (appropriately), that I was delighted to find this book.

There is plenty of action and suspense as Rackley tries to save Leah from the leader, an arrogant and evil man called \\"Teacher\\" and his zombie like associates.

In the one instance where it did cut through the wax entirely, it wouldn't remove the resulting plug. Mostly it just manages to mangle the wax seal and simply make it more difficult to remove the old fashioned way.You can tell from the first moment you lay your hands on it, it's a cheaply made device.

It's tough to find 28x32 pants, so I was happy to see these jeans. But, he could not even get these jeans over his hips. When it says \\"original fit\\", be careful. Plus, the jeans are skin tight, especially across the waist / crotch area. A 28x32 of these jeans is really for a 26x32 person. So, order up one size.

Jay Mohr isn't exactly a funny guy. Just DUMB, which is fine if the movie is actually amusing, but i swear to God I only cracked a smile (not even really a smile--a smirk) once during the whole movie, when there was a parade with The Pope on stilts. And I was -drunk- when I saw it and in a very easily amused mood, too. I've seen Goodfellas and Casino probably 50 times, so I at least had hopes there'd be some funny \\"in jokes\\" for fans of these movies.

And like all Brazilian music, the combination of driving, complex rhythm and haunting, sensuous melody is remarkable and invigorating. Saying that this album isn't as good as her others is like saying that sapphires aren't as good as rubies, diamonds and emeralds -- all are very good!

It will serve to keep people from moving west if they believe that life is that grim, dark and hopeless. It was a torment to read.

The Panasonic looks great with HD stations. SD color is a little less refined, but sharpness is quite good at typical viewing distances. Blacks and color suffers a little at large viewing angles.

But more importantly, this thing just stopped dead in its tracks after checking and filling seven tires. Yep, couldn't even get through all tires on the second car. It just stopped. Given Amazon's return policy after 60 days, the shipping will cost as much as getting any return, and I don't want to exchange it for another piece of junk. LOOK ELSEWHERE for something more durable. I'm guessing you get what you pay for in this category of mechanical contraptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus rating!","review":"The details given in the product listing claim 300psi output...the product user guide that came with the product specs only 140psi! Watch out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted","review":"I bought this in late July, and although slow to fill car tires, it got the job done. I liked being able to set the desired pressure and not have to hover over it watching the PSI. However the unit died on me less than 2.5 months later about the 6th time I used it. Neither compressor or light will now come on.

I only used it a few times to maintain the tire pressure on my pickup, no heavy use. Amazon's return policy was flawless though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I had given this a very bad review because I was using it wrong. The barometer has a marker to automatically stop when you reach the desired pressure. I had not realized that (as a good man I never read the instructions...still haven't!). So I thought it couldn't be used for any decent type of pressure. Once I realized that it worked just fine. Great litle tire pump and lantern!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Works okay, but delivers very weak pulses of air. It takes forever to pump up pool toys; I wouldn't even attempt to pump my truck tires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after after not so many uses","review":"Worked ok for about 20 times. Now it stopped working. I would love it to be replaced. Anyone know how? It was very noisy and jumped around. I would prefer on that plugs into the wall and not into the car cigarette lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I purchased this item for its small size to carry in the car. The second time i used it it broke. Both times i was using it to fill a lawnmower tire. The tires max air pressure was only 10 pounds. Its a nice concept but if you want something to last its probably best to purchase a compressor a bit more substantial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car tire air compressor","review":"I've owned a few of these 12-volt car tire inflators. For the price, this is by far the best one. It inflates quickly, and is less noisy. The built-in flash light/safety light can be very handy. Also, the long plug-in cord is a plus. And the best feature of all is the ability to set the air pressure you need, and walk away from it because it shuts off automatically when it reaches your desired PSI. That's great in bad weather situations. Nothing negative to say about this item. I HIGHLY reccommend it. Buy one for each vehicle, they're inexpensive enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It works well and I have alhaving one available.ready had to use it. It serves well for what I needed. Thank you for"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the job done.","review":"Gets the job done, however is noisy and only works with 9 Volt cigarette lighter and takes a few minutes to fill the tire with air. For its price, no complaint. Has no carrying bag either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice addition to the emergency kit","review":"Got my compressor a couple weeks ago and so far it has been really good , I tried right away on my car and it only took a couple minutes to top up my tires to 35 psi , it took about 20 minutes to inflate a truck tire from flat to 60 psi so that is about its limit , no really bad since the tire was big and it was completely deflated , a little loud but I expected that , for the price you are getting a good deal anything better will cost 3 - 4 times more so this one is perfect for light use .Someone mentioned problems with the connection to the tire valve and the first time I used it the connection was a little hard to push into the valve and the compressor would shut off immediately giving me a false reading on the pressure gauge , after close examination the inside of the connector seems to be a little rough , but after a few times putting it in and out of the valve the inside kinda molds to the valve and works fine , never had any more problems with it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful tool in the car and in the garage","review":"I have owned this tool for almost a year now, and have used it regularly to maintain tires at proper pressure. Easy to use, reliable, light is useful when needed.A tad noisy if I want to find a fault with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me.","review":"I've had this for several months now and use it on my 15 inch passenger car and truck tires. It rapidly boosts pressure on up to about 34 PSI, after that, the pressure raises very slowly. I usually keep my tires at 35 PSI but found that I can save a lot of time by setting it to 33 PSI. This should work well for most passenger cars. The auto shut off is neat and the pressure gauge agrees with my old tire pressure gauge. I would have to guess that it is pretty well calibrated. For the price and functionality, it beats the heck out of using the old bicycle hand powered tire pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what it does.","review":"It works great with my 2008 Honda Fit. I bought this for the obvious reason of what it does. Every 4-5 months I need to put air in my tires. When my tire light comes on, I keep saying... I'll get it at the gas station... oh, I'll get it next time. Oh, I'll get it next time. And before I know it, 2-4 weeks have gone by. Now, that I have it I put it in immediately so there is no problems to worry about.Highly recommended.It is a bit tough to get it off after you've put the air in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I've owned this thing for about 6 months now, and I love it so far. It can be a little loud, but it works great and I love the automatic shut off once your desired PSI is reached. The 12v adapter has a nice long cord, so reachable to all 4 tires. I haven't used the flashlight feature on it, but as a inflator, it works great. And the gauge seems pretty accurate (as compared to my digital reader)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"I had this unit for just over a month and only used a couple times with no problems. Then recently tried to inflate a bike tire, which it is capable of doing, and when connected to valve stem it stops. Runs when disconnected from stem so something shutting it done when trying to put air in a tire. No good and very frustrating for a new product that recieved such good review. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Good product. Haven't used more than twice. I like the compact size. I bought my first unit in 1993 and I have used it until it literally became brittle and broke. This unit is so surprisingly compact compared to my first unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Chinese POS","review":"The reason a person buys a product like this is to have the ability to pull it out of your trunk when you see a low tire and inflate it. The third time I tried to use it, it failed. I tested it on different cars, to see if it was a problem with the car's electrical power. It wasn't. I tried it on differenet tires with different valve-stems --- still wouldn't work.AMAZON should not be selling CRAP like this and then after 30 days sticking customers with a defect / non-functioning product."},{"rating":"1","title":"want our money back","review":"The connection to the tire valve doesn't fit. It is cheaply made. We want our money back. We would give it 0 stars but this site thinks we haven't rated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Chinese made junk","review":"I should have known better, but I purchased this with points so that we'd have an inexpensive, portable inflator. After using it only 3 times over a month and a half, the compressor no longer works. I used it twice to pump up a car tire, and my wife used it to pump two bicycle tires. It worked fine on the first but died on the second. The light still works but no compressor. Why can't anything last? Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pump","review":"I just bought this unit recently for the third time. It is a great small pump, I like it. It pump a bit slow but it does not give any problem except when you finish pumping, it is difficult to detach from the tire valve. If you don't pull it quick enough, then you will loose some air. I believe that the manufacture should read the reviews and make improvement to make a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"works perfectly","review":"This is exactly what I needed, it is easy to use and you don't have to worry about reading the tiny gauge numbers sicne it cuts itself off in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked good","review":"Took a little while but did a good job. Was a little tedious putting it all back together but it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inflates Tire Quickly","review":"I bought this for my daughter to use on her car. She loves it. Slight problem is that the pressure dial does not turn the pump off at the set pressure. She uses a separate pressure gauge to verify her tire pressure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 12V inflator for a low cost","review":"Gauge is not totally accurate, but once you determine it's margin of error, you can determine the needed adjustments. Otherwise, it's a very good inflator for the money if you need a 12V pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"A throw away item that will break with minimal use, but after the warranty has passed.","review":"I do not write reviews much, really only if I like something a whole lot, or if I want to warn people about something. Sadly, the latter is the case in this review. This item was only used 3 times all year, and then less than 1 month out of warranty it breaks completely down. I bought it of course to inflate my tire if it had a slow leak, just like keeping my pressure at the right level for each season. I tried to just give one tire a bit of air - just the 4th time using it - and no compressor / motor. Completely burned out. It may have been run during the 3 uses for a total of 10 to 15 minutes. So if you want a unit that will last just past the warranty time, and then die - even though you only used it for a total of 10-15 minutes, then this item is for you. Otherwise, save your money because this item will NOT be there for you when you need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limit Switch a Pleasant Surprise","review":"This inflator is quite convenient, except for the fact that the coupling to the valve stem does not come off easily, losing air in the process. I did not see a product spec. that identified the red \\"circle\\" on the inflator as a pressure gauge AND a limit switch, allowing the user to set the desired pressure and walk away, and not have to use a manual pressure gauge to check the tire pressure. This is a feature that I was surprised to find, and pleasantly so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tire Inflator","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Gas statons with compressors that work are increasingly hard to find. I felt she should have this tire inflator in her car at all times. The feature I like about this unit and the reason I bought it is you can set the desired tire pressure by turning the red ring on top so the pointer points to the desired tire pressure. The compressor will turn off when the preselected pressure is reached. Another reason I selected this compressor is it has a tire quick connect end, which allows connecting and removing the compressor to and from the tire quickly. The power cord and hose are plenty long and are stored in the internal storage compartment. The last feature on this device is the work light. This is handy when needing a flashlight in a dark location like the side of the road at night. I would recommend this to someone looking for an emergency tire inflator."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 months later","review":"6 months later and this can't even generate enough pressure to inflate a soccer ball, let alone car tires. Don't waste your money. Spend a little more and get a decent inflator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Nice, compact unit for inflating cars, suv's, bikes, motorcycles, balls, etc. The good thing is it automatically stops when the desired psi is reached but bad thing its not 100% accurate, usually have to put it 3-5 psi higher. Only suv's tires takes little time, overall a decent item, easy to carry/store in car for emergencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and not useful for much else","review":"I haven't tried this on a actual car tire so I can't comment on that. But I purchased this as a portable inflator for pool toys at the beach. Well 20 minutes later and my child's small pool toy was still only 1/2 filled. I was able to blow up the second by mouth before the compressor finished the first. Also I purchased an wall outlet adapter for use with this compressor but it wouldn't work.

The Griswolds go off on a vacation in Las Vegas, and what happens there is so minimal it's a wonder why they even bothered to make a movie. Chevy Chase seems tired and weary as Clark, this time finding himself becoming a gambling addict particularly at the mercy of the blackjack dealer, a whimsical Wallace Shawn. Meanwhile, wife Beverly D'Angelo finds herself a wannabe companion for a quietly lecherous Wayne Newton and the kids go off in their own directions, the son becoming somewhat of a mini-Mafia man and daughter a caged dancer. Randy Quaid returns as redneck cousin Eddie, who has become so predictable his character is merely a caricature of himself.

However, I do not see the benefit of printing that book. I would rather prefer reading an extension in his Volume 1, Fascicle 1 (Art of Computing Programming).Let's be fair... At least it is interesting to read Knuth code style.

I recently saw the famous Twyla Tharpe Dance company dance to this music in the Paramount Theater in Seattle, and It seent me over the edge - absolutely beautiful to see this wonderful, upbeat music danced to by five beautiful, fun-loveing and artful dancers.

The text is well suited to the intermediate level history scholar who needs to gain a broad perspective, prior to conducting more detailed analysis.The book is long, longer than it need be. At times Mr. Cantor strays from his subject matter with verbose asides. The text can also be rather dry in places. With this said, Mr. Cantor's work more than offsets these weaknesses of style by providing broad content and many excellent insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here","review":"If you are a scholar, classicist, or Christian, this book will disappoint you. Dr. Cantor's book presents much opinion, few facts, and no citations. Typographical errors abound in what is billed as a 'completely revised' edition of this work. These typos were distracting, but that they were coupled with a polemical, bombastic style that left me more often enraged than entranced, made reading almost unbearable. It is a shame that this book has so exalted a reputation and doubly that it is used in universities to teach history. I like my histories, especially when they attempt so broad a focus, to be balanced and source-based. If you are looking for a brief overview and chronology of the middle ages, you can probably find it here, but you would be better served seeking them elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is written in a engaging style that is fascinating and easy to read.

I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and readable","review":"Professor Cantor provides the definitive short history of the Middle Ages.

Dr. Cantor, an excellent teacher of history, successfully points out how major medieval upheavals that took place largely in Western Europe will continue to exert their influence well into the second millenium A.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed by the book. More properly, it should have been named \\"The history of the Roman Catholic Church\\", since three quarters of the book are devoted to christian theology and church institutions. Very little attention is paid to agriculture, technology, mililary organization, diplomacy, etc. Moreover, the books never strays outside the Western Europe. The Balkans, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe are hardly ever mentioned, and the Moslem and Jewish cultures are treated only as external influences on the \\"civilized world\\", not as parts of it. Throughout the book, \\"civilization\\" is implicitly equated with christianity, - and only one of its varieties, at that. I ended up learning far too much about obscure doctrinal disputes, but nothing about the real world that paved the way for our own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertized","review":"This book is totally wrongly titled. It has little to do with \\"The Civilization of the Middle Ages...\\" Instead, it is a rather shallow and superficial history of the church in medieval times. Other than church history, there is very, very little about the medieval world.In addition, the author's constant use of pejorative terms (dumb, stupid, incompetent, etc., etc.) to describe individuals is nether enlightening nor, it would seem, very consistent with what is supposed to be a scholarly work.Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen before you buy!","review":"Please listen so the samplers if you can to ensure this is the album you want.

His knowledge of and facility with Anglo-Catholicism is unique, especially since he can turn it into laugh-out-loud comedy. His characters are well developed and garner your sympathy, and he leaves you with a rare sense of our humanity and shared irony. Again, he is a craftsman, and his writing is superb. This novel is short and especially funny. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"While there were a couple of moments I laughed out loud, overall, I really disliked this book.

The novel is witty, funny and highly critical of Catholicism. If you like Joyce's Ulysses, you will love Lodge's British Museum. Lodge's use of parody and pastiche make you feel as if you were in Conrad's, Kafka's or Woolf's shoes. It is the best example of the neo-realist, anti-modernist writing of the 1950's.

I recently upgraded to XP, and checked out the troubleshooting guide at compaq.com, where it says that you can get drivers to make this scanner compatible. It's NOT. They wanted me to reinstall my brand new Windows, which wouldn't really solve anything. Don't get this scanner if you have XP or plan to upgrade to it in the near future, it's not worth the struggle.

We keep ours in the trunk of the car for emergencies, and it has saved the day more than once, allowing us to air a tire up for long enough to get to the tire store for repair/replacement.

One of the features I loved was the valve that allowed you to take pressure readings without having to disconnect the nozzle. Unfortunately I lost mine and thought I could buy another one to replace it. Unfortunately the new one does not have the valve any more, so I have to take the hose off every time to read the pressure, which is a pain in the butt. Unfortunately, I'm past the return window (by a couple of days no less) and Amazon will let me return it at my expense and will only give me a partial refund. That will cost almost as much as what I bought it for. I still give it two stars because it is a good little compressor and it does a great job of inflating things. It's too bad I have to pull the valve off to check the pressure now or else it would have definitely gotten 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than imagined","review":"I haven' t heard from my brother-in-law if this works or not.

There does not appear to be any warranty, and even if there was one, it would not be worth the shipping charges to send it in for repair/replacement.I used this thing once to inflate a basketball and it immediately blew a fuse. The unit does NOT indicate how much power it needs and I assumed that the standard 10 amp fuse on the cigarette lighter should be enough. Replaced fuse and then it worked on the basketball, but then a few months later it was blowing fuses again. I went to a 15-amp fuse, which did not blow, but the compressor would chug a couple of times and then stopped. Apparently its life was over!

However, if you want an exceptional live document from the end of Townes' career, where he \\"wore his skin like iron\\" and his \\"breath was hard as kerosene,\\" then this is the cd for you. To hear the aged Townes sing a song like \\"Lost Highway\\" with its lyric \\"O'er a life of sin, I paid the cost,\\" you can't help but feel like that man understood those lyrics like no other, and it's a kick in the gut. His version of \\"Ira Hayes\\" will tear you to pieces, and the song \\"Highway Kind\\" will leave you slack-jawed. It's the honesty of these recordings - warts and all - that leave me in amazement, because after all those hard years, Townes was running strictly on emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"tvz's songwriting at it's starkest","review":"Yes, his guitar work isn't as great as is used to be, and his voice sounds downright pathetic at times, but every track on this CD is beautiful.

I didn't really care for \\"Out of Time\\" that much, although the science was well-researched. On the other hand, \\"Bob the Great!\\" was an hilarious sci-fi humor story.

I can't imagine this being sold in the conditioon it was received, but if it is viewed without flipping it open it does \\"look\\" new. Should there be grip strips that were originally on the inner top edges - if so they are gone and left lots of scrapes behind.

As others have noted, it came with a large sticker on one side that was difficult to remove and left behind an adhesive residue that cannot be removed. Also, the edges are very sharp and I cut myself while trying to remove the sticker. The spring tensioner is very weak, and doesn't hold up the knapkins properly. Finally, because of the sharp edges, you run the risk of scratching whatever surface upon which it rests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for us","review":"Okay, I really wanted to like this. I was thrilled when I easily peeled the dreaded sticker (that has given so many others fits) from the side...no sticky mark or residue at all! My problem came when I tried to remove the napkins one at a time which seems to be the redeeming quality of this product. To my extreme disappointment, they didn't come out one at a time. \\"What am I doing wrong?\\", I found myself saying. Then I realized, I shouldn't have to figure out how to \\"correctly\\" remove a napkin from a holder. After much trial and error, a super quick flick will produce the best results...but not consistently. If it is too full, or too low on napkins, the quick flick method does not work. Last night my husband tried the best method (quick flick of the wrist) to remove a napkin from this holder and actually said, \\"I can't believe how much I hate this thing.\\" That was my cue to write this review. I really wanted to like this product, but it just wasn't in the cards for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good but may scratch your wood table","review":"The napkin holder looks and functions well, but after a few months of usage it appears the bottom has left some scratches on the wood table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish & Functional","review":"This napkin holder not only looks nice, it also works quite well. I have a 4.5 year old and a 2.5 year old pulling napkins out of it during their meals and as long as they only pull on one, that's all that comes out.The only con is that this is not made out of the stainless steel that my stove or fridge is made of, which resists finger prints. Those show up quite well. That's the only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars. However, even knowing that, I would have still purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I bought this about two years ago because it look fashionable and modern for my kitchen.

Really nicely designed napkin holder which holds a good handful of napkins and allows you to remove just the amount you want without the whole lot coming out. The brushed steel finishes off the look.Okay - the negative and there's only one. And that's the brand maker's label stuck to one side. Nothing will remove that glue and I've tried several of the suggestions here. I even started off by heating it with a heat gun but it still left an ugly rectangular blob of gunk. It ruins the item canceling out any positives. I have no idea why the manufacturers are still selling this defective item.Rather than go through the return process I intend to wet-sand down the brushed nickel with increasing grades of glass paper.

The napkin holder itself is a beautiful piece and functional, especially for various size napkins. However, it's pointless to own it if I can't remove the sticker that is part of the product packaging. It's bizarre that between soap and water, goo-gone, and the \\"hair dryer trick\\" that OXO says to do, I can't remove the sticker. For a ~$15 product, it's not worth the time I've put into trying to remove it. It's not normally an issue for most products, but with the stainless steel look, you don't want to damage the outside by scratching the sticker off. Other than the sticker issue, I love this piece, but have thrown it away as ironic as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticker doesn't come off","review":"I saw the sticker problem mentioned in other reviews, and thought it would have been fixed by now.

All other holders either allowed the napkins to fall in a heap unless full or held the napkins too tight causing several to come out each time. This one solves both problems.

I'm pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in OXO","review":"I like oxo products but this was just a waste of my time. As other people said, they put a HUGE sticker on one side of the product which is impossible to get off. There is also a barcode type sticker underneath, which leaves residue as well. For being stainless steel, it is going to reflect some kind of mark even after trying to get the stickers off. Plus it reveals fingerprints a lot more than other materials would.

Since there really isn't a comparable product, I thought I'd take my chances. I'm glad I did.Yes, the sticker does leave a weird residue. It's almost like the glue interacts with the steel and results in some strange reaction. The sticker will definitely leave a mark when you remove it.However, the sticker was only on one side, and that side is against the wall, so I don't mind. If this item were in the middle of my dining room table, I probably wouldn't be able to stand the irremovable sticker residue (actually, I haven't tried removing it, but I read that other reviewers tried Goo Gone, and if Goo Gone doesn't get it off, I don't think anything will).Despite the sticker issue, the item is very functional and saves valuable counter space. It also look great. When there are fewer than 7-8 napkins, removing one requires a quick tug. I try to keep it full because napkins are removed much more easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase this napkin holder!","review":"First of all, there is a huge sticky label on the side which is very difficult to get off and leaves a stain.

There is no question about it - it is a great piece of music. But to listen to it eight times in a row is a bit more than one can endure. It probably wouldn't be so bad if the CD didn't contain two versions performed by James Galway. To listen how such a wonderful composition is turn it into commercial trash finished me off.

In fact, Pachelbel's canon is not a canon at all; just several variations over an obbligato base line.After hearing the \\"canon\\" for the umpteenth time, I have found it to be shallow and dull, especially on this recording. The recording is repetitious and utterly dismal. Track 5 I find to be especially abominable; the words over the intrumental music make no sense and are not sung in Pachelbel's language and style; the words are inauthentically sung. This is baroque music, not comtemporary christian. Also, there is not even an original performance with a chamber group or organ.

It was the one ray of sunshine throughout the whole dark depression. Don't pay any attention to these reviews, because no one can decide for you. Cleo definately showed off her brilliance of harmony, and is a true gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"very physical book","review":"I mean a very physical book in the sense that it takes all the matters with the point of view of physical insight. The treatment of bosons and fermions is quick clear and it seems like a sleight of hand trick. The interaction of matter and radiation is one, perhaps old fashion, complete source of actual calculus difficult to obtain in other sources. Other topics about perturbative calculations and feynman diagrams is also very clear and straightforward to the mater itself. I recommend the book to all students in the graduate level, thougth a very russian style is a must for the great style lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emulsion Cleaner for Negatives","review":"I haven't had a chance to review it yet. First I have to read the book about scanning negatives, then I will clean the negatives that have scratches and dust on them. Then I will try the emulsion cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so useful for hobbyist","review":"This stuff is just plain noxious. You can't use it in the house. I used it outside on the porch, spraying a tiny bit on a PEC Pad and wiping the slide. Some of the older (ca. 1963 Kodachrome) slides were damaged by the fluid. It worked well on newer slides. The best results were obtained when slides were so dirty that they were basically unusable any other way. Some had mildew on them and this cleaned them up pretty well. It also removes gummy deposits well. In most cases, just blowing dust off the tray-mounted slides using canned air, them blowing off the scanner platten glass and immediately scanning, was the best way to get clean scans. Also, light brushing with a lens brush can be helpful, as well as light rubbing with a PEC Pad. Using this photographic emulsion spray is definitely a last resort. After scanning several thousand slides, I still have most of the bottle left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruins your negatives","review":"Beware of this product. I used this with their Pec-Pad on my Kodak VC400 120 film. It was just regular film but left a streak when it dried. I try to wipe it off with the cleaner but every time it dries, it leaves a streak so its pretty much on there permanently."},{"rating":"1","title":"No effect on ink","review":"I ordered this in hopes that it would take gel ink off several professional photos that were about three years old. The ink had been on the pictures about four weeks. The cleaner had no effect on the ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Completely runied any negative I tried it on, Just left un-removable streaks in the negative that were embedded in the surface. I found it completely useless. I can't imagine how this can be designed to use with film negatives. I was using Kodak gold 200. Guess I need to find another way to restore negatives to a decent state before scanning. The rest of the bottle might come in handy for removing marks off walls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this if you want to destroy your negatives","review":"I used this cleaner, per instructions, on some old Kodak Tri-X B&W film and it ruined them permanently. It left a sprinkling of white dots all over the emulsion. I followed the instructions to remove the dots, and it made it worse. I wrote the company about it twice, and got no reply. Luckily I stopped after a few negatives, but the ones it ruined were irreplaceable. I threw this crap out the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use care with this product","review":"Um, this didn't work for me as well as it was advertised. I ruined a photo even more than it already was ruined. I used them on very old photos probably around 1920 and I believe they had also survivied a fire (1945 or so( and storage in a shed for probably the last 50 years. Was not a miracle worker like I had hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good make sure you open a window","review":"So far we found this product be very effective for its advertised use. The only downside and I'm sure this is unavoidable is the fumes that it puts off when in use. Now I don't know much about the chemicals but I do know that for a general film cleaner we have switched to a product that we have to pick up locally because it can't be shipped because of its flammability. Interestingly we found this product we picked up locally did not have the harsh fumes of the one we used to get shipped to us. I know this is a review but it makes me wonder if chemicals are added to some of these cleaning compounds so that they can be shipped state to state. And if those chemicals are in fact the ones that add such a harsh aroma. So in closing just note that you'll need to use this product in an extremely well ventilated area. Otherwise we found this product to be extremely effective for its advertised use."},{"rating":"1","title":"makita chuck key","review":"The description did not match the product so I had to file the pilot by hand to fit the 7/32 hole in my Makita chuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Collector's Friend","review":"I am the author of CANUCK, planned as a companion series to the SOLDAT series; having said that up front, I would like to champion Cyrus' books on German military equipment. His series does a lot of things no other series has yet done; provide detail rich current photos of actual equipment and how it was worn, with detailed information on variants, insights into the soldiers' lives, and some very good comments on telling original items from postwars or reproductions - a must for serious collectors.These books are a great alternative to pricier, and out of print, works like Angolia's much more comprehensive books. For the collector, Lee's books are probably even a little better as the photos are larger and clearer."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally read","review":"My daughter always loved this book but it has taken me a lifetime to pick it up.

I found the spatula set to be very useful, however, please don't use with tomato based sauces, especially if it has olive oil, or any type of oil for that matter. It stained the wooden handles. I have also found it difficult to remove the tops of the spatulas. It says that they are removable, but I have managed only to remove some of them to get the dough out of.Overall, they work well.They have been through the dishwasher, left in hot pots while I answered the phone, so they are pretty durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best spatulas I've ever used","review":"This is my first review, usually I read them but have never written one. I got my spatula set about 2 months ago and love it. I've even left it in the pan while I was browning ground beef and not the slightest mark to indicate so. I remember cooking with spatulas and the more I cooked with them the smaller and more bent up they got till I threw them out. Well, no more, I truly believe this will be the last set I will need to buy. The spatulas are made of quality material, I may not have tested them at the claimed 800 degrees but I have used them cooking up to 500 degrees and not a mark on them.I would have given them 5 stars but I think the handle could be improved. The heads are great but the handles are just thin wood. I don't have fear of them breaking but I think it makes them look cheap.Update: It's now 12/2009 and I still use these for my everyday cooking. 6 yrs later and they are still as good as new."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT SO EASY","review":"On the strength of the previos review from France, I bought this book in the hope of a nice intro to group theory. Imagine my consternation when I read the preface in which it was clearly stated that the book specifically covers FINITE group theory and presupposes that the reader has had prior, elementary course in group theory. If you don't know group theory already, start with some other book, then try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On!","review":"I had some previous exposure to Group Theory, but then my thesis (in Computer Science) actually needed Group Theory, so I was forced to dig deeper and get some real understanding.

Sorry but this was another flop that had potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsiness is charmful ?","review":"The movie had a nice idea but how come a girl so clumsy is charmful and sweet? She is portrait like someone who should be locked in a mental institution, she is as clumsy as a toddler getting into things all the time that becomes annoying like the boy who acted in One Fine Day with Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. Watch \\" Legally Blonde\\" the girl is sweet and naive, learns to be smarter but never clumsy like that, so much that she is really charmful. This Princess Mia is an insult to the actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't like it...","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer who says this film sends the wrong message about beauty and acceptance. But films don't always have to be PC, as long as they're good. This one was not. I found the story and acting corny and awkward.

I recently rented it because I was thinking about her and missing her. It's so fun and uplifting.

Not only does it make Mia seem like a total geek at the beginning, you notice Michael only \\"falls for her\\" after she undergoes her makeover. A great image to put out to young girls, \\"You have to be pretty to get the guy you want, because who loves a girl who is actually comfortable in her own skin?\\". Not.Although, on a lets-not-think-about-the-disintegrating-self-image-idea-here basis, this is a rather cute movie. The books are just way better.

They both had the same had the same plot line which she did not want to a princess. The book and the movie had the same charters. In both the book and the movie her mom started to date her teacher. A poplure boy she likes embrasses her in front Of everbody.The Differinces between the book and the movie are that in the book her mom is dating her algabra teacher and in the movie her mom is dating her debate teacher. In the movie when she got enbrassed it was at a beach pary in the book it was at a school dane. In the book her dad is alive but has cancer. In the movie her dad had alredy died of cancer.

The acting was great and the plot was good, but it was nowhere near the plot of the book.

Although she enjoys the movie, we were both disappointed that it didn't contain both of the Princess Diaries movies, which is what I thought I was purchasing.

Booooo to the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of Disappointed","review":"After reading the reviews on the Amazon web site, I felt I just had to see the Princess Diaries. So I bought the movie at a local store. I was kind of disappointed it wasn't REALLY funny, plus it was a worldly movie. I thought it would be a nice clean movie. I must admit for a new movie, it didn't have any swearing, so that was great. But the story is based around popularity and her being a princess. Other than that, I thought it was a great movie. (starring Julie Andrews, it would have to be great)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Diaries Takes the Throne!","review":"This movie is great for people all ages! It's funny, interesting, and has a really great plot! Even though this movie may seem like it's just for kids, I think everybody will enjoy this!

Usually when that happens to me I end up not liking the movie very much, cause the book is almost ALWAYS better than the movie. But in this case I think they did a good job. I like the actress who plays Mia Thermopolis (though she's probly to pretty), but I gotta say that, I can't see Julie Andrews as Grandmere--she's not wrinkly and weird enough. But I guess her version of the grandmother is okay in its way.Anyhoo, it's worth watching so go watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting, relaxing, innocent movie","review":"Ok, so I'm not 12 and I LOVE the Princess Diaries. Maybe its because I'm young at heart, but movies like this always make me smile. Amongst the barage of other movies you can't take kids to, this comes along.

Anne Hathaway gives a good performance too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but doesn't compare to the books.","review":"I gave this movie five stars because it really is great, one of my favorite movies. However, I think the books upon which the film is based, by Meg Cabot are ten times better. If you loved the movie, you will adore the books.(But, beware...Mia's grandmother is nothing like how Julie Andrews was in the film!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"... I'd buy it","review":"The movie was predicatable, but most movies these day's are. It's a good, funny movie and people in the family can watch. And even though it gets shallow at some points, isn't that the way some people are in real life, anyway?Most people complain about making over Anne Hathaway and how you should see the inner beauty.... but people in real life do look for looks (not saying I do). And at the end, Michael [Robert Schwartzman, who is an AWESOME actor and singer by the way] ends up 'seeing her when she was invisible'. So it shows the boy who isn't shallow and DOES see her inner beauty does end up getting the girl.The DVD is actually cool because it has commentaries, 'A New Princess' with all the actors and making all of the movie, and 8 deleted scenes.The casting was done pretty well, except - I don't really think Mandy Moore is that great of an actress, she kind of overacts on the screen - it's fake.

If it was possible to give it no stars I would. The book is sarcastic and witty while the movie, sadly, is sachrine drivel. The movie script reads like it was based on a sixth grader's book report of the back of the book. Disney hacked a wonderful book to shreds and commited its burned peices to film. I can't wait for a remake, this book deserves much better than this film could ever hope to provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books are way better","review":"I saw this movie before I read the books, but the books are so much better than this movie. I was surprised that there was so much stuff changed. The only thing they used was the fact she was a princess. In the book, Grandmere is completly evil but in the movie she is wonderful. Anne Hathaway was not good at playing Mia. The books were so much more funny, but Anne Hathaway lacked the quirkiness of Mia. Read the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting.","review":"Am I the only person who was sickened by this film? A \\"family film\\"? If I had a daughter, I wouldn't let her within 20ft of this movie. Mia (Anne) is supposed to be uncool- we know this from her frizzy hair and clumsiness. But once she gets a make-over, with her hair straightened and her eyebrows plucked, her life is suddenly better. Because she is pretty and a princess, people suddenly like her, and she gets the guy. Of course, we all know he wouldn't have even looked at her before she got her make-over. Is this what we are teaching young girls? That being happy depends on their physical beauty? The whole concept is disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie...books were better tho","review":"I really loved this movie but I have to say, the books are much better. Mia, who isn't the most popular girl in her school, visits her grandmother and is almost blown out of her seat. She's actually a PRINCESS!!!

Sorry, that is the message of the world or we would not have a billion dollar beauty industry.I am a sucker for a Princess movie. What woman or girl hasn't dreamed of being a Princess.

Everyone is intrigued by the Pygmalion formula but this movie had a lot of unnecessary scenes, dragged on and on, and it gets to the point where it even starts to annoy you especially scenes with her best friend in the movie. I liked Heather in \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\" but her character in this, her character just whines and complains all the time. They should have had more fun with it like they did in \\"Clueless\\". There are so many better family movies out there and a lot of those good ones don't garner the box office success that this empty barrell did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie is unrealistic and poorly made. By \\"unrealistic\\", I don't mean that the concept of \\"ordinary girl becomes princess\\" is stupid. I'm always game for some good fantasy. But the way the characters responded to their circumstances seemed stilted and unnatural. Also, the happenings of the movie didn't make much sense. Case in point: Near the end of the movie, Mia is crying in a broken-down car, wet and bedraggled, because she can't make it to the royal ball, while her grandmother (the Queen) is about to announce to thousands of people that the Princess has abdicated her duties. Suddenly, the screen goes black, and in the next scene Mia is clean, dry, and dressed in a beautiful gown, making her royal entrance. Huh? This is just one example; over half the scenes are done like this.

Obviously the guy has fallen in love with Mia before she gets a make-over.Make sure you notice these two self-evident scenes:Scene No.1: the chorus is rehearsing. Michael looks up and find that as if Mia is gazing at him,so he seems to be caught unprepared.Scene No.2: Mia goes to check out how much it would cost to get her beat-on car fixed. Michael offers a free labor and the car mechanic Doc seems amazed. After Mia has left, Doc chaff him, saying\\"Ooh...You're sweet on her? \\" From the way he offers explanation, the way he gazes at Mia's receding figure, everyone can easily conclude that Michael is in love with Mia.so do not keep your kids from it,for it's simply so sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I am 23 years old and I loved this movie.

NOT becuase her dad (who wasnt dead in the books!) gave her some dumb diary. also, grandmere was a cruel but funny woamn in the books. her character in the movie was so whatever. and what was the point of having mandy moore in this movie? so you get publicity out of a bubblegum popstar. and the director actually had the nerve to give her a scene in which she sings. not to mention her voice stinks. so if you read the book and liked it, dont see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"really cute","review":"this was a really cute movie, really different from the books which i think are better.

A long lost heir to the throne of Genovia has been identified as a klutzy teenager who lives in San Francisco. The Queen of Genovia goes to San Francisco and attempts to persuade her to come back to Genovia and take her place as a princess of the realm. From their the typical hijinks ensue. The princess gets an education in proper royal behavior & procedures. The Queen learns to loosen up and relax. Princess Mia also struggles between dating the school jock, who ignored her before she became famous and dating an unpopular guy who has been her friend for years.The story is predictable and hold no real surprises. Despite this I still found myself enjoying the film.

It's low-brow, formulaic bravado involving a motley crew of oil riggers who have to drill a hole in this monsterous rock to blow it apart. The movie runs like a connect-the-dots toward an obvious conclusion. Suspense? Forget it. Plus, the film could have used a better editor; it dies the death of a thousand cuts times 10.

Let's build sympathy for Bruce. Let's feel sorry for two young people in love ... . Let's believe that NASA will send idiots into space to save the earth.

It is not their fault that the movie is a disappointment. It's not that I don't like films that have no ambition except being great fun, because I believe that this is a very high ambition. Only few recent pictues succeeded in being just that and \\"Armageddon\\" is definitely not one of them. It has great special effects, yes, but it has no real momentum. The editing is the worst thing of this film. Michael Bay mistakenly believes that the more cuts I have per minute the more exhilerating and relentless is the action. A fatal error. He should study the action scenes of films like \\"The Terminator\\" or \\"Face/Off\\" frame by frame. What's more, the screenplay gives us no characters to root for.

The only reason to watch it is the first five minutes, wherein you see several small pieces of the meteor hitting the USA. The story doesn't make any sense, the action is just-above-average. The story is so impropable and predictable, it is actually hilarious. Every 5 minutes in the movie something goes wrong, but guess what ... in the end the hero wins. This is a typical example of an American big budget piece of crap. The special effects aren't that good either.

This must be one of the worst movies of all time, the idea is good, and was portrayed quite well in ''deep impact''(although it was hated by people, I really liked it.) Although it starts off ok, then the ''oh the Americans will save the day'' thing starts, just like in ''Independence Day'', although in that movie, it wasn't so blatant.

This film is mind-bogglingly horrible. To think that sentient beings actually congregated and wrote this abomination is a mystery for the Ages. The fact that this piece of crap was so successful is further proof that mankind is regressing in its cognitive evolution.If I was given a choice between being sentenced 5 years in a Turkish prison and having to sit through this film (in its entirety) again, I'd hop on the next jumbo jet to Istanbul!1 star is 1 too many. Anyone who gave it more than that should really take a long, hard look in the mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuine guilty pleasure","review":"With a great cast, spectacular special effects and many shattering scenes that depict hard core destruction on Earth bound cities, Armageddon is a movie you watch with your brain turned off. Not that it's completely dumb, but it's not something you nit pick for scientific accuracy. It's very entertaining, loud and sappy; and man is it a helluva ride. Bay is the best director for this. He has a gift for the action scenes as well as the emotion. They are all overdone and overlayered with a patriotic soundtrack and camera angles that come from all perspectives. The Criterion Collection is full, and I do mean full, of extras and documentaries. If you want a more realistic disaster movie I would recommend Deep Impact. It's slower but a more revealing drama. I still highly recommend Armageddon, just leave your scepticism at the door and ignore the critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesone special effects and a great action adventure flick","review":"This movie with its special effects, story line and the adventure got me to see the movie twice this summer. And I cannot wait to purchase it when it comes out next year. Bruce WIllis has finally come out of the closet with a more believable character. He touched the heart of every man and father of our time. THe rest of the cast was excellent too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fasion Western","review":"This is like the old fasion westerns, where the posse rode out to kill the bad guys. In this case the bad guy is a comet, ready to destroy earth. The special effects of asteroids hitting New York, China, and Paris, are spectacular. The movis is filled with drama, suspense, and comedy. It is also filled with trite dialoge from the cast, but somehow this comes off, and Bruce Willis does a great job being the unlikly hero who saves earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my God what a bad movie!","review":"This movie stinks from the opening scenes to the last. I'm the first to allow a lot of willing suspension of disbelief, but this went to far. The begining explosion in space features flames and noise - neither are possible in space. The scenes on the asteroid contradict not only common sense but the movies own description of what gravity is like on the asteroid (one minute the characters sail off into space, the next they are jumping around and coming back down. And finally the heroic end of the movie is witnessed all over the world, shown with scenes from heartland America to Asia - all during day time! Daylight all over the world in Bay's mind. And you could see it shining through his ears. He's a moron with too much money. Well, I guess that sort of defines Hollywood. Beyond that, the portrayal of 'roughnecks' is the director's own idiotic imaginings, The love story simply got in the way and was infintile anyway. The music blew, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because it's my duty!","review":"Why in God's name does this movie average 3 and 1/2 star reviews? I am obligated, as a sentient creature, to bring that lofty average down! Thinking people: unite! Give this movie a 1 star review as soon and as often as you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a trashy film.","review":"This film is not worth watching - it's kids stuff. The action on Earth is simplistic but just about watchable. The action in space is plain trash. They seem to have gone for just about every movie cliche possible - too many to list here - but the 'stupid' Russian astronaut part is particularly tasteless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna good space movie? Watch Appollo 13","review":"Even for an escapism movie, Armageddon is just plain bad. Do this date, I can't figure out why oh why if you're gonna blow up a asteroid the size of Texas would you need a gattling gun? The film made no sense, to say the acting and dialog made no sense. Horrible film to watch. If you want a space adventure that is gripping and tense, then I'd suggest buying Appollo 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst action movie I've ever seen","review":"This is an extremely badly made movie. The only entertainment it provides is that you can laugh at the director's stupidity. The other comet movie (Deep Impact) is a lot better. If you have to choose one among the two, go for Deep Impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly funny despite seriousness of the topic!","review":"At first it seemed another testosterone junkie action flick. However, to my surprise it was very edge of the seat action, mixed in with lighthearted humor. The actors portrayed the meteor as the arrival of the pizza delivery boy. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes mass destruction special effects like those seen in Independance Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Impact.","review":"One will enjoy this movie to a level of inverse proportion to one's intelligence quotient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Excellent - Criterion Version Worthless","review":"If you want to see a great action movie with some romantic overtones and some honest friendships between very different men then this is a great movie but take my advice and only buy the movie and not the criterion version. It advertises a humorous outtakes video and if you think cursing is funny then you will like it but that is all it has to offer. The commentaries do a lot of talking but don't really offer much detail in the way the movie was made. Ben Affleck comes off as a young smart aleck and you are better off buying just the movie, saving some money and enjoying some really great acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"a review by freya and tammy","review":"Tammy says this movie's awesome. She's a big fan of Bruce Willis and the dark skinned man(Bear), with the big wrench. I did not like this movie as much as Deep Impact, but that's because I saw Deep Impact first. No complaints about Armeggedon though. It was well written and acted out. I own this movie, and watch it every time I need some action. Just kidding. It's still a really good movie. Go buy or rent this movie. Tammy and I promise that you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"Simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Instead of listing what was bad, I will list what was good: ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment of the year","review":"This movie stinks from the very beginning. The ending is so obvious you need not waste more than 15 minutes on this *&$. Is this the best Hollywood studio has to offer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Actors, Bad Effects, Bad Story= WORSE MOVIE IN THE WORLD","review":"Simply the worst film I have ever set eyes on. The only good part was the New York part. The Gayest Movie I have ever seen. The stupidest part was THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!! Save Your Money And Get GODZILLA! WARNING STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got boo","review":"I don't know what this film is about.No suspense, no action,no sci-fi.What is it??? One of the worst film in 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"no Sci(ence) and cheap Fi(ction)","review":"One of the worst films I have ever seen. This movie goes no further than being a cheap copy of the film \\"DEEP IMPACT\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth watching but looks unreal","review":"It appears director was always thinking about what could go wrong next"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone notice it has better star-rating than Titanic?","review":"Surprised!! It's very overrated and worst action movie ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you really liked Deep Impact, You'll love this movie.","review":"I have to start this out by saying that I thought that it would be like the 5th element, but the director soon proved me wrong. They had a very interesting cast for this movie. The movie overall is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST FILM EVER MADE !","review":"When I saw this movie in the theater, I liked about the first 5 minutes, then I just remember wanting this retarded movie to end. It just kept going...and going....and going. It just got more absurd as the hours past. Terribal script, lame acting, dorky soundtrack. Especially that god awfull song by Areosmith. Sitting there in my seat after two and a half agonizing hours, I only could hope for a real asteroid to hit the earth to end this movie disaster. Do yourself a favor and buy a different dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armageddon, one of the worst films to ever hit the screens","review":"This movie is yet another flaw by the same guys who brought us Con Air, Gone in 60 Seconds, Pearl Harbor, more and more Hollywood junk, big budget movies with poor scripts,Armageddon proved to be the worst of the bunch, although having a good cast, the producers of the film should have run a second check on the screenplay before handing it off to the actors. The whole dialoge is too abrupt, the whole concept of the movie is very un-realistic, and of course based on a love story just to intice the younger generation of the audience.poor movie script indeedSincerelyAlfredo Blume"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adrenaline pumping tear jerker!","review":"Love him or hate him, Bruce Willis gives an outstanding performance in this present-day thriller. The plot may be the same rehashed story that has been plaguing the TV and movie screen in the recent few months, but the combination of an excellent cast which can pull off the bad boy image while delivering memorable wisecracks, and a few powerful stories within the main plot makes this a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Well written...well acted...draws you in and makes you want to know what's going to happen next...before it was over I cried, my mom cried, my boyfriend's mom cried, AND my boyfriend's DAD cried....a must see"},{"rating":"1","title":"God, no, make it stop...","review":"Oh, man, I tried to find something useful to say about this movie, but all I can do is shake my head and wonder why this kind of movie exists. So empty and unsatisfying. So cold and improbable beyond even science fiction.And adding to the pain is an excruciatingly bad Aerosmith ballad on the soundtrack.Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay must be stopped.Just stay away if you haven't seen it yet. Run screaming. Save yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armageddon","review":"The movie Armageddon is about a group of NASA trained astronauts who have to go on a dangerous mission to help save the world. They have to venture out into space so they can land on an asteroid the size of Texas. Their mission is to drill a very large hole so they can blow it up before it reaches Earth. But no only does it have alot of action it also is a serious tear jerker. It made me cry at least 4 different times. The sad parts don't over throw the humorous parts. Althought the whole story plot may be a bit of a stretch the graphics and actors help to make it more believable. Bruce Willis as in all of his other movies was top notch and awesome' while Ben Affleck wasn't at his best. The soundtrack also kept your foot taping, some songs by Aerosmith. This is by far my absolute favorite movie; it is timeless and will keep making people awe for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Willis back in sweaty vest mode! Yeeha!","review":"The third Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer collaboration, Armageddon sees Bruce Willis back in sweaty vest modein this spectacular sci fi asteroid action fest. And while this does have it's flaws, it's still a cracking high-octane film filled with action and humour. Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi are good make a great supporting cast and add some well-timed humour.The visuals and FX are fantastic and Bay's direction is thankfully lees frenzied than his previous films Bad Boys (1992) and The Rock (1995). Silly and jingoinistic in parts, it's still a great action film as only Bruckheimer could deliver. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Lacks The Special Features","review":"Oh, come on! 1998's second best film (behind SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) needs more to it for the theatrical version's DVD release other than a music video and promo and two theatrical trailers. Get the CRITERION COLLECTION DVD, and skip over this one!MOVIE: Grade: A+THEATRICAL RELEASE DVD: C-CRITERION COLLECTION DVD: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"An intellectual feast - Bruce, Ben and a Big Rock","review":"Not every sci-fi movie is able to incorporate mankinds desire for self-preservation with the blossoming of youth and young love. It is a metaphorical battle between the established way (represented by Bruce Willis) and the genesis of a rebellious new order (represented by the romantic interest - Ben and Jennifer). The rock represents the divisions between these two ideals and in itself is an idealistic revisionistic portrayal of natures ambivalence. It is amazing that the writers and directors were so carefully able to weave this subtle message into such an action packed, spine-chilling, visually astheatic, think piece. Well done chaps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action pack-suspense film.","review":"I think all the actors played a tremendous part in the action thriller that it became. Putting Bruce Willis in there was a great idea. If you ever decide to make another video like that you best be using Bruce Willis. Plus the soundtrack was the best soundtrack that I have heard since Men In Black or even Scream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant allround action","review":"An excelent film that draws you right in!
