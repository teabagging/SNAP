I see links to other groups here, but those groups can't hold a candle to this group. If you like this album and the group, please support them.

I guess I could relate this cd in greatness to the first Strokes cd. This cd has its own sort of awesome chilled out, happy,and upbeat, sort of mellowed out theme to it if that makes any sense. Every song is a highlight. Kissing the lipless starts this cd out on an amazing note, thats followed by track 2 which has an addicting chorus, I'd go on about everysong but you really need to listen to it for yourself.I always try to intoduce new music to people this is one that everyone has always loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't leave my CD player for a week","review":"This CD cannot really be compared to any other.

So ... I sought out \\"Chutes Too Narrow\\" last month and I must say I dig it from start to finish.Singer-songwriter James Mercer clearly loves the written word. His lyrics are cryptically clever and the song structures are quirky, yet they somehow work. Keys-man Marty Crandall supplies some subtle organ work. I really like his creepy prog tones on the eerie folk song \\"Those to Come.\\" My favorite tracks are the challenging \\"Young Pilgrims,\\" the breezy pop of \\"Mine's Not A High Horse\\" and the brilliant \\"Saint Simon.\\" Drummer Jesse Sandoval and bassist Dave Hernandez supply a solid rhythm section and deserve equal credit. Pick up \\"Chutes Too Narrow\\" and by gum, put down that Nickelback record, you nincompoop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Endearingly catchy folk/indie-pop","review":"Chutes Too Narrow is a lovely nugget of pop. It starts off with three brilliant tracks, the first being \\"Kissing the Lipless\\", which contains some incredibly lovely melodies driven by intense singing and light electric guitar. \\"Mine's Not a High Horse\\" has a similar melody but is drier, lower and quite Belle&Sebastian-ish.; \\"So Says I\\" might just be the catchiest song of 2004.The rest of the album continues in this vein but is melodically a bit weaker. However, tracks 8 and 9 (\\"Turn a Square\\" and \\"Gone for Good\\") stand out. \\"Turn a Square\\" has a rockabilly feel to it with a great chorus and \\"Gone for Good\\" is pedal-steel folk-pop.This album reminds me a bit of \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\", so if you like B&S; or catchy indie-pop, this is a must. Very well-written, and the lyrics are surreal and inviting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mazing.","review":"I don't know what drew me to buy this cd. I bought it before Oh, Inverted World, and I bought it before I even heard one song on the CD. I believe that I bought it becuase of the many, wonderful reviews this album is getting.And the reviews are rightfully so. This is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard in my life. Many people say that it's the eclectic mix of sounds that makes this CD wonderful, and I'd have to agree.Also, to me, each lyric can represent a different aspect of your life and be applied in various situations. That sounds very pretentious, but it's true.The album is catchy and there is a sheer wonderful feeling that you get when you listen to it, like you could own the world.All this in a CD that probably plays for only 45 minutes.This CD is great for any type of situation: a laid back party, a car ride, a field trip, anything at all.This CD is wonderful and is 'mazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody brilliant!","review":"The Shins' sophomore effort, Chutes Too Narrow, will make you wonder why every other band that you've listened to in the last 5 years are just horrible, horrible imposters. You'll cry for joy while they wail away on their instruments and you'll thank the gods in Heaven that music so sweet has blessed you ears for the all too short 10 songs on the album.\\"So Says I\\" makes me feel like I got stomped on by angels. It's a materful song with great base backing the vocal tracks. \\"Young Pilgrims,\\" \\"Saint Simon,\\" both of these songs will make you want to tear your heart out because they affect such intense emotion.I cannot believe that it took me 9 months to find this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut From A Poignant Band","review":"Great Debut From The Shins.

This is a CD that you could play for most people without having to skip any of the songs. Heck, a lot of the CD's I own is for the one or two Great songs on it. You don't even have to be a fan of The Darkness or Perry Farrell to like this album either. Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Chutes Too Narrow is awesome.

It is AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"we are a brutal kind","review":"At first this may come off as a step down from Oh Inverted World; while it works in the same sort of indie pop with light tinges of psychadelia of the debut, there's not really anything that will hook you in the very first listen like \\"Caring Is Creepy\\" or \\"New Slang\\" (although \\"So Says I\\" comes close). But the truth is it's just as good if not better than the previous album, it just needs multiple listens. The melodies, while they don't really slam your head with big obvious hooks, are impeccably strong, and there's lots of brilliant little sonic details in the arrangements, in particular the beautiful combination of overdubbed harmonies and violin that close \\"Saint Simon\\" and the teriffic almost Cure-like rising keyboard line in the chorus of \\"Mine's Not A High Horse\\". So give it a chance to grow, personally this is gradually becoming one of my favorite albums of 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"This album took a second to get used to after listening to oh inverted world for so long.

As told by Dell, the younger of the little girls, Flutter By is an excellently crafted story that takes the reader deep into the world of an abused and neglected child who, along with her half sister Lucy, discovers that kind and generous people do, indeed, exist. Sometimes poignant, sometimes frightening, the story evolves around the most wonderful of friendships and the discoveries that the girls make about themselves and life. The surprise ending is a classic. Don't let the length of the novel (85 pages) fool you. Ms. Bell packs more great prose in those pages than most authors do in much longer novels. Flutter By deserves to be on all the best seller lists. I cannot recommend it more highly. Bravo, Cindy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a toy, it is for collectors!","review":"First, let me say that THIS IS NOT A TOY.This is a model that is destined for collectors.

I bought the old vinyl record when it came out in 1963. The new CD provides better sound. This record gives a wonderful cross-section of old-time Delta blues and songs. The truly amazing piece on this album is \\"Slidin' Delta\\"; this version of it is, for my taste, the greatest piece of music-making I know. After listening to it hundreds of times, I still discover new details every time I hear it. It's a relatively long performance, so John Hurt could really get into the piece. (We are poorly served by getting our blues in 3-or 4-minute takes; longer takes are almost always better than the same artists' shorter versions.) The guitar work is beyond belief, and the subtlety of the singing puts to shame most of the \\"blues shouters.\\" Even those who don't share my fixation on guitar work and understated intensity will want this record. Essential for blues and folk-music lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Internet site now longer exists","review":"This product is so old, it's from the 1990's and the part of the game you go online for no longer exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"A little disappointed.

This L1 simply doesn't take good pictures easily. I am a basic user, but my wife is a semi professional, highly educated camera person, and she agrees it ain't just me--she actually advocates returning this one. There is also a obnoxiously long wait for the cmaera to recharge between shots--whether with flash or without. The only thing redeeming--and why I tried this one, is that the lens actually protrudes from the camera body, making it difficult to put your finger in front of the lens.

The pictures turned out great, several pics I took throughout the city almost look professional.If you are considering buying this camera and are on a tight budget (like i was), definitely get it.

It is somewhat of a pain to assemble and it does seem like the basket is not completely level in the stand but it's almost the only option out there. There was another option I found on an eco website but it was almost $100 and didn't seem worth it after what we spent on the basket.

I've written thirteen books on the Civil War and Indian Wars myself, and I understand the importance of good maps. The prose also is sloppy, and the author repeats the same absurd premise - that a few more men in the ranks of one regiment might have changed the course of Gettysburg, and thus of the Civil War - so many times that one feels tempted to toss the book across the room. An absolute disgrace to the field of military history."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted words and no maps","review":"The author, who did a good job with Burnside's Bridge, repeats himself over and over ad naseoum and fails to include maps or drawings to illustrate what he is describing. His main premise is, that had the 15 th Alabama been fully complemented with men and had it been supported by another regiment, Gettysburg would have been a Confederate victory. That is prepostorous, considering the number of reinforcements the Union had.

Each bird listed has a section on song, behavior, breeding habits, nesting, population, and conservation. Flight patterns, nest identification, and habitat are also described iconically. Good range maps are included. The \\"photos\\" will not help much in identifying birds, but a complementary guide such as Sibley's can fill in the gap nicely.

This is NOT so with this case. I had to struggle with the base that holds the camera to the cover. It got to a point that I had to just take out the base and just use the cover. Even then, the cover is not designed to be removed very quickly. I wanted one that you can strip off with one swift motion. This was not what I got.

Even brand new pens seem to write faint, like they're running low on ink. They also run out of ink quickly, faster than I'd ever expect.

But with the small screen and poor cross hairs it is nearly impossible to aim anything. But that isn't the only thing that makes this game feel unfinished and buggy, there is the menu system which you can't use the buttons or d-pad. Also the enemy worms think forever!

The children aren't even in the least bit scary and the little boy who played Issac recites his lines like he's still trying to remember them. There is absolutely no atmosphere, eeriness or creepiness which the original movie had an abundance of. This version is stale and falls flat on its face.

If you are already familiar with C++ and merely want to learn the syntax and features of Java, save your money.

One must read the text once just to get a basic understanding of Java, and then read it again to fully comprehend it.Begining Java students SHOULD read this book, but I would recommend that they try a more user friendly introductory text first.

The authors can't decide if it's for beginners or advanced. In the end its for neither. They go into great detail on some very simple topics and gloss over the complicated.My other major complaint is with the book's examples. Every example is an \\"opportunity\\" to review every concept introduced so far and a few that haven't been covered yet. For example, in the chapter on files, the author's example for reading from a file is a half dozen pages long. It's just not that hard! But you have to pick thru several hundred lines of GUI code to find the subject of the example. By using features that haven't been covered yet you will supposedly become familiar with them.

He really is quite series accurate, with his small watch chain and nicely white trimmed jacket. I also very much like his hair, it's very soft and a great colour! I do have some slight problems though: his bangs are rather high on his head and just a little off center and his grin is off center as well, drooping a little to the right side of his chin. Besides that, though, he is a cute plush and a good item for any Fullmetal Alchemist collection.

So the tip slides itself into the barrel as you're writing and you have press the two halves of the barrel back into each other after every 3 words you write.I guess you could super glue it together... and perhaps not all of them have this problem... but that's my experience and it's totally unacceptable.Update: No, they all have the automatic disintegration feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 of 12 Pens Exploded On Me","review":"Watch out for these pens.

But it was too disjointed for my taste. You think you're going to watch a period piece, and it starts with modern skyscrapers and cars...What? Then it takes you back to Shakespeare times. Then 5 years earlier, then 40 years earlier...By this time, I'm lost as to what is happening. Then it moves forward...are we 5 years earlier or some other space in time. Maybe if you can hold out to the end it improves. But about this time, I turned it off. I figure you have 30 minutes to let me know if you are a good enough movie to keep watching.

The acting was second rate. Redgrave The Elder gave another one of her eccentric performances.Mark Rylance has been called one of the great Shakespearean actors, but from his ham-handed performance in Anonymous he could have fooled me. The men faded into the woodwork.I knew the movie made a hash of English history and theatre and drama, so I wasn't surprised by anything. I got the feeling John Orloff had a list of Oxfordian points he had to include in the movie and once he did, he checked then off. The major problem I had with Anonymous is it's a bore! There is no sense of urgency. The story plods along. The endless jumping back and forth in time made the story confusing to follow.After seeing Anonymous, I understand why it tanked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"Sounded intriguing, and great intro with Jacobi, but (after allowing for the fiction necessary to present their speculative lark) after you realize the only \\"historically accurate\\" thing in this movie is perhaps the CGI scenery, the whole thing lapses into a slow, tedious reinvention of the time based on our own projections and paranoias. The characters are caricatures and cliches and sometimes grossly slandered, albeit well acted. Wanted to see where this was all going but with no sympathetic characters to make me care, I gave up halfway.I hope no one thought they \\"learned\\" anything about history from this movie, not even about the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhleming.","review":"I don't believe Shakespere -- whomever he was- was as much of a pompous bore as he is made out to be in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"This is one of those rare Jems. The story is a unique but intriguing possibility of who William Shakespeare really was. I can see how it can be difficult for some people to follow and helps if you have some fundamental knowledge of Queen Elizabeth and her court. Clever engaging script writing, great acting, and visually stunning. This film is a treat for anyone whos a fan of Elizabethan history, Shakespeare or shows like the Tudors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oxfordian theory presented well","review":"I really liked this movie and all it's intrigue. It purports the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare, not the usual Stratsfordian theory, based on a book written in 1910. A historian told me this is a minority opinion and Wikipedia gives credit to both theories. But whatever is true, the movie makes Queen Elizabeth, the characters, and the Oxforidan theory seem plausable and alive. I thought the movie was well-done and worth a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly written and beautifully played","review":"My number one criticism would be perhaps the title and definitely the cover art. It looks like you are about to watch Hellraiser. Anyway this movie has all the themes of love, sex, politics and war, betrayal that you would expect from a Shakespearean piece. And they deliver with much of the Bard's verses being performed within the story. It's hard to know how much of this movies was based on fact and what is pure fiction. But after seeing this it is hard to rule out the possibility which the movie implies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, nothing to write home about","review":"Thought it would be revolutionary like SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.

Of course, the whole movie is poppycock.The portrayal of Stratford was simply offensive, but in many ways the treatment of Jonson worse.And the full Prince Tudor theory. . . . Filth.Not sure why I drew these connections, but now more fully understand that (a) P.T.Barnum was right and (b) propaganda is a dangerous thing, even very bad Teutonic propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't discuss MY superior theory","review":"Do you know who wrote Shakespeare's plays?I do.ALIENS.Think about it. Man alone could not have written those plays. Why, they anticipated words like \\"downstairs\\" - written before such words came into widespread use! Clearly, the true author of the Shakespeare plays must have been an alien.And what about the weird dialect? Did an Englishman really get basic words, like \\"if,\\" wrong time after time? Obviously, the real author had a lot of trouble with English. The twisted, annoying and convoluted language clearly bespeaks alien influences.If this movie had given so much as a nod to the aliens theory, it would be 5 stars. But it did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood, please stop making historical movies","review":"Many theories have been discussed regarding the identity and authenticity of William Shakespeare. Personally, as a historian and Shakespeare enthusiast, I believe that William Shakespeare himself penned these remarkable plays, but I'm always intrigued whenever other theories arise. However, the movie itself is a disaster. In portraying the Earl of Oxford as the intelligent playwright, Anonymous, Director Roland Emmerich rewrites history... (Spoiler Alert) Not only is William Shakespeare a drunken illiterate fool (much like Bottom in a Midsummer Night's Dream) but Queen Elizabeth, historically the celebrated Virgin Queen, is an emotional whore who can't function without her advisors, commits incest, and has not 1 but 3 bastard children. Once again, Hollywood please stop making historical movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept. But extremely boring","review":"Sitting through this movie felt like I was subjecting myself to torture. I thought it was going to be interesting like Elizabeth the Golden Age, but it wasn't.

Proffessor or student or shakespear aficinado to appreciate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching this movie required effort...","review":"Just finished watching this movie.This movie had a great idea -- original and appealing. I absolutely love all things Shakespeare. HOWEVER, it was very difficult for me to get into the movie, because of all the shifts from present, past, and earlier past. I couldn't easily follow who was young Edward, old Edward, young Cecil, old Cecil, whose father, the multiple Earls, etc. I had to REALLY REALLY pay attention to figure out all the characters which took away from enjoying the story! All in all, it seem jumbled together with the varying timelines and subplots. While concept was great, there was clearly not enough focus on executing a solid story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anonymous [HD]","review":"We downloaded this rental to a TiVo DVR. The movie was hard to follow and not much more than ancient conspiracy theories. Few if any of the characters were worth the time.I am really hear to review the Amazon service.* The movie was very low quality. It disolved into digital snow often while watching. It recovered but was very distracting.* You can only keep it for exactly 24 hours. Come on, no DVD rental place would be so ungenerous. Here is what happened to us. We got sleepy in the middle of the movie. We paused it and started up the next day. We got all the way to the last 15 minutes and the 24hrs expired. This is a likely occurrence since they don't give you 24+the running length of the movie. So make sure you are going to watch it in one go or you will get a really nasty surprise right as the movie is drawing to a conclusion.As for me, I won't be renting from Amazon until the 24hr policy changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not like this film.

Rogue works hard, and is such a wonderful artist, not to mention the rest of the band. This album was so influential for me. I'm a writer and after I listened to this on the way to what was high school for me back then (I'm writing this review kind of late after first hearing it) I wrote so much more. It's spiritual, romantic, emotional, and has an Egyptian feel and tone to it all. I've seen them live and cried in Rogue's arms. This album also got me through some very hard times, along with their previous album, \\"Telemetry of a Fallen Angel.\\" I don't want to say much on the genre because it really transcends labels. It has music and lyrics that will make you feel and help you find yourself. What more could you ask for from this album? What more could you ask for from life?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Acquired Taste","review":"I purchased this cd after first downloading several tracks by the cruxshadows on Kazaa... This is one of my favorite cd's in an eccentric way. It is a bit of an acquired taste for me, compared to the bland high-budgit popular mainstream music on the radio, this band has more personality. Their lyrics are nice and the singing, I love, if a bit different from the adopted bland styles of more popular groups.

An Obscure Geography is set in the eighth grade in a poor rural community; the author captures some of the more obscure nature of the students. I Am Telling You Lies reveals how a Latin American student deals with his family expectations and his physical appearance.Two of the stories are \\"short shorts\\" - Fog misses the mark for this form while Chairman of the Board succeeds.All in all this collection is worth reading.

As a supplement to that text, I procured a copy of this book, 'A History of Economic Theory and Method,' which greatly aided in my understanding of historical economic thought.

The plots are intricate and creative, and there's comedy (sometimes in the most unexpected places) to offset the drama and tragedy. I love that each character is more than simply a \\"hitter, hacker, grifter, thief\\" -- the \\"hitter\\" has a sensitive side and sings beautifully; the \\"hacker\\" played violin and such other incongruous details that really flesh out the characters.But I miss the subtitles most DVDs now come with. I'm hearing-impaired, and I think the only one on the show who doesn't slur words is Timothy Hutton.

Though there are no subtitles, you CAN see words if you turn on captions through your television set. We've tried all 4 caption settings on our television, and nothing worked So, if you don't have a BluRay DVD player, or a DVD player that has upsampling, the captions through your television SHOULD work (no guarantees).

I feel it is incredibly unfair to have the customer PAY to return an incorrect item sent by MISTAKE of the company. Not ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little book for vocabulary boosting","review":"This is a very handy and inexpensive way to work on vocabulary expansion using a systematic approach to recognition of word origins. The book works foward from simple prefixes \\"re-\\" to more complicated prefixed and suffixes (and \\"mid-fixes\\"), such as \\"-gen-\\" or \\"-cogni-\\". One can follow the book foward in order, or simply use it as a reference by picking up given prefixes or suffixes as an adjunct to foreign vocabulary work. I introduced one of my children to words starting with \\"mal-\\", \\"bene-\\" and \\"parl-\\" while teaching him beginning French, for example. A nice companion to Strunk and White's, Elements of Style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Vocabulary","review":"This little book is one of the best teaching aids I've ever come across and one of the best investments I've ever made in terms of lesson planning, not to mention my own knowledge. It groups the word affixes by meaning and derivation. I'm on my second copy. I used the first one until it literally fell apart in my hands.I'm only sorry it's not available in hard cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need an index","review":"This is a great book to expand vocabulaty; it is used by many teachers. My only criticism is that there is no alphabetical index so, if you want to find the prefix \\"pre-\\",for example, you need to look page by page to find it. But, it is definitely worth it once you find the page."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best organized resource for vocab. building","review":"I purchase several copies of this book every year when I have students that finish their 3-yr. dyslexia program with me; it is my parting gift as well as my encouragement to be a lifelong learner. I've had former students tell me that, in high school & college, they realized the value of this particular resource. It is organized by \\"keys\\", each key covering 2 pgs. & listing the word part (suffix, prefix, word stem, etc.), it's meaning, a lot of example words that contain that word part, & an exercise to practice it's usage. It seems simplistic, but you'd have to see it to really understand the appeal. The alpha index in the back gives the key number, not the page number. As a way to expand vocabulary, it is top-notch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book at all","review":"Not a good book at all, very soory I ordered it ( not the fault of amazon's but the publisher's)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ink color change sucks","review":"changing color of ink was stupid, it was a good pen - now it is just more junk - don't buy it and maybe they will get the message"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the pens, but hate the vendor","review":"Package was damaged and only contained 11 not the entire dozen pens.

However, they have changed the ink used in the pens. They call it \\"super-ink\\" and claim that it helps stop check fraud. That sounds great, but the ink itself no longer has that deep bold blue color I've come to love. I'm very disappointed with this change as I will now have to find a new brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning Buyers Beware - Ink Color has Changed","review":"This pen has been a long time favorite.

But Uni-Ball changed the color ink in their blue pens. The ink is now more a robin's egg blue rather than the deep, rich navy blue the pens used to have. I guess the new ink helps prevent check fraud -- but most of the time I'm not writing checks.I'm off of this product.

Bad move, bad pen.","review":"This is classic case of \\"improving\\" a previously great product and then just screwing it all up. Someone should be fired for the so called \\"super ink\\" fiasco. I've been buying these pens by the box full since the mid 1990s, but now they're being marketed with a new design. There are two BIG problems with this - first the pens have obviously been engineered down because now, every time I try to use them when I travel, they leak in flight. I've ruined two expensive dress shirts as a result. The second is this so called \\"super ink\\" which comes out looking like faded blue poster paint. I mean the old design had a smooth, dark, and bold coverage. But these new designs have a faded look that to me seems like the ink is always about to run dry. Thumbs down to these changes. Someone really should lose their jobs for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooo!!!!!!","review":"The new \\"fraud prevention ink\\" is horrible. It does not flow as well, it is a lighter shade of blue, and the pens seems to \\"die\\" almost immediately.

Unfortunately as others have stated they ruined the pen with light, wimpy blue. Too bad since it was a five but the terrible color now makes it a 1 star at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Pen. Ever.","review":"In my opinion this is the perfect pen. Why?1. Fine point, but not on a thin breakable stalk.2. Simple thin body with no bits that come off or break off or that you can obsessively play with. Well, ok, I click the cap, but this does not break or get ink on me.3. Cheap (this is a box of 12).4. Flows easily, doesn't leak or smear.5. When it does run out of ink, it is a quick and unlingering end.6. I love it in blue or red.While other pens are absurdly styled or needlessly complex (like trainers/sneakers), this one is classic and dependable. What a pity that it is getting so hard to find. What a pleasure that one's treasures can still be found on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Listening Experience!","review":"Excellent album with eleven songs that will appeal to a variety of musical tastes. The CD maintains a pleasant flow infusing latin, R&B, & jazz rhythms throughout. The feel-good single \\"Vespa\\" is included. I'm partial to the tracks \\"Love\\" & \\"Cabbie\\".

In fact one of my favorite running shoes 25 years ago was the Saucony Jazz.As to the recent purchase. I was pleased that Amazon made possible the purchase of Saucony shoes. BUT after using them for a short time I realized they were defective. I noticed that the ball of my foot was dropping into a depression which caused my foot to become very sore. When inspecting the shoe closely the slope and placement of the raised treads on the bottom of the shoe and the relative thinness of the inner removable sole were allowing the ball of my foot to drop into a hole which was rubbing and creating soreness. I have partially corrected this by placing a thick piece of doe skin on the bottom of the inner sole. The situation is still not right.thanks for listening Karl Mosher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still A Great Retro Shoe","review":"There's not elaborate or cutting-edge about the Saucony Jazz, it's been around forever, but their simple, unique design makes them a timeless classic. They're incredibly comfortable and while they seem flimsy at first, they actually last a long time. They come in a ton of colors and you really can't beat the price.

If you don't mind the retro look then get a pair cause the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like them on me","review":"I had seen these on someone else and liked them but they had smaller feet, maybe that made a difference. They also seem very flimsy. I ended up donating them.

I bought these several years back, and I used them as shoes to wear inside the house. But since then I've been wearing them for workouts in the gym, martial arts, jogging etc. And even just as going out casual. Basically any type of activity that requires you to be light on your feet or you just want to feel comfy in general. It feels so light that it's almost as if I'm not wearing anything on my feet. It's just a very comfortable, relaxed pair of shoes. I would buy another pair but so far mine held up pretty well. The only situations not to wear I can think of is it's maybe not for long hiking, heavy duty labor-type work (where things can fall on your feet because the padding on top and sides is pretty thin), and where's there's strict office dress code. Otherwise I think these are the best pair of shoes ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly comfortable.","review":"First, logistics review. The shoes arrived pretty fast, but not in the \\"prime\\" time range. In any case, as I said, delivery was fast and efficient.As for the shoes, I couldn't find my size on the colour I wanted, i use a US 8, I decided to purchase an 8.5, and glad I did. I think i could have used the 8 but, these shoes in an 8.5 are THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOES I'VE EVER TRIED. No break in period required, i got them and I went for a 4 hour walk, not a single issue, they felt even more comfortable than my older \\"comfy\\" shoes.I own several other models of more vintage running shoes (air max 91's, various NB classics), For the price i can't see myself going back to those brands.Don't hesitate, just buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"love joe but not feeling this one","review":"I really I did not feel this cd at all. nothing like what i expect of a joe cd, nothing like his first 3. what if a woman is the only song i truely like and one song isnt enough to keep it in the stereo.I tried a few times thinking maybe it would grow on me but it didnt.

Tom Waits, PJ Harvey & Iggy all gave me filthy looks when I popped it into the player. However, a girl needs some fun music & this is it! Like many ppl, I bought this for \\"Dragostea Din Tei\\", but have since grown to like other tracks better (my new faves are the dance tune \\"Sarbatoarea Noptilor De Vara\\" & the ballad \\"Crede-ma\\"). To be honest, I prolly like it more b/c I have no idea what is being said; all too often (for me) great tunes are ruined by stupid lyrics, so its possible that if this were in English, I'd hate it or be too critical.In short, the melodies are fantastic, well produced and not boring. Its brainless fun that makes you smile, and makes a slow day go by faster.Its too bad that O-zone is no longer together, and that Dan Balan, O-zone's founder, has moved on to gothe metal (yes - quite a 180 indeed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Catchy whether it's a ballad or dance song!","review":"Can you get any catchier music than this? Very European! This is American release! Every sound is addictive! You don't need to understand Romanian either to appreciate the quality of the music. The English version of Mai ai-hee is, as expected, not as good as the original. English translation can make the original song worse. That's why Kate Ryan never translated her #1 song \\"Disanchantee\\" from French to English, although all her other songs she did. The French lyrics is so poetric that it is almost impossible to have a straight translation to English!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Transition","review":"Life is one great transition.

It was listen-able. I didn't hate it. But I didn't love it, either. It would be fine background at any goth gathering, but that's about it. The recording quality left a bit to be desired. CD and Digital recordings have kind of spoiled me a bit, I am not used to hearing fuzz or hiss in the background of my music these days. The lyrics, when they could be understood, were rather interesting, but the music is pure Sisters of Mercy knockoff.

This edition, my introduction to Sappho's gorgeous verse, includes one hundred and twenty four of Sappho's fragments and songs, many of them with more than one translation included.This edition also contains beautiful illustrations by Stanley Wyatt who emulates a Greek style. They are well done and complement the poetry well.Sappho's poetry, even in its fragmentary form is quite beautiful. It is no wonder that her poetry has survived to this day. In her time, and for many centuries following, she was considered great, even on the level of Homer and it is well deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes it writes, sometimes not","review":"I have been struggling for sometime now to find a green ink pen that writes decent and is a color of green ink that is actually usable. This is another one in the pile of scrap. The ink is a typical color, but the pen doesn't write very smoothly. Depending on the tilt of your hand depends on how well it writes, and sometimes it just doesn't. I find often I have to dot my i's several times, or maybe half of a word or a letter is missing. I might try a less fine point, but I'm losing hope.

For example, TARP was passed and signed into law by then President Bush in October 2008, but the film portrays the bank bailouts happening as a result of Obama taking office. The film is a series of segments showing Democrats and Independents who voted for Obama but are now sorry that they did. Ultimately, the remorseful voter premise falls short because of a lack of any other supporting material. There is absolutely nothing new here that you haven't heard already. This film doesn't even cover the normal GOP talking points well. This is not a documentary but an hour long PAC commercial that isn't done that well. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"BAYOU BEND","review":"This is a comprehensive, well researched book on a spectacular collection.

The setting for this collection is breathtaking, the mansion is beautiful and the setting, in Houston's finest area has to be seen to be believed. Miss Ima's collection is huge and the house, though large, is not big enough to showcase all of it, so when one visits the house they may see different items then they would have seen months earlier. To visit Bayou Bend in the Spring is to experience heaven on earth. This is a great guide to a singular collection in a unparalled setting.

At this point, I could only receive calls - could not make any outgoing calls or use the phone beyond answering incoming calls. Called T-Mobile and they wanted $10 from me return it for a new one, even though it was under full warranty.

Also sometimes when I call people I can hear them talk, but they can't hear me. It is rather strange. Yesterday I pulled out my phone and realized that the screen wont even come back anymore.

But all in all, it did not quite achieve what I hoped for. As a practical approach, when it comes to implementation, it serves nicely as a reference. The deeper mathematical roots of kernels (especially when it comes to measure theory and functional analysis) are not dealt with at all or just scratched at the very surface. The notation is sometimes awkward, mentioning for example the representation of an object in a given vector space with respect to the basis. And: Too much copied and pasted from the former book about SVMs. Basically, reading papers of Carmeli, Aronszajn and others will give you a much deeper insight into the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Useful Reference on Kernel Methods","review":"The book is divided into 3 parts.

Yes he slows down a little bit, but it's still much too fast to understand exactly what he's playing. He gives no instructions or tips about anything he's playing.

I like the automatic throttle (uses only as much fuel as needed for whatever load is attached). The fact that it's safe for use with computers is the real highlight though-- nothing worse than a power blackout combined with the feeling of being cut off from the outside world.

The only thing the installer said was an issue was the wires coming from the senors to the wall weren't long enough. We have been in the new house for two weeks now and have had no problems with the opener. This model is exactly what it states to be. It is functional and very fast. Our previous home had a loud motor and was very slow. This one is on the quiet side (not silent) and very fast. It also has a good signal reach on it so you can open it when your further away.

This is, unfortunately, not one of his better efforts. I won't rehash the plot - it's less of a plot than a series of vignettes, in any case. But I do want to comment on the performance of the Sasha Grey which is competent but by no means stellar. I suspect the praises she received from some critics have to do with the fact that she was an adult film star and one usually does not associate good acting (in the traditional sense of the word) with professionals in this field. The film is beautifully shot, as is the norm of most of Soderbergh's work, but there just was not enough in the movie to keep me interested.

What I just watched does not look like the trailer at all. The colors were completely over exposed with yellows and reds and so on.

Right up to the point at which some inept actor, on cue from some inept director, mentioned by name the inept oaf currently living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Much more of this film should have been left on the cutting room floor: about all of it, I would say."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't buy me love","review":"The need to love and be loved, to know and be known, suggests director Steven Soderbergh (Bubble), is so deeply and powerfully embedded in human nature that we will do almost anything to get it. We will even pay for it, whether to a therapist, to a personal trainer like Chris, or to a $2,000 an hour \\"escort\\" girl like Chelsea who provides sex, of course, but mainly therapy to very wealthy but deeply lonely men. Mainly they talk to Chelsea, about all the things you'd talk about in a \\"real\\" relationship. She pretends to offer that and they believe they receive it, and woe to both parties when they drop their guard and transgress business boundaries to reveal themselves to each other as real human beings rather than as partners in a transaction. Since human love is one of the few things you can't buy, Chelsea and her clients seek something they can't get and forfeit their closest approximations in what they already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellow, Dolly.","review":"It is a story of high-paid sex-worker and boyfriend of her involved in the lives of others.Rather boring than sexy and provocative, it leaves New York landscapes for different movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girlfriend Experience (2009)","review":"This movie is boring and you don't see much of the girlfriend in it. The DVD case seems misleading because the movie was about different guys telling the girl about how bad the economy is. I threw this straight into the trash after watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype!","review":"I head so much about this movie, mainly because the lead actress is a hardcore adult star. Everybody kept saying how great it was. I disagree. I found it boring and the \\"acting\\" not as good as some of the stuff I've seen on community access. It was like watching a dead pan comedy, except it's not comedy and there are no jokes.If you are a fan of Sasha Grey, you may enjoy this for the novelty. Otherwise, you're not missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"This would have to be the worst ever film. It was so boring it sent me to sleep. Never bother watching this film. I threw it straight in the bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Movie but....","review":"This was a pretty movie to watch. The cinematographer really is great. But that being said the movie, like Miss Greys performance is just vacant. It was an interesting essay on these yuppies who are obsessed with money and themselves but that doesn't save it for me. Sasha is not a 'professional actress' (and no I don't count what she does as acting). She just seems void of emotion and just vacant. I have seen her interviewed on Tyra Banks and in real life she comes off the same way. The story could have been a lot better if say Natalie Portman of somebody who could really act was in her role. She tried and the director worked to her strengths, not having her talk too much but still...This has nothing to do with the movie but I hope the girl takes some acting lessons and gets out of what she is in. She is too young and has too many years ahead of her to be involved in what she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cinematography","review":"While certainly not a great story, it is however engaging and fairly interesting if not a bit esoteric.But what I was most impressed with was the quality of the picture/cinematography. This was shot with an HD video camera and it looks truly wonderful. It serves as an inspiration for what you can do with an HD camera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An objective look at the skin trade","review":"This movie is the latest in a long line of Hollywood productions to take advantage of America's obsession with escort women. Starring porn star Sasha Grey, this movie follows the life of a high-class call girl over the course of one week in New York City. The lead character, Chelsea, is self-employed, and the movie is about how she runs her \\"business\\", promotes herself, finds customers, does her job, and try to expand. Along the way, we see glimpses of her going thru a series of interviews with an investigative reporter who bears a striking resemblance to Ralph Nader. The movie is not about the sex, of which we see none whatsoever. Instead, it is about how she handles herself both emotionally and as a self-employed businesswoman. There is little comedy, less romance and only some drama. And for those who think this is a porn flick, let me say that that this movie deserves between a R and a PG-13 rating. Overall, not that bad, but not that good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing for a little while","review":"The story line was a bit interesting but did drag on for a bit. Probably a bit too much character development. Acting was so-so.Spoiler alert:The ending is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contender for Worst Film of the Decade","review":"While some may praise the works of Steven Soderbergh, this film is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. Sasha Grey delivers a cardboard performance which lacks the depth necessary for the role of a prostitute. Her connection to the adult entertainment industry built buzz for the film, but her performance is nothing special. The movie focuses more on people talking about the economy than holding a cohesive narrative and its jumpy plot line is a disaster. My advice is to not waste your money on the product when there are plenty of other drama films which deserve attention. If you want a more accurate examination of human condition and relationships, check out Marc Webb's 500 Days of Summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 STARS???!!","review":"I loooove Sasha Grey but was very disappointed with this movie overall. Her acting wasn't the best & I expected more. Its not the worst movie but it did NOT deserve 4 stars. I'd recommend renting this film, buying it was a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"This is one of the best cds i have ever purchased.

Every song is great, it's like putting on Zeppelin 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gravy","review":"Best album of the 90's, bar none. If you have one shred of political angst in you or you simply enjoying rocking out, there's no reason why this wouldn't be in your collection. Every song is a 10, Tom Morello(and his magic tricks) provide continuous ear candy, along with the deep, timely bass of Timmy C. and the heartfelt pounding of Brad Wilk on the skins. Oh, did I mention the intense, soul-digging vocals of Mr. Zack? The guy is amazing. I could go on, but you get the idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"prower to the people","review":"This is a trly amazing C.D. It has everything good music sould have:cool riffs, good beats and intelagent lyrics. Zack De La Rocha's policticaly motavated lyrics show no mercy at exposeing the perjaduses and inequailties of capitalisium and socity in general.This is all set to Tom Morello's riffs and awesome distorted guitar souds.This albaum puts all mindless rap/metal bands ,ie. Limp Bizkit, to shame. A have for anyone who likes hard , smart, kick a$$ music."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This debut was awesome. Rage Against The Machine is the pioneer of all the rap-metal bands out their. They can drive a hook while staying hardcore and politically correct. If your tired of all the bands playing on all the Top 40 radio stations and you want to listen to something good, cop this album. I also reccomend Evil Empire, The Battle Of Los Angeles, Renegades, and Live And Rare, yes that's all their albums. Cop them all now. Every single track is good. If you like early Limp Bizkit, Korn, early Godsmack, or any hardcore metal band that can drive a hook while still sounding hardcore, then definately buy all the Rage Against The Machine. Even if you like other metal, or any kind of music, buy all of Rage Against The Machine's albums. No matter what kind of music you like, buy all of their albums, you definately won't regret it, their worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Rage Against The Machine releases","review":"Of the three Rage Against The Machine CDs I own, I consider this by far the best. Yes, \\"Evil Empire\\" is good, but the self-titled release simply can't be outdone for hard-charging music and potent lyricism.If you like in-your-face music, go right ahead and click that cute button in the upper right-hand corner of your browser. Of course, it also helps if you happen to be disgusted with American sociopolitics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This album, along with Tool's Undertow, falls into the list of those albums that you just have to have. To appreciate their craft and art has become such a wanted necessity to people nowadays, it makes it difficult to see them live. Too many people :( But oh well, Rage and Tool are the best alternative/metal/rock/whatdaphuckever bands around. and i have a feeling it will stay that way for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy crap........","review":"I got this album a few years back, just before Evil Empire came out. I had heard it from other peoples copies, and I thought MAYBE it was worth buying. Upon listening, I was completely blown away, and couldn't believe my ears. Possibly one of the most polished albums I've ever heard, the absolute best track is \\"Wake up\\", because it is all out perfect. I can't really say that I dislike any of the tracks, except \\"Settle for nothing\\", which is a very boring song. For any Rage fan, this album is essential. All the crap about \\"Renegades\\" being the best album by these guys is all lies. Buy this one, and crank it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RATM is amazing","review":"RATM is awesome. The great political lyrics, Tom Morellos AMAZING guitar riffs and scracthing (on the guitar strings) is reason enough to buy this album. Also you should check out Audioslave I saw them live and they are completely under rated and another one of my favorites. My favorite track on the CD is Know Your Enemy probabely because Maynard James Keenan from my favorite band Tool is a guest Vocalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deadly Combination","review":"What happens when you fuse metal, punk, hip-hop and jazz elements with three very talented musicians and a guitar genius?RAGE...THe first album was angry and raw, a sense of enrgy never achieved by any ohter group.Evil Empire showed the evolution into more hip-hop. Battle of Los Angeles was an engaging album showing a more refined sound.The last album is lacking in creativity because every song is an adaptation but the musical talent is still raging.My dieing wish is that they will reunite and create another masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up!!","review":"RaTM self titled debut has to to be one of the best album of this decade. Zach De La Rocha is a very gifted song writer and combined with the best gutarist of this generation - Tom Morello - this album is a rock/rap classic. Rage is the only band that actually saying something worth listening to. You may not agree with their politics but at least they are saying something other than doing it all for the \\"Nookie\\" or boasting of their supposed virtuality (whilst in fact many of these bands are very much powerless.) I mean, how many musical groups post a book list on their web page with authors varying from Karl Marx to Henry Miller to James Baldwin? And for all of you who say that Zach is not much of a rapper, I begged you to purchase Lyrict Lounge Volume 1 and listen to the sound C.I.A (Disc 2, track 10) where you can hear his flow. The companero can rhyme.p.e.a.c.e"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best American band since Nirvana.","review":"Don't judge Rage by my one-line summary - it's not the actual music i'm comparing them to Nirvana with, it's the originality and quality. I think the only 2 bands to excel in those categories are Rage and Nirvana. It's a pity bands like KoRn and Limp Bizkit are on the top of most \\"favorite lists.\\"... Buy this and Evil Empire as soon as you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RATM = Amazing!","review":"Wonderful album. Tom Morello (the guitarist) is up there with Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix in terms of guitar talent. The lyrics really make you think and definitley food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vital and aware music..","review":"This debut may have it's greener bits (anyone who has seen the early video clips which look like they were filmed in a mall will know what I'm talking about) but it truly rages in all the right places. First it's just an excellent album to p*** off mom and dad, until you really pay attention to the issues De La Rocha raises to the fore. \\"Know Your Enemy\\" has my vote for the best Rage song ever, and a guest by members of Tool on that track just make it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with the high-energy, explosion of Rage!","review":"Rage Against The Machine's self-titled album is a classic! It doesn't matter if you're a hip-hop head, or into heavy metal, or punk. This album is all those genres in one package! I personally like hip-hop, but with the inventive and politically savvy lyrics, and energy of front-man Zach De La Rocha, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG! This is Rage's best album! Also, If you like this album, You will probably like Limp Bizkit's \\"Three Dollar Bill, Yall\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistable Metal-Funk","review":"The fact that Zach De La Rocha's lyrics are at their awkward worst doest not change the fact that this is the most musically inspired album that RATM released, and certainly the best rap-rock record ever made. No matter how you slice it, \\"Take the Power Back\\" is the funkiest song about eurocentric school-teaching ever put to pen. A must for anyone disappointed with Audioslave's muzzling of Tom Morello's inimitable guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one album....","review":"Two reasons why I like Rage: they don't use synthesizers, and they're good for blasting in a car."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wake Up\\" to the Militant lyrics of Rage Against The Machine","review":"Rage Against The Machine's music is about the problems with the system. Rage indulges our ears to the rythems of bass guitarist Tim Commerford as electric guitarist Tom Morello is busting out his skills to the militant lyrics of vocalist Zack De LA Rocha."},{"rating":"1","title":"the front cover is great!","review":"this is awful material! the songs tell about justice! the riffs are quite Ok but i would like to have more intelligent lyrics like slayer's!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst band is the universe","review":"These guys are terrible. They have absolutely no talent and they act really afeminite. This is music for the mindless. Even Sugar Ray is better than these guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious singer/dumb lyrics sink a great band.","review":"Rage Against the Machine is a prime example of a great band ruined by an extremely annoying lead singer and unintentionally stupid lyrics. While I'm sympathetic with the politics that Rage purports to espouse, the lyrics on their self-titled debut amount to little more than empty-headed sloganeering. Even worse, the lead singer's minstrel-like attempts at \\"rapping\\" would be offensive if they weren't so lame. This jerk almost makes me long for Vanilla Ice.What saves this album from complete worthlessness is the band's brilliant punk-funk-metal fusion. If this had been strictly an instrumental album, I would have given it at least 5 stars. As it stands, it barely gets 2. Recommended for those who like to think about \\"important\\" issues, but not too deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY AWSOME BAND","review":"Rage is tied with 311 for my favorite band. I also think the Urge kicks some serious *** too. Rage Against the Machine is a CD you can just listen to. You don't have to skip the bad or anything like that because there are no bad songs on this CD. It just beats Evil Empire by a bit, but it is the best. They are also very kick *** live."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no substitute!","review":"There is no true comparison for this band. They live what they sing about, and it shows in every track. Mad funky bass lines, a guitarist who can lay down Sabbath-like guitar or The Edge-style sonic textures, mixed with lyrics that are 100% political and 100% angry, 100% of the time. It will open up your mind to what's going on out there. This is a top-10 of all time CD, and the best debut by any band since GnR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rap/metal at its best","review":"These guys are the Metallica of rap/metal. They come at you with a no frills, hardcore rock and rap combo that can't be stopped. For any Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, or Korn fans, these guys are the original hip-hop rockers, so go get 'em now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, unique sound","review":"I started out by borrowing this cd from a friend and then ended up buying it right away. Every song on this cd sounds different and has a strong message too. This is a great freshmen effort from a great band. Definately a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best rage cd ever","review":"it is a masterpeice. all the songs are individaully amazing imigane combining all together. its an amazing album you must own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their politics is bad, but their music is great","review":"I forgive them for not being politically intelligent because their music is great. They're my favorite band easily. If having crazy political views makes it so they put out great music, so be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convinced","review":"After listening to this album several times I have concluded that it is way overrated and doesn't deliver the goods despite of all the 5 star reviews here. Sure its better than linkin park and the lot but that doesn't say much at all. Musically this album cannot compete with with other far more interesting acts of that era such as soundgarden and RHCP whom displayed far more class and intelligence in their sound.The lyrics and vocals sink things much further as they come across as very pretentious and quite obnoxious, with little variation.Halfway through the album I get really tired of it all. Certainly impressionable and anti-everything types will love this but to me what could have been more becomes rather annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The final rap&metal fusion?? Nah, it's just rock'n roll!!!!","review":"Rage's self-titled debut is one of the most signifigant metal albums at the 90's beacause of it's crossover potential. Metal bands like Faith No More had rap elements in their music but this album is the final mixture of rap and heavy metal. But that is not the only reason why this album is bloody great. Tom Morellos unique guitar-playing and Zack De La Rochas angry punk-influenced rapping is the thing that makes Rage sound so fantastic. Band's sense of dynamics is also amazing, thanks to Brad Wilk and Timmy C. This record swings and rocks and sometimes blows up to my face letting me wanting to hear and see this band live."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the top 3 of the century","review":"Let me first say that i am a real music fan and I like to listen to all kinds of music. I have more than 200+ cds and this record is the sh-t. It is IMO one of the top3 albums of the century along with \\"are u experienced\\" (Hendrix) and \\"Appetite\\" (GnR). It is really good. It has tremendous amount of energy and the lyrics are so meaningful. The guitar playing is I would say fantastic and Tom is my pick for the guitarist of the 90s (Check out BOLA for Tom's finest work on the guitar). The rythm duos are also really good in this album. Overall this album is funky, raw, and eneretic. Do ur self a favor and buy this album!!!And for those who gave this album a bad rating without justification yall should just f kin go and listen to Britney Spears and NSync."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff (especially for a rapmetal album!)","review":"Wow, I don't really like a whole lot of rapmetal, but this is pretty good stuff. When I got this album, I never expected to like it, but I do. Tom Morello is a great guitarist, good enough to give Jimi the Hendrix a run for his money. He lends some really great solos, and rather weird effects. I especially like the songs \\"Bombtrack\\", \\"Killing in the Name\\", and \\"Settle for Nothing\\". Some of the songs on here aren't anything special, but the good ones make up for it. I don't really care much for the rapping, I would prefer more variety in the vocals, but it's surprisingly not that bad. The political lyrics are excellent (stick it to the man!), I admire a band that's not afraid to speak their minds. If you like rapmetal, buy this. Also buy if you appreciate good guitar playing. If you like this, you'd probably also like Biohazard. And, Rage's other albums are okay too, but this here's the best.Rage, baby, rage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, POWERFUL, THE BEST...","review":"This is the one and only CD I listen to. It is powerful, addictive, and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugely influential","review":"When I first heard this album back in 1993, I just did not like it. Repeating the same lyric over and over at the end of each song in every song, and not at all enjoyable listening. But over the years this record has grown on me considerably. Now viewed as kick-starting the rap-rock fusion, it cannot be understated just how important RATM have become. Every song on the fierce debut is focused and undiluted by commercialism. Bombtrack is a seriously rockin' track as is Bullet In The Head. This is still the best RATM release, although I still love the other two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like altogether HARDCORE MUSIC this is the cd for you","review":"This cd is one of the best cds of the nineties. It contains some of the best guitar solos since the day's of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Jimmy Page. If you are a fan of Hardcore rap and rock then this is the cd for you. I believe \\"R.A.T.M\\" along with Korn and Limp Bizkit are the future of Music. Eventually all music should merge as one great type of music. QUIT THE ISOLATION, MUSIC IS MUSIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I remember first hearing thi sband in 93 and thinking how I had never really heard anything like them before and how rare such a liberal stance is to take in music. From start to finish, this album moves quickly and keeps the adrenaline pumping. It is probably the best rap/metal combination that I have ever heard, better then limp bizkit and Kid rock. It seems that helped start to whold rap metal movement with album helping the public and music industry to accept acts like korn, papa roach and pod. The aggressive nature of the album keeps you wanting more. Songs like bombtrack, know your enemy and freedom help to showcase the band's writing potential. This album is a true rarity, an album that does not have any boring or repetive parts to it and all the songs would make great singles that fit toghether to make a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best Rage cd I've ever heard!!!!","review":"I am a die hard rage fan, and let me tell you that this cd is all you could hope for if you're into the hard rock scene. While Rage's sophmore and junior albums,Evil empire and Battle of los angeles are also very good, neither of them are full of the ferocity and hardcore rap to the heavy metal beat that this album offers. It's the kind of cd that you want to listen to over and over again, even when you've had it for years. I've had my copy for over two years, and let me tell you that it is still my favorite cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"In your face but in a good way","review":"\\"Know Your Enemy\\" has to be one of the greatest songs ever.It rules and is amazing along with the rest of the album.But why do people player hate?'Cause they're telling the truth and the truth isn't something you always want to hear.A good example would be \\"killing in the Name\\".It adresses the problems of the Catholic church,like when the church went around killing people 'cause they weren't Catholic,which they don't want to talk about but that really happened.Anyways,Rage rule and we worship but don't hate them 'cause they tell the truth.BTW Bob from Austria has some testicular fortitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhh...","review":"You remember back in \`92 when you were sitting in your room with GOOD music on the radio? Damn; I bet that makes you feel like a \`vet. Remember when a time of good bands existed? Remember when another good band that was different from the other good bands arose? This was it. Rage is one of those bands you can hold onto every hook and beat blasted. Zach's voice attains the highest urgency I have still yet to hear from any other band. This band really felt it's political cause, and spawned bands such as Boysetsfire, and other good bands. And then the crappy ones too. But every crappy band ever came out rooted from a good one (usually). This band is as revolutionary as Refused, and I think it goes without saying that this album, as well as all the others are timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"the definative r.a.t.m. album","review":"this is really the only rage album you need to own. here they combine zack de la rocha's bleak militant raps with tom morello's brilliant guitar work. it all comes together with brad wilk and timmy c. supplying the tight back-beats. this was all replicated on their next four albums with somewhat lesser results. this is definately one of the heaviest, harshest, most aggresive albums of the 90's.check out the songs \\"bombtrack\\", \\"killing in the name\\", \\"freedom\\", and \\"township rebellion\\", some of the albums highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's ever","review":"The title explain's it all. If you have done a search for this cd than you are the kind of person who needs this cd. It is just powerfully perfect. One of the best, if not the best, overall cd's I have ever heard.

A must have.b"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word, RAGE!!!!!!!!","review":"All the the imitators will fade away(Limp Bizkit, Korn, etc...). RAGE will always be respected. They are true. They are real. They are fierce. They are uncompromising. This is what makes them the best band of the 90's and sure to be in the new millenium. Any band that can release only 3 albums in a decade and still create such a stir is definitely a real rock band. Thank God for RAGE! No other band does it like they do! All 3 albums blow away anything else. The first is completely insane and will take you on a ride. The second will remind you of the greatness. The third will open up the door of what's to come. What a great band! See them live and become a true fan!!!!!! A live show from RAGE is a show you will never take for granted. The best band on earth!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rage against the machine","review":"i sat down and listend to rage against the machines first album. the way Zach De La Rocha expresses his political veiws is outstanding. tom morello adds somthing that no other guitar player can do. there is no band today that can be compared to rage against the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"not funk-metal but best rock 'n roll record on the planet","review":"Folks, it's from back in 1992 and still they took it for the MATRIX soundtrack! Studio equipment and production tools have improved a lot since then but still no one before or after this record was released has been able to match it in terms of power of sound. It's not about production, it's because Rage really mean it, and people can't help but feel that. Superb musicianship, kamikaze bravery and an attitude. That's what they've got, and that's what makes this the best rock n' roll record of the decade and not just a \\"funk metal\\" geek record."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAGE PROVES THAT THEY ARE THE BEST BAND","review":"Rage against the machine proves that they top everyone else with their creative music and hardcore lyrics.

Yet young new listeners LOVE this album. Its funky, its hard, its rebellious, full of passion. This album alone, not RATM has its place in history, is a classic already in many avid music fan collections. It was ahead of its time, it was the band's best, ultimate life effort squeezed into one album. Unfortunately they could never live up to it. Released in a time of jaded generation X, rebellious punk/undustrial movement, it GOT the recognition it deserved. Not overrated, but maybe under appreciated. There are no synthesizers, sampling of music. All the funky sounds played through REAL talent. It blows away any alternative / industrial music produced today. Even new young fans ask - where are bands like this today? There just arent, so sad. RATM, holds its legendary place is music history. Paved the way for the Linkin Parks, the LImp Bizkits, the Korn - but no one could touch RATM's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great angry music with a message.","review":"Rage rages against injustice and corporate America.

Back in my younger days, the CD never left the changer in my car. The hard riffs and angry lyrics really appealed to my teenage angst and the trials of growing up. The CD still sounds as good today as it did then, but only difference now is I could care less about the lyrics. The whole Anti-US sentiment that runs throughout the CD is total garbage. Try ripping those lyrics off in communist China or any other totalitarian society. On a lighter note, the CD is still outstanding and stacks up against the best of alternative rock of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is real power!","review":"Incredible debut album from these great musicians.Zack's powerful vocals are great, he wrote amazing lyricsMorello's guitar from hell, Timmy's bass lines are so catchy and Brad's drums are so damn amazing.This is definitly one of the greatest debuts in rock history, it was sure they wouldn't release another perfect album like this.Traks like Freedom, take the power back, Bullet in the head and Bombtrack are classics from the first listening.This is full of 100% attitude, it's a shame bands like Korn and limp biskit got more recognition with his fake \\"bad boys\\" attitude than ratm.I love the cover as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new manifesto for change","review":"I'm not going to attempt to describe the music to you because I believe that music is interpreted differently by everyone.Here is why I like them:-- Conservatives hate it!-- Former GOP candidate (Gary Bauer) thinks it is un-american and thinks it supports violence against the police (I guess they believe that anything that runs against the mainstream though is \\"evil.\\")-- They are exponentially better then any other rap/rock fusion group to come out before or after them.-- They support Amnesty International, Free/Independent Media, Leonard Peltier, FAIR, AK Press, and others.They also create original, thought-provoking music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rage Rock Rap!","review":"After listening to the Matrix soundtrack album, which contains the track \\"Wake Up\\", I thought I'd give this album a try.

Simply stated, this is a very good album. The music flows well and supports the lyrics outstandingly. Zach De La Rocha's lyrics however, indicate, at best, potential. There is a very repetitious nature to the album, not to say that the message is belittled because of it. It seems to me that De La Rocha was only beginning to come into his own lyrically, and was still learning how to fit his message in with the music. As a whole this album was a positive indicator of things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love rage a gainst the machine and their self titled album","review":"Thisalbum is superior to all other albums.

Unfortunately, their debut CD doesn't quite live up to the reputation that the group has acquired over the years. Their lyrics and song content are difficult to understand for non-activists (myself included) and the guitar riffs/bass lines aren't that great, either. While the band's sophomore album, Evil Empire, also shares the same fate lyrically, lead singer Zack De La Rocha definitely has more of an artistic flow while the band members managed to create music that sticks in your head. On the debut CD, the only track really worth listening to happens to be \\"Killing In The Name\\" which has received a healthy amount of airplay. Go ahead and skip this one and check out Evil Empire instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"ISN'T VERY GOOD","review":"This cd isn't that great. Evil empire is the best rage cd. In this cd rage isn't really rockin as hard as evil empire. Get evil empire if you want a hard, loud, and a total masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE UNDERSTAND!","review":"I'm writing this for detractors and fans alike. In my opinion, this album is the greatest and original rap-metal album created. But that's my opinion. You all are entitled to your own.If you like Limp-Bizkit, Tool, System of a Down and other great rap-metal bands, this is the inspiration for them all. This is a great album, with piercing guitar licks, like on \\"Killin in the Name of\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Know your Enemy.\\" \\"Wake up\\" gets some of its sound from Led Zep's Kashmir, but it most certainly is not a copy. The lyrics are a bit repetetive, but effective. Also, its claim that they don't use synthesizers is correct, but they use effects pedals for most things, although they do create some great effects just by amplifier distortion, but you would have to see that live. Great Album, BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Settle for Nothing? NEVER!

The songs about the USA government and what they are doing are quite brave ones. And if they could, they would destroyed the US government. The songs are quite violent and sad.

You do the same moves over and over in 3 cycles and that's on every dvd. Personally, I can stand repetition. Not to mention, the trainer Brett can be quite annoying. I finally decided to return the product and to just stick to Turbo Fire and other less boring beachbody products. Plus, the Rev anthem is annoying. \\"Rev it high, rev it low...etc\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I did break a sweat......eventually","review":"I've completed P90X and Insanity so I had high hopes for this being a BeachBody product. There is no comparison. This was one of the worst workouts I've ever seen.

BeachBody really missed the mark with this one. I actually returned the videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"So disappointed in this series of videos I don't know where to start.

Tried a couple of the DVDs and didn't even make it through any of them. Granted, they bill it as a workout that's not a \\"graduate\\" program as Insanity and X are, but the day I tried it out was after already doing a P90X workout. After turning it off I went to walk my dog and got about the same workout I would have from the DVD, without the annoying instructor. Returned for a refund, minus shipping and return shipping, but happier to be out the $22 or so for shipping as opposed to over $90 for something I would never have used again.Note: I give it two stars as MAYBE for people who aren't in shape could benefit from this.

At the same time there are some good ideas here and there. I am not sure that it is really worth the money in buying this book since all it is is just a list of things/ideas. I think they could have trimmed the book down to less than 2002, and maybe give more details ways to say you love someone. Maybe if the book had some elaborate ways that people have done nice things.

I used to use the \\"clicking\\" pens with the retractable points, but as I am literally writing all day long I found those pens tend to break. The uni-ball retractable pens would just fall apart after a while and I could never get them to hold together once that happened, making them a huge waste of money.

Maybe amazon got a bad batch of these pens I dont know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Ink Flow","review":"All around this was not a great pen to write with, the ink flow is not consistent and it absorbs into the paper too much making the writing look very faded. I prefer pens that have ink that stands out and is very bold, so this pen did not cut it for me. It's also very scratchy because the ink is not very lubricating, so unfortunately this pen didn't cut it for me.

They write smooth, with dark ink and sharp marks. They're cheap enough that losing one doesn't make you cry for hours, like some other similar (but more expensive) writing implements.

I love how they are sold in 12 packs. Have you ever been at your wits end because there is no pen anywhere? Well since I don't usually carry a pen around, I have a tendency to not have a pen when I need it most. So the 12 pack of my favorite pen is convenient to flood my life with pens.

I absolutely will not use ball point pens, which have a sometimes capricious flow of ink, and which require much more pressure to the paper in order to work properly.This particular model is quite skinny (and I assume holds quite a bit less ink) than the type I usually buy:The ones they call \\"Vision\\". I find that you need to hold this narrower pen at a very precise angle to the paper to write fluidly with it. I suppose it may be good if you want to train yourself to adopt a more precise pen holding technique (as I am, trying to go to three fingertips rather than my usual four). However, the wider more expensive Vision pens offer overall a much more enjoyable experience, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these pens, great deal","review":"I love the very fine point it has and no globs of ink either. A very good price and they were here fast"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"If you generally use a lot of pressure this pen will be perfect, but since I don't think I you should have to etch into a notebook in order to write some notes--I hated this. Also the pen itself is very thing, making it difficult to grip and write with. The ink is too bold for my tastes and tends to bleed onto the second page. I thought this was a great deal, but now I have 12 useless pens. Honestly, I would prefer the cheapo Bic pens over this. It then again, that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Pen for a couple of days","review":"I bought these pens because they were rated so highly on Amazon. Well, either I got stuck with a bad box or my expectations were too high. These pens were terrific the 1st time writing with them, the ink doesn't bleed or leak and writes smoothly on the paper. After a couple days of use however,each pen became worthless to me because it apparently ran out of ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"too good to be good","review":"These pens have failed. Me at least. These pens work amazingly for the first few use's, but then the ball gets stuck and ink flow is intermittent, and I am forced to throw the pen out and reach in the box for another.

You would think that you would get out of the way of a speeding vehicle, but no they crash right into you.However, this game is fun. You get to fully customize your car, provided that you unlock all the required components. You also get to by some pretty cool looking cars, provided you have the money.

The dragoons were where bottom of the barrel for West Point grads. Later on he's a Major on one page then a Colonel on the next page. It's not until 4-5 pages later are we informed that he was promoted. Many times during a battle the reader is left scratching his head asking what happened. The detail of a movement is described and the next thing you know the battle was over. What happened?I've read over 63 Civil War biographies and was disapointed in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Vignettes of Soviet and American Life","review":"I enjoyed this book greatly. Not so much an autobiography as a series of vignettes, Leaving Leningrad is very easy and entertaining reading. The witty personality of the author shines through every page so that by the end of the book you feel you know her well. You also feel you have seen what it must have been like to live in the Soviet Union in the 60's and 70's - not from the commonly available perspective of an academic or a dissident, but from the point of view of the ordinary everyday working stiff. That's what makes the book not only light and fun, but also enlightening. Read it in an evening (that's all it takes) and I'm sure you'll be glad you did.

The DVD is divided in two: the first bit, a very basic lesson of nordic skking, taught old techniques no longer in use.

The episodes on this come from the series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. \\"Pompeii and Circumstance\\", \\"The San Franpsycho\\" and \\"Fright House of a Lighthouse\\" all come from \\"What's New Scooby-Doo\\" so if you got all 3 seasons don't buy this and if you don't buy them instead of wasting your money for 3 episodes, especially if you're a Scooby fan.

Do yourself a favor and look very closely at what this item is and compare to the Long Shot CS-6 - you will see it is the exact same item. I can't really comment on the Long Shot CS-6 itself because it will be a Christmas gift for my son - one that cost me approximately $25 extra due to a deceptive seller and an ignorant buyer (me)!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Frustrating","review":"The box and a commercial for this gun described two features inaccurately.

The boys were SO bummed! They still play with it though, making their own sounds and of course, we still read it together and they can still turn the steering wheel and pretend.

Beautifull well-written songs with an edge that has an overall dark mysterious quality. Rather than trying to be controversial, like a certain person whose initials are: M.M., who has given a \\"warped\\" perception of what Gothic Rock music is to the masses, THE SHROUD spends endless hours refining their craft. The band's compositions range from neoclassical waltzes(ROSES), straight-ahead Rockers(DAY AND NIGHT),Alternative Rock(PROPHESY), and Pop(WHERE THE WIND GOES). This CD is a must have for anyone who loves music, and is looking for something both beautiful, harmonious, and mysterious at the same time. It's on my list as one of the best Cd's of this decade. It wouldn't suprise me if they became one of the biggest bands within the first decade of the millennium. Check them out, for they are worth endless listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yippee, they don't fit a Goth stereotype!","review":"As the summary states, this band has won my approval because they are the epitome of what Goth is supposed to be: beauty laced with melancholia. Unfortunately, the press seems to label any band who sounds even slightly, what's the word, \\"dark\\" as Goth. Don't they understand that it takes more than a little eyeliner and songs about Satan to make you Goth? Goth is not about that at all. With this brilliant CD, The Shroud proves that adequately. They bring Goth back to what is was intended to be all along: a release for romanticism and the inevitable tragedy that follows. *mindless ramblings from the strangely complacent girl in the velvet stockings...but you can just call me Dementia*"},{"rating":"1","title":"anticipation leads to letdowns.","review":"After hearing \\"Pixy-Led\\" on one of those cheesy goth compilation cds, I thought that The Shroud would be an amazing band. Pixy-Led certainly is a catchy, semi-powerful song. But maybe it was only good in the context of \\"we are so goth and bleak\\" bands on the compilation. Maybe I was just looking for some salvagable song so that I could say the compilation wasn't a complete waste of money. After hearing \\"A Dark Moon Night,\\" I have decided a few things. The Shroud DOES have potential. However, everything seemed to blend together and sound the same as everything else. Once again, I'm finding that \\"Pixy-Led\\" is the only salvagable song on a cd full of filler. And that upsets me, because I was so looking forward to hearing the Shroud.

I'm a huge Tim Burton fan, absolutely love his movies and sketches. But the man is a terrible poet. The subject matter is trite, the meter and rhythm would embarrass a fourth-grader, and I was left feeling perplexed and startled by the huge difference between the quality of his verse and his films. The images were clever and creepy. It's the words that made this such a dreadful chore to plow through. I winced on every page. NOT recommended, even to fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholy Indeed!","review":"Tim Burton is pure genius. In this little book of melancholy poetry he combines humor, darkness and independent thought into indescribable delight.This petite book of 23 short poems is the definition of creativity and artistic expression. Burton's poetry is simple, rhythmical and completely unique. His characters are as varied as \\"James\\" to \\"The Boy With Nails in His Eyes,\\" each offering a touch of whimsy beside an outsider existence. Anyone who has ever felt different will somehow relate! Complete with Burton's own drawings of each distinctive character it is a very entertaining experience.If you enjoy Tim Burton's films and relate to his ability to tell the tale of misshapen outcasts you will enjoy this chance to savor Burton in print. Adults and children alike can chuckle and moan at the inventiveness of a true original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"I like the main idea of the book about deformed children. I also like the humor in it (death, sadistic humor, unholy encounters with kitchen appliances, etc). I wish the stories were longer and a few of them didn't flow smoothly.

But Oyster Boy was a let down. It's a very small book with very little content. It has a really Gorey type drawing style, and that's always fun, but it wasn't anything new or interesting as far as creepy art goes, and not nearly as good as actual Gorey art.

When I was given this book as a present I did not expect much of it even though the title intrigued me and front cover art work was bizarre. I found this to be a collection of surreal accounts of abnormal children but still able to touch and allow the reader to endear to these beastly freaks of nature. The darkness in these stories are reminiscent of much of Burton's film work and the artwork is almost as powerful as the stories themselves. This book works on every possible level as it is simple yet sinister enough to be potent. A definite must-read for all those with a slightly twisted outlook on the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old scary FUN!","review":"If you are a Tim Burton fan, get this book. It's a collection of fun and very Tim Burton poems about outcasts and outsiders that makes you feel better knowing you're not in their situations.The book is oddly formatted.

Though I laughed at times when I probably shouldn't I must admit overall I enjoyed it. The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because there were a few in there that were kinda lame and this is most certainly not a book for children. If I had known that at the time I purchased it I probably wouldn't have. This is certainly a must have for fans of Tim Burton. Another book I would recommend would beBoetryby Beau Beaudoin.

Gorey is truly the king of gallows humor.Tim Burton has followed carefully and respectfully in Gorey's footsteps in everything he's done, from his movies to this hilarious little poetry book. Yep, it's kind of twisted, but most healthy and well-adjusted kids (aged 7 and up is probably a good guideline) will be able to appreciate the dark humor as much as you do. Get this book, you'll be glad you did, but if you don't own any of Gorey's books, get one of those, too, and you'll be able to quite clearly see the influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"This was the final Mahavishnu album of the 70s, and quite different from the group's earlier work.

The bold new directions established by the original band's recordings (Inner mounting flame, Birds of Fire) seem to have led into a dead end. (McLaughlin abandoned the fusion approach not long after Inner Worlds was issued.)Most of this album is standard issue 70s funk/jazz that is unmemorable at best (and annoying at times, with a vocal that chants insistently: \\"are you ready to be ... a planetary citizen\\"?)I bought this CD because of \\"Lotus Feet\\", the one gem on this otherwise lackluster set.

It has exercises at the end of each chapter that really helped me to dig deep and figure out what the real problems were. It is a short and easy read, I finished it in about 2.5 hours. I would definately recommend this book to anyone, male or female, who is having difficulty with tension in their relationship after the arrival of a baby.

This carefully animated guide to skiing knowledge empowers the skier master the subtleties of technique: classic, ski skating, norpine, telemark, and more advanced moves. The knowledge in this DVD is readily absorbable. Some people sell DVDs but can't demonstrate nor teach. In my opinion, these folks are master instructors and certainly elite skiers.

I feel like I'm missing something...Half the video is an info-mercial for: The video. I just don't get it. Go take a lesson instead. The price is the same and you walk away with some knowledge. However, it is kinda fun to watch them clown around on XC skis. It is pretty amazing.

I did not find any problem with the characters, I thought they were quite charming. And the story was very well executed. This is a very good book from a very good author. I wonder how many books the other person reviewing this has written where he/she seems to know everything about everybody but Ms Kingsbury has a large following of satisfied readers and one person who does not know what he/she is talking about, will not change Ms. Kingsbury's credibility. Go out and buy the book, don't critique it, read it and enjoy and be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is awful. The characters are shallow cliches and full of contradictions. For instance, we're constantly reminded about the happy marriage of the protagonists, the Baxters, yet they seem constantly to be lying and arguing. The historical detail is full of anachronisms, very sloppily researched. The plot is transparent and contrived. There's a grammatical error of some sort every couple of pages. I bought the book because of the Christmas setting, but there's very little holiday atmosphere or detail. I see that this author has a number of other books in print; that may account for the formulaic quality of this one. I hope the others are better; I won't be reading any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Dreadful-No Stars however I had to choose 1-5","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this mystery. I had enjoyed Kingbury's Manor House mysteries, and so looked forward to this era, setting in a resort on the seacoast in England and the time of year. The characters are shallow, one-dimensional, the main character is a nosey-parker, with nothing to do but fawn over servants and come to conclusions that the author doesn't let the reader in on.There's no Christmas presence in this book, and lots of bickering between the main character and her husband.Early in the book, she describes the barrister club, and informs us that King George VI was a member--this a novel of Edwardian England!

I fell in love with the graphics and sound of NFSU 2, but the overall gameplay was lacking a lot. The gameplay of this game is way better and way more fun.

I mean, c'mon, the first one sucked and the second one was anything special either. However, the third installment is a very well made and well rounded game. It offers a wide variety of personal modifications to your cars, trucks and SUV's and has quality, realistic, and challenging street racing.There are different types of cars; tuners (rice burners), muscle cars, trucks, SUV's, and luxury sedans. All of which offer different customizations and each having their own pros and cons. The campaign mode is extremely long, and offers races in San Diego, Detroit, and Atlanta. And the arcade mode supports two players and is very fun to play with a friend.Overall, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition is very cool, and will provide hours of fun as you beef up and customize your rides so that your the sickest street racer out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if it don't work why send it ,cheap people out for a dollar,,,so keep the dollar.","review":"white mountain traders/really bad they didn't check the to see if it worked.

But as we all know, great books don't necessarily make for great films. Life Is Hot In Cracktown could perhaps have been something worthwhile in the right hands. But this clearly low-budget endeavor falls short of anything worth your time. The shortcomings of this film are many, but chief among them are tortoise like plot development, one dimensional characters and amateurish editing. The story isn't new.

It opens with a stupid rape scene - intended to shock but not believable. And you know what? That is the best discription of this movie, READY???IT IS INTENDED TO SHOCK BUT IT IS NOT BELIEVABLE!I would suggest that you buy: \\"NEW JACK CITY\\" with Chris Rock if you really want to understand drugs in the intercity.

It was a cross between watching a breaking news story and the all to tough life on the streets. I'm sure there was something about this film that may have been good; however, I'm not able to find it.. It was based on a book that I have not read and I don't think I will. I saw no redemption in this movie, it was a film that said to me there are bad people out there and watch out they will get you. You have no control over anything or anybody; furthermore there was no love story to pull it together except one scene. I turned it off and then turned it on to finish it. It is just not my kind of movie. It was violent just because these thugs could be and they left a trail of victims in their wake.There were some extras and deleted scenes. It is rated R for violence, sex and drugs. It is almost an instructional DVD on becoming a gang leader.I cannot recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the people next door!","review":"This is neither a family film nor a comfortable easy to watch film.

However, we come to see them as people with hopes and dreams trying to get by.That this film can pull that off, is a tribute to the acting and strong writing. While disturbing and uncomfortable, there is a story of people trying to survive. Some survive with hard work, some by begging, some by petty crime and some by violence. In the film, we come to understand why they have made these choices and how that placed them into this position.

Many key events were completely ignored in favor of a popular view of history. It does not address the notion of the United States' overpowering desire to sieze Canada, nor of the intense unpopularity of the war in New England. Could have been done a lot better, as were many of the earlier documentaries done by The History Channel when it first premiered (check out The American Revolution - quite excellent!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"I saw this on the History Channel while Channel Surfing. I have the attention span of about 15-20 seconds before I switch channels. This documentary caught me spellbound. I always thought 1812 was an irrelevant war, one that just kind of happened and wasn't that important. By viewing this film I found that at first the War looked catastrophic for America during the first bombardment of Baltimore harbor. But then I was relieved to see Jackson's troops overwhelm the British in a victory so lopsided because the British forgot their ladders. This victory, from original defeat solidified America as a force to be recognized. This war symbolized America as a country which led to the Western Fronteir (via Louisiana Purchase). This movie encapsulates what the Star Spangled Banner means."},{"rating":"1","title":"The War of 1812: A load of tripe and a waste of time!","review":"This series is a huge waste of time and money. Here are some true facts: The War of 1812 was fought across a large part of Eastern North America and many common people lost their property and lives in a range of brutal ways. A sizeable portion of Washington D.C was and ransacked and burned by a combined British and Canadian Army after the U.S. Army fled in panic. The \\"glorious\\" Battle of New Orleans was actually fought after the end of hostilities (the combatants had not yet heard that the war was over). NO NATION WON THIS WAR, since at the end, all captured lands were returned to the original owners. So, where's the glory? The War of 1812 was legalized murder and anarchy and this film is pure patriotic spin. It's \\"history\\" for uneducated masses, and definitely not accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"History re written.","review":"Like Nick (London UK), I too learnt a different version of this history. It appears to me that one should question everything that is produced by the History Channel if this is the type of drivel that they put out. Face it Vietnam wasn't the first war the US lost. This program is pure US propaganda and is far from true history. I guess this will upset some, but lets face it \\"The first casualty of war is the truth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passable","review":"I thought this a solid documentary that informed me about nearly everything I wanted to know about The War of 1812. It is not spectacular but certainly is a valuable primer on a period of time often overlooked. It uses the same partial reenactment method which has made countless other History Channel productions resonate thoroughly over the years. The segments on the siege of Baltimore and the Battle of New Orleans are very well done. Indeed, I wanted to go out and read a biography of Andrew Jackson as soon as it was finished. For the amateur historian who is unfamiliar with the period this DVD will entertain and educate."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat disappointing","review":"I was somewhat disappointed by this 2 disk set.

In any case, the truth is US forces were chased back across the border and got their capitol burned to the ground as a result.

I was surprised there wasn't a battery in the box. Especially considering that Amazon doesn't try to sell a battery with the transmitter anywhere on the page. And also considering that you have to click on the \\"More Technical Details\\" portion of Amazon's page advertising the transmitter to learn that the battery is not included.So this intended to be more a politely critical review of Amazon's website with respect to this item than the item itself. Because I can't test the item because I didn't know that I was supposed to buy a battery because the information wasn't efficiently presented to me, the customer.I chose \\"five stars\\" for my rating because I'm sure that once I get to actually use the product, I will love it, because I'm sure it's terrific, because it's made by Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, do not waste your time or money!!!","review":"Using the ST-E2 has been a very frustrating experience, the unit managed to fire off my EX 520 II speedlights half the time in a studio situation.

Each short story selected for inclusion, has a common theme of individuals, their soul mates and Ms. Goldbaum's remarkable palmistry skill and intuition.Being knowledgeable with all facets she writes about, I found the first section of Ms. Goldbaum's book to be loaded with information in a brief, straight-forward manner, potentially very enlightening to any looking for a lasting relationship. With lists such as \\"Relationship Mistakes Checklist\\" and \\"15 Qualities To Look For In A Soul Mate Relationship\\", I would recommend this section especially to anyone beginning the pursuit of a serious relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Myrna's book gives you an in-depth look on what to look for in a soul mate, how to find that person, and then countless stories of readings that she has done related to soul mates.I really enjoyed the stories of all the people that has come in contact with from the rich and famous to poor, down and out.

The format of the program is similar to the TV show with Steve talking/singing and providing instructions. The software is well put together and graphically appealing, but most the activities are a bit too complicated for my son. Having said that, he loves the chalk girl and will happily spend an hour on that section alone. This game has really helped him in his use and coordination of the mouse. Also, the che game involves rotating shapes to fit a template, it is fascinating to watch as your child discovers how to do this.In summary, I would say that this is a good game, but 3 is probably too young for most of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not great","review":"We got this in a pack with three other games. My daughter, who is four, played it once and hasn't gone back to it. She would much rather play Clifford Learning Activities, which is a much better game, in my opinion. From watching her try to play this and helping her, I can tell you there is much more to do and learn in a game like the Clifford one. I think limiting it to just art is just that, very limiting. Your money would be better spent on a game that not only has art, but also counting, language, logic, problem-solving, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use.

Not so, with this book.Given that VB.NET is still in beta, I was pleased to find that the authors had done a very nice job of structuring things into logical groupings. They covered concepts in a concise manner, while still maintaining all the essential elements for topics.I would suggest this book to anyone interested in learning VB.NET. It also makes a good learning tool for VB6 - since much of the text is dealing with changes between VB6 and VB.NET.Some other publishers offer free updates to owners of their \\"beta\\" books. It would be nice if WROX implemented something like this also. I would like to read what the authors of this book have to say as VB.NET moves into production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview","review":"This is a good preview of the technology.

It's content is very thin on any one topic, and it concentrates on structural features of the interface (like buttons and list boxes) without really getting to the meat of user interface design: task flow and behavior. Every topic covered has much better coverage elsewhere. Read Alan Cooper's _About Face_ for a much better discussion of behavioral design, Edward Tufte's _Visualization of Quantitative Information_ for information design, and Jakob Nielsen's _Usability Engineering_ for usability testing and heuristic evaluation instead. And keep a copy of Microsoft's _The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design_ handy as a reference.

It has a spiral binding so you can open to a pattern and the book wont flop shut right when you are in the middle of a stitch with your hands full of yarn and hook. The only negative about this book is the sizes of the pictures in the \\"stitch selection\\" part. The pics are only about 1 1/2 inches square so you can't get a very good idea of how the stitch really looks. As a beginner crocheter, I found this book easy to follow and understand and it has so many stitches that give you plenty of material to grow your skills with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource Book","review":"This book is very attractive. It has just about every stitch known to crocheters.

I like that it is wire bound beneath an attractive spine book cover. I know I will use this Stitch Bible frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty designs, helpful reference","review":"The Crochet Stitch Bible has a nice table of contents with pictures of all the stitch designs. It is easy to use because of its binding, and it is easy to carry because of its size. I also have the Harmony Guides #6 and the Crochet Encyclopedia. I would say they are similar, though the harmony guide seems to have more useful stitches as well as good symbols, and the encyclopedia has more \\"different\\" kinds of patterns. I think that all three together provide a nearly complete picture of the stitch patterns that can be created with the basic stitches and not too much \\"post\\" work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best crochet book ever","review":"This book has an incredible amount of patterns. I'm not a novice but I do make scarves, fingerless gloves and now I'm attempting a sweater. When I shared the book with other crocheters and showed them my creations, everyone had to get this book. So I am now purchasing these books as gifts for my friends. The book is small enough to carry around in my briefcase and what I like most about it are the diagrams or charts that come with each pattern. I was never good at following the text instructions, I'm now spoiled with the charts. I would recommend this book for beginners and novices. It's a must-have and you'll always find the best deals ever through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crochet stitch book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It gave me some good ideas to do in my crocheting. The directions were very easy to read and to do.

I've crocheted for years, but sometimes when life gets too busy, I'll go for long periods of time when I can't do it and I'll forget certain things. With this book I can always browse through it and find exactly what I'm looking for, and I'm back on track in no time.

I think that I'll check it out at the library first. I don't know why authors and publishers have to go out of their way to make things fancy and new, like not printing things in black ink, when we are just trying to learn something or follow a chart.

Useful index with all the stitches by name. Each stitch has illustration, instructions and chart with international symbols. Also a stitch key on right side of every odd numbered page which means you can read the charts as the symbols are right there. Stitches are grouped into broad categories such as mesh and filet. Also more details in back about the symbols and abbreviations. The terms are American with a comparison to the English in the back. My one criticism is that the actual pictures of the stitches are very dull and small when more colors would certainly have brightened up the book. Hopefully Barnden will be persuaded to bring out a second volume with more stitches. Very useful important addition to the growing crochet stitch collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep its promise","review":"Most of the songs included in this box are, in my opinion, neither goth nor erotic.

I've seen a lot of kids' CD-ROMs, and this is one of the best I've come across recently. You won't be disappointed; Blue is so adorable!

Ideas from the film have been used in other sci-fi movies and TV shows. The film is based upon Colin Wilson's 1976 novel The Space Vampires. Henry Mancini's epic, loud, sweeping music score for Lifeforce is an underrated masterpiece! Mancini is the same guy who wrote the jazzy Pink Panther and Peter Gunn theme music! This CD also has the alternate music cues(composed by Michael Kamen) that were used in the shorter U.S. version of Lifeforce. Keep in mind that the tracks sound a little damaged! Mancini's Lifeforce theme music has been ripped off for video games and TV shows! Also, Tobe Hooper's movie has no connection to the Nintendo game Lifeforce(known as Salamander in Japan)!

The pen is attractive, the ink does dry fast, and it's certainly comfortable to hold. However, actually writing with it was a very disappointing experience. It felt scratchy/rough on the paper, wasn't what I would consider to be smooth, and didn't lay down much ink. I personally liked the Bic z4 Needle Point (0.5mm) much better, but they are no longer available in 0.5mm.UPDATE: Just purchased Pentel EnerGel liquid ink gel pen in 0.7mm. Ink dries fast.

The authors attempted to show areas of overlap and differences and in my opinion could have spent much of the book showing how to work toward alignment between the two departments. Rather, it showed how HR must market the hospital to employees, both new and old and how marketing must use surveys to assist administration in identify patient satisfaction issues. Nothing new, especially if we appreciate and recognize the continual efforts of patient and non-patient care staff to provide excellence in healthcare - inside and outside of the four walls we call a hospital. \\"Raving Fans\\" is much better.

I will say that if there was a problem (storehouse or transportation), it probably was isolated. Easy assembly, and they provide extra screws/part if you misplace one.

It seems that Lauri Lyons went out of her way to find the dregs of society to interview and photograph. There are many negative and hateful comments about the USA and I can't imagine why any publisher would publish this book.I believe in the constitution, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. But, why would they print such a tasteless book? This is not real America.There are some nice exceptions, such as the cowboys in Montana and many old timers. However, there are photos showing people standing on the flag and stories about how people threw the flag she gave them on the ground.She had a good idea and an excellent theme. She blew it.M. R. Hansen"},{"rating":"2","title":"eternally evolving language","review":"Baron's purpose for writing this book consists of informing the audience of how language came about, how it has changed as new technologies came around, and how it is still changing. First she talks about where the written language first came from, and then she gets more specific and discusses how English evolved. Next she covers who reads and why they read throughout the timeline. She also talks about written standards and how language is exchanged over distance and time. She also has a whole section that is devoted to email. This book is well written with language that is easily understandable. It is interesting with good example and explanations throughout. It is more of a slower reading book to be able to soak up the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"good to read","review":"baron book is a nice book to read about the written of email and alphabet,but i have not read everything thing about it that is why i want to review it on internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for parents with \\"wayward\\" children of any age!","review":"A dear Christian friend recommended this book to us, when our oldest daughter started to \\"leave\\" for the \\"far away land\\" as described in the Parable of the Prodigal Son (see Luke 15:11-32).We were so caught up in the guilt and embarassment of how our daughter had disappointed us, we were neglecting the most important assignment that God had for us - ministering to our disobedient daughter!Our daughter has come \\"HOME\\", now, and her story is an inspiration to others... We thank God for all of the Christian people who ministered to us during that time, and we thank God for how He changed our daughter's life...I try to keep a copy on hand, because God uses our testimony to encourage other parents on a regular basis - just like the parents who ministered to us...Thank you, Miles McPherson, for allowing God to speak to us, through your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating Breakthrough Products: Innovation from Product Plan","review":"Cagan and Vogel's book Creating Breakthrough Products is long overdue in the fields of business and (industrial)product design. It provides a realistic view of product development and a \\"behind the magic curtain\\" look at product successes and failures. The arguments, visuals, and product case studies provided in the book helped me envision a mental map that I can use in my work.

I was looking to be motivated into creating new products, but this was like reading a history book without addressing how to think outside the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not useful","review":"This book is basically a collection of examples of successful products. It breaks down the reasons for success into three areas: good design, usefulness and timing. The problem is while it covers the concepts of creating a well designed product that is useful to many people, it doesn't cover the timing issue. This leaves the book rather flat and overly simplistic. Perhaps if it covered some great product ideas that were useful and well designed but flopped in the marketplace (think Apple Newton) we would be able to draw some conclusions about the timing issue...make something that helps people more easily do something they already do or want to do, make sure it's well designed and user tested but not too expensive and just hope your timing is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Real Thing","review":"Don't waste your time and dollars getting this album. It is not a collection of greatest hits by the artists that made the songs famous. Instead, it is a collection of unheard of artists who did re-makes of some well known, some unknown hits by these great songwriters. The only thing in common in this collection is that the company had rights to this collection of remakes done by British bands.

Even though it is an entirely acoustic album. it is possibly his blusiest recording. There is plenty of slide guitar, fiddle, mandolin, and even kazoo. Of course, Jimbo's vocals are masterful throughout. The songs are strong from start to finish.

I was worried that the size would not work but it was fine. The bag is well made and my daughter said the strap was very comfortable.I fyou need a good bad- you can't buy a better one for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As BIG as advertised!","review":"A well made bag, but the description is misleading....It reads \\"Waterproof bag holds 1-2 cameras and 3-4 lenses with room for accessories\\". You could possibly hold four small or medium lenses, without anything else and NO accessories. You could carry two camera bodies and some film but NO lenses. But there is no way to put two bodies, and 3-4 of the smallest lenses without removing all the padding and dividers - Then you'd might as well throw them all in a plastic sack and save your money.I bought this for a Digital Rebel and regular lens - a flash and one telephoto lens and two batteries. It is busting at the seams, and I have ordered the battery pack/grip to go onto the bottom of the camera so I'll probably have to reorder a larger one.If you want a good looking canon bag that is small and compact, you'll like it, and it is well made and worth the current cost, just remember it is smaller than the description would lead you to believe....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the advertised size!","review":"I bought the 100EG for my Canon EOS-10D with a Canon 28-135mm IS lens and a Canon 420EX flash. My camera with the lens attached BARELY fits in the bag, and only after all the dividers are removed. A longer zoom wouldn't have fitted, period. Very dissapointed with the \\"1-2 camera bodies, 3-4 lensees, \\"AND\\" accessories\\" claim. Sure, if you own toy cameras. What's the point of removing the dividers? As far my setup, this bag is only good for 1 body and 1 small/medium lens, NOTHING else (as far as camera components), not even my Canon 420EX flash. Also, the waist strap is annoying since it pretty much useless and CAN'T be removed. I do, however, like the build quality and looks. I am going to gamble on the 10EG and HOPE to get ONE camera body, TWO lenses, and ONE flash in it. You'd think Canon would know how many of their OWN components could fit in their own bag!!! It's too bad Canon doesn't post more views of this bag with an example camera and lenses inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a day trip or a weekend","review":"First, when I bought the Canon Digital Rebel XSi, I was hesitating between the Canon Deluxe bag and theCanon Zoom Pack 1000 for Elan and Rebel Series Cameras (Holster Style). I am glad I chose the Canon Deluxe bag.It is perfect to go on a day trip or a weekend as you can bring 2 lenses with the camera and the charger in the front pocket. There are 2 dividers that divide the bag into 3 compartments: 2 lenses and the camera body. The dividers can be removed and they are adjustable so you can move them around to create different size compartments. Also when I go on a day trip, I can just drop my keys, credit card and a bit of cash in the inside pocket of my Canon Deluxe bag, so no other bag to carry around...Finally, I think it is of very good quality. It is great for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger Than It Looks","review":"I bought this (elsewhere for more $) for my Canon T1i and its kit lens.

I have Breathless Body 1 too. This one is different in that you do three exercises in a row for 30 seconds each then rest 15 seconds.

There are a good amount of lunges and jump lunges, which is tough for my knees, and I cant do - so I do the modifications, and sometimes I totally change it from what the video is doing to keep the cardio up. The workout is challenging.

Far too much fighting and not enough about relationships. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite historical novel of Arthur","review":"I've treasured my copy of this novel for decades. Sutcliff specialized in Dark Age Britain, although this is the only novel she wrote for adults. She weaves a haunting portrait of a misty, troubled, ancient land where Roman civilization and Celtic pagan culture are threatened by the barbaric Saxon invaders. Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot (here shown as the original character of Bedivere--Lancelot is strictly an invention of the Middle Ages)are portrayed as the historical characters they surely were. Don't look for a fantasy Camelot, with banners and Round-Tables. Here, Arthur is a Romano-Celtic warlord, desperately working to stave off the inevitable invasion. There is a brooding quality of impending doom that pervades the entire book. No one has ever drawn a more convincing canvas of Romano-Celtic Britain, in my opinion, or a more realistic portrait of the kind of man that Arthur probably was. A treat to be savored and re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sword At Sunset","review":"This is very simply a wonderful book. Rich in characterisation not only of Artos the Bear but also of his wonderful Companions.It is Artos, warrior, horseman, leader of men who gave rise to the later more romantic, sanitised depiction of King Arthur.We see a different side to Guenhemara, who he takes to wife.This is a gritty story, and for me a more plausible story of the rise of Arthur and brings him to life on the pages. It is a story that is vibrant and engrosing. I know that this review will in all probability be unable to do justice to just how very rewarding and enriching this book is.Many feelings come forth for the reader in this bloodthirsty and rousing story. The dream that Artos had that early Britain would be united against her foes. It is a story rich in paganism, pageantry and comradeship but it is also a story of treachery.This is a magnificent book....I didn't want it to end"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch historic novel","review":"Extremely well written, this novel sweeps you through history at a fast pace.

Kind of.","review":"The release of a new Tindersticks album is always a good sign. They break scant new ground on this release and the disc is relatively short in running length. I think that the biggest problem in reviewing music can be that the artist is cursed if they don't try something new and it's easy to condemn them if they just trot out more of the same. 'Can Our Love.....' lacks the sheen of their last effort ['Simple Pleasure'] but also some of the grit from their earlier work, particularily their sophomore album. Tindersticks fans, buy it, you know that you want to. One cavet. There is a slightly more expensive 'deluxe' version available as an import. The only difference is a cardboard gatefold sleeve. No bonus tracks, lyrics, photos, extras, etc. The gatefold would work great on vinyl but as cd packaging it doesn't seem to justify being called a 'limited edition.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS","review":"This is a complete piece of junk!!!!

It's what you do when you have no, well, real dialogue. \\"Eff this!\\" and \\"Eff that!\\", all delivered with the slurpy gusto only London mafiosi could muster. It's embarrassing too -- these older actor chaps reduced to such juvenile strategies to keep the film from coming to a complete standstill.

The film depicts just 24 hours over the length of the film BUT could easily have been written and filmed in just 10 minutes flat. Added to the foul language [effing and worse at almost every other word, and I'm no prude] the film jumps about within it's 24 hour period plus it has fantasy scenes which render the viewer totally confused and wondering why they bothered!

Living in a small town in the middle of no where, finding an instructor for Tai Chi was not an option. This video was the perfect solution. Claire first demonstrates the movements that you'll practice first then with the assitance of two of her students you go through those movements again, and in the same method as if you were taking a class.

It is not fancy but the price is reasonable and the instruction is coherent. Claire Hooten gives background information on Tai Chi and speaks of the 6 principles (posture, relaxation, etc) at the start. After you watch it once you'll want to fast forward to the 30 minute mark for practicing the movements. She demonstrates the entire short form (first 20 postures) once through then breaks them down in groups of 3 or 4 and gives the instruction twice. The first is just her from the front and the second adds two students who perform with their backs to you for the \\"EZ learning reverse view\\".

The game has several good things, such as:-It got back to the classic 2d style, where you can sit down and play, whereas in 3d you have to pass tutorials and all that junk.-Unlike some people say, I think that the game has plenty enough guns, and if you make your own, you can own pink worms with unlimited air strikes for example. Or how aboat a barrage of never-ending homing missles?-The game still has the funny voices, which is good.The bad things about this game are:-NO HOLY HAND GRENADE! The Holy Hand Grenade was the most awesome weapon ever, and now it's gone. That is the only bad thing, but there's still plenty of guns in this game, I mean, all I REALLY use is the bazooka, air strikes, homing missiles, shotgun, grenade, cluster bomb, and uzi. That is a lot, but there are even more than that. But no super sheep.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"This is truly a game for the whole family! We had already enjoyed previous versions of this game, but as much as now. This is probably the perfect game for the PSP platform.

The book was in fantastic shape and we were amazed at the great service we received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, Terrible Package, Shameful Waste","review":"Birders take large field guides such as this to an office supply store to have the plates removed and bound separately. This makes the plates practical for field work. Ridgely and Greenfield have to know this. The problem with this book is no gutters. When you spiral bind the plates, you lose significant material on each page: text on the left and pictures on the right. My bound plates were full of birds without heads. What a shame this book was designed so thoughtlessly. I threw mine away and went back to using the old Birds of Columbia guide by Hilty and Tudor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beggers can't be choosers...","review":"This is really the only option if you're traveling to Ecuador to bird and it's a great book as those before me have said. It's very hefty, both in information and in physical size. It's overwhelming sure, but so is birding in the tropics. The plates are pretty good, though some are laughably awkward, the raptors for instance. I didn't choose to bind the plates separately in my copy when I went, I carried the whole text in my backpack. It was heavy and sort of obnoxious to keep pulling it out to refer, but what are you gonna do?Those are really the only complaints, and by and large it's well worth the money and there's nothing else you would choose to take to Ecuador. I'm certainly glad I have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulky but a great field guide!","review":"Ridgely does it again, with a fantastic field guide for Ecuador. It's very bulky and difficult to carry in the field hence the oft suggestion of having just the plates bound for field use. I agree with the notion and should have done that. This guide is a must for a birding excursion to the wonderful country of Ecuador."},{"rating":"2","title":"History people should know.","review":"I first read about David Thompson in a National Geographic magazine and I couldn't put it down.

But the ink is not Uniball's blue/black masterpiece of 2004. BLX blue/black ink is very light. I would call it more of a blue pen, than a blue/black pen.The general public would be correct in liking this BLX pen. It's great.

This book, while clearly a very personal account of one leader's experience in education, is a valuable resource to anyone who is involved in an organization that is governed by the dynamic and challenging efforts of an executive committee. When a common goal is that of education, helping the environment, or building a strong community, the thoughtful ideas and dedication of a group of individuals must be translated in the most efficient and productive manner possible. This is a story by which one can learn priceless lessons in any aspect of the organization so that the ultimate goals can be attained.

The fact that the book was all-inclusive is what made it such a wonderful find from my point of view. Friedman leaves almost nothing unanswered, including how to audition for a potential manager or agent, and the secret as to just why most young actors impress directors at the actual audition, but then blow it completely at the callback.For a young acting student such as myself, this book gave me information that I didn't get from my college theater classes, making it an invaluable addition to my personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uni-ball Vision Elite pen refills","review":"The refills are not worth the money you think you are saving.

If I had known that, I would have never purchased it. It is too much trouble to use it for one thing and have to keep switching. It should state in the ad that it won't replace the shorter hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not receive product ordered","review":"Rather than sending me the 20ft hose ordered, I was sent a 15ft hose. The item number was clearly marked on the plastic package in which the 15ft hose was packaged, and was clearly different from the item number for the 20ft hose (which was provided in the description of the hose and had appeared on the order form).To make an exchange, I would have had to make a trip to the post office AND pay for the return postage without being reimbursed, even though this was clearly the seller's error. This was simply not worth my time and expense.I will not buy anything from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover 20' Deluxe Stretch Hose","review":"I couldn't believe when I received the option to share my opinion of this product, I had just cut off the vacuum- amazing. Anyhow, that hose is, just like it says, 20'- however, it is really tight and hard to pull and vacuum at the same time and will always pull the vacuum cleaner over with a crash! It marked my wall with a huge black mark, so lay it on the floor before starting, should you buy! If you purchase to do stairs, and your staircase has landings it will rub against your railings, something to think about. My opinion is maybe still better to use a handheld vac instead, plus the vacuum does not come with a wide bare floor attachment, so it's not good for that either, oh well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's longer than you think!!","review":"The hose did exactly what I intended it for. It reaches all the way up my stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong hose","review":"This did not fit my Hoover Windtunnel vacuum. How can I return it? I threw away all of the paper work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite fit the vacuum correctly.","review":"The quality of this hose is excellent. Same as the smaller original one. It is longer and does extend the reach a fair amount. My problem is that it doesn't fit on the vacuum properly. Each end connects like the original but because the hose is slightly longer than the original when fully compressed for storage, it doesn't lay in the retaining groove like the original. It just sort of flops off to the side of the vacuum and catches things as you vacuum. I'm returning it. The floppy hose is more frustrating that having to move the vacuum to get hard to reach places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"Works well but if you try to stretch it anyway near 15 to 20 feet it is difficult to pull that far and will tip over the vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long","review":"I got this to replace the original hose which finally just collapsed. The hose is well made, but it's so long, it hangs off the vacuum like saggy skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"20-Foot?? Nope","review":"The hose will work, but will not function at 20 feet. After about 15 feet, it will pull any connections apart, and will topple the vacuum cleaner well before the 15 foot stretch. The biggest stretch is the description."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible attachment","review":"The idea that this is a twenty foot extension is completely ludicrous. If you have a strong person hold onto the vacuum it is possible to get this extended to twenty feet, but if you don't have anyone holding onto the vacuum you are lucky to get 6 feet out of it. Any attempt to extend it further will likely topple the vacuum potentially damaging furniture or walls. I've damaged at least two walls severely."},{"rating":"2","title":"hoover 20 foot hose for Wind Tunnel","review":"This hose really is a great addtion to the Hoover Wind Tunnel.

Would have been 5 stars if the hooks on the front were easier to work one handed. At first I thought it was going to be too big, but now that I've started to use it I would have to say it is about perfect in size. I carry a Canon 20d with 17-55 and 70-200 lenses all the time. I have plenty of room for spare batteries, flash cards, card readers, a small water bottle, and a couple granola bars for long days in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kit bag","review":"I have had this bag for about a year now and it is great for keeping a grab and go kit together. The comments about how many lenses you can really carry in this thing are valid. I carry 28-135mm EF on my 20D most of the time and I lug around a 17-85mm EF-S and a 50mm EF. I figure I have room for two or three small lenses like a macro, tele extender, or macro tube - Or on big lense (I think I can get a 100-400mm in there without much of a problem. I keep my battery charger, filters, cleaning kit etc. in the bag all the time. But if you know what type of shooting you are going to be doing then plan accordingly. If you filled this bag up with glass you would not want to carry it all day anyway.My only grip are the little metal clips creak a little but a few inches of electrical tape cured this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy","review":"I can fit a canon eos camera body, a 50mm, 24-70, 70-200 and 580exII flash in the bag.

I have a Canon 5d with 24 - 105, a Canon 100-400 lens, a Canon 50mm, and a Canon 580ez flash -- there is no way to get these items in the bag and keep them readily available for use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not amazing","review":"The bad is really sturdy- it holds a good amount of equipment... but not nearly as much as advertised. I'm still a pretty amateur photographer, having only been in the business for a few years. I have 2 camera bodies, 3 lenses, 2 flashes, and a bounce, as well as other small miscellaneous items. And that is about as much as this bag holds. With the overall size of the bag you would think it could hold a lot more. It probably would be able to hold more if you removed all of the dividers, but then that would be pointless.Also, the strap is extremely uncomfortable! No matter how you wear it it digs into your shoulder. It looks nice and padded but the strap lands on you on only one side, rather than lying flat. Ouch. I though it might be because I'm small (5'1\\", 95lbs) but I had my fiance try it on and it fit him the same way and he is a big guy (6'1\\", 220lbs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Professional Gadget bag 1 EG","review":"A very well designed bag thats just the right size for my needs, very adaptable and top quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gear bag, solid build","review":"I've had the bag for a little over 2 weeks now, and am enjoying it well...I can carry 2 Canon DSLRs quite comfortably with 4 lenses (16-35, 24-70, 24-105, and 70-200), and 1 flash (420)Only issue I have is the bag height - it is a little tight having the 24-70 mounted on a body, and loading it vertically.Overall, great price and sturdy build (bag stays firm fully loaded), and the non-slip shoulder pad keeps the bag secured when carrying...Would definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL!!!","review":"I agree with others, that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this bag... IF you only have one camera and a bunch of lenses. However, I have 2 DSLR's and there is NO WAY to fit them in this bag unless you disconnect the lenses first.

Hall & Annette R. HallThis is a true historical book about the Vietnam and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in finding out the truth about the war from an infantryman's point of view. It tells it like it was during the Tet Offensive in 1968, hard hitting and to the point. Written by someone who was \\"there\\" when the events happened. I would highly recommend that you feature \\"I SERVED\\" on your website and in your book stores. It certainly disserves recognition as a serious book of the war in S.E. Asia. I know from experience as I was over there myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was under the impression that this book was a true to life accounting of events leading up to the Tet Offensive of 1968. I bought the book based upon the recommendations here. I was disappointed to find that it was more of a heavily gilded diary, with little to no credibility where actual events are recounted.Further, I did not enjoy the overall ego-centricity of the contents, and would've like to read about the accomplishments of the men in this LRP unit, rather than the personal jabs (sometimes scornful) and off-hand speculations of the first-person author.I've judged the contents of this book as misleading, but perhaps others will enjoy it more as a story that plays fast and loose with the facts. I guess I was just expecting this book to be more of a hard-core Vietnam era combat account. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what title implies","review":"The books name belies its content. The part of the book that pertained to service was in the last few chapters. The first part of his book was all about his childhood and school problems he had which, to me, was not the name of the book. Yes, the language was salty, but this is to be expected when decribing language in the boonies. This book was a cathartic for the authors feelings and I for one did not appreciate it. For me it was a waste of time trying to read this treatise."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP SCREAMING IN EVERY SONG!!!","review":"I love this band from the beginning, but you're losing me with the idiotic screaming.

It's a little harder than the last couple of CDs, but it also has the melodic sounds that we heard from Seasons. If your a Sevendust fan, it's a must buy. Not their best, but it is still a good one with no \\"album fillers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily their best since Animosity.","review":"For me, this disc combines the sounds of \\"Home\\" and \\"Animosity\\". It has many very heavy moments, but there are also some more vulnerable, melodic tunes on here too. Lajon continues to be one of the most versatile vocalists around. He has a beautiful singing voice, yet can scream and growl with the best of them. It is true that Sevendust doesn't really stray too far from their proven formula, but why would you want them to? I think they have a pretty awesome thing going. There are enough crappy bands out there. Don't ask Sevendust to change their ways and become one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"Sevendust did is again. They put out a hard core album!!!

The songs blur together and their best song on the album is their single. I went to their latest concert tour and was also disappointed. I think they're trying to be too flashy and have gotten away from their true talent. They need to take a breather and get back to how their previous albums were, which were top notch by the way. Sevendust, I love you, but you gotta get back in the swing of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sevendust Disappointment","review":"The new album \\"alpha\\" sounds like a completely different band. I understand that Sevendust has changed quite a bit since their debut album that was self titled. I don't necessarily think it was a great decision to change but I bought and kept and still listen to every sevendust album ever recorded besides \\"alpha\\" Lejon has the best voice in the genre of rock. He has the tough and aggressive vocals that can be changed to the greatest singing voice in rock. I felt like this album completely wasted this talent by using way too much of Morgan's vocals and not Lejon's. Morgan does not have good vocals for screaming or singing. Sevendust does not need two vocals or three vocals when you have Lejon. I tolerated Morgan's voice in the album \\"next\\" but \\"alpha\\" just has way too much of his vocals. I give this album 1 star because there is not enough Lejon and too much Morgan vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone who has never listened to Sevendust before...","review":"I listen to Sevendust to feel the energy, the heart and the soul that they pour into their music. With every beat in each song you can feel the power of those effects growing stronger. It's easy to tell that each member of the band is there because they love the music they make and can't wait to share it with anyone willing to listen.And if you ever see them live all of the notions I have expressed will only become more evident.Obviously I would recommend any of their albums, but this is certainly one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sevendust Rule and I wish I was in the band!!!!","review":"From the first song to the last one this album rocks. In a world where most bands change their style of music to more main stream crap, Sevendust have stayed true to their fans. Alpha is just awesome! The songs are fast, aggressive and heavy and I love the double kick on all the songs. LJ's vocals rule. If you are a fan of Sevendust, you will absolutly dig this album. If you feel let down by your current favourite bands, get this album and become a fan of Sevendust. I cant stop listening to this album, it rocks!

I was blown away by the distance and quality. I read a ton of reviews on here and various other websites claiming they could see over 100 yards away. I would argue the distance is far greater than that. I watched a leaf fall off of a tree in the middle of the night from what I would estimate a good 250-300 yards. (side note, I played football for many years so I am quite familiar with 100 yard estimates). There have been a few complaints about the power button placement. I would agree probably would be better somewhere else however you have to hold it to actually power on and off so I find that complaint of little significance. Only other semi-issue is the weight but its so worth it. Also comes with a nice hard case so plenty safe to throw in a pack or bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy worth every penny.......don't mount to rifle","review":"I've had this 20/20 NV scope for months and have taken it on several night hog hunting trips. It works like a charm and I was able to make out in the full moon cows on the neighboring property 500 yrds away when without the sight you couldn't see even the hill they were standing on. Every one of my friends that comes out hunting with me are amazed of how clear it is and the control you have. We can make out Hogs out to 500 yards then sneak up turn on the spot lights and Whamo.**** do not mount on you rifle....I did this and rigged up a mount and when I took my first shot the shock from the rifle turned everything off and now the display is slightly askew. Even having gone through my abuse I still love this NV scope."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome scope","review":"First of all, got this scope to view flying objects after watching a UFO special haha. So I researched and for the money heard this scope works well. First night I got it, was blown away with how well it worked. Scoping around the backyard I can see everything clearly. You just focus the front lens. You start seeing all kinds of things. Insects, birds are easily identified by their movement. Then you notice you can see all the stars you can't see because of the city lights. Then you see distant planes flying blinking and then looking straight up you can see some Leo satelites flying with a steady faint glow. Was everything I expected. Field of view is sort of small so finding moving SATs can be hard, but just survey the sky from one side to another and you'll see some interesting things. Last night seen two objects fly by at a super fast rate. Totally interesting, and recommend this scope to any amateur sky watcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elderly Looking","review":"These shoes were cheap, i.e., inexpensive, so I kept them, but they definitely gave a more grandma vibe than that of style maven.

Why not use picassa or iphoto or any of the other free ones that do a better job. Basically it does a lot, but does nothing well. If you are a point and shoot user, just use picassa and photoshop elements.

I'm actually online looking to see if there's something different (READ: better) than this iron while I still have time to return it. Definitely NOT worth what I paid. The other bad thing about it is that even though it has an automatic off-switch, you can't really tell its off unless you touch it (the lights are still on and there are no sounds announcing its off, like the Black & Decker).

Extremely disappointed! Was looking to replace my five year-old Black and Decker Pro Finish 750 ($90 top of the line at the time). The old Black and Decker blows this thing away any day. One-swipe ironing that produces flawless results is not inherent in this ultimate expression of German household engineering. Ramie and Linen shirts took forever and were still wrinkled in some areas. Jeans were not crisp. Also the Rowenta seemed too lightweight. Bothersome design flaw of no on/off switch also puzzling. (Heard it's for safety but I don't particularly care for plugging in or unplugging live wired appliances). Those reviewers that rave about Rowenta on here must have never used a real iron. One that allows you to do a quick one-pass and voila...wrinkle free perfection in a matter of seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This is my second Rowenta.

The opening FMV sequence will make your jaw drop! And the character designs are fantastic!The soundtrack in FF3 is very well produced, as well. There are some really great and memorable tracks throughout the game. Final Fantasy III also presents a satisfying challenge, even to long-time RPGers like myself. There are some challenging bosses in this game.Whether you are a hardcore RPGer, or just occasionally pick up an RPG, you can't go wrong with this title (especially for the price!).

This is a fun game and i would recomend it for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DS RPG","review":"In a world of chocobos, flying ships and monsters your character embarks on a journey to restore the balance of good an evil throughout the land. Along the way you will meet people some who join your team preeminently and some who join temporarily.As far as RPG's go this is among the best. I found the graphics to be ideal for being on the DS. I'm not a big FF person so this might not count allot but I found the music in the game to be great. It had me looking online for an FF3 DS soundtrack anyways. What makes the game-play challenging is choosing the right jobs for each character in your team and making sure your team is strong enough to fight through dungeons. The turn based fighting style is generally pretty simple though. Then there are also secrets in the game to discover but are not necessary for completion for the extra challenge with an ample reward.overall I'm satisfied with the game and the amount I spent on it ($34.82)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adaptation","review":"Square-Enix did a very good job adapting the game from its NES version.

The story, graphics, music, and job system intrigued me. I enjoyed not being restrained to stay with one job however it was obviously unbalanced. Nonetheless, I loved playing my Dragoon but I must say that this game is EXTREMELY hard. Like, 'pull your hair out' hard. There are times where you'll even wipe on trash or \\"lose\\" because your whole team got petrified. That was really frustrating.

Thanks Amazon!Pros:1) Soundtrack: A joy to listen to.2) Graphics: The most detailed graphics I have seen on the DS sincerelease.3) Challenging: Forget about finishing this title in ten hours. If you move to fast through the game you will die.Cons:1) Challenging: Some may find this unfair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not the best in the series, but worth playing.","review":"Final Fantasy III was originally released in Japan only. They felt the American audience wouldn't appreciate it very much. I can definitely see why. It's not so much that the game was \\"too Japanese.\\" It just didn't have the strongest game play or story when compared to the rest of the series. The game isn't terrible by any stretch (hell, I like it a lot better than II or V) and any fans of the series will find fun when they play it. It's worth picking up if you want to complete the series, and as far as RPG's go, it's decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an experienced player","review":"I'm not giving this game a single star because I don't think the game is no good. In fact, I understand that this is a great game by people who would know. However, I didn't understand what an RPG was (role playing game) when I bought it. What that seems to mean is that you have to tell your character what to do in any situation, ie, fight, run, etc. Personally I find this tedious, (I'm 47 and pretty new to this stuff). I understand that it's an \\"old school\\" technique that is really popular. If you don't know what RPG really means, ask a teenager. After they finish formatting your computer and showing you how your Wii works that is. lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap re-make","review":"The origional was awesome, this is not the origional.

I will say that some of them I have not seen anywhere else. I was most impressed with the articles about shadows. My biggest complaint other than price is that I would have like to see more of the articles have both OpenGL and DirectX source code.

That said, the author explores new ground on the hardships of people going overland to California. This is a story that needs telling.This book is for those interested in California history.

I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera. These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them. Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground.

The listener connects with the earth, sky, and all living and nonliving things with the sound of each note. The mysteries of nature are revealed .... the spiritual realm is opened as whirls of energy surround the listener. Anyone listening is more open to exploring their own personal journey on this path called Life ... infinite possibilities and choices are narrowed down to the ones that matter to you the most. This music is serene, meditative, life-affirming and loving ... The flute music is like the air we breath ... it is essential and very beautiful and real.ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION: Mehdi ~ Instrumental Heaven Volume 7, A True Gem, Samples at SoothingMusic.Com *** Go Listen Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"It's hard for me to put into words my obsession for this CD =) In the last year I have been through a lot, including a seperation and difficult move, and Breathe is the only thing that has brought me peace and let me sleep at night.

I can never get coffee tasting just right, so the pod system really attracted me. I kept debating between the Senseo and the HomeCafe. It was a demo of the senseo that made me decide to go with it. The Senseo brews a nice small cup of coffee that is nice and frothy. It gives you the sensation of a cappuccino or latte after adding a little milk. I adore the mild roast and the decaf roast.

My four boys have ridden this trike over and over and sometimes even fight over it. My youngest, age 2 1/2 can manuever it quite easily as the seat is adjustable. I recommend the seat to be placed high for the little ones as they can reach the pedals much easier. Even my 9 year old still wants to ride from time to time. (He is the typical size for 9 years)I agree that the bike is a bit heavy, and one of my boys struggled with that for a little bit but he's mastered it now. This is a very durable bike which has outlasted any plastic ride-on toy that we've ever owned! So I'm now purchasing one for my nephew.

Also the pedal was always coming loose too. Once again with all my strength it finally tightened it. and it too appears to be OK. But....It's a wonderful trike, the kids love to ride it and for this reason i would recommend it, do to it's very well built steel construction and the air filled rubber tires.

Were ours the only tires made of material recycled from a toxic waste dump?I thought the smell would blow off, but now it's been almost 5 months with no abatement (in fact it's worse in warm weather!) making me REALLY wonder if i should let my kids ride this thing.A return at this point seems unlikely -- perhaps I should buy new tires?

So then I had 2 of the 24 I should have received.The next time I called Amazon. At this point (about 2.5 weeks after the original order) they decided they could't actually ship what they advertised, so they told me to send back the two I had received, and they would issue me a refund.

Not only that, with the amount of plastic used in the pen refill, one might as well buy a whole new pen. Other than liking the writing performance of this pen, the main reason I purchased something refillable was so that I would be reducing plastic waste.

Which means they took the tracks and MASTERED them to cd quality. The mastering was NOT done from an mp3 source either, and anyone who bought the original mp3 downloads also knows this - as the original mp3s were of pretty bad quality. The tracks on this cd are not of bad quality & if you played the original mp3s side by side with this disc and couldn't hear the difference - you are freakin' DEAF!Great album, great songs.

They sound a lot different than the tracks released on NUDE. Also, all of the songs that were not released on NUDE are fantastic.

Then I picked up \\"Turquoise and Crimson\\" and it revived my faith in this band's talent. Songs like \\"Dead Angels\\" and especially, \\"Where It Never Rains\\", leaves you with a deep and soulful feeling.

Just because you were on a fire base, didn't mean you were safe. Shelling, sappers, friends, stupidity, sleepless nights, the overlooked heroism, were all a part of it.

Jack details his life during this 3-4 month ordeal. Loss of friends, million dollar wounds, and the West Dickens street sign are just some of the stories told in this book.This is a great read.

The visiting vicar helps on that score. Adele too learns to appreciate the husband she thought was too proper.

Follow your own heart.","review":"I use to have a belief that \\"psychics\\" could actually tap the \\"Truth\\" from the other side. But after paying $200 for a reading from Echo Bodine, I now strongly doubt it. She gave me completely INCORRECT answers, which caused me harm physically.At this point, I don't believe you should EVER pay for spiritual truth. If someone is charging you, they are taking advantage of you. Follow your own instincts and your own heart!!!!If she is wrong in a reading -- how accurate are her books??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Echo Bodine!","review":"I have read several of Echo's books and all are very good.

I found it to be very informative. It was also easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The first time I read this book, it opened my eyes to a new way of looking at things. I just downloaded it and read it again and got more out of it than the first time. I love the way the author writes... like she's talking to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like this author","review":"Recently introduced to Echo Bodine, I like her voice. I find her work engaging, enjoyable, not always to the depth that I would like, but helpful overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gift - Understand and Develop Your Psychic Abilities","review":"This is the first book I have read by Echo Bodine. I am very impressed with her writing style - very reader friendly. And out of all the books I've read on developing psychic abilities, Echo's is the best so far. I especially appreciate her chapter on what the Bible says about psychic abilities. This is something, in particular, that I have struggled with personally. She has helped me to understand where these psychic gifts are coming from and presented Biblical scripture to back it up. I look forward to reading more of Echo Bodine's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but one problem.","review":"The thing about this book is that it makes it seem like if you use tools in your work then your not a psychic. Some of the best psychics I know use divanation tools. Theres nothing wrong with the tarot astrolgy i ching or reading palms. Its like anything else in life. We cant cut wood without a saw. We cant boil water without heat. Same concept. Other than that its a all together great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"I found this book a very intriguing read. Echo always does such a fantastic job in the composition of her books. She not only covers the subject of psychic capabilities but explores each type of psychic ability individually. She also presents the subject of psychic capabilities from several viewpoints, not just the standard cliché standpoint that \\"all those who are into this sort of thing are evil, devil-worshipers, witches...etc.\\" She presents very valid and thought provoking viewpoints and explanations. I recommend this book to anyone wanting a non-bias and non-pagan explanation for psychic capabilities and for those looking for insight on the subject period."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gift","review":"This was an easy read. I appreciated the practical suggestions. I was dissapointed with the Biblical explanations - a bit shallow in research/explanation. In fairness to her she had said that the publisher wouldn't let her give all of the research that she had done. But still what she did explain was lacking in depth. The better read if you are looking for that aspect as I was would be to read Tiffany Snow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fine","review":"Sjipping was fast.

I have been to two different lakes with this device and it gives only the outline of the land mass, it does not show underwater obstructions, roads, bridges, Marinas, just the basics. I wanted a GPS device that shows me the shore lines so when I am fishing at night I will not run my boat aground and that is what it does. I use lake maps for the rest. You do not have to download any maps with this device.The vertical sonar,fish finder, water temperature, boat speed, longitude and latitude all works great.If you are looking for a GPS that is more detailed with mapping capabilities, this device is not for you, but if you just need a basic GPS to keep from running aground at night it works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father of the Blues","review":"I cannot express enough how great this collection is.Along with B.B King,James Cotton and many others,Muddy Waters combines the Blues with a solid beat that is great for rock fans as well as Blues fans.This is the most complete set there is.Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Clestine Prophecies, THE Autobiography has arrived","review":"If you only buy one book a year, you're in luck - this is the book. I have just finished it and can't recommend it highly enough. Where \\"Celestine Prophecies\\" set the standard for popular spirituality, this novel picks up the ball and scores THE touchdown! Personally I don't subscribe to Reincarnation, but Patton writes with such convincing atmosphere and detail that I may have to review my beliefs. There are few books in my life that I have read cover to cover in one sitting, \\"THE Autobiography\\" has just become one of them! Like Castenada's Don Juan, I believe Patton's Jesus will live beyond the printed page."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most bogus books ever written","review":"This is a pure scam by some compete idiot claiming to be \\"Jesus\\" who should be put into a mental institution immediately. This guy has no idea what he is talking about except putting out lies in the form of \\"autobiography\\". One other reviewer has pointed out various faults, along with which I would like to add, the state of \\"Orissa\\" did not exist at that time, where this fraud claims to have gone. I don't know what kind of \\"authentic\\" research was carried on. But this guy is definitely in the long line of fake writers just to fool some people and make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old stuff","review":"Every time I hear someone say that Jesus acquired his spiritual insight by travelling to the far East, I can only shake my head in astonished disbelief. Anyone who thinks this is possible would do well to undertake a thorough study of the Torah (Old Testament) and the Gospels (and ask God for understanding while doing so). Jesus fits far more easily into the tradition of Hebrew spirituality than any other tradition. This becomes more and more clear to me as time goes on, and that's just from reflecting on things I USED to read in the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"How low can I rate this?","review":"I won't waste too many words describing this woeful effort. New age mumbo-jumbo passed off as the life story of the Messiah will not and cannot fly.

It is poorly written, whether viewed as fiction or fact, and here I must say that anyone who considers that it could BE fact is sadly self-delusional. It's too bad that I don't have the room here to pick the book apart logically. This reads like a very poorly written piece of cont. fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Response to Carolg23","review":"I can't speak for everyone who gave it a low rating, but I know that the reason I did was not because it was a non-traditional view of Jesus.

Open This Book With Care!","review":"We invited Richard Patton to a session of our monthly mystery school after reading this fascinating book, The Autobiography. While the story reads smoothly, the process of producing it was long, even tedious. Patton is to be congratulated for pursuing his own pastlife \\"memories\\" to conclude this well-told tale. It helps readers expand the boundaries of orthodoxy and come to a fuller understanding of who Jesus of Nazareth was/is. What is \\"fact\\" and what isn't, here, is not as important as how one \\"incorporates\\" an understanding of what the purpose of a world saviour is. Patton clearly says Jesus is our \\"wayshower.\\" So, the question becomes, \\"Am I walking in the way that is/was shown?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a poorly-written book","review":"With all the \\"10's\\" customers were giving to Patton's book, I thought it would be worth my while to take a gander. After reading the first chapter I realized that I wasted my money. I went to Amazon and looked again at all the customer reviews and noticed that his seeming legion of fans were also pushing his book on all the bestselling religion titles, saying stuff like, \\"If you thought this book was good, check out Richard Patton's \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth\\". It is obvious that Patton and/or close friends of his have grossly abused Amazon's generous policy of allowing customers to review books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I discovered this book while reading the reviews of Elizabeth Clare Prophet's, \\"The Lost Years of Jesus\\". The reviews were remarkable. I ordered through amazon.com, and read the book in two days, putting it down only to sleep. How absolutely beautiful this Jesus is. This book needs mainstream awareness...I could not find it in the computers of two Nevada City, Ca bookstores. Thank you Richard Patton, you have performed a great service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book needs to be made into a film!","review":"With very little religious background I was able to understand just who Jesus was. With Da Vinci's Code just about to be released the author should be ready with a screenplay. Mel Gibson look out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, pathetic execution","review":"While Patton's idea is an interesting one, his execution is severely lacking. His prose conveys the impression not of a quality author writing about Jesus, but of a neo-spiritualist looking to make a quick buck by writing about controversial material. Certainly, the image of Jesus presented is probably closer to the historical Jesus than the one depicted in the gospels, but Patton unfortunately also manages to give him a surreal, Indiana-Jones quality that simply doesn't fit. Jesus may have been a wise man, but swimming with crocodiles was probably beyond the range of his abilities. Moreover the idea that Jesus travelled to the East to study the Eastern religions, a journey which takes up a large portion of the book, is nothing original. On the whole, this may be a good book for a (somewhat) refreshing view of Jesus, but it's certainly won't pass for good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating and absorbing","review":"A fascinating and absorbing account of the man around whom the Christian Church is founded. This book is a compendium of many of the New Age theories around Jesus and his training prior to being 'publicly' announced. For me it certainly addressed and answered many of the contradictions of the New Testament. It must have taken some courage to claim to have written \\"THE\\" Autobiography and for the most part, I believe this author has succeeded. In its own right as a novel, \\"THE Autobiography\\" is a fascinating read. As a work of revelation, only history will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing revelation - GREAT BOOK!","review":"I hadn't expected anyone could deliver fresh information on this subject without being patronising. Patton has succeeded beyond my expectations. Here is an autobiography that brings the Icon of Christianity to contemporary life. If this was a movie, I would be camping out to be first in line. This is riveting material thast has stepped out of the dust covers of religion and onto the streets of the 21st century. This is what Scorcese was attempting in the \\"Last Temptation\\" but failed by selling out to sensationalism. For me, Jesus the Man has become a reality that has immediate relevence to my life.

I was able to make voice calls while riding. I had to boost the volume of my music files in order to hear my tunes. That one failed about eight months later. IMC honored the warranty and replaced it with a new unit that didn't cancel noise as well as the first one. I had to stop and turn the motor off in order to make a voice call. Also, the wires between the speakers and mic seemed to be a little shorter which determined which side the mic and the wire that came out of the helmet were to be on. I also had to unwind the the wire around the speaker magnets in order place the speakers inline with my ears. I'm having trouble with this headset after about six months.

First the volume is way too low, I can not hear any phone calls. Also when using it for music on my iPhone I can barely hear the music going 50-70MPHs. The other issue is the connector at the helmet is a big block and it does not feel good against your neck. I had to keep adjusting the cable while riding which isn't safe. This also does not allow you to switch the headphones out for better ones unless you cut the cord. The cord is almost too short if you have a handlebar mount for your phone. The cord needs to be about a foot longer for this setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"The headset is easy to install and is very simple to use.

I found only one and was not disappointed: Prince John Magruder by Paul Casdorph (1996). There is not even a listing for him in my World Book encyclopedia. But the author gave a limited account of the important charade which substantially deterred Maj. Gen. George Brinton McClellan and his Federal army in its march toward the Confederate capital of Richmond. Magruder's flair, as descibed by the author, was perhaps unequalled, excepting Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, of course.

The research that went into the creation of this novel is incredible. There are thousands of fun facts that Burkes somehow found a way to relate to one another. Although the transitions from fact to fact were sometimes confusing, I learned several little tidbits of useful information, ranging from the building of the Suez Canal to the development of the air condintioner. Overall, I thought the book was fun and informative, and contained plenty of fun and wacky facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burke is trying too hard","review":"After producing the marvelous and engaging series \\"Connections\\", Burke seems to have gone to the well one to many times with \\"Circles\\". Burke trys to take his 'Connections' approach to identify complete circles in the connections of history. But rather than taking the connections where they lead, this self-imposed, artificial constraint leads to a combination of wild leaps and tidy little packages that just doesn't ring true. Burke comes out looking like he's just trying too hard, and a reader who's really paying attention will just refuse to follow.Okay, there are some curious and interesting historical connections identified here, but it's just too hard to follow Burke's route just to glean a few gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Round and round we go;where we stop,only Burke knows.","review":"This book consists of 50 different trips throughTechnology,Science,History,Culture,Personal Relationships and a few other things;but in the end they all end up where the trip started.The trips in this book are reminiscent of the trips Burke used to take us on in his TV series Connections. I enjoyed the trips on Connections much more than the trips in this this book for a number of reasons. Since the connections that are detailed are interesting asides which are quite surprising and entertaining ;but not particularly earth shattering.These trips are little else than entertaining;and as such they are far better presented with video than simply by prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"six degrees of historical separation","review":"In this book there seems to be no notion of causality in history; Burke just meanders from person to person, invention to invention.

As an avid reader of science non-fiction, I find this book to be annoying and tedious. It is as if no one even considered proofreading the end product, since each essay absurdly draws connections by making giant leaps in logic without offering any meaningful explanation as to why.

Themes for trivia games are nice, but not required, and certainly not a porno-video game (the better you play, the most skin they show). No more to say about this game's badness.

There is a history lesson in explaining what prejudice existed and how the Crispus Attucks family dealt with it. The book cronicles the high school story of Oscar Robertson in particular and the Crispus Attuck Tigers from 1950 thru Oscar's final high school game as the number one player on Indiana's all star team vs the Kentucky all star team lead by \\"King Kelly Coleman\\". I was an Indianapolis high school resident during this period and can speak for the historical accuracy and emotional insights brought into focus by the author Randy Roberts.

On a couple of occasions, the peg that was supposed to be attached to one piece got stuck in another piece when trying to pull the pieces apart and my husband actually had to use a pliers to extract it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I could hardly put it down. The main character in this book, Viola, is a young woman without a very thorough education but a good heart and good instincts about how to be a friend to others. She learns to cook, makes costly mistakes, and becomes friends with some incredible characters. It is mostly a funny, romantic book but it touches on a few serious issues. It made me think some and laugh a lot! This book is definitely worth your time especially if you enjoy cooking, art, or the \\"romance\\" of the English countryside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"A fascinating book regarding what causes failures in structures. Anyone who builds or designs should read this book. Full of interesting real-world lessons in what can go wrong from incompetent workers or designers, to mistaken assumptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for Sports Parents","review":"This book has a message for anyone raising kids involved in organized sports - the leagues have changed since you were a kid. Many leagues wash out kids at young ages through unrealistic expectations, focus on winning at all costs, brutal schedules and cuts of kids who want to play. If you worry about the cost of competitive sports to your kid, this is a good book to read. The adults in your childrens' leagues need to have childrens' best interests at heart. Author Bob Bigelow, former NBA player and author states he probably would have been cut if he started as a kid today in a competitive basketball league. Whether you agree or disagree with the authors' points, you will probably find some ideas to ponder in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"As described","review":"This book arrived in great condition and very quickly. It was for a friend, so I can't comment on the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda Junk","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the other reviews! This book is not well organized, or written, and has little substance, if any. It keeps saying the same thing over and over and over again. The book only takes a look a youth sports from a very narrow viewpoint. This book may be good for those who feel it is necessary to completely shield kids from competition even though they will have to face it everyday of their lives as an adult. This book should be geared to those kids that only want to play recreationally and have no ambitions in sport whatsoever. It leads you to believe the whole world is made up of poor little kids that keep getting \\"cut\\" from teams, yet totally ignores dealing with talented, focused, athletes who have some higher goals. The book constantly berates programs that \\"cut\\" kids. I'm sorry, but there has to be a place for the higher levels at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Basic Book for Barbie Knitters","review":"On the plus side, this book has beautiful photogaphy and simple but very pretty styles, designed with an appropriate gauge (mostly about 6 to 8 stitches per inch).The most noticeable flaw: there are several mistakes in the instructions. It's not hard to figure out the corrections, but gee whiz, didn't anybody proofread this before it was printed?This book is ideal for beginning to intermediate knitters, who mostly want to make clothes for their kids' dolls. Advanced knitters and doll collectors, who prefer more complex, sophisticated shaping and fit, will probably find the patterns in this book too basic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knits: Hits & Misses","review":"The very first pattern I tried from this book had an error in the pattern.

I'll have to gain my fed education elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact or Fiction???","review":"Here we go again. Another Woodward book that makes a nice story, but is not sourced.

His obvious bias makes it difficult to take the book seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maestro Gone Mad","review":"The appropiate title of this book should be \\"Maestro Gone Mad\\". Greenspan overstepped his judgement of the pace of the economy. Instead easing the interest rate rise he continued to bellow the flames. Now the economy has slowed to the point of recession. Tens of thousands of people are layed off. I bet they have a Merry Christmas! No this man Greenspan is no Maestro, at least not any more. He has gone MAD!

However, I wasn't expecting much from Woodward - and unfortunately I wasn't disappointed.The book briefly chronicles Greenspan's life and offers some sharp apercus on his celebrated tenure as Federal Reserve Chairman over the past decade-and-a-half. The book provides about as much detail and insight as a well-written newspaper or journal series and can easily be read in a day or two.If you know little about the Federal Reserve and central banking in general, perhaps this book will be informative or a least serve as a primer for more serious reading. Otherwise, I don't see any reason to bother with this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dull stuff","review":"I ran up on this book at \\"Everything's a Dollar\\" (there were SEVERAL copies of it on hand, too) and wondered why a new book by Bob Woodward about Alan Greenspan would end up there. It didn't take me long to figure it out. I have read other Woodward books (the best two being All the President's Men and The Final Days), but this one is more like The Brethren: an excruciatingly hard to read account of a subject that surely is more interesting than it comes across. I have taken so many Economics courses that I now know absoutely nothing about the subject, but if you like economics and reading about federal monetary policy you'll be able to wade through this book.

This book isn't it. Woodward appears clueless about economics and trivializes the actions of the FOMC while attempting to raise Alan Greenspan to diety status. Ironically, the portrait of Greenspan emerges as more of a benign genius who is as in the dark as the rest of us concerning the consequences of FOMC actions. Woodwards attempts to dramatize each one-quarter of a point Fed Funds move fall flat, both in analyis and results. Its such a shame that this book will become what many readers will undoubtedly regard as a \\"true\\" picture of the Fed simply because it hit the NY Times bestseller list.

The boom was brought about by record low oil prices in real dollars and the \\"dollarization\\" of the world economy. In effect,the US was able to run substantial trade deficits with minimal negative impact since foreign banks (OPEC and the Far East) held dollars as their reserve currency. The demographics of the American population also contributed to unprecedented economic growth. With a record number of baby boomers entering their prime income earning years during the mid-80's through the 1990's, the demand for housing and cars was bound to grow with a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. Don't forget that the S&L bailout in the late 1980's forced the government to compete with the private sector for capital, further stalling the economy. Clinton had the fortune of taking office at a better time than any president in American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I enjoyed a book on the Fed!","review":"I wanted to be more informed about how The Fed operates and wound up being educated and entertained. A page turner; definitely underrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reporter, poor book writer","review":"Woodward has never, in my opinion, written a good book. His specialty and genius is the newspaper article. As a result this book is another in a series by him that I find informative but written without verve or excitement. He makes the obvious points: that Greenspan endures political pressures, that he studies a massive amount of data, that he makes statements that are vague and leave room for face-saving exits. Other interesting tidbits include how Greenspan uses cocktail parties with the political elite to find out who is up and who is down and that Greenspan once rubbed elbows with the superficial social philosopher Ayn Rand.However, I found reading the book a chore, which is sad. I think Woodward has good stories to tell but books are not his medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Milestone In The Sad Decline In American Journalism","review":"This is a deeply, deeply disappointing book. It is an incomplete chronological romp through the Greenspan years, with nothing new to say and zero analysis of the most exciting period in US economic history. Bob Woodward is lazy, uninspiring and unchallenging as a writer. What Woodward likes to call the book's \\"informal\\" style reads like an unpolished first draft. I would have failed this as a freshman paper, because it represents nothing more than a timeline with soundbites attached. It is truly pathetic that the political and publishing establishment looks up to this man. The only thing more pathetic is that the American public keeps buying his lightweight books. This book is a product of it's time - a nothing book in an age where the lowest common denominator seems to get lower every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Needs a Rate Cut","review":"Woodward is playing for the mass market with this one (I suppose this goes without saying); it's a light read with few new details (other than some personal observations culled in interviews with Fed Associates and Politicos), and disappointing because it lack direction. Woodward touches on several topics which individually could have comprised an entire book. Many themes are glossed over in favor of a good \\"sound bite\\"--a juicy quote that covers a multitude of sins. It's a poor effort, and considering the homage Woodward pays to Greenspan's relentless attention to detail, I doubt even Greenspan would be impressed by this amateurish attempt to interpret the numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending these back!","review":"These boots feel very cheap and are made in china!

The paint on the front saying \\"Nikon\\" is an ever-so-slightly different font. There's a tiny (<1mm) hole on the edge and an included string for tethering (I don't use it). The Nikon cap says \\"LC-67\\" on the back and this one doesn't.Compared to the real Nikon caps, they feel the same, fit the same over the lenses, and have the same pinch mechanism that makes Nikon caps much better than other brand's caps. I use these on my Mamiya 7 lenses because the Mamiya caps are loose and annoying in comparison.Recommended. You can get about five of these for the cost of one legit Nikon cap, and they're just as good. Shame on Nikon for charging so much for their own replacement caps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price","review":"This lens cap is very similar to the Nikon one that was lost.

After seeing stacks of BTBs books, I decided this was the one.It seems as though the author had a list of unusual vocabulary words that she was intent on using. Ie: \\"He lifted his eyes to the etiolated sky.\\" What?There are so many themes going on in this short book, but none of them well developed. Man leaves boring wife, begins work with a woman, takes up with her as a new lover, learns wife has cancer, vows to take care of her, girlfriend gets pregnant, wife has an accident near death experience, learns that she has been negative and boring, apologizes to husband for not being the wife he should have had, releases him to love his girlfriend, recovers from accident but shortly thereafter dies from her cancer, and our hero marries the girlfriend. Come on!This book is so poorly written, I would not pick up another one from the tall stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new twist -- couldn't put it down !!!","review":"This novel had a very timely twist to it which made it a real page turner. It was much too short and I wanted to know more about some of the characters that were brought up such as Samantha -- what ever happened to her?

Although I scanned through this quite a while ago, I am taking the time to tender these comments, so that others may save their time and money. This book is a perfect example of terrible writing, an improbable plot, two dimensional characters - there is nothing to recommend this piece of fluff.

A spinster, opinionated beautiful heroine and a rakish hero. The first part of the book dragged interminably. There was a meeting between the H and h and then she went to tea and OMG I thought I was in another book! The author waffled on about her best friend and her romance and highwaymen and secret assignments.. I got a bit lost. Then finally the hero returned and there were some interesting bits.

But the pacing in this book was just sooooo sloooooow. When I sit down to read for a half an hour I want the story to go places. I am a fast reader and in half an hour I think the heroine moved from one room to another (slight exaggeration) I couldn't finish this book although I tried a few times. Maybe if I had actually liked the characters I might have but it was grueling. The oh so beautiful heroine who was as dumb as a brick. Sorry, but the whole idea of confronting the highwayman by herself at night??? Yeah right. I can handle breathtaking beauty when there are some brains along with it. Maybe I missed the point, but this one did not do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the 5-star ratings","review":"The story begins with the heroine being insensitive, selfish, inconsiderate. I don't know why her best friend stays friends with her. Early in the story the heroine meets the man who will be her husband. But then we don't see him again for more than 1/3 of the book. I just couldn't stand the heroine's personality long enough to see (1) the hero come back to the story, or (2) the heroine improve enough to be likable. I made several attempts to read this story, but finally gave up about 1/3 the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed","review":"There were some slow parts.

I worked with women who had been abused and abandoned as Isabel had been. She captures their feeling of absolute hopelessness . When I would ask these women why they stayed under such circumstances. They would say things like I didn't know what else to do, I couldn't support the children alone, or worse felt they probably deserve their misery. Isabel experienced all these feelings, but overcame them for the sake of her children. Most woman wouldn't have quite as many male admirers to help as she, but none the less when you don't have a choice you do what you need to do. This is a story any woman who is being abused should read. Yes, there can be a better life!Jane Yanagi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors create doubt","review":"I used this guide in 1988.

In Peshawar, Grand Trunk Road is known as GT Road.After much difficulty getting this sorted out, the traveler learns that buses for Darra do not leave from this station.

I had a copy of this same show on record (remember records?) that sounded twice as good as this does. I bought this for a couple of songs (Rich B*tch, etc) but if you can find the orignal blue cover LP on vinyl, pick that up and leave this badly dubbed CD alone. I am getting sick and tired (pun intended) of all the die hard Iggy fans giving four and five stars to CD's that sound like sh*t. Buy the remasted CD's of The Stooges and Funhouse, search out the original CD of Raw Power (Iggy's new re-mix is digital distorted), and you should have all the Stooges you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I've never been to fond of this album mainly because it wasrecorded at the end of the Stooges career and Iggy by this point waswaist deep in self destrution. There's plenty of bantering and instigating but this in itself does not make a good record be it punk or anything else. Driving by an accident is always fun too right? Stick with the first 2 albums and Iggys \\"Lust For Life\\" and leave this for fanatics only. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID","review":"I bought this after hearing all the fanfare, and reading mixed reviews on amazon. It's obvious some people who reviewed this were letting their devotion for Iggy get in the way of giving an intelligent and realistic verdict. The CDs sound awful, to put it bluntly. On the first disc one can barely hear the guitar, and on the second it sounds like the show was recorded by a microphone that was under a wet blanket. It's interesting as a document of how out of control Iggy's shows got, but it's worth one listen, if that. It seems like Iggy has this huge mystique surrounding him that causes every piece of crap recording out there to get released. The liner notes said he wasn't even making money off this one, that's a good indication of market flooding. If listening to good punk music involves listening to garbage like this, I want nothing to do with it. This isn't the real truth or the best example of Iggy Pop live. It's just pushing garbage disguised as gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is IT!","review":"Call it a historical document if you want, but this is an essential album for punk disciples everywhere. Comic and dramatic, and often incendiary musically. The Stooges packed it in after the songs on disc one, but they went down swinging.Highlights, apart from Iggy sparring with the crowd, are the bitter \\"I Got Nothing\\", a scrappy \\"Cock In My Pocket\\", and the final, nasty, end-of-the-road \\"Louie Louie\\", with lyrics worthy of the song's myth. James Williamson rocks up a storm throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"An informative, enjoyable read","review":"As a non-native interested in learning about native cultures, I very much appreciate being able to learn directly from the source.

When she returns to the reservation to practice after graduation from medical school, she learns that adding traditional medicine can make her work more effective, since it provides hope and healing energy to the patients. She experiences this first-hand when she seeks out a medicine man to perform rituals to help her and her chlid when she develops complications while pregnant.She also learns that her cultural traditions have a place in all areas of her life and provides explanations of many Navaho rituals.

As I read through the book I felt as if I was travelling with the author through this life journey of hers. What makes the book acceptable is the fact that the author does not make any judgement about the cultures that she has to be in. Her attempt to combine the best of both the worlds is the main attraction in the book. I agree with her totally that the need of the hour is holistic approach to any medical intervention. Coming from India I do understand the gap in the modern approach to 'cure', namely the 'healing'. I wish many non native Indians would read this book and benefit from its facts.I wish the doctor all the very best in her present endevour of popularising the holistic approach among the modern medical world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merging of a personal and professional life - very moving,","review":"This book was a surprisingly wonderful experience. The authors have brilliantly woven together a woman's personal inner life and professional strivings. It made me examine the working together of my own life in the same way. Very personal and intimate, yet exciting reading too. A touching and sensitive depiction of the real Native American life -- the one we never really know.

Each of the monks learned a different style of Kung Fu. Fu has learned the Tiger style. The main events in the story are: grandmaster is killed, the temple is set on fire and a former student steals the dragon scrolls. During the fire the five monks escape. The story continues with Fu trying to get back the scrolls and him wanting to be with his brothers.I like Fu a lot because he loves to fight and he hates to give up a fight.

The main characters are fleshed out well, and the plot has many intriguing hooks (which, of course, are left unresolved at the end, so that you'll read the next book). The story, which moves at a fast clip and doesn't bore with too much description, is punctuated by several engaging, well-written action scenes.

Yes, there are references here and there to god and whatnot. I'm not a religious person at all, but this book is not what some people may think because the ideas still apply to life regardless of your POV on spirituality; it's about lessons in life and it isn't telling people to follow certain morals of any certain religion (the authors don't try to press that onto the reader). So, if you are anti-religious and someone who's turned off by those kinds of things, start reading and begin to notice such mentionings, I advise you still don't pass over this book (it's not as if every-other word is \\"god\\" or something like that anyway).

One of the problems is that when envisioning an alien invasion of Earth, it seems that John Ringo had to think of a way where Earthlings can actually fight back. It just seems somewhat unbelievable to me, although he's developed a whole subplot involving the evoloution (or Uplift) of the various alien species. Either way, Ringo seems to go out of his way to say that humans (and by extension, Americans) are superior to everybody else, even spacefaring aliens. The book is not as interesting as the first book, but he continues with his political commentary. It got a little too tiresome for me, yet I still finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great characters involved in fast action military battles.

In the second book the hero is kind of depressing, his wife got killed, one daughter has become a robot and the other a crazy killer. In this book humans are losing big time and the battles are not very enjoyable. That subplot in the underground city was almost as bad as the couple of chapters in Key West in the first book. Then, all the women in the book are white trash psichos.

However, the Posleen don't adhere to schedules, so the fun begins a little early...I have to say here again, when reading this series, you have to remember what you are getting into. This is not cerebral stuff by a long shot, but it is fun.One thing that really annoyed me about the book was Oneal. Just something about the way Ringo paints him bugs me. Sure, he's a hero. I get that. But saying \\"Nyah, nyah, you can't hurt me!\\" in the middle of combat was a bit much to be expected to swallow. It was almost too much, even with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Gust Front\\" worth the read","review":"I enjoyed Ringo's first book in this series, and was even happier with \\"Gust Front\\". The editing and pacing of this book was \\"tighter\\", and the story was more fleshed out.The characters in this novel were well developed, with real emotions, goals, and attitudes. What I really liked was that there were few of the black/white/good/bad stock characters, and that even the fools and the cowards were given real personalities and real motivations. The plot was well paced, and the climax was a real payoff.Both \\"Gust Front\\" and \\"A Hymn Before Battle\\" are sort of a combination of Harold Coyle's \\"Team Yankee\\", Drake's \\"Slammers\\" series, and Turtledove's \\"Worldwar\\" series.

I first heard Johnson from First Wives Club (closing credits song)-that song would be Over and Over, which is not on her cd.Favs are--Forever More, Outside My Window (song with a messege), Yearning, Some Kind of Miracle and God Sent You.I would describe her voice as somewhere in between Toni Braxton (not that deep) and Whitney Houston (not as high, nor does Puff Johnson try to go beyond her boundaries). I highly recommend the cd, I can easily sit through the entire album. It's unfortunate that Ms. Johnson no longer appears to be around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Violin varish cleaner","review":"This 25cc bottle contains a liquid used to clean the sticky resin (that accumulates from the bow) from off the varnished surface of a violin (etc).

Bromiley's book is a fine resource not only for the obvious reason that it provides swift access to theology of the massive tomes of Barth's Dogmatics, but also for Bromiley's insightful and lucid explications and summaries. Being structured after the Dogmatics, it is not only a typical introduction, but it gives an idea of the Dogmatics in nuce. It is a highly recommended stepping stone to Barth's magisterial work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not challenging","review":"I got this video because I have the Reebok Hi-Low Impact Video - which is AMAZING, I have been using it for 15 years. And I have the Legs video which is also amazing. The Legs video can be pretty challenging and it really tones your legs. I expected the same with the Abs video. It however is not challenging at all. Maybe if you were 100% out of shape this would be difficult but I got through the first two exercises (10 minutes each)and I felt like I had wasted my time. I haven't even bothered with the 3rd exercise yet.

The telescope is two lenses that you attach to the pen, and it has a pretty far range. The recorder works great, the button is well hidden so no one has any idea that you're recording them because it doesn't beep when you press record. Even if they accidentally press the play button your cover isn't blown because the pen doesn't have a speaker. You have to put it in the (awesome looking) carrying case to hear the recording when you hit play. Only YOU can hear what you've recorded! My only complaints are that the case only locks when the pen is inside, if you take the pen out of the compartment on the case anyone can open it. The XP-4 spy pen has a lock on the case that only the pen can open, so it's better than the X2 in that respect. Also, the light on the X2 only turns on if you hold down the button, so you have to keep holding the button while you're writing. But still, it's cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon will probably not send you the right thing","review":"This spy pen is probably great, but I wouldn't recommend ordering it from Amazon because you probably won't get the right thing.

Although they should have left out all the dialogue, it's pretty annoying when you just want to hear the music. I don't like it because if I hear the dialogue over and over again it kind of ruins it for me when i watch the movie cuz I've heard it so many times.

The Napolean Dynamite soundtrack includes songs that were NOT even used in the film (one example I Want Candy), but then it fails to include THE MAIN THEME by The White Stripes. I think if a CD is going to be called a soundtrack it should at least include all the music that was used in the film. And, how can a soundtrack not include the MAIN TITLE THEME SONG?!

I was also a little confused why the Alternate Ending Montage is used on here & not the Original Ending Montage. In every other aspect this soundtrack pretty sweet.

My favorite quote being about Nessie being blown out of the water. Also, I like the A Team theme song alot as well.The movie is great, but the music isn't anything special by itself. In the movie, it may enhance the quirkiness of Napoleon, but listening to it in your room or car is just plain boring in my opinion, maybe because I prefer full orchestrations.But hey, if you like the 80's, some Napoleon quotes and the A Team theme song, then you might like this CD.

Parry has identified most of the missing songs in his review. Another annoying feature of the sondtrack is the inclusion of songs that are not in the film. The final problem is that the dialogue from the movie is such poor quality that you can barely hear it. I wouldn't have bought the soundtrack had I had this information before.

The Dance Numbers at least keep You awake, but the Years 1988-92 found Estefan leaning on Ballads, and One was barely distinguishable from another; on top of that, the 4 New Cuts feel like padding, to fill a CD's worth of material for a Christmastime Release...a Couple of Hits are missing, too(i.e., Bad Boys), so to summarize, Nothing truly Bad here, but precious little on Target...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't too impressed.","review":"Gloria Estefan is a GREAT artist, but this CD didn't do much for me.

A limited talent at best, she started off as the singer in Miami Sound Machine, where she should have stayed.

That track is the only good one on this CD. Once she became Miss Cuban hootchie-cootchie mama, quality was thrown aside for utter banality. But everybody loves a superstar, right? Even if mediocrity \\"gets in the way\\". Unbelievably, MSM made a return without her on the soundtrack to the forgettable Sylvester Stallone film \\"The Specialist\\", with the tribal-sounding dance chart hit \\"Jambala\\", which turned out to be better than anything recorded with Estefan.

I'll never forget his 'love affair' with the Thomson sub machine gun. (It saved his life many times and deserved love!)Megellas was used to hard times. He worked in the WPA and liked it too.

Isn't this the war that officially ended American innocence?The games where about heroics, being as good a human being as possible, this book is just about death. While I will admit that the name of the book seems to be sarcastic, it is sad to see such a great title dragged through blood drenched mud and slaughter.Also, shouldn't someone be paying Vivendi for using the name?

Some of these books are famous, some of them are obscure. Jess Nevins has done an excellent job of tracking down the books, so now you can know the history of these characters, many of which have been forgotten one hundred years later. For instance, I don't think too many people knew who \\"Rose Coote\\", the headmistress of the girl's school, was. Well, in this book, you can learn the history of that character, as well as every other character who is so much as mentioned in the comic. By the way, I met Jess at the San Diego Comic Con, and he said he is working on an Encyclopedia about the League.

There are millions who say we should do something to help the poor, help the homeless, help the hungry, but Jimmy Carter actually tries.After reading Mr. Goldberg's account, I find there is nothing in it which outweighs Carter's work for Habitat for Humanity, not to mention everything else he does.

It is well writen and seems researched, but keep in mind that in almost any opinion book, you are libel to get a one-sided look at any matter that the author has feeling on.

Lacking any real substance, it is essentially an amateurish blog in paper form. Some of the chapters are amusing reading, others pointless diatribes, and most rehashing of complaints against easy targets. Nothing new to really read. The best option is to pick up the book at a local library and read the first few chapters, which are the best the author has to offer.I really had hoped the author would provide substantive criticisms of the people he chose, but rather he just presents his own opinion of why he doesn't like them.

Now think about what's happening here. Someone like Goldberg writes a smear book that dovetails with the smearing and propagandizing already being done by the radical right, Fox being one of its most prominent voices. Rupert Murdoch publishes the book. A web page is set up on the publisher's site to smear from there, and the author goes on a publicity tour which includes many appearances on Murdoch's Fox News. During the author's appearance(s), Fox shows the book's cover and generally promotes the book, but the audience is never told about the author's connection to Fox and News Corp. The book is partisan hatred, period. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Unbelievable","review":"The stupidity contained in this \\"book\\" is almost beyond comprehension.

But when a kind and decent man deeply committed to social justice and basic human rights is determined to be one of the Top 100 People Screwing Up America, there is a problem. And yes, there is a problem. Many of them. One of them is with the individual that wrote this book. If you think intolerance is funny, then you will find this book downright hilarious. If you find Bernard Goldberg funny, chances are that you are a scary, scary person and don't even realize it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And So it Came To Pass","review":"In digital years, 100 People is so \\"yesterday\\" yet it foretells the very future in which we now live. Back in 2005 when this book was published, there was at least some opposing counterweight to these liberal heavyweights. Now the political and economic policies they supported have contributed greatly to upsetting America's and the globe's economic balance.Bernard Goldberg lays bare that generation born of the radical sixties today grown to full political stature. It is perhaps unfortunate that the voting public was so mesmerized by the media projected visage of a Great Oz ruling over a social safety-netted Emerald City, that they failed to look behind the curtain at who is really pulling the levers.Concise, well written, and to the point.

Totally predictable. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bernard Goldberg on the Daily Show... Ouch!","review":"Goldberg appeared on The Daily Show with John Stewart promoting this book. Stewart normally is a silly, unthreatening interviewer but he went after Goldberg and really skewered him. Stewart demonstrated that Goldberg's claims of balance were nonsense - this is a straight-up right wing hatchet job on left wing figures. More to the point, Stewart asks the key question...do you really feel the need to describe Barbra Streisand (for example)as one of the 100 people screwing up America? One of the 100? With all the problems we face, this is who you identify as the problem? Stewarts exposure of Goldberg's triviality, and Goldberg's apparent inability to even remotely defend his choices, was an eye-opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfounded generalizations.","review":"I found his characterizations of \\"liberals\\" totally off the wall. He failed to recognize all the liberals that fought for feminine rights, Civil Rights, individual rights and freedodms, etc. As a minister who marched and \\"sat in\\" during the Civil Rights movement and who was spat on and cursed by \\"conservatiives\\" I found the author's paint bruch too broad to be helpful.I certaily agree with some of his personal parodies against people who are just nutty extremists. But I find these people on both sides of the political fence. But, I doubt anyone would appreciate \\"Conservatives\\" being confined to Nazi's or KKK types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's screwing up America?","review":"The only entertaining aspect of this book is the fact that someone wrote it seriously.

And besides, that's not the focus anyway. If you're a die-hard liberal, avoid this book, because you're not going to like it. To anyone else, read it.A lot of people in America need to shape up and shut up, and I'm glad someone finally has listed his opinion of them.Goldberg presents these opinions in an unbiased, funny, republican way, making this one of the best books I've ever read.Chances are, If you don't agree w/ the first three pages, you wont w/ the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it. I beg of you","review":"Although Goldberg does have some strong points regarding the cheapening of American culture, this book isn't worth reading. I don't mean to spoil the surprise, but, no one in the Bush administration is in this book. Simply ridiculous. Hmmmmm...... Is Barbara Streisand really screwing up America more than a man who sends 1500+ kids off to die for no reason? You decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldberg should be on this list","review":"I object to a book that proports to be defending conservative values in America using the term \\"screwing up\\" in its title.

How can you believe an author such as this when he displays such bad taste and bad judgment in naming his book?

The author takes particular note of how contemporary \\"journalists\\" are failing by becoming media darlings and cheapening what hard news is.

Goldberg points out the hypocrisy and sleazy double-standards used by liberals to further their cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unenjoyable","review":"This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book. The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it. It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh. Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark. The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to read the reviews...","review":"If you're a Republican, you'll enjoy this book, except for the extremists who will be ticked off that Michael Savage is on the list and Bill Clinton is not.If you're a Democrat, you'll hate it.It's funny to me that so many Republicans have written reviews about how great the book is, and so many Democrats have written reviews about how horrible it is. It's like switching between FOX and ABC!Nearly 950 reviews?! Come on, the title tells you exactly what you're getting. My rating is based solely on its entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally someone is speaking up for the 'silent majority'.","review":"Thank you for speaking up for the 'silent majority' who have been beaten into submission by the elitist, politically correct, arrogant, intellectual thugs.

He forgot that Dick Cheney told Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont to \\"go $@$#yourself\\" on the Senate floor. Sounds crass to me. Too bad Bob Novak didn't meltdown sooner, Bernie could have overlooked that one, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very One Sided","review":"I read this book and found it to be very one sided. Goldberg himself admits there are mostly liberals on his list, however, I was shocked to not only read that they were all liberals, but who some of them were. I agree with quite a few of the selections. I think the world would be better off without Michael Moore, however, I also believe the world would be better off without Bill O'Reilly. I think even many conservatives would agree that he should definitely be on the list, but he is not. I think that for the most part the people that are screwing up America are both liberal and conservative, and I think they both deserve places on The List."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37)","review":"Bernard Goldberg is a clever and interesting writer. The introduction was terrific and this style was carried on throughout the book. I am interested in the subject matter and that also kept me reading, however, I couldn't wait to get on to the next listing. Not only did this book keep me interested, I learned some facts that I did not know previously. It was fun to view things from a learned journalist point of view with his years of experience and knowledge. The \\"inside\\" world of politics is in many ways a mystery to me but I found deeper understanding of some of it by reading this book. It is written from a conservative point of view, but is filled with facts, some humorous and some very serious and important."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Homerun for Bernie! Straight Shooter!","review":"Having read Goldberg's two previous books, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from his title. He leads in to his list with background on his own personal experiences, and is witty and to the point on the \\"100\\". You'll probably agree with most of his choices and disagree with others, but overall he aims at the hypocrisy on both the left and right (mostly left). There are some eye-openers here! You will be shocked - you couldn't make some of this up if you tried. It is an easy read, a good summer book, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and Arrogant","review":"Another case of the pot calling the kettle...It is a mistake to review this book as if it were serious. A serious look at defining the trouble in America would include the corporate manhadlers, some lobbyisyts, and at least one conservative political name on the list. Instead, it is a list of those people conservatives love to hate. So let's forget the politics and take a look at the amusement value and prose. Both sorely lacking because he takes himself far too seriously and lacks the writing skill to at least bring the book to a pleasant amusing read. If you want to read summer trash then stick with the Danielle Steele novels at least they are honest at what they proport to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical right-wing propaganda","review":"As is typical of books of this genra from the right of center, there is no documentation. I'd like to verify some of Goldberg's claims but it isn't easy. This makes me suspect him of sour grapes. Hardly a book worth spending much time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's another one...","review":"I lost track of how many times the author contradicted himself after the first 40 pages. It always makes me laugh at how all of the conservative talking heads whine about how out-numbered they are in the media. They're either talking a lot louder or they underestimate their own presence, because they're all I ever seem to hear today. Although I agreed with a VERY small number of points that Bernard Goldberg made in this book, this was largely out-of-touch drivel. At least it wasn't as vicious and insensitive as Ann Coulter (who's mean-sprited garbage is described by Goldberg as being done with \\"a twinkle in her eye\\").I defend Goldberg's right to his opinions, as I do everyone's. I guess I just wish that books like this weren't as popular as they are. Afterall, I bought a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows how far conservatism has degenerated","review":"Goldberg really shows how far conservatism has degenerated in recent decades. Conservatives used to be highly skeptical of the power of government to produce positive change and advocated limited government. Now anyone who thinks that the federal government is wreaking destruction, either domestically or abroad, is labeled an \\"America hater\\". Yes, if you have significant misgivings about our misrepresentatives in D.C., you hate America! America equals your so-called federal government. Forget about community, church, geography, ideals, commerce, etc. OFFER FEALTY TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, or else! Do we need any more proof that we have a one-party system?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time","review":"Thanks to Bernard Goldberg we now have a record of who really is screwing up America today. In response to others here who want GW listed, \\"Get a life.\\" He isn't listed because he's not screwing up America. If you really would read through the whole book, (which I doubt you have) then you'd figure it out. What you obviously don't like is that someone has done a very good job pointing out that your locked down and lost persona has been exposed. Great read, good list and very fine writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is missing at least 250 million people.","review":"While I agree that some of the people of the list are absolute pieces of work it is not fair to blame the current state of affairs on them. The real problem is the average American, the guy that sits on the sidelines or stares at the wall doing nothing while this country goes down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe it","review":"In an effort to look unbiased the author tries to pass this book off as a non-partisan, both liberal and conservative bashing book, when in reality it is simply a liberal bashing book. And the ironic thing is, Mr. Goldberg himself is part of the Media Elite he so harshly criticizes.The best part of the book is when he names Michael Moore #1. He gives no explanation as to why he named him number one, indicating that Mr. Goldberg has no argument or justification. He simply places an out-of-context quote under Mr. Moore's picture and expects us all to be content, just taking the author's word for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sleeper","review":"Aside from the overt political bias the book is not particularly substantive nor interesting. Conceptually the author had a good idea, but just did not execute it well. I suppose that is why the author is also the publisher -- generally a red flag."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Stupid Book","review":"The book is essentially right wing propaganda and not worth anyone's time. If anything, it simply exists to make a really bad, slanderous, neo-fascist propaganda book appear high on Amazon search list results for political topics about the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 101, not 100","review":"The 101st would be the one on the cover. Goldberg bashes others who feel entitled to offer public criticism, by offering public criticism. Apparently he is more deserving than others when it comes to such entitlement. If there is a problem (and I dispute that contention), the author is part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is ridiculous","review":"The title attracted me at first, but once I actually started reading I was very disappointed in the lack of substance. I am sorry, but I thought this was going to be a list of 100 people who are actually screwing up America-you know, the people who make decisions and therefore have screwed America in the process. Instead, many of the pages were filled with celebrities, who actually have no decision making authority and therefore have not technically screwed up America. They're just annoying. And yeah, I understand the author might have a little problem with the opinions of Michael Moore (#1), but at least he wasn't the one who made the decision that has cost, and still is costing, many people their lives. Now THAT'S screwing up America for ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Just terrible, this person has no idea what they are talking about and the book is full of lies and errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"What an angry, untalented man Bernie Goldberg is. Apparently, Osama bin Laden is ok, since I don't see him on the list, but people who follow the \\"moral obligation,\\" as Teddy Roosevelt put it, to question our leaders decision making are the real problem in this country.Can't wait to see the notation next to his book on the Times best seller list indicating the bulk sales by Townhall and the rest of the wingnut websites and organizations. This should be on the 50% off shelf within a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godlberg IS what is screwing up America","review":"Anyone who thinks Eminem, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Al Franken, John Edwards, and Micheal Moore (who is #1) is about as screwed up as most of the individuals HE claims to be screwing up America. This book is dumb, idiot, and totally unorthodox, right-wing media. DO NOT BUY!!!!!! and do not waste your precious hard-earned money on this trashy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as I feared","review":"I was prepared to hate this book - just from the pictures on the cover, I was sure it was going to be a completely lopsided attack on liberals, and liberals only. I was a bit surprised to find that he did take aim at a few right-wingers as well, enough to get an extra star from me. For nailing Michael Savage, David Duke and Ken Lay he gets some of my respect. For admitting that the ACLU has done some meritorious things he gets a little more. Overall, however, it was a rehash of stuff I can hear any day on conservative talk-radio, so I cannot recommend it as something profound or thought-provoking. If your conservative leanings cry out to you to read it anyway, just get it from the library and invest the $$$ instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bernard Goldebeg is a Big Fat Idiot","review":"Bernard Goldberg's views are so right wing it makes my computer screen tilt"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible (buy something else)","review":"Poorly written, and flawed right from the get go, this book is more hateful trash from the far right. They have conceived too many real everyday Americans (LIKE ME) that when people on the left who are in a position of some power or influence deal with us as if we are educated citizens who might care about things other than guns and abortion, that they are being elitist and in some way disrespectful. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and as I sit here, watching my once great country slip into a depressing, dangerous conservative oblivion, books like this get published, as their cynical, frightening conservative authors make money and laugh all the way to the bank, as we everyday Americans fund the real elitism in this country - the tyranny of the willful ignorance that we all seem to enter into, waving our flags all the way. Stop this madness. Read something else, like Einstein's Dreams, or The Tipping Point."},{"rating":"1","title":"They really need a zero star rating.","review":"First, this is a review based on an excerpt of the book since based on that excerpt I would never buy such biased uninsightful drivel.Bad enough that I am wasting time on this as it is.The author reminds me of my grandmother who didn't like Martin Luther King Jr. because he 'stirred up all that trouble with the black people'. Some people are so conservative that they fear any change and they hate those who would bring it about. People like Jimmy Carter and Michael Moore and Al Franken hold the USA to a high standard of morality and ethics.

I would have been expelled in college for writing a biased piece like this, but this author gets rich off of it. Please spare yourselves and read the plethora of other, more balanced works out there today. This is far too radical to be worthy of reading.

By putting Al Frankens name in it, are you 1) trying to ride off his popular book 2) working for Fox News now?The list is predictable. It is full of Democrats, with just a few Republicans sprinkled here and there.The big question - why are people like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh, who make it that if you vote for a Democrat, then you hate your country and are stupid, why are these two not on the list. They are everything he says Al Franken is. Actually, they are worse. So why pick on Al, but not list the conservatives? Because this book is pure Republican.Bernard wanted us to feel sorry for him in Bias. Now I start to see why CBS wanted nothing to do with him.

Some may say it's natural evolution -- hasn't every generation said \\"These kids are ruining the country!!?\\" and if that's your view, then you'll find the book interesting. If you truly believe that our morals and sense of decency are being severely eroded through the media, \\"entertainment world\\" and what we consider our rights under the First Amendment, then Goldberg's introduction will ring true with you. And the intro is necessary, because otherwise the book just sounds like a \\"rant.\\" Truth is, I felt it began getting repetitious when I got to #47 so I just flipped through the rest of the book to see who the other 53 were -- but it was a fun and interesting read and I handed it off to my husband with a recommendation.

But like Goldberg, I think many liberals have by definition become the new conservatives; unwilling to bend, unwilling to grow, stuck on dogma. And to be fair, Goldberg hands it to some notable conservatives in the book, as well. Some of the choices have nothing to do with politics, but rather, taste. I didn't agree with all his choices, but I doubt anyone does. But it made me think; and that's why I've giving the book 5 stars. And I am no chickenhawk (in regards to another review); my son is a soldier serving in Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rogue's List","review":"An entertaining book - more conservative readers will find themselves guffawing at the incrediblyridiculous schemings of the predominantly liberal rogues listed in this book, but will ultimately beshocked that these very schemings have wormed their way into American educational curriculum,mainstream media agenda, and domestic policy.Sane readers will probably come away with the conclusion that the road leading to the end of America's reign as a greatnation has been paved by the left and their pc thought policing and tactics.

Few have the courage to tell it like it is and you only get a reaction like that when it hits home. Somewhere along the line we have to learn to disagree without being disagreeable. Discrimination and hate comes in many forms. In an earlier time some of the irresponsible things said by the leaders on the left would be considered giving aid and comfort to the enemy. There is a HUGE difference between descent and irresponsible speech. The left needs to get a grip. Bush is not the enemy. The USA is a great place and nothing that the Michael Moore's of the world say will change that. Libs should READ the book BEFORE they react.

Definitely good for some laughs and for making one aggravated at the hypocrisy of many of those profiled. Most Democrats and liberal leaning folks will find fault with Goldberg's choices for his list, but I think he reasons each one out fairly well. As he states in his prologue, any type of \\"list\\" is subjective and no one is ever going to agree 100% with the author's choices. No doubt, Goldberg leans right, but he is fairly middle of the road politically. Conservatives are not left unscathed and many of Goldberg's choices are people I don't necessarily associate with any political philosophy other than self aggrandizement and greed at others' expense. Overall a good book, an entertaining read which makes some good points- but don't expect to agree totally with the author regardless of your political persuasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"I was suprised so many people faulted him for basing this book on his opinion rather than fact. He readily admits in the opening introduction that this list is completely biased by his own opinions and conservative leanings. He also admits that, had this list been compiled a few years earlier, it would have leaned far more towards the liberal side than it does. I was also suprised that people expected this to be serious political discussion. The title should tip you off to the fact that this is more social commentary than anything. All in all, this is an entertaining book, and has some interesting points. It was fairly well researched I thought, and had some interesting takes on a lot of the starlets and celebrities that hollywood is so quick to praise. No, I don't agree with all of them (although I was delighted to see Paris Hilton's parents, Laurie David and Michael Moore in here) but it's still an interesting and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is so Bad","review":"The references in the book are so dated.

Mr. Goldberg lists both in his book, but there are more liberals listed because there are more liberals at fault!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And Bernard Goldberg should be at the top of the list","review":"This is the type of right wing, arch conservative garbage which is really screwing up the country. It seems that any one who is a lout and a blowhard can write a book and get it in the best seller's list.

With that, the premise of the book misses the relevant mark of today's happenings.However, if you are a reader who really gets upset with the mere mention of some of these Hollywood types, you would probably enjoy this book.

He just has a fake interview with Al that is a feeble attempt at humor, but it never even so much as hints at the real reason (if there is one) that Franken is in the book.2) He doesn't even bother with that much for his #1 (Michael Moore). It's just a picture of Moore, that's it. Don't get me wrong, I get the joke (#1...Michael Moore...'nough said), but come on! What a cop out.3) 100 people, 320 pages. There's very little substance here (and like I said none at all in the Franken or Moore sections).This guy is basically a joke. 3 stars for Amazon is really bad.BTW I hope some of you saw his appearance on Jon Stewart. It's the worst I've ever seen Stewart slam somebody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldberg doesn't get it!","review":"Goldberg has merely added fuel to the fire in our already divided country. We don't need more people to blam; we need more people to take responsibility for their actions and to embrace honesty over finger-pointing. Besides his obvious right-wing slant, Goldberg ignores the dilemna facing our country or, actually, encourages it. Blaming people like Bill Moyers and Robert Byrd for the problems that were preventable by all those left out of the book is childish and depraved. By the way, what did Barbara Streisand and Courtney Love ever do in power to harm America?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't Goldberg be Number 1?","review":"Is there anything a conservative won't do for a quick buck? There isn't one surprise in this book. It has all been said many, many times before by writers better than this one. By the way, aren't we all getting tired of reading about how screwed up America is? Personally, I kind of like it here. Goldberg and his conservative friends are worse than the French. Frankly, Bernie, if you think America is so screwed up, why don't you leave? Perhaps you and your America Is Going To Hell friends would be happier in...Afghanistan! After all, you would fit right in with the Taliban. They too think America is all screwed up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37)","review":"A typical neocon rant disguised as a book. I get turned way off whenever I read something that first attacks the personhood of others, and then engages in exactly the same logic-actions that it criticizes in others. Freud, who was not a liberal, refers to this process as projection.I might listen to the conservative point of view more often if they didn't preface everything they put out there by attacking and disrespecting anyone who disagrees with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Typical","review":"Generally speaking this is exactly what one would excpect from a partisan with limited insight to what makes America a great place.Any book of this type that lists only 100 \\"bad\\" people in a nation of hundreds of millions yet somehow finds room for inconsequentials like Barbara Streisand and Al Franken is obviously the work of a hack. Does anyone take the \\"funny girl\\" and a former SNL staffer that seriously?If we do, that maybe says something more about the sad state of politics in our country than 10,000 accusatory fingers pointed at entertainers ever could.Of course he attempts to dodge well-deserved criticism by claiming this is simply his opinion, but it doesn't change the fact that he misses the point and generally speaking just stokes the flames of blind partisan muckraking.America, after all, is what we make of it. And if the nation were to reflect what Goldberg makes of it we would be in a sad place indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37)","review":"This book is real common sense. I wish I could find a way to convince my left wing friends to read this book with an open mind.

Yes, I am a liberal. However, I'm one to listen to both sides of any story before forming an opinion, that's why I bought this book.First of all, Goldberg in my opinion didn't have an original thought of his own. All he did throughout the book was quote someone else. He's so anti liberal he ought to take a long look in the mirror and maybe he'd see why liberals are liberals.If he think that someone who think that not naming storms with the representative of black names is screwing up America well, he seriously has a problem. It's trival and petty and didn't warrant a place in the book. Sure,it was to poke fun but it's stupid and I believe that he has given the topic some serious thought or he wouldn't have written the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn something","review":"Ok - several names I didn't know until he explained and the lightbulb went off - Oh...I remember that guy. I actually learned something from this book. I also agree that everyone's list is going to be a little different, but I think he did a really great job of explaining his list. Interesting, enlightening, with humor. I've read three of his books, but I enjoyed this one the most. It's easy to read and you can stop and go as time permits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, funny and well written.","review":"This is the best page turner I have read in years.

This adolescent quibbling is getting old people. Stop it. You are better than this (I hope).As I read, I often said to myself \\"I can't believe intelligent adults get away with writing this fluff in hard cover.\\" My main complaint is, many of the people profiled are condemned for speaking out about what they believe and it's okay as long as they say what the author wants to hear. Freedom of speech simply does not work that way. Thank goodness.Want to do something good for America?

It does contain compound sentences."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually read the book!","review":"A \\"reviewer\\" who gave the book 1 star obviously did not read it. His review is nothing but left-wing blather that never even mentions anything in this book.

They are not all democrats or liberals as people like Michael Savage make the list.

I really, really liked reading names I had never heard about and the influence they are having on society. With much of this coming from higher education in the U.S. and how the college and unversity educators' philosophies are impacting the society of tomorrow; as they teach their ideas (not subjects). These influences affect the \\"American-rooted-cultural-belief\\" and the \\"principle fiber of the every-day-average-US-loving-American\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits the nails right on the head!","review":"I bought this book years ago when it first came out, mainly out of curiosity, and I must say I would recommend than anyone who dosen't want to see our country go down the toilet should read it. Contrary to what many people may think, it is not tasteless bashing of those in politics. Bernard Goldberg stands up and says what everyone else has been afraid to by blatantly calling out anyone whose behavior has contributed to the decaying morals and ethics of American society. The fact that Paris Hilton's parents are #1 on the list should tell you right away that he's on the money. Intelligent, well written, and laugh out loud funny, I can't say enough good things about this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slam-Bang Effort","review":"I agree with most of Goldberg's views on politics and culture.

He's a rude, cynical, self serving bastard. He told Linda Staci to shut up on live television because she asked him why didn't Rush Limbaugh make the list.At the same time a rolling stone writer pointed out that he ranks the \\"Unknown American Terrorist\\" someone who is trying to kill people, further down the list than someone as Howard Dean or Michael Moore.

At the head of the list was the old standby, Ad Hominen Abusive. When you can't refute your opponents argument with facts or logic, just smear the person making the argument. If you don't like universal health care, call it \\"socialized medicine\\" and the person who proposed the plan a \\"pinko\\", \\"fellow-traveler\\", \\"communist.\\" Considering middle america's aversion to homosexuals accuse the proposer of being a \\"closet queer\\". This book is one, long ad hominen abusive. About the only good thing I can say about it, is that if you tear out the pages, it will make good kindling when you're trying to start a fire in the fireplace.This review is by Arthur J.

It's just a good thing this book is about people today who are \\"screwing\\" up America, other wise if he did this though out all of Ameircan history Bernard Goldberg would of listed heroes such as Franklin Roosevelt, Benjamin Franklin, JFK, Theodore Roosevelt and so forth.

Isn't that giving him more credit than might be intended? So go read #37, Al Franken. It consists of an entirely fabricated, conversation between Goldberg and Franken on Franken's Air America Radio talk show.

The book reads like a gossip column book and one actually walks away from the book with the impression that Bernard Goldberg is the number one America Basher. His credibilty for me was really 'shot' when I saw that he included Bill Moyers ... and the way he underhandedly uses a third person to justify his inclusion of Moyers in his book.One other note, the other night (7/20/005), Goldberg was on a national talk show and actually screamed at one of the talk show quests to \\"SHUT UP\\". Actually, he told her to shut-up about five times because she was not agreeing with many of the premises and justfications for the Americans on the list.

Mr.Goldbergs' writing style is simple,straightforward and as subtle as a punch in the face.The book is therefore easy to understand by anyone,even ultra-leftists with closed minds. Mr.Goldberg uses an interesting approach in describing the 100 losers in his book and it is one that closed minded people detest,he uses facts.Each individual is discussed with facts and examples as to why they so deserved to be included in the top 100 list,with the exception of Courtney Love.

America is a land of many ideas and opinions and because the people on his list do not agree with Goldberg ,on issues, he villifies them by putting them on his hate list. He is simply bashing America and Americans who dont agree with him. The exact thing he accuses the people on his hit list of being guilty of.His writing style is an adolescent and socially immature style . The book seems much longer than it really is.

So much for his jacket photo.This book was all over the place, no coherence, just ranting. He did target a few token conservatives with his rapier wit (possibly to make the book seem more \\"fair and balanced\\").Don't waste your time with this one.

Hey, I don't like all that crap either, but jeez, enough already. And then here he goes blowing off about people whose names are barely recognizable. He unloads about like Ann Coulter and I was foolish enough to actually buy her book. I was a whole lot smarter this time and checked this one out at my local library. I noticed that some kid had taken an ink pen and scribbed all over some of the pages, and later I thought the kid had the right idea.

This is nothing more than more conservative whining and liberal bashing. More blaming the left for all of the troubles of this country caused by the administration in office for the last six years. If this is what passes for critical thinking in the news media no wonder they are worthless. The author does a miserable job of analysing his arguements and presents only the information he likes and ignores the rest.

So I guess that means that Cheney and Bush are big fans of Eminem and 50 Cent. As we all know these guys use the infamous \\"F\\" word (not to mention the \\"N\\" word), the only conclusion Mr. Goldberg can derive from that is their obsession with rap.Goldberg is just another Right Wing Ostrich that hides his head in the sand (or elsewhere dark and stinky) and ignores the complexity of the cultural horizon in this country. To focus solely on the left as the source of all that is wrong, is foolish. Sure, folks on the left make mistakes and get some things wrong. But that is equally true of folks on the right.

Goldberg is a former Democrat who has now decided to cash in on the current trend of hate-filled, right wing, info-tainment that has taken over our popular media.Goldberg's book has the same appeal as that of gangster rap, angry talk radio or sleazy daytime television.

While the title was provocative enough for me to give it a chance, it falls flat in most areas. It is certainly amusing at times, and Goldberg does a good job at pointing out the flaws in many very stupid people, but he seems to have a social fetish here and focuses only on people in the cultural elite, rather than personages who actually impact the daily lives of Americans. Most of the 100 in his selection just don't make much sense, even if the stories are amusing at times.

Goldberg is an angry and bitter man who had a humor by-pass operation somewhere along the way as was evidenced during his book promotion appearance with Jon Stewart on the Daily Show.

The writer seems to yearn for a return to the \\"good old days\\". The biggest problem that this reader encountered was the writer using a black /white situation as he went through his list.

This book made cheap attempts to incorporate \\"humor\\" to entertain the readers. However, these attempts failed to make me laugh. What laughable is the content and substance of this book and Goldberg's attempt to simulate what turns out to be nothing but a propanda for the Bush's house of corruption.It's also evident that Goldberg reflects the fear felt by a large number of the Far Rights.

Instead he just sites a slew of people (most Democrats) who are trying to tell the truth, and belittles them. The objective is to make you think these are \\"bad\\" people in some way.It's another sad day for America. Who loses? You the American people.

There were times during the election when I could not sit in my living room because of the bias which was masked as popular college programming on our television. In particular, the 'Get Out and Vote' MTV campaign, which smacked of the underlying pro-Kerry/democrat message, bothered me to the point that I stopped watching the station all together. I couldn't stand it that my television suddenly knew how to think better than I did. Thus, reading material like this was gratifying in that it wasn't trying to tell me what to believe. Instead Goldberg's message was delightfully frank. If the media wants to make a point in the future, perhaps it should try Goldberg's straight-forward approach. The 'ignorant 58%' who were, amazingly, wise to the media's election schemes might then be more willing to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Goldberg is right on with this list.","review":"Some may differ with whose on the list.

It would be naive to think that one party always makes the right desicion, yet the book is majority liberal.Michael Moore is number one. I only see him trying to hold acocountable the people in office who make poor descions. It's their desicions that are screwing up America, not his or any celebrities. I think it's time Americans focus on their politicans and not their celebrities.If America is getting any worse it is obviously do to the increasing competition for jobs and wealth. So many jobs are outsourced or taken over by illegal immigrants. People have to do things like steal, sell drugs, become prostitudes just to keep their head above water.

All you get is rightist propaganda of the worst kind with no effort of a balanced view of the big picture. This country is being driven into wars we do not want and do not need, driven into an energy dependence that will soon choke our economy and nothing is being done to counter it.

Is that really the point? Neither Rush nor Al Franken influences my opinions particularly, nor are they pushing laws through the state legislature or US Congress that are having a direct impact on my day-to-day life. They are simply commentators, or celebrities with opinions, like Barbra Streisand. Everybody on this list is very high profile, but only a small percentage could truly be considered people of importance --- people who truly do influence the direction this country takes. The top 100 people --- for better or worse --- are probably individuals of whom you have never heard or read a word.Goldberg could have probed into the deeper questions as to who moves & shakes the country, but he opted for the easier route of taking cheap shots at high-profile lightweights who don't share his political views.

If Mr. Goldberg wants to look at who's screwing up America he needs to take a cold, hard look in the mirror. Even a Conservative should be ashamed of this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooor-ing!","review":"This is just another right-wing screed intended to demonize people who A: Care more about the average worker than corporations ; B: Think the unnecessary war in Iraq has taken away invaluable resources from the war on terrorism and made us LESS safe; C: Think tax cuts for the wealthiest people in a time of war and record deficits is just WRONG; D: Think the conservative's culture of selfishness and greed has harmed our country; and so much more.

For a guy who has so closely guarded his bias throughout his work as an Emmy winner, he sure has stepped on his unit with this effort. It verifies the old journalistic ethic that those in the business should never let their biases be known. I cannot believe he actually wrote this. It is not that well written, a far cry from his broadcast work. He is not even handed or objective in his assessments. Even in a work as subjective as this, one should be fair in arriving at a conclusion and he has not done so here.This leads me to ask the obvious question: Does Bernie do the real work when he is on the telly or did someone ghost-write this piece of garbage?Sorry Bernie, stick to air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"What Goldberg means is that liberals are ruining America. This is the kind of childish rhetoric that goes on in the country. Watching Goldberg on tv complained how people are rude by uttering the f-bomb on the streets.

What can they do now to screw up America? Obviously, Bush & Cheney & Co. being absent from this book (as they are responsible for 99.9% of the screwed-upness of the country) makes this book nothing but a liberal bash and a big joke. Goldberg is more worried about Courtney Love than he is about the liars who used false pretenses to start a war (Bush and Cheney for you Republicans who can't figure it out yet).

If you are with the majority of americans who disagree with the way this country is headed (govt. taken over by the religious right) you will not enjoy this book.

It's completely asinine to place Jimmy Carter on the list. The explanation given as to why he's on the list is even more asinine. Goldberg states that Jimmy Carter is too \\"Friendly\\" with left-wing dictators. Well then, if he's going to use that standard he should have also included the elder George Bush and even Ronald Reagan. They after all did become a little too \\"Friendly\\" with right-wing dictators all over the world. Does Saddam Hussein in the 1980's ring a bell Bernie? Of course not. Conservatives develop selective amnesia when it comes to those facts! Bernard Goldberg is one of these conservatives who never cared for the facts to begin with.

He could have written a thoughtful book with a thesis and supportive argument that furthers an intelligent debate. Instead, he feeds more empty pap to the hungry conservatives by taking cheap shots that are either dead wrong (e.g., Jimmy Carter), unfair (e.g., Paul Krugman), or just pathetic (e.g., his one-word entry for Courtney Love as a \\"Ho.\\").

Didn't America learn in 1969 that he shouldn't be behind any kind of steering wheel?Yes, the elitist response to this book is name-calling. That remains the liberal response in the face of facts.

What's more is that even when its from the same author it's inconsistent. Such is the case with this book. The Falcon Guide: Hiking North Carolina (also written by Randy Johnson) is a good book, yet for this book the author has done a very poor job.The route descriptions are especially lacking in details. As are the trip difficulty scales, not to mention the author completely bypasses mentioning water sources. I don't have any recommendations on general hiking guides to virginia but if the appalchian trail is your cup of tea then look no further than Exploring the Appalachian Trail: The Virginias. That series of books is far more detailed than any of the falcon guides for the area.

In playing more melodic music the bow grip, a different bow with a slightlydifferent centre of balance, bow pressure variation, less angulation of the body ( ie in a more forward direction), and slightvariation in his left hand finger positioning would all lead to a more intimate performance of these melodic gems, in my view.Of course to alter any of these facets would require a lot of adaption, but I am certain that the performances would begreatly enhanced.I am a violinist too and like to analyse performances. Not all Strads suit a particular player too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of the Violin","review":"This album, as all of Joshua Bell's albums, is beautiful.

But it certainly kills my interest in the study of brand management. Instead of teaching in a straightforward and comprehensible manner, the authors did just the reverse - turning an interesting and relatively intuitive topic into something dry, complicated and unwieldy.

At 7 oclock you have a multifunction dial that can show a second time zone, month and year from last leap year, alarm time.At 3 oclock there is a second hand. There is a video on you tube of a commercial for this watch that shows this second hand moving in a semi sweeping movement fashion as it moves between the ticks that mark out each second but it doesn't move like that.The minute repeater sounds pretty good as it tries to mimic a mechanical chime, but I dont think there is any mistaking that the sound is electronic even to an untrained ear.I like the dual button clasp and the bracelet hasn't snagged any hairs off my arm yet.Overall I think the watch gives you a lot for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away!","review":"This is the most amazing meditative cd I have ever listened to!

There are also pronunciation and grammar pages as well as an introduction to Brazil as a country. Some topics crop up on different pages. In addition to a section for money (p 183-9), money matters also appear under hotel, tipping, shopping, etc. As a small criticism, the information on directions (one page at the end) could have been more detailed, but this is nevertheless a very useful book.

I've been to Ecuador many times for both bussiness and pleasure and let me tell you from experience the birds on that island are extremly rare, exotic, and most importantly beautyful. Full of colors and energy. I may self am a big bird lover. And being used to the dull everyday birds of New England, these birds are quite exciting.

As other's mentioned, it is very difficult to get the PC sync cable into the port. The post is too large, and you can feel that it is bending the guides in the cable. Because I am using this exclusively in the studio and can leave my cable plugged into this item, it's not a huge deal. At the same time, for such an expensive and \\"OEM\\" solution, it's inexcusable. If I felt like bothering with it, I would definitely send this back and look at cheaper versions that may work just as well without the design issues.I purchased it despite other's pointing out this flaw specifically because I was in a hurry to test my camera out with a strobe setup, and didn't want to have to deal with cheaper versions that didn't work electronically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it today!","review":"Strangely categorized by Amazon.

This book uses the strongest characters from the first novel to good advantage.One small negative that will not be apparent to the reader until reading the third Stone novel, \\"Autumn of The Gun\\" is Compton's weaving real historical figures into the novel. In this book, Compton does not distort history so the surfacing figures like Bill Hickok do not damage the storyline.If you choose to read \\"Autumn of The Gun\\", you need to consider that Compton's viewpoint (Which becomes Nathan Stone's viewpoint) about Wyatt Earp is not supported by historical fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but sparse","review":"\\"Crows\\" is a short collection of unorganized and disorganized anecdotes. There is little text on each page, and the book is short. Brief stories from myth and legend are interspersed with the text as two page inserts that irritatingly look like the rest of the text. Whenever these myths and legends are inserted, the reader is confused when the previous pages' text don't just continue on the next page.Crows are great, kindred spirits that have gotten an undeserved bad rap. This book, while entertaining, is mostly fluff and little substance. It is just the merest taste of the intelligence and personality of these birds. For learning about crows, ravens, and ourselves at a deeper level I recommend \\"Mind of the Raven\\" by Bernd Heinrich, \\"Bird Brains\\" by Candace Savage (same author), and \\"Caw of the Wild\\" by Barb Kirpluk (what a name for a bird enthusiast!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanting","review":"As an avid reader of nature and nonhunting outdoor books, I was severely disappointed with this book. I had previously read Ms Savage's book \\"Prairie, A Natural History\\" and was looking for the same scientific and somewhat scholarly approach. \\"Crows\\" was a very cursory. The author did not delve into any specific area such as intelligence, life cycle etc. She only touched on others research. There was no original information.

I read this book hoping that certain nagging mysteries would be solved, especially about Irving Berlin's compositional/creative processes. For who could but wonder how a musically \\"illiterate\\" man (he could neither read or write music, hadn't studied harmony, etc.) could create so many timeless masterpieces, so many miracles of musical invention? And who would better be able to answer these questions than the songwriters first born? Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the absence of any insights into these matters. Instead, Ms. Barrett deals with the mundane, the day-to-day stuff. We learn what it's like to be a rich seven year old in New York City instead of how \\"How Deep Is The Ocean?\\" came into the world. The book is about her, not about its title character, and that was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter, NOT Father","review":"I bought this book on Mark Styne's recommendation.

That is, it reads well. The book not only offers a much clearer perspective into the Matrix films, but also allows you to obtain a philosophers perspective, where you begin questioning everyday phenomenon, such as are ability to really have free-will, or free-choice. The chapters are concise and to the point, lacking the usual rambling one experiences with philosopher's. Overall, the book does a great job of retracing the crux ideas behind the matrix films, yet also proposes some new ways of looking at your very own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like A Splinter In Your Mind Review","review":"The book, Like a Splinter in Your Mind, is a great read for anyone who enjoys The Matrix trilogy and is interested in understanding additional backstory and clarifying a few of the confusing concepts found in the films. For example: why don't the machines just kill all the humans instead of plug them into the Matrix, what kind of philosophy Morpheus, the Oracle, Neo, and the Merovingian believe in, why Neo can do what he does, etc. The philosophy presented will embellish the reader's understanding of The Matrix trilogy, and lend relevance to the philosophy which exists in our every day lives.

It continuously slips (retracts in) on you in the heat of a very important confrontation or record-breaking event. The stylus itself is too thin. In order to hold it properly you have to press it into your fingers. This can cause some indents into the sides of your fingers-- not too pretty. If you happen to have a strong hand, like my friend or me, your retractable stylus will not stay retracted.

Yes, Aaker has some decent insights into brand management in his case studies -- hindsight is 20/20. Unfortunately, they're difficult to find, since his writing is extremely repetitive and verbose. One gets the impression he is more interested in communicating how intelligent he is, than actual information on brand equity.

Stolen Nazi millions should be an interesting subject, but this books takes all the life out of the subject. The cast of characters is large, and if you are not familiar with the inner workings of the Nazi regime, keeping them straight is difficult, and this book does not help. The stories are largely redundant, Nazi's steal money, and try to hide it at the end of the war. More often then not, it goes missing.

Laibach's reworking of The Angels is one of the few mixes that actually works, giving the song a middle eastern feel while keeping the integrity of the original.

The result, of course, is utter nonsense, but if you're a Christian looking to confirm what you already believe, I'm sure you'll find this book to be great. Otherwise, its a waste of time. Just to point out one little flaw you can read for yourself in the excerpt - she interviews someone who no longer considers themselves to be Wiccan.

The book is definitely written from a Christian point of view, and as such may turn off some readers. However, it is not preachy, nor does it bombard the reader with proof texts on why Wicca is wrong. Instead, Sanders focuses on some things missing from traditional Christian practice that are present in Wicca, and how that appeal leads many to adopt it.I was hoping for a more thorough examination of Wiccan beliefs, though I realize this was not the author's aims.

There is a cheaper Cullmann flash, the 20 AF-C, that does allow for tilt but unlike the 220EX it does not support high speed sync. The support of high speed sync is crucial for use of the flash for daylight fill. For me fill is the primary use of this flash.The small size is a big advantage over its larger cousins. It has adequate power for bounce flash of standard height ceilings though you will need a flash bracket and off shoe cord since the flash does not support tilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be better with the ability to bounce flash and more power","review":"This is a basic flash that makes all the decisions for you-it's auto only. However, the fixed flash head does not allow bounce flash which to me is a deal breaker.

It's too bad Canon feels this is a good entry level flash-Nikon has the very basic SB-400 for a similar price, but has bounce ability and is much more powerful than a built in speedlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Canon keep selling this subpar product?","review":"I ordered this flash as a replacement for a 420ex (that I was borrowing from a good colleague). The minute I opened I had the ominous feeling that it was going to be a disappointment. Indeed! The very first test shots were incredibly telling as to how lousy and shoddy this flash is. First, it does not swivel so you can kiss your hopes for bounce flash goodbye. Second, it's lacks punch and power. In many of the informal tests I performed, the built-in flash of my camera (and even that of a point-and-shoot I have lying around the studio) is more powerful!!!!!! I re-packed it and sent it back. Got a 430ex and am nothing but satisfied. In short, stay away from this flash! In this case you won't even get what you paid for--avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"the speed light is a very good flash. but it was not as powerful as i needed.

My new flash photos were superb. I brought out details 30 or more feet back.

It still has that early \\"PJ\\" sound, yet you could see where they would be going on the next couple albums. \\"Go\\", \\"Animal\\", and \\"Dissident\\" are big grunge rockers, while \\"Daughter\\" and \\"Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town\\" show their range. \\"Rearviewmirror\\" and \\"Indifference\\" are excellent as well.

THIS IS pearl jam. from the menacing opening notes of 'go' it is clear that pearl jam sought to refine and legitmize the genre they brought to the forefront.'grunge'? no.'dirt rock'? no.this is what rock should be -- guitars, drums, and vocals. this epic takes the listener through the entire gambit of emotions -- from the straight up rage of 'rearviewmirror', which is the best song here, the political rantings of 'blood', the introspection of 'elderly woman...' all the way to the almost triumphant 'dissident'.buy this record if you would like to hear the cd which all other rock records should be measured against."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I am often disappointed when I see an album filled with ratings of 5 stars, I don't think people seem to realize what that means. You gotta save the 5th star for those extra special, classic albums. This is an outstanding album, however (probably one of my top ten albums ever), even if I don't give it 5 stars. Why someone would insult Pearl Jam by comparing them to Godsmack is beyond me. Pearl Jam's talent far exceeds Godsmack. This is definitely a cd worth owning. Even though I feel every song on this cd is great, I could see how some people would not like some of the non-radio friendly songs like wma, blood, etc. All that rage filled into one album, and then a song like indifference thrown in there at the end!

They rocked, and , more importantly, they stood up for those less fortunate than middle America. Than I head the song 'Daughter' and I learned that Eddie didn't have sympathy for at least one disadvantaged group in America: The mentally handicapped. On that track he cruelly and heartlessly mocks the vocal affectations of those with mental disabilities, just to get a cheap laugh. I'll admit it, his impression is dead on: he totally sounds like a 'tard. But is it really appropriate to mock the mentally handicapped, particularly when one is involved in so many fashionable, liberal causes? Well, no. The time for fratboy humor is over, Mr. Vedder."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great pj album","review":"This album, in my opinion towers above the likes of Ten or Vitalogy...but it is hard to compare pearl jam albums. They are all great. Yield, Binaural, and Vs. are probably my fav's. I said that Binaural was my fav. Pj album in a review, but that's just because it's new to me. All Pearl Jam albums are beautiful in different ways. This one has some beautiful acoustic ballads in \\"Daughter\\" and \\"elderly woman....\\", and then supplies the listener with some groovy tunes in that of \\"dissident\\" and \\"rearviewmirror\\". I'm not sure if groovy is the best way to describe those songs...I guess kickass would be a better way. This is probably the most listener friendly album other than \\"ten\\".

It's more filler, which has four good songs, the rest being forgettable. \\"Rearviewmirror\\" happens to be my favorite of the tracks on this album, giving it the credit. \\"Daugher\\" is one of the other good songs, and these two were the only ones good enough for that extra star. But they did prove me that they could do better. My one-star is saved for No Code, despite a cool album cover.Back to Vs. this album is for hard-core PJ fans/grunge fans or people who like attention span music.

It also has some terrible acoustic tracks on this that I couldn't take.

This is the strongest album by them, the only this closer is the latest self titled album. It starts strong with 'go' and even in the middle of the album when they start to experiment with 'w.m.a' you're still totally sucked in. A lot of rock albums tend to have song after song that sounds the same but each song here has it's own feel, no two are similar at all. This album also has perhaps their best song ever 'rearviewmirror', raw emotion and loud guitars dominate this album and anyone who wants to know what the 90's grunge was all about has to check out this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cohesive and brilliant","review":"VS is definitely one of the greatest albums Pearl Jam ever did. The playing and writing are solid, and it's actually an improvement from the blockbuster Ten, another great album. It's also more emotional, courtesy of Vedder's lyrics/vocals an the music goes together brilliantly with the music. Songs like \\"Go,\\" \\"Daughter,\\" \\"WMA,\\" \\"Rearviewmirror,\\" and the closer \\"Indifference\\" exemplify this. Pearl Jam's heaviest songs (Blood and Leash)also are effective and great as well. Recommended for any Pearl Jam fan who hasn't picked this album up yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Ten was better","review":"This album is pretty good. I don't like it as much as I liked Ten, but there's some really awesome songson this one. \\"Go\\", \\"Animal\\" and \\"Daughter\\" are especially good. Mike McCready plays some awesome solos. He's great with a wah wah pedal. Stone keeps playing the original rythym riffs he's know for. Eddie always gives a great vocal performance. Pearl Jam is definitely my favorite grunge band. But overall, this album just didn't have the same effect on me that Ten did. That doesn't mean it's not worth buying though, I'm glad I have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAVE YOU HEARD...","review":"This CD has a bit more of a hard, testosterone edge on many of its songs, which is awesome.

From beginning to end you'll throw your head around and maybe other stuff too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember grunge?","review":"This is Pearl Jam's best album. There isn't a bad track on it. Every song is either a noisy rocker (Blood, Go, Leash), a passionate ballad (Elderly Woman, Daughter), or something fun and a little weird (Rats, WMA). It includes Rearviewmirror, which is probably the ultimate Pearl Jam song --- Eddie Vedder sings like a wounded animal, the band is locked together in the same groove, and the music just builds and builds until it almost breaks. If you don't own any albums by Pearl Jam, buy this one anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pearl jam album","review":"This has to be the number 1 best in the my pearl jam collection, and i have them all.

Great songs , But The Others Rock As Well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome CD","review":"This is just an amazing CD. It's great cause instead of being just hardcore grunge, it's a bit evolved. Don't get me wrong, I love the grunge, but it's good when bands take a chance and change. This cd has a lot of really good songs, but I do have to agree with the guy who said it earlier, I think songs like Go, Blood, and Rats were just fillers. I mean they're ok, but they're not as good as they could be. Animal was a rocker all the way through, Daughter and Elderly showed their more acoustical side, and W.M.A. was a cool change, I really liked the all the drumming and guitars, it's really good stuff. But, my favorite on the CD is by far Rearviewmirror. That's just an amazing song. I can't say any better cause I can't think of any other way to describe it. One more thing, it's pretty hard for a lot of bands to have a second album and have it be cool. But, they pulled it off nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another PJ masterpiece...","review":"Another great PJ CD. Vs. rocks hard and smooth! The interplay between Stone and Mike's guitar work, Jeff's basslines, Jack's drumming, and Eddie's vocals is absolutely amazing.

The closing track \\"Indifference\\" is absolutely beautiful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before the downfall","review":"This is still the good Pearl Jam, the band you can relate to, the album that has songs that stick in your head without having to be another 'Alive' or 'Jeremy' that made 'Ten' a success..lyrically a bit more politic, but at the same time a bit more uplifting and even humouristic concepts compared to 'Ten' which was serious all the way. More melodies also, and songs that are a bit more happy and joyful, and also more acoustic songs, which is great. 'Daughter' is an acoustic-driven song, and it was a big hit, a very good song simply...'Dissident' a very melodic riff and some overall nice singing...'Leash' is a great anthem youth song which is refreshing from PJ, and so is the bittersweet 'Glorified G' which talks about gun control with tongue-in-cheek lyrics, this is a song that wouldn't have fitted on 'Ten'...the rest is also good, like 'Animal' a pretty aggressive song that's one of the highlights on here...GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the most dedicated fans of the series.","review":"Fans who have read the entire series of Doctor WhoNew Adventures may find this book more rewarding,but for those who haven't followed the entire runwill find this book too convoluted with appearances of characters from the previous 49novels of the series.

God did they ever, the music was terrific, Warrel's voice was tremendous and the musicanship on stage was phenomenal, the tracks off Dreaming Neon Black were standouts. Warrel and the boys also interacted very well with the crowd whilst showing alot of respect to the crowd in appreciation of their support. Its a shame only a few hundred people showed up to support the band, im sure if alot more people would open their minds and give this album a try, and the other releases by Nevermore, Nevermore would harness all the respect and attention that the media and mainstream society give to much more mediocre and brainless bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown\\"","review":"This is far and away my favorite Nevermore release. Easily their darkest album, the mood throughout is one of crushing heaviness. The progressive conception of each and every song is excellently constructed and intelligently conceived. This is the one Nevermore release I can always rely on to give me a Progressive Metal fix. When looking over my own Nevermore catalog my eyes always linger upon this CD before any of the others because I know greatness lies within. Each and every song has a signature riff or devastating chorus even though they all constitute sections of a masterful concept album. Indeed, I dare any Progressive Metal fan to resist the fantastic lead guitar riff on the song \\"The Fault of the Flesh\\", the insistent pulse of \\"Beyond Within\\", or the darkly mesmerizing chorus of the title track. This album is all-around excellent. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Surprise, Excellent Album !!","review":"I'm not a Power Metal fan or a big fan of Extreme Metal with all clean vocals. So when I listened to this album I was amazed at how good it was and how it grabbed my attention right away. I would say that the music is a hybrid of Heavy and Thrash Metal. This is really a very depressing and dark form of music. I love it. The musicianship is great and there are so many tracks that stand out. The vocals grew on me very fast and now I enjoy the whole package. I must say that after listening to this album, I went out and listened to their next 2 albums and didn't care for them because they just aren't as good. I think Dreaming Neon Black is their best effort. This album also opened me up to Evergrey."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okay","review":"This is my second album to nevermore and I wasn't dissapointed, but Politics of Ectasy and Dead Heart in a Dead world are both better.

There are the same battering and broken chord guitar riffs, but much better vocals and stronger vocal fury from Warrel Dane, who had a little trouble on Politics. Songwriting is much stronger on this album, and this album really gets me going. Nevermore destroy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dark metal","review":"I have to say that I almost hated this album when I first listened to it. I mean, if you're at all depressed when you listen to this, make sure there aren't any razors handy. But, after listening to this a few times, I have to say that a lot of the tunes do stand out as moody, heavy pieces. The lead singer has a great voice and the music is good. A must have if you like metal, just make sure you don't get too depressed after listening to an hour of gloomy, gothic lyics..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it for the vocals","review":"This is a great metal concept album, but you probably already know that. What needs to be explained to metalheads that are curious about Nevermore is that this is definitely groove-oriented metal, as opposed to having a thrashing feel. The drums follow the grooves of the guitar, and they never get very fast, but they are technically superb.Warrel Dane conjures emotions of such a wide range with his vocal delivery. He has so many voices and inflections, and during the title track his performance is spine-tingling. It gets four stars because in my opinion, I like my metal a little more driving and less grooving. Get this album now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crushing, Pounding","review":"Nothing wimpy here. After one listen I see what all the fuss is about. Lots and lots of energy, good shredding, monster drums, good vocals. Lots of 32nd notes, lots of lower string riffs, tons of wattage on this album. There could be some more soloing but you don't even notice because the songs are solid and tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Look, I don't get what the hype about this album is. Nevermore can obviously play, as demonstrated by the first song on here. But why did they choose to have the whole album be a mid-paced, boring almost-concept album?I bought this album because \\"Deconstrution\\" was freaking awesome, but I was quickly disappointed when I discovered that it was probably the heaviest song on the album.Half the songs on here are so slow they're practically ballads, and \\"The Lotus Eaters\\" is one of the most irritating metal songs I've heard. I buy an album for great guitars and headbanging, not to listen to the most pathetic, whiny \\"Please God...\\" a guy can muster over and over again.Not the worst I've heard, but this really bores.

The portion on fitting and pattern alteration was informative but again a beginner might need more explanation. It's as if someone is reading from a book while you look at the pictures. And this might be due to the age of the video but some of the sewing techniques can be done in less time and trouble with the use of sewing tools, such as a button placement guide, found at your local sewing or craft store.

Steve has taken all of this into consideration and wrapped it into a succinct manual for self-improvement.Best of luck and thank you for a great resource. I wish I had started studying it sooner.I visited his website ... to obtain information for the friends that want to purchase this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I am an avid reader of many different types of books and this is without a doubt the best seires I hav ever read. Iris Johansen is one of the most talented writers I have had the pleasure of reading. She keeps you so enthralled in the story that you feel like your living it rather then just reading it. I'm not sure which was my favorite, they were all first rate. If I had to choose then it would be this one. If you have the opportuinity to read this book.....DO IT! You will never forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, I normally love Iris Johansen's work","review":"I normally love Iris Johansen's books...The series on Eve was excellent. I just couldn't make myself like this story. It didn't seem to match the description when I started reading it. Normally I will push through a book with a slow start or perhaps material that doesn't immediately appeal to me, but I just couldn't keep on reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completes the set","review":"I have (I think) the rest of the Wind Dancer series, but had not read this, the earliest.

It was a tradgedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I read the \\"Wind Dancer\\" after reading some of Iris Johansen's other books that mentioned the statue. Like all of her books, it is a fast read because you don't want to put it down. I'm not usually a fan of romance novels but hers have good plots. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to \\"get away from it all\\" and enjoys reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your're new to Johansen, this is a great story to start with!","review":"This was my first Johansen novel, and I promise it will not be my last. I wouldn't recommend it for reading in public, though, for it is filled with passionate scenes that will make the prudes blush! It is best embraced late at night before bed. It is a unique blend of history, mystery and romance. Johansen has a unique skill for developing characters with depth; they draw you in, and leave you feeling the story's end has come to soon.The plot surrounds a coveted statue, the \\"Wind Dancer\\", and the effects it has on those who have, and those who want it. The novel is short, but definitely worth it. You will not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite by any stretch","review":"What can I say....I couldn't get through this book.

As most people know, Wacoal bras usually sell for around $50.00. So finding a comfortable, well supporting bra for under $20.00 is really a big savings. And I honestly find this bra to be more comfortable than my Wacoal bras. So there you have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a landscape picture book","review":"While I was interested in seeing the presented works, I was disappointed that the landscaping drawings were mostly only a half page and had no detail information as to the plantings, etc. Basically it becomes a picture book to examine the presented landscapes, some of which I have seen repeated elsewhere. The overall size of the book is too small to get much value out of the photographs of the landscape that are presented. The plants seem to mostly exotic that would not be available to most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good disc to chill out to","review":"This is an excellent mix of different trip hop artists. Very jazzy, lots of good breaks, and really relaxing to listen to. This is what I pop in the player when I'm out driving on a lazy Sunday afternoon. My favorite track is 5, fat ol j. In the middle this song breaks down into a thick plodding bass line with good drum fills soon to come. The best part of the album I think. The beats are excellent, the mood is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"horse cast","review":"The horse legs seem to be thinner then the horse body so when casting is taken out of mold they break.

This is a must for anyone planning to hike the Pacific Crest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable","review":"This is a funny and enjoyable read with lots of facts and history. I loved that George kept meeting up with the same other long distance hikers throughout his trip, his nicknames for them (and himself!) and his relaxed and humble way of describing an incredibly physically demanding trek. Good for you George - you've inspired me! Buy this for a vacation read - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Any PCT Dreamer","review":"My favorite aspect of this book is how the reader sees America (and the PCT) through the eyes of a humorous New Zealander. George's writing is a pleasure to read. I especially enjoyed the passage where he describes exactly why he hiked the PCT. He had obviously done a lot of thinking over the many miles he walked and had come up with a beautiful way to express the exact reasons as to why he would walk 20+ miles a day for five months.The only aspect of the book I didn't like was that, towards the end, Spearing seems to be a bit tired of writing a book and resigns to simply listing the names of the wilderness areas he visits. This is in stark contrast to the excited, witty and funny tone taken earlier in the book.Regardless of this, I thoroughly enjoyed Spearing's book. If you are at all interested in hiking the PCT, I'm sure you will like his book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Take","review":"\\"Dances With Marmots\\" is essentially a diary of a New Zealander's hike on the Pacific Crest Trail, starting in Campo CA (on the Mexican border) and ending when he reached Canada.The nice thing about this book is even if you are not a hiker, the author being a New Zealander adds facets of interest to the book because he is new to hiking and new to the United States. His comments about Americans and their land are very amusing.I initially caught sight of this book online, where the first two chapters were published, and they mentioned Warner Springs, CA. I live near there, and had to laugh out loud at an incident he told of an encounter with a local at a little country bar, the Log Cabin. I bought the book at Amazon.Spearling's humor carried through in the book, I enjoyed it and passed it on to family members who enjoy hiking and a good story too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it works.","review":"We bought this phone retail, it worked for 1 year.

You truly feel the emotional and psychological turmoil that Mark, his wife, his children, family and friends felt.

The songs on the album have a very mellow flair with a nice mix on instrumentation.(some blips and blops, an organ or piano and a guitar) Her voice is the key instrument on this album.

It was always funny when they bleeped the 7 words, but if they did that to this DVD, all that you would hear is bleep, bleep, bleep.

If you like profanity...Go For It!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Last Performance -","review":"This performance is boring, even aggravating.

Carlin was much funnier previously, especially on TV and the Carson show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carlin's Swan Song","review":"George Carlin has done it again. A concert intended for laughs but ends up going much deeper. He easily attacks our beliefs and values, destroying them. Same wonderful Carlin, funny but thought provoking. Obviously much more than a comedian. He knows all the stuff we have had jammed down our throats by parents and religion and appropriately educates us all with simple logic. Who else could make one not believe in God or government? Makes a lot of sense to those willing to think and question why we are in this state. George Carlin, before his death, implored people to ask why they should believe in something with no proof. He will make you re-evaluate all that you believe in. A must see for eveyone out there. There is something that relates to us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy Critic","review":"Disappointed. Listening to a \\"few\\" of his skits on the radio is better than having to watch an entire performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"R.I.P George","review":"George was as raw as ever on what was his final HBO special. This was the funniest comedian ever. Yes, it maybe somewhat offensive to some but not as offensive as say \\"you're all deseased\\". It just seems ironic the George talked so much about death and the \\"so-called after life\\" and it was aired on HBO only 3 and a half months before his death.George was never afraid to tackle any subjects. He went where most people would not dare to go. Hopefully George is up there \\"smiling down on us\\", and getting a kick out of this current presidential election.George will be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I'm a George Carlin fan, but I have to say I was disappointed with this show. Instead of his usual sharp wit and cutting humor, this one just felt... bitter. I suppose maybe he was beginning to feel his own mortality, or maybe that razor-sharp mind was beginning to slip a bit. In any case, just felt like there was a lot of plain old meanness and contempt in this performance that overwhelmed the humor. Certainly it had its moments, but this will not stand out as one of Carlin's best performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I love this DVD. George at his best! George was thinking \\"outside the box\\" before the rest of us knew there was a box! Rest in peace George."},{"rating":"2","title":"God, I miss him","review":"Loving someone so much only makes you that much sadder when they're gone.Hilarious comedy as always. You can tell the age has set in, but who cares? He will always be funnier than any mainstream comedian on TV these days. Letterman, Leno, Kimmel, Dunham? Give me a break. Those guys SUCK.If George is up there, atleast we can take solace in that there are a lot of laughing angels as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"He was better than this","review":"I am definitely a George Carlin fan and have been for decades, but this performance is a sad end to a brilliant career. In fact, I think the last couple-few HBO specials he did showed that his performances were becoming much less the brilliantly astute observational comedy used as a tool to break down absurd social constructs and instead seemed to just feature him becoming plain mean and self-righteous. The expression \\"crotchety old man\\" comes to mind. I dearly love the bulk of his work and will miss his insightful voice, but it's sad to me that he ended on this note."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show is bad for ya!","review":"I love most George Carlin, but I turned this off halfway after buying a rental on amazon!

F-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I am a lifelong fan of Carlin's, going back to attending the infamous standup in Milwaukee in the 70's when he was arrested. This DVD was a big disappointment. It's a mean spirited harangue on kids and a second rate rehash of his opinions on religion and some politics, which he has already done, and much funnier. Rent it if you must, but don't waste money buying it. It gets a little better in the last 15 minutes, then it's over. Bah."},{"rating":"2","title":"May the Great One Rest in Argument","review":"We LOVE Carlin and I already bought the boxed set of all his other shows for my husband last xmas.

Thank you-"},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM NOT A FAN OF THIS PRODUCT!","review":"This flash was purchased to go with the T1-i by Canon thinking that this high quality flash would sync well with the Canon camera. Here is the major issue: The flash is weighted significantly ahead of the important engagement point of the camera to allow for proper syncing. This engagement is crucial because it ensures the ETTL mode is firing for digital instead of TTL for film. However, because of the design, even when the flash is screwed into the camera, I feel that the forward weighting of the flash is always wanting to slightly disengage this area (even when screwed in), not allowing for proper communication between camera and flash. The flash works occasionally and inconsistently. Frequent sendbacks to Canon! Who knows, maybe I just got a lemon. Do not recommend. Tech support tend to be nice people though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't fit directly to Canon 100mm 2.8 L","review":"Great product, BUT against as stated in product description, it won't fit directly to new Canon 100mm 2.8 L macro lens, and adapter from 58 to 67mm is required.I received both, Canon 100mm 2.8 L and this lens, just to see that spend US$38 more is require, and worst, need another week to start using those products.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon MR-14EX Macro Ring","review":"The only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5, is because of the price.

That is to say the musicians bring a wonderful energy and depth to the pieces. It's just that my favorite composer, Frederic, seems almost awkward in the creation of these sonatas, both piano and cello. Each has a kind of shallow quality not found in the composer's brilliant ballads, scherzos, short piano pieces and concerti. Still, his sonatas, remain far more substantial, in my mind, than the ponderous \\"sturm und drang\\" chamber music of Brahms and the \\"ride 'em cowboy, 19th Century Dvorak. However, chamber music remains magical in the canons of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Debussy, whose late and delicately magnificent chamber music seems almost too good for people."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BLOODFIST MOVIES WERE UNRELATED AFTER THIS; 2.5 STARS","review":"THIS TIME AROUND, JAKE RAE [DON ''THE DRAGON'' WILSON] GIVES UP HIS WORLD TITLE AFTER KILLING AN OPPONENT IN THE RING.

They compared this CD's version of Beethoven's 5th Symphony to the previous \\"gold standard\\" and it was clear how more energetic and probably true to Beethoven's vision of it this one is. I love listening to it. Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, or at least its opening, is arguably the best known classical music in the general public and a cliche, but like beautiful sunsets, none of that detracts from it's beauty, and it's popular for good reasons. The other composition, zeroPoints, is certainly unusual if not strange and may take some getting used to. It is not melodic but it does grow on one and is interesting. It's not what I listen to when I want to relax and just enjoy the beauty and energy of good music, but I do listen to it occasionally for musical interest. The CD was worth it for the Beethoven piece alone, zeroPoints is (to me) an interesting side dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"LI Mom","review":"Bought it for my cousin to keep her new engagement ring in and was very upset with the size.

You can read it in an hour. He reminds us that despite its failures and blunders, the church is still the main avenue God uses to nourish ourselves and each other. Just as no one has discovered another way to learn to walk except to do it and pick oneself up after falling, so the church body keeps on going. God seems to put up with us, and we should put up with each other. I guess it boils down to what someone told me as a teenager. \\"When you find the perfect church, don't join it.

His whole book flows and I couldn't help but finish it in one sitting - it drew me in and dragged me along. He takes stories and experiences in his life and draws truths out of them. He covers topics like dealing with difficult people, taking care of people in pain, why the church is important, what real diversity is, and the problems in the church. As a college student, I found this book extremely insightful and relevent and it answered several questions I have been wrestling with for years. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book many Fundies would love to hate","review":"In this work Yancey traces his Fundamentalist heritage from a conservative WASP church in Georgia, through a Bible-believing seminary in SC, to his ministry at a multicultural church in Chicago pastored by an ex-Bob Jones University grad. By applying the principle of grace in a thoroughgoing way, he shows up the discrepancies of faith and practice in many churches and colleges of the Bible Belt and brings to bear the lessons from Jesus' condescension and ministry.Unfortunately, Yancey quotes approvingly from Roman Catholic sources and shows a lack of discernment in that area. But overall, this book's a devastating critique of American Fundamentalism in the past several decades. It promises to be a powerful tool in the reformation of a movement that began well in the 1800s-early 1900s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yancey-lite","review":"A short book, but too long.

However, his bottom line perspective of worship being God has an audience watching worshippers seeking His presence in their hearts is not what God seeks at all. God seeks those who worship Him in spirit and in truth. Thus, where is God in worship? In our heart? What would He want with that sin-filled, darkened, old thing? What He wants is \\"chesed,\\" Hebrew word for \\"covenant faithfulness.\\" Our inability totally to do \\"chesed\\" caused God to do it for us, incarnate, sacramentally in Christ. Thus, where is God for us? In the Gospel preached in its purity and distributed in the sacraments distributed according to His Testament. Yancey is yet to discover this.

In todays culture, many think Church is just not necessary. Yancey takes a thoughtful look at why participation in Church is needed. He gives readers a biblical overview of the purpose of the Church in todays culture and why ordinary believers should be involved. This book will have you asking yourself \\"Do I need to change the way I'm involved in Church?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club Book","review":"I read it for my church book club and found it interesting and gave me great ideas of what I did NOT want my church to be like. It was an eye opener"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected, but somehow got the point across","review":"When I saw this title, I expected a slightly systematic book about the need to go to church despite its shortcomings. What I found though, was a series of seemingly random and not 'to-the-point' stories that somehow meshed together very well to accomplish the book's goal. I never had 'aha' moments as I read the book, but when I finished reading the last page I did indeed desire to 'bother' with the church again. Philip Yancey does a great job of expressing truths through well-told stories, and this did a whole lot more for me than a theological or doctrinal approach would have. Short book but really good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivery Nightmare","review":"I know this may have nothing to do with this television, but I thought it was important to give fair warning. I shopped around extensively for an LCD television - reviewing information on-line as well as multiple trips to electronic stores to look at the item myself. The problems I've had have come from the particular carrier who \\"delivered\\" my TV. They had my phone number printed incorrectly. They failed to return phone calls in a timely manner. I had a day scheduled with them over a week ago - waited home all day - and they didn't come. Then I had to wait for them to return my call to reschedule a delivery time this week. After waiting home AGAIN for this package, it arrived with an huge hole in the box - and a scratch right on the screen. I refused the package and canceled my order.

A boon for conservatives who would like to attribute the problem of at-risk black youth to cultural underpinnings, but a slap in the face to those who live with and try to work through the problem of inspiring and motivating black youth everyday. Read Marian Wright Edelman's The Measure of Our Success for an alternative (and ultimately, more measured) vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Thinking","review":"Too often McWhorter does what many blacks accuse whites of doing--he draws a conclusion from any negative encounter he has experienced with another black person and assumes it is the norm. Bad thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Be Required Reading","review":"My first thought half way through the book was: This should be required reading in every high school and college English/Sociology/Black Studies, you name it, course. McWhorter deserves universal accolades for a book that is a breath of intellectual fresh air. With the deftness and precision of a skilled salesman selling a mechanical kitchen tool, McWorter slices and dices each and every myth and argument used by many Black leaders to lay claim to perpetual victimhood for their people. The destruction of these myths and arguments is complete. His logic is impeccable. His scholarly approach to a subject that is frought with emotion is remarkable. (Well, he is a PhD Linguist after all.) But, his writing style is not pedantic in the least. He is a true academician, in love with the search for truth. I could go on and on in praise of this book, but I will end by saying: If you want the know the truth about the current racial climate in America, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen Harper: Perfect example of anti-intellectualism","review":"In reference to Ellen Harper's \\"review\\" (Sept. 19, see below) of John McWhorter's powerful indictment of victimology, separatism, and anti-intellectualism in current American Black culture, what better example of these self-defeating tendencies can there be than this long, incoherent, inept tirade against a book Ms. Harper admits in her first sentence SHE HASN'T READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Argued","review":"A work of pride but more important of clarity and real caring.

While McWhorter does vigorously use real-life situations to support his views, these situations are the extremes, the clips one can find on the evening news and not common for African American life even if they have come to represent that life by the popular media. He fails to base his opinions on the average African American's life and instead relies on generalizations about the entire black community taken from rap lyrics, political demonstrations, and gotcha newspaper headlines.Fun read for conservatives and those interested in researching the conservative view on race relations, but does little more than rehash old arguements with new extreme examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME ISSUES, ANOTHER PERPESCTIVE","review":"These issue have all been presented before, and I wish I hadn't spent my $15.00 bucks on it.

If he wants to motivate African-Americans to change, he has gone about it the wrong way.I was also repulsed by his not incorporating gender nuetral pronouns.

In order to push Black America forward, the real causes of poor performance in Black society must be clearly identified, which John McWhorter indeed does do. I've read web posts about John's book where people have said things like \\"I read the first xxx pages and threw it in the trash.\\" After reading John's book, I can only say that those people are typical of that part of Black America (and even White America) who only wish to continue looking at Black American society through the lens of Victimology. You really need to be able to remove yourself from what you've always believed to be \\"true\\" about Black America if you are going to get anything out of this book, and if you are really going to be able to help yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could I would give this book zero stars","review":"Many times when we have books such as this, people over -generalize and take too many things out of context. Before Mr. McWhorter wrote this, he should have done some research and did a couple more drafts of this. Continually he contradicts himself and he put his perspectives above others experience. If you are looking for an intellectual stimulation book this is not the one for you. The whole time reading it, I was making corrections to many of his assertions and I was becoming angry for when a student spoke of her experience with racism, he discredits it for it was not his experience. Basically since this book got publish, everyone should be able to write a book. He should stick with linguistics."},{"rating":"1","title":"confessions of a sell-out","review":"When I initially picked up this book, I had no idea that I would be reading a bunch of justifications for the treatment that African-Americans receive in this country. He even went as far as to justify the bombings of African-American churches by saying that white churches were burned over seven times that amount in a year. Bottom line, this guy is a sell-out who obviously had it easy growing up, and fails to realize that racism still plagues society. He knows nothing about the black community, is probably married to a white lady, and lives in the suburbs. Mr. McWhorter, I am very disappointed in this book and I know your ancestors are too.

I think it could have been written in half the length, resulting in a much more enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"not perfect, but still good points","review":"Losing the race is not a perfect book because McWhorter mainly deals with his own personal experiances. The book does not really deal with black society as a whole. However, McWhorter is still brave for writing this book because it does dare to question African-American academic acheivement. Losing the race is a good source to help understand race in this country but needs to be combined with other sources like america in black and white and end of racism."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on race I've read","review":"Losing the Race is excellent. The other reviewers said more about the book's content and such so I'll merely affirm what they say. While the book is of course conservative when compared to the majority of whining cowards who claim the title liberal, while I was reading it, I didn't think of it as much as conservative, but as MAKING SENSE. This book is logical, thorough, well-written, clear, and depressing when one thinks of the current situation.

I love that it's designed to be stored on the neck strap with the buttons toward the piece that's connected to the strap.

So simple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Not much to say here that hasn't been said. The RC1 does exactly what you think it does: triggers the shutter on my XT (and many other Canon cameras) remotely.Two simple controls: a three position switch (off, immediate, 2 second delay) and a trigger. Set your camera to timer mode, point this little guy at the infrared sensor on the front of the camera, and click. That simple. I use it to trigger long exposure macros, and it works perfectly. It's also great for group shots that I want to appear in (use the 2 second delay).Comes with a base that slides onto the camera strap, allowing it to be stored on the strap itself when not in use, then unclipped when you need it. I've had it for a year, left it on for months, and have yet to change the battery.The ONLY improvement I could think of is if the system were radio frequency so that you didn't need to point it at the camera - but since the cameras themselves aren't set up that way, I can't ding it a star.Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and reliable","review":"I have had this little guy for about 3 years.I love it.

A bit expensive (I guess one pays for the Canon Brand). I used to have the Opteka equivalent and found it less reliable.I really like the following points: solid build, nice design, the fact that it can be attached to the strap; the delay and immediate mode.I use it mostly for outdoor landscape photography and indoor studio portrait and no complaints. The only drawback is the fact that one needs to face the camera (OK from angle, but reduces the distance and definitely unusable from behind the camera, it is IR activated, not radio)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for remote or night shots","review":"This is a must if you intend on being in the picture or if you want to take pictures at night. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device that should satisfy most people's requirements!","review":"I've owned and used this product for several months now, and have found that it does everything that I need.The range works as advertised, and I also love that you can attach the clip holder to the camera's strap for easy, quick, and convenient access. The adjustable 0 second or 2 second delay is great, too!The only (very) slight issue that I have with it is that the remote has to be in front of the camera for it to work... which is great for self-portraits, but say you're taking a night shot on a tripod you'll have to do a reach-around (be careful not to get your hand/arm in the shot). That said, it's not enough of an issue for me not to give it 5 stars, or buy a remote switch instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!

Having it right there makes it incredibly convenient.Good for tripod work, though you have to reach around the front of the XTi because that's where the sensor is. The 2-second delay mode is great for long exposures, as it locks the lens up and eliminates that shake.I wish the buttons were a little bigger, to permit use with gloves. I also wish the instructions were a little easier to read. It's one sheet with 10 different languages in tiny print and are a little vague in spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remote","review":"I love this remote. I can take pictures of myself now.

It's so small and light that you won't even notice it when it's attached to your neck strap. Rather than using the RS-60E3 remote switch with a tiny 4ft. cord which can get tangled up, use this and have all the flexiblity in the world...well at least up to 16ft. You can use it like a standard shutter release or with a 2 second delay. But the main reason I purchased this remote was to use for bulb exposures--just push the button once to open the shutter and when you're done just push it again to close.

At just $20 you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great accessory","review":"It's a tiny gizmo that hides in your hand when you take a group photo or you just don't want to touch the camera because of vibrations or whatever reason.

It weighs just a couple of grams too.I luv it and wouldn't leave home without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, with a few caveats!","review":"This little remote is a good product and a must for self- and self-family protraiture. I found the shutter release options very handy. Very small and easy to carry around (in your shirt pocket if you wanted to). The caveats (and hence why four stars): you MUST be in front of the camera (or at least the remote). The small size though practical in some respects it also presents a problem since it's fairly easy to misplace. Trust me when you carry around $3-4K worth of equiment or when you're doing paid work, the least your mind is thinking about is this little remote. Thugh for the price it's OK to lose it, I suppose.

I like specially cause you don't have to press the shutter, so minimizes the chance of bad pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best investment I could have ever made!","review":"We are not professional photographers, but it is nice to get a family picture every now and again. Normally we wrangle all the kids and dog together, get them where we want them, and then run to the camera and run back into position to get ready for the flash. With this little goodie, I never have to move, so no one gets distracted, I just click click click, get a couple shots in, and then its over. VERY easy to use, just point and click right out of the package. Batteries are a little hard to find, I have looked at CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Home Depot, anywhere I thought that sold small batteries, but to no avail. The batteries did last a long time though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"The device works as advertised and does a good job.

If its slightly cold, I need to hold this thing in my hands before it gets warm and operates. If its been lying for some time, I need to press the button a lot of times before it starts responding again. And the range is too small. Barely 3-4 feet. I dont think this product is worth the money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice little remote- if it worked","review":"It's simple to use. I have a Canon Rebel T1i. You simply set your camera drive mode to \\"Self Timer/Remote Control\\", set the RC1 switch to on, and push the button to take your picture. Form factor is fine, comes with a little holder that allows you to keep the remote attached to your camera strap, bag, etc. (Which is good- it's small so could easily be lost/misplaced.)The problem: Mine doesn't work. Never did. Unfortunately, I didn't figure that out until after Amazon's return grace period. (I just didn't need it for a few weeks.) So I had to go to Canon for support. They had me test it to prove to them that it didn't work. Now I'm sending it off (I'm paying for shipping) to Canon to see if they can \\"service\\" it. Had I done something to it, I'd be fine with this. But since it never worked in the first place, I'm quite disappointed with the quality of the product, if not the quality control process at Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer. Not compatible with the XS","review":"When I ordered this, I made sure to research that it would be compatible with my camera - Digital Rebel XS. After all, the Amazon page says it is compatible with the Rebel line. However, after I received it, and looked in my handbook, the RC-1 is not compatible with the XS.So, before you order this, make sure that your camera model is compatible with this remote! I would have loved to use this remote, but I cannot. Don't make the same mistake that I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"non functioning","review":"Item did not work.

You can pictures of yourself from far away. You can also use it when you have the shutter speed really slow so not to shake the camera at all.The only downside is that you have to be on the right side of the camera so the lens doesn't block the sensor, but other than than I've never had a problem with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I purchased this!","review":"I've had this remote for two years and it's already stopped working. But hey, what can I expect from an electronic controller that's under $20.00.It did work but is not very versatile. Too many times I found myself in a picture with my hand exposed and the remote visible. Also, the range is terrible, about 12' with new batteries.I'm upgrading to a more expensive version, something I should have done from the beginning.

Except for one CRITICAL shortcoming. I'm a mountaineer and often take group shots outdoors. Sometimes the camera needs to be MORE than 16 feet from the group, because of rough terrain or desired angles. At that distance the remote would not work consistently, so I would have to walk closer to the camera to activate it. However, the remote / camera firmware replaces the 9-second countdown that the onboard camera timer has with only 2 seconds. Meaning that I have only 2 sconds to re-join the group. Forget it. I might as well just run from camera to group in 9 seconds.I think this product was designed by engineers who never use or field test their own products."},{"rating":"1","title":"wierd gadget","review":"Got this one with wierd looking cover?Made me feel uncomfortable from the very 1st moment.I took about a dozen pictures with this gadget.Worked pretty good.Few weeks later, tried to take pictures,didn't work, tried few times, took one picture &no more.Something is definately wrong with this product.The funny looking cover is world-class design,nobody seems feel uncomfortable, not mention anybodyquestion the rational.I guess i kept it with the slide switch on position,batteries may have drained out in few week of non-use.I have no idea. Don't even know where to replace batteries.If batteries are indeed the problem, thenthe wierd looking cover should protect it fromuser's innocent mistake of leaving switch on.I think i have to buy this product againsince i have to have remote control, this product is cheap,small.Buying it again is easier than replacing batteriessince i don't know where to get them & what price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea...","review":"...but it only seems to work if you are pretty much dead-on square to the camera. I was hoping for wider area coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Adv ertised","review":"My photography does not have much call for a wireless remote but this was too easy to pass up. It delivered as advertised and I am finding that I am using it in place of a wired remote for ultra close up and low light photagraphy when using a tripod. It is very small so it is easy to pack away anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wireless remote","review":"This remote does everything it was advertised to do. It has great range as long you are in front of the camera. For a 'behind the camera' remote, you should get the wired RS-60. This remote has a nice fast response time - making family portraits with the kids and the dogs and everyone trying to run away a little easier. Just turn it around in your palm, or crop out your hand and no body will notice you are using it. It is better than the RC-5 because you can choose the instant shot or the delay.Pros: works great - just as advertised.Cons: ...... still looking for one I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE TO USE DESPITE ITS LIMITATIONS!","review":"I like using this remote with my Canon XTi, but I always have to remember to switch the camera to timer mode and the lense to manual focus. I still think it is more convenient to use the wired remote because I have a preference to be behind the camera instead of dangling the wireless remote in front of or over the camera. However, the wireless remote is convenient because it is wireless and it is faster to access for those quick shots if you are constantly on the move without spending the additional time to unwrap the wired remote. I especially enjoy using the wireless remote for group shots with myself included instead of the camera's automated timer. Overall, I use both the Canon wireless RC-1 and the Canon wired 60E3 remotes. For some it might not be necessary to have both, but I like having the option to use either. It just depends on what the specific situation calls for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have bought is sooner","review":"Wish I bought this sooner. This is wonderful for taking photographs of yourself on trips. I had my camera for a long while, and have only rarly taken pictures of myself on my trips. I end up coming back with pictures of my wife, the scenery...but rarely myself. This remote changed it. The reason I dont give it 5 stars is that you need to be relatively close to the camera. Wish it worked from a greater distance. Also, it would have been nicer if it was radio-controlled rather than infra-red. In order for it to work, I have to stand on one side, in direct line of sight of the sensor. Not a big deal, but you have to take this into account when positioning yourself in a group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly but....","review":"The remote works perfectly as advertised, but it would be nice if the Rebel XT could pick up the signal when you aren't standing in front of the camera. In other words, this is great for pictures where you want to be in the shot, but it won't replace a corded clicker for taking tripod shots where keeping the camera perfectly still is a must. Yes, you could stick your hand in front of the camera and use the 2-second delay feature, however this won't work for action shots. Other than that, it's great to be able to take pictures of me and my fiance without having to ask someone to do it for us or having to rush into the picture with the self timer on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"I am glad I have this remote, but I wish it did a little more, like have a trigger type setup where I could open the shutter, and then push again to close. Other than that it is a great peice. I do a lot of night shooting at fire scenes, and using this with my tripod really helps cut down on the movement with the low light situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"wireless remote for canon slr camera","review":"A handy little gadget. Great for taking long exposures. Cut down on cameramovement. Recieved item in 3 days. It was just as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item if your in front of your camera","review":"Great little item. Clips to the Canon camera strap so there's less chance of losing it. I purchased this remote at the same time that I purchased my XTi/400D. I was familiar with this RC1 remote from previous use with my Rebel XT/350D.The RC1 remote has the same problem with the XTi of not being able to trigger the shutter from behind the camera. I'm not sure why the eye proximity sensor next to the XTi viewfinder isn't used for the remote IR also. I use the remote mainly just to ensure that I'm not in contact with the camera/tripod during the shutter release.Overall, this is still a very great item. For night shots, I secure my camera on the tripod, set up a decent shot through the viewfinder, and then stand to the side and use the remote for three or four shots (holding the remote near the front of the camera)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon RC1","review":"Works great. My only complaint is that you must have the remote in front of the camera to work because that is where the sensor is. I use the remote for long exposure night shots and don't really like sticking my hand in front of the camera to take a picture.Other than that the remote has worked flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and easy to use","review":"This controller is not only appropriately priced, but it adds a level of convenience back to my shooting that I once had and lost. I used to shoot with a Rebel XTi and the Digital Rebel series have infrared receivers for this controller. When I went to the 40D, I lost that (why Canon didn't have it in that camera is beyond me). Now that I'm shooting with a 5D Mark II, they brought back InfraRed support! yay!This controller is particularly useful in Bulb mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"you gotta get one of these do-dads","review":"We have shot SLR for many years. We had the cable releases, and all the odds and ends. My wife is the main shutter bug and is always setting the timer and scampering around to beat the shutter for family shots. We are always forgetting which bag the shutter release is in and when finally finding it, the moment is over.Now, all we do is unclip the remote from the camera strap, get in the picture and press the button. My wife looks more like she belonged in the picture, and less like she just hurdled over the kids to get there. The nature shots are more natural, and the low light condition wildlife shots the animals arent looking at us trying to figure out what we are playing with.This is one cool little gadget.We use it with a canon rebel Xsi."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have an XSi.... it is worth the money.","review":"This is a great remote. If you have ever found it annoying having to set a timer and then run to get in the picture, this can help you out immensely. Just a quick click of the button, 2 seconds later, *shutter sound.* It is especially useful when taking low light photos on a tripod. You don't get any shake from pushing the button, and you dont have to wait for the timed clicks either. If you think you can use it, you probably can. If you don't think you can use it, it is probably still worth the 20 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!! I love it!","review":"It's a simple item, but it's great for taking portraits or any time you need to put the camera on a tripod/keep it perfectly still.

I hate to use the word haunting because it may come off as a cliche, but I'm still amazed at how some of the tracks (Dracula - The Beginning, The Brides, Mina's Photo, Mina/Dracula, and The Storm) can still raise the hair on my neck.I'm not too crazy about the Annie Lennox song that closes both the soundtrack and the movie, but I could listen to \\"The Storm\\" over and over again and never get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate","review":"This is an exceptional soundtrack which really captures the atmosphere and style of the film. However, the reviewer who comments that Kilar has only a handful of soundtracks to his credit couldn't be more wrong.

Aside from the Polish composer Wojciech Kilar's unspellable name, the CD is, how should I word it? Pure terror. In fact, the first track makes me feel like one of those gothic nuts who pierce everything. This is only one of a few horror movie soundtracks that, when listened to alone, evokes the same discomfort and intimidation as the images in the movie. Two truely scary tracks are THE RING OF FIRE, which uses a repetitive DING DING, like THE MURDER from PYSCHO, along with the cackling of Dracula's wives as they eat a horse. What did bring the rating down was the unpleasent repetition many of the songs utilized. This especially in track one, where Dracula's defeat of the Turks is symbolized by a serious of crashing orchestrations that seem to go on forever. In all though, the chords hit just right, making for a very uncomfortable listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping","review":"Fast shipping, item delivered as promised, but with small crack in the case.

Queen Latifah has truly evolved and matured into a very well rounded entertainer and most of all.....singer / songtress. Who knew that a hip hop icon could turn it out like this? As quiet as it may have been kept, I always felt she had a voice just by listening to some short stint vocals on some of her other cds. Then there was the movie, Chicago...her vocals there really made me listen and take notice. This sistah ain't no joke with her jazzy, sexy self. I like this cd from start to finish. It is a very sophisticated version of mainly retro jazz with a little r&b flavor. I think that she may have grown out of todays version of hip hop music. And that's not to say that she's washed up as a rapper, because the girl can still flow . So for all of you that don't think that hip hop or rap musciains are true artist....Meet Queen Latifah. I look foward to seeing the Queen do more material like this"},{"rating":"2","title":"About time","review":"This album has me singing, dancing, humming and thoroughly enjoying this wonderful Diva....It's about time she put out such a great album and she certainly has showcased her talent with such a great selection of songs.I knew her years ago in Manhattan when she used to sing with a friend of mine and have been waiting for this album since then.I highly recommend this album no matter what your musical tastes are.... this one is too good to pass up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew the Queen was Into music but WOW!","review":"I could listen to this cd over and over again.

She deserves better than this blandly produced and arranged album. There is no grit, no ragged glory to the music. The artist front and center is wonderful.

Hearing her sing \\"California Dreamin\\" was just painful. Had she left the lyrics and the arrangments alone on each song, she would have hit a home run. (except for \\"Calif Dreamin\\"). Frank Sinatra used to adlib the lyrics in songs with great success. The Queen isn't Frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Dana *can* sing!!!","review":"Dana's vocals are the best part of this album.

I find that I choose the songs I am in the mood for and skip others, though....there are some really gutsy, bluesy songs and some smooth, romantic ones. I don't necessarily think they should be on the same disc. I would love to hear an all-blues CD from Latifah - she would do a great job, belting out some old blues tunes!! This is a great album overall, though, well worth the price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They call her Queen for a reason","review":"Beautiful voice, great songs - buy this cd! I love all kinds of music - mainly hard rock, but this is just so lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just short of amazing...","review":"I intially did not listen to too much of Queen Latifah when she rapped, just knew a few songs. For most of us our first glimpse of her voice was in Chicago. This album is great and the music is fabulous. Couple of songs didn't really do it for me, especially California Dreamin', should have left that one alone, not really the fault of her singing, just the way it was remade did not work. My favorite would have to be Lush Life. It's so beautiful, strangely similar style and tone to Natalie Cole's version (maybe those two should get together). Sometimes you forget it's Queen Latifah singing because it's just something you're not used to. Every now and then she slips a little of her attitude in there and you remember it's her and are again amazed. Hope she continues along this jazz path!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Dana Owens Latifah","review":"I love her anyway but I was so blown away by this album it almost brought me to tears. It was such a classy fit for this Soul Sistah. I handed it off to my co-worker and she took it home to listen to and came back to work this morning and told me she was buying it this afternoon. I hope she gives us more of this sultry sexy side of her. I can hardly wait. Some one asked me if they could burn a copy and I nearly ripped their head off. This is one CD that every one needs to purchase not copy. This is really a ten star effort.

A departure from the rap and hip hop we are used to from this artist, \\"The Dana Owens Album\\" is a surprisingly fresh collection of old standards done in a jazzy style that Miss Owens pulls off with grace and power. The vocal interpretations on this album are simply dazzling. In an age of cookie cutter pop stars and redundant hip hop artists, it is a relief to see an artist go out on a limb and give us something of substance and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"I knew this was a hit from the very first song. Queen Latifah does it all. Blues, Jazz and R&B. She shows her versatility in all areas. \\"California Dreamin\\" nice arrangement..\\"Hello Stranger\\" ditto.

Queen, keep it up...Thanks for so many great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Voice Matures","review":"Love to hear how Queen's voice and songs have matured over the years.

So what a bummer this new album is. The promise has not been delivered. Her vocals are forced and undistinguished - this album is not worthy of the talent she unleashed for Living Out Loud and Chicago. Let's get those musical directors back in the driver's seat if QL is going to attempt this music again...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprise and A welcomed album","review":"The first time I heard Queen Latifah sing standards was on the movie Laughing On the Outside and was blown away at the Rap Artist being able to sing standards so when The Dana Owens album came out, I had to buy it.....I play it all the time.

An album one can play from start to finish.I love artists that are able to redefine themselves, she is just that artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was driving and heard \\"California Dreaming\\" and it brought tears to my eyes.

Dan Owens aka Queen Latifah constantly amazes with her talent, beauty and charm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irksome lack of knowledge of the LYRICS","review":"I do like Queen Latifah as an actress. I do not like her as a so-called 'jazz singer'. Why not? Well, heck she didn't get the lyrics right SEVERAL times. Particularly in Lush Life. Gee, people, if you are gonna pretend you 'love jazz' then you should at least know the lyrics to the songs you attempt to sing. For those of us who are musicians and who have worked as session musicians, please don't insult us! It's very very very obvious Queen's 'voice' was extended, lifted, lowered and generally 'embellished'. Sure they all do it, but I expected something better from Queen. So I'm not buying the mp3s, but will go get more Diane Krall and Nina Simone and Etta James. Thanks but no thanks, Queenie. Stick to 'rap' or whatevah it is you DO do other than act. Or just stick to acting, you do that well, in a certain kind of role at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice voice gone bad.","review":"I have really tried to like this album. Really I did. However, the more I push myself to like it the more I find wrong with it. Don't get me wrong Ms. Owens has a great voice, I think she would do well with to cover musical theater not jazz. Also, the Hello Stranger song is great but boring. Ms. Owens offers nothing new on any of the jazz standards on the cd. The songs sound forced and there is no emotion at all to them. There is no range with her voice either, every song sounds the same.She actually butchered a few of the songs: (Lush Life and Baby Get Lost). I won't be too hard on her about Lush Life, it's a difficult song and most people butcher it (poor Billy Strayhorn). I think she should have taken the route of Ol Blue Eyes and left it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok&I Applaud Her Risk here","review":"say whatever you want about Queen Latifah but She is One of the Few acts from the 80's that truly can control Her Destiny.She made a Name for Herself as a Rapper. she had some Moments though Hit&Alot of Miss on the Album front. alot of People know Her more for Her Film Work which to me She does far better overall. now She is back as a Stylist with to much Polish. the Musicianship,arrangements&Production are cool,but Vocally She doesn't quite have it. if she had that It then Jill Scott would have to worry just from being a Stylist herself.I give Latifah dap for the Risk because this was a Gamble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Let the Real Singers Do It!!","review":"In my honest opinion, Queen Latifah should definitely leave singing to professionals: aka... someone who has years of study in jazz vocals or musical theatre. No direct attack on her personally, but I see no reason why her celebrity status should outweigh the vast talent that other unknown singers have over her when it comes to publishing a CD. I thought that she had a lot of soul in her singing, but she just doesn't compare to hardcore jazz/broadway style vocalists."},{"rating":"1","title":"dana owens should stick to what she does best","review":"I have a ton of respect for this woman. rapper, actor, vocalist, producer of music and TV, activist, funny, human - a role model...but I'm sorry, she really can't sing that well and I don't want to hear someone copying older tunes that can\\"t sing or bring somethin new to the table. . .This album diminishes her and this is a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Dana! Graceful, upbeat and strong--WOW!","review":"The moment I finished listening to this CD, my knee-jerk reaction was simple: MORE! Queen Latifah proves she is as comfortable performing classic songs as she is doing rap. Her fans knew her talents as a rap artist; it is no surprise that she can pull this switch into more classic tunes without a hitch. (After all, she sang wonderfully in the movie Chicago without a rap format.)Her voice is strong, sensuous, and just plain wonderful to listen to. Al Green also joins her in singing \\"Simply Beautiful,\\" a song Green himself wrote.The selected songs combine to form a very strong, unified set that is ecstasy to listen to the way you want to, maybe just relaxing or perhaps with a glass of fine wine. The quality of the music is excellent and the cover photo of Dana is beautiful. You don't get lyrics to the songs but the credits are there.In short, BUY THIS CD! You won't be sorry! GRIN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Price!","review":"I first heard the tracks to this CD off of RealPlayer's Free Listening Parties. Honestly, I didn't have any high expectations for it...after all Queen Latifah is known partly for her comedy and rap, right? However, after hearing it for the first time, I was taken aback! She can do everything...and well, too! You can hear the strength of her character - her voice is definitely full of soul. Even my roommate asked \\"this is Queen Latifah?! you're kiddng\\"...she thought it was another Diana Krall! There's a taste of swing, original covers, soul, light rock, etc. all you need to sit back and relax. After continously listening to the cd, I had to find out if it was out yet..and for how much.

Buy it and experience the royal treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"I've always liked Queen Latifah, but I've never been a rap fan. I loved her performance in Chicago and when I heard about this CD, thought I would try it. I think this CD is terrific. She's got a wonderful voice and the selection of songs is a bit electic, but enjoyable. I think this CD gives her an opportunity to show off her vocal talents despite what another reviewer said about hearing better karoke performances. But, you've got to like this style of music. I also enjoy Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook series. These songs are easy on the ears but have enough kick to get you moving a little to the beat.

Twenty years after this event, he decides to meet her again, but this time, he has to meet Keiko too, Otoko's lover, who wants to seek revenge against him for having treated Otoko so badly many years ago.This is a beautiful poetic story about passion and revenge and the complexity of human characters and relations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complex world of human relationships.","review":"Human relationships are anything but predictable. In 'Beauty and Sadness' Kawabata melds scenes of ardent love and revenge with subtle grace. He writes a story of love which is unpredictable and believable.

A woderful read for people interested in the complexity of the human relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to be moved with the tone in this novel...","review":"Sadness & Beauty is I believe the last work Kawabatta completed. In it, he creates a world where everything is found to filled either w/ beauty or sadness, and towards the end, it seems that nothing can be beautiful without being sad, and that all the sad things in the world take on a beauty of their own.

Ventrella gives short and easy to follow practical examples in a clearly bulleted format. It's easy to read and understand, and you can reference it quickly if necessary. Whatsmore, the advice he gives is effective and priceless. This book has been a great help to me and I highly recommend it to everyone, even those who are not in business per say.

Its like there is an elastic trying to close it while I am trying to find the right Cd amongst the flimsy little sleves that fall out of the case all the time. To top it all off they are individual, which means it is twice as hard to find the right cd. Can you imagine trying to find one cd in a messy stack of 72? The corners of the inside sleves are made of plastic that feels like it is sharp on the corners. The \\"Spiral\\" they are on doesnt do its job which is supposed to make it easy to flip through the sleves. When I try to flip one, it always pulls a few more with it. then pops back to where it was. This is a very frustrating Cd case. I would not recomend it. Go with Case Logic.

I don't expect Johnny and the boys to put out an album like Hold Me Up, Superstar Carwash, or even A Boy Named Goo, but it seems like they've lost their rocker souls and have settled for being banal adult contemporary (ac) musicians. Better Days lacks the passion, grit, and ingenuity of past songs like Name, Flattop, We are The Normal, Iris, and Two Days in February. Better Days sounds like the usual sappy drivel produced by ac musicians like Kelly Clarkson, Ryan Cabrera, and Howie Day.The Goos might be pushing 40 but they can rock harder and produce better music than this. Look at The Rolling Stones.

Julius, Lord Claredon and Victoria Mallory are too much the caricatures, the cardboard cutouts, to be anything much more than irritating. He is more interesting than her by a whisker. Her petulance is just too much. A nice juicy murder with her as victim? There is a good deal of charm in the author's writing, and her stories are often entertaining. Alas not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"fussy and silly","review":"Yet another married, virgin bride. It is just not believable that any noble would marry and have no plans to having an heir. Any regency gal who was raised in the Ton would know that is almost her primary role. Both Victoria and Claredon would know that any marriage not comsumated would not be binding or legal. I wait for the day when some smart regency writer will incorporate that certain truth into a much better story. Also - Victoria's constant anger towards Claredon was overdone. He did not know who she was when he went to her room; she was the one using a false name and he did marry her. She was the real problem. Again, regency authors try to make their chits feisty, like that is supposed to make them interesting or smart when all it does is make you want to cringe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"Yet another regency with a rake who is obsessed by a wife who is a shrew and vastly immature. There is no earthly reason why Lord Claredon, Julius, would find Victoria mallory attractive. Her personality fails on all accounts. Debbie Raleigh takes great pains to paint a vivid picture of all the attractive physical qualities of Julius. And also lets the reader in on why perhaps Victoria is such a managing female. But no rake of Julius's stamp would take Victoria barring him from the marriage bed. Pages of the story are devoted to Julius lusting after his wife, going crazy at the sway of her walk. How stupid. Again, her personality, her over the top poor treatment of him lends the reader to ask what in the world would he find attractive about her to begin with? She is not an incredible beauty, he notes. Just a silly ploy by the writer to keep her heroine a virgin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"I bought both the OXO Good Grips Toilet Plunger, and matching Toilet brush, partly because the reviews on Amazon were all good.

Overall great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly overrated.","review":"I'm dumbfounded by the blurbs and positive reviews. Some people can blame the translation, but that doesn't change the issue that the characters are poorly developed, unsympathetic, uninteresting and that the novel itself is constructed like an amateur outline. Minor characters appear and reappear inorganically solely to cause a problem that the leads then solve in ham-handed ways. Not remotely suspenseful or insightful. This is a remarkably simplistic view of an incredibly tumultuous and fascinating period in both Chinese and world history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I have read many children's books that were originally in Chinese, translated to English. I always thought it was funny the way the children end up with numbers for names in the stories. I was a bit surprised that this book used the same convention (Yile, Enle and Sanle = 1st Joy, 2nd Joy, 3rd Joy). At times I felt that I was reading a children's book and wonder how much of that is because of the translation or is this the Chinese convention for writing? It was often very simple and repetetive. Overall, though, once I finished it, I felt that it was a good story and gave me a little peak through the eyes of the average Xu on a time of political turmoil. Interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Access Sydney is an easy, accurate resource","review":"Access Sydney was one of three books I took to Sydney and proved to be the one I used most. The orientation section at the beginning was invaluable. Some of the side bars on food, the harbor and the Olympics were very helpful. The only down side to this book (as with others) is that some restaurants had closed or changed chefs, etc, and there were not enough mid-range hotels to choose from. The illustrations are well done, but some of the other graphics are not the best. Overall, very accurate entries and the break down of neighborhoods was a big help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not broad enough","review":"This book isn't bad for a reference if you have others, but don't study only from this reference.

Everything is so superficial and at times not very well explained. The example problems also do not contain a detailed step-by-step solution, which at times can be very frustrating. The book lacks dedication and hard work from the author and appeals more like a \\"get rich quick\\" scheme type of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not enough","review":"This is a REVIEW book; it does not cover all the topics in enough depth to educate someone who is not familiar with surveying. I agree with most of the other reviewers that state it will not adequately prepare you for the exam. I was most disappointed with the overall quality of the book. I found numerous minor errors and a few things that are just plain wrong. Likewise the companion \\"Practice Exam\\" is a joke. The questions are too easy and too many are focused on definitions and regulations, not calculations and problem solving.

When we last saw Roger he was about to battle three other robots, with the help of Big O and Dorothy, and season two gives us what we want. Not just a real battle between the robots, but also a battle for his mind. Flashbacks of memory he never knew he had, fighting old enemies and finding brand new ones, and clues to what had happened forty years ago. Batman, Noir and Gasaraki all mixed into one. Better strap in for the ride!I just hope Roger and Dorothy's relationship is developed more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job.","review":"This is a tribute to how books of this sort ought to be written.

Well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible w/ Vonage?","review":"Bought this 3Com router for SOHO-use with Verizon's FiOS Internet service. Among the devices on the LAN is a VOIP phone adapter that provides our Vonage phone service. Every morning at approximately the same time, the Vonage servers would send a packet stream that the 3Com router would misidentify as a SYN flood. The router's log showed the packet stream as a possible attack. Thereafter, the router would stop routing packets until it was restarted. Once restarted, it would function normally for approximately 24 hrs until the next packet stream arrived. This behavior was observed using the default settings on the router's firewall. I suspect a flaw in the router's firewall rules is responsible for the problem. Another (home brewed) router functions flawlessly in the same network environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This recording is fantastic, as all of Anner Bylsma's recordings are.The cadenzas are amazing.

Obviously it's great for long exposure shots to reduce shake, but it's also great because you can lock it on BULB or to take continuous shots at any shutter speed. I've had my Canon RS60 for about 5 years and it's still working. Originally got it for my Rebel 2000 and carried it over when I got my Rebel XSi. It's an absolute must have. I also have the Canon RC-6 wireless remote and I can say that it's really only designed for that one person who never makes into the group photo. In order to use the RC-6 you have to hit the infrared sensor from the front and it can only be synced with the camera with a shutter delay. That's why the RS60 is much better than the RC-6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Remote RS60E3","review":"package arrived 2 days early. remote worked pefectly. many thanks to the vendor. will definitely use them again ! i'm hoping to get into long exposure photography and the remote is my last piece of the puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable for long exposure","review":"Using photoshop, and being a big fan of bulb exposures the RS60 E3 is a must have accesory. You can use it just as you would the shutter button on the Digital rebel, as well as lock the shutter open, which is very good for painting with a small flashlight, etc.My only qualm with the switch is the shortness of the cord, but if you're trying to take a self portrait with the remote, then you need to get the Infrared remote. The two of those combined makes for a perfect pair of tools for any remote picture taking needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, convenient remote for a Canon SLR's","review":"This remote does exactly what I would expect. No issues whatsoever. If you need a simple wired remote then this would be a good choice. I have however purcahsed another 3rd party wired remote which allows me to do Time Lapse photography and other creative photography as well as just as a simple remote so I use the other one much more frequently. It is a bit bulkier though due to the features but also much cheaper than the original Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Just what I needed.

I do a great deal of macro photography and having a remote such as this comes in very handy. I have tried the wireless remotes with less than desirable results but this switch has never let me down. I use it with my Canon EOS camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little remote control for the Powershot G10","review":"The more I use my Powershot G10 on tripods or try to do long exposures, the more I realize that when my finger presses down on the shutter, it slightly vibrates the camera and I get a slightly blurry exposure. Well, after untold numbers of photos and me scratching my head like an idiot, I decided to get a remote switch.The remote switch works fine as advertised for the Powershot G10 and works on the Rebel series digital SLRs as well (XT, XTi, etc). And this being a Canon accessory, you'd better believe you pay more than you should for the Canon brand. The cord isn't that long, but can easily be extended with a trip to Radio Shack and for $10 (Google \\"rs60-e3 extension\\".)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to my gear","review":"I have been using it for almost a month now and it's been a great help to me when taking night photos. I only wish it can do more.It's compatible with Canon EOS Rebel XTi,XSi,XS, and the latest Rebel T1i, also compatible with EOS Rebel G, EOS Elan II, EOS Elan IIe, and EOS IX. Great price. Thanks to Amazon and Adorama. If you'll ask if I will recommend this, Yes I will recommend this.You can see some of the photos I've taken at http://www.dailytechlog.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave the camera alone!","review":"I had the wireless remote, but I had to get my hand in front of the camera so the IR connects the IR receiver in the camera, and gives the camera the command to release the shutter... (NOT Convenient)... but with this, I was freed to take shots from any place, and not shaking the camera when it was on the tripod.TIP: there is an option in the Canon 350D (A.K.A. Rebel X) that locks the shutter once you click the first time, so when you click again to take the shot, there will be ZERO shake (Because the Shutter does shake the camera when you take a macro shot)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remote!","review":"Besides that the cable is somewhat short, this remote works extremely well.

However after using the notch in the side to retain the cable, the cable fell appart. The notch tore the sheath of the wires and they are now exposed.

I would have liked more heavy duty construction, and the contacts to have more definite tactile feedback for the focus vs shoot position, but it works just fine, and it lets me take pictures while talking more easily to the subject, in addition to the obvious vibration reduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remote helps overcome the shakes","review":"If you use a Canon 20D, this little item is worth its weight in gold. It plugs into the camera, and provides a way to fire the shutter remotely. In the old days, a big air bulb was used by photographers with their big view cameras. Today, a little electronic thing like this helps me avoid the shakes (and blurs) because you're not pushing anything ON the camera to move or shake the camera. Just a slight squeez of the fingers and your image is captured. These little guys are available for most quality cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Accessory","review":"I bought this and a tripod for my Canon Digital Rebel. Both are must haves to experiment with depth of field and the \\"wait for it\\" shot. Very simple to use and hook up to camera. However, don't be confused. This is not the family portrait accessory. I would have given it 5 stars if the cord had been a little bit longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wired remote does not fit a Canon 7D!!!!","review":"Although Amazon has this listed as fitting a Canon 7D, it does not. It has a plug end like a headset, where as the plug that fits the 7D needs to be the pin type. I usually read the reviews on a product but didn't in this case other wise, I wouldn't have purchased this remote and would have looked else where. Since I waited to try the remote, I missed the return window and so am stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but a little overpriced","review":"This is a great switch I use on my Canon SLR. I use it primarily for night shots and anything else that requires a slow shutter speed. My only complaint is that I feel its a tad too expensive. An item like this should cost [less]."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job","review":"When I opened the box, I realized how small the remote control is. I guess good things do come in small packages. =)I tested this accessory and it works as advertised -- half shutter, full shutter, shutter lock, and winding the cord for storage. I haven't been it for any serious work within these first few days of having it. While the remote is kind of expensive for its function, it's quite inexpensive compared to other DSLR accessories -- particularly lenses. =PI anticipate to use this for bulb mode shooting, e.g. to shoot fireworks. I also anticipate to use this to help portrait subjects relax, as suggested by another reviewer.I'd like to also note that theOpteka remoteis just a few dollars cheaper than the Canon cord, but I decided to get this one because I like the Canon brand, and this one looks much nicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!","review":"For just a minor piece of equipment, it works just as expected. There really isn't anything that you can say about a basic switch.But.. hey.. it fulfills the job for which it was intended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed Accessory","review":"I use mine all the time for macro and longer exposure.

Wrapped a rubber band around the housing and it's still going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon RS60 Remote Switch","review":"This is the most helpful thing for photographers and a must have. If you have this and a tripod, then you are set for all long exposures. One great thing is how easy it is to use. I didn't read any of the directions and I was able to figure it out. This will help you with exposures from one second to a day long. I really recommend this.

Much better than those that are remote, wich can be used just in front of our cameras so we always will appear in that picture and the wire is long enough.The release button can be locked while shooting, so it can be used for taking very long exposure pictures, like for shooting at the stars. It was delivered perfectly on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your pictures are shaking then use this !","review":"If you take night picture or close up then mount the cannon camera on a tripod and attach this remote in the slot provided and you would get nice pictures without any shaking or blurr!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great buy, product works really well.

I've had it for 3 years now and it still functions as well as it did when I first got it. It has taken a 30 mile trip hanging out of my car (and consequently dragging against the pavement) and some how survived. There is room for improvement: a longer cable and a better wrapping mechanism would be greatly welcome. Overall, this cable release is well built and holds up very well.Note: if you are doing long exposures, make sure you use your camera's mirror lockup to minimize the vibrations caused by the mirror flipping up and invest in a sturdy tripod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for occassional use, breaks under heavy use :-(","review":"I take a lot of pictures that requires the camera to be mounted on a tripod. Using this remote shutter release seemed like the obvious choice. However after receiving the switch, I noticed the switch mechanism seemed a bit cheap. Well, I was right. After a few months of daily use, the switch quit working. Even before it quit, the switch started acting finicky and wouldn't take the shot right away. I still needed to take photos so I bought a second one. Just like the first, it stopped working in a few months too, ARRGHHHH!!! After the second one failed, I bought the wireless remote control RC1. I wish I bought that the first time. It works so much better and without any wires to get in the way. The only downside is you can't take a photo from behind the camera with the wireless. I guess you can't have everything. I strongly recommend you skip buying this poorly made switch on buy the wireless switch instead. You will be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT FOR Canon EOS 7D, 5D Mark II, Mark III","review":"This item works with the Entry level DSLR cameras like Canon Rebel T2i, XT, XTi, XSi, XS, T1i, EOS 550D/1000D/450D/400D/350D/300D but not all EOS cameras.The product is not for all EOS family of cameras - as mentioned in the description.
