I recently decided to upgrade even though the old one still works as new. Thank goodness I did not throw the old one away as the new unit fails miserably in comparison. To begin with, the old clock has two alarms, not just one. Next, the earlier model allows you to select what is projected. I prefer to have only the time displayed but the new model can only alternate between time and temperature - quite aggravating. Finally, the old version allows you to preset the snooze time from zero to 55 minutes. I do not use the snooze feature so I set the time to zero and simply tap the snooze button once to turn the alarm off until the same time tomorrow. Like I said, I continue to use the original clock and put the new one in the guest bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking for a replacement clock as the projection on my original alarm clock with projection died. This La Crosse is not near as good. Unfortunately, I could not find one like my original one. The temperature doesn't do me much good as it is always off by several degrees plus it is aggravating waiting to see the time when it is showing temperature. The clock does not set itself like it advertising and it is quite frustrating setting it. You definitely have to read the directions to figure it out! I am now using two alarm clocks as I like my old one as I can also see the time on it regularly day or night very easily where the projection is the only decent way to see the time on this clock. The actual clock display is horrible during the day and only possible at night, if you press the button on top. It also has no stability and falls over with the slightest bump."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, horrible execution","review":"Love the concept of this projection clock/outside temperature. however, every couple months or so it decides to readjust the time 4 hours??? I have it set up correctly and for months it will go along nicely. Then randomly it jumps the hours just to f@*& with me. I'll wake up at 2AM and it's telling me it's 6AM, not funny! This has happened twice in approximately 4 months. The unit is pretty cheap and flimsy, you get what you pay for. But if this is your primary alarm clock, don't trust it!

Lastly, do yourself a favor and download the users manual from the La Crosse website.

I ended up taking the whole thing apart and cut off the front part that guards their nails. It works now, but defeats the whole point of the safe guard.

Examining a diverse set of cases such as CFC production, offshore finance, infant formula, dolphin-tuna debates, etc., Murphy is able to weave an argument that predicts international political outcomes by attacking cases that vary.

A great story about one of the great movies that's also the story of Hollywood in microcosm. It's packed with larger-than-life characters like Bette Davis, George Sanders, Darryl Zanuck, and of course Marilyn Monroe, and plenty of lesser-known but no less fascinating figures, like Elizabeth Bergner, the real-life Margo Channing upon whom the original story was based. It's also an intriguing mystery (was there a real Eve and who was she?)with an intriguing, satisfying wrapup--and with an ironic twist at the end. And the author tells his story in a unique, dramatic way, in the form of a novel, and weaves actual quotes in a way that you'll find hard to believe--but they're all documented. Amazing. All in all, one of the best and most enjoyable Hollywood books I've ever read.

It's purely shocking how every single part could have gone to several others, fascinating and sometimes sad to read how these great actors interacted with each other. Staggs also includes discussion of the short story on which the film was based, and discussion of the reality on which that story was based. I enjoyed knowing that all the more since I wasn't really familiar with Broadway Theater of the time or its great stars. We also learn that there was a sequel short story More About Eve. My only disappointment with All About All About Eve was that the author didn't see fit to include the short story, or its follow-up in the book, nor even to explain why he didn't. That would have been very interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much about Eve","review":"I had high expectations for this book. I love the move \\"All About Eve\\" and bought the book with the idea that it would have a lot of interesting background on the development of the movie, interaction between the actors, and an analysis of the movie's long appeal. While the book covered these topics, it wasn't with the depth or gravity that I had hoped for. There was a drawn-out \\"sub-plot\\" about the \\"real\\" Eve, which seemed superfilious and inconclusive. Those looking for a serious book about a good film won't find it here"},{"rating":"2","title":"Title Sums It All Up","review":"Sam Staggs does indeed cover All About \\"All About Eve\\". This is book is directly aimed at only those fans who cannot get enough and will seem too much for the casual fans (if such creatures exist) of the movie All About Eve. In other words, much of this book seems aimed at gay men who wallow in the high artistic camp of what All About Eve has become. In this respect, it is quite a thorough joy, as the history of the true story behind the movie is presented, the original short story, and then into the heart of the book, the filming of the movie (Celeste Holm comes in for perhaps too hard a time because of the author's personal feelings towards her and her attitude toward his book. Her actual celluloid performance was perfect.) The remainder of the book follows the growing legend of the film and the creation of the musical, Applause, based on it. It is a breezy, fun read without a single bumpy night in sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MISSED OPPORTUNITY","review":"The opportunity to write a behind the scenes account of the making of one of the best films of all times has been missed by Sam Skaggs. While he has done a good amount of research, he has not been at all discerning in writing about what he has discovered. Nor has he availed himself of a good editor or a good copyeditor. The result is a repetitive mess of mixed metaphors and labored prose with little insight into the creative process of movie making. Finally, his search for meaning in even the most inconsequential details of Mankiewicz' screenplay and direction borders on ridiculous. Though Skaggs is acquainted with Freud (there's a chapter called, \\"Tell That To Dr. Freud Along With The Rest of It\\") he clearly has never learned that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much all about eve","review":"Padded,repetitious-would make a great magazine article but too not enough material for a book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck","review":"The lit-crit deconstructionist approach.

You might naively think that Eve (Anne Baxter) is interested in Bill because she makes a pass at him, but no ...Staggs has seen the movie too often, projected too many fantasies into it, subordinated the movie to an agenda. There is some interesting gossip, and a nice summary of the fates of the players. Noe of this makes up for Stagg's stretched and contorted logic or his slack prose.If you want to see the inside of the way a great movie is made read the book about the making of Psycho instead, or Memo From David O Selznick.

The player action and coverage is superb, as the left winger can reach behind the opposition net, and the goalies can swivel and actually shoot the puck! My number one challenge is to score a goal by my goalie. The ice surface is actually a thin sheet of teflon so the puck moves really easily which makes for a fast game. There is no need to use a marble (ie an allie) or a wooden puck with a ball bearing implanted on the bottom. The game is rugged and stands up well as verified by the pounding it has taken from two sixty year old former teenagers!I very highly recommend this STIGA game.

The configuration enables players to skate behind the net. The layout doesn't permit as much scoring as other table hockey games, do, though, so games are not wild and crazy enough. The teams are made solidly -- strong three-dimensional players with colorful jerseys. Unfortunately, the playing surface is paper rather than plastic. This surface is flimsy and curls up by the corners of the rink. The goal retrieval mechanism works but is made of light plastic and will probably wear out quickly. Thus overall this game is great to have for hours of fun, but it probably won't be as durable as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hockey Fun!","review":"I ordered the Stiga hockey table as a surprise Christmas gift for my 2 sons, ages 15 and 23.

Like his later film To Be or Not to Be, Brooks mutes the comedy a bit and reveals an emotional side to the story. It's a welcome change of pace from films Brooks made in between these two which relied a lot on slapstick and sexual humor. In fact, it's okay for kids to watch, as there is no swearing, nudity, violence or sexual situations (which shows you what a filmmaker can do without going for the cheap laughs). All of the actors are wonderful, especially Dom Deluise, who is flat-out funny as the priest gone crazy with greed.

The humor bounced between understated to the point of boredom, mild satire, and slapstick which frequently stumbled past funny to merely manic.On the plus side, Dom Delouise produced some good laughs as the greedy priest.

You can not base an accurate study of the Hmong Culture based on interviews with Hmong peers and students. Though I do find the quote of other authors pretty well worded. Although the Hmong did fight the Han-Chinese to reclaim their land, they never succeeded. Many Hmong philosophers were killed and written history were burned and destroyed by the Han- Chinese.

There was no order to the book she seemed to flop all over the place, there were sentences that made no sense, sentence fragments, numerous points of repetativeness and questioning of the readers ex.

I bought this CD, assuming that it would be as funny as his other works. But it isn't. There are certainly places in the CD where he made me smile or laugh a little, but there is no section that causes me to lose it, laughing-wise. It seems rather strident, as if he is trying too hard. A great comedian makes you laugh and laugh over. Rodriguez' trying too hard to be funny makes me feel uncomfortable, to the point where I don't care to listen to it again.If you are Mexican-American, as I am, or if you just want to lose it and laugh until you're crying, try the CD's by George Lopez, \\"Team Leader\\" or \\"Right Now, Right Now.\\" I have listened to them over and over, and they're just as funny as the 1st time I heard them!

Not a chance. I skipped the first 40 pages to get to the present of the ensuing relationship. When a historical novel starts when both the heroine and hero are small children the story seems to add to much and not enough. Ms. Riley does have a gift for writing but historicals are not her forte. The love scenes were not vivid and the the language made you want to gag, way to syrupy.

None of my friends/family can watch foreign films, its to bothersome for them to read subtitles. I try time and again to get them to watch just 1 italian film, and that film is this one. I'm reviewing this film because I collect film with Monica Bellucci in them. While her role in this film is that of the mistress and the 3rd female role, the daughter is the 2nd female lead. Monica's part is frequent. But in the end this film is not about her, its about the family, and a great job all the actors/actress do of being this family in Roma.

Okay, very little. If I was trying to write the next _Ethan Frome_, then this book would be perfect. Instead I write sci-fi and fantasy. I was looking for tips to improve my description of things; this book recommends describing different things. Too much emphasis on metaphor (which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious).

Easily seen from all over the 100 x 70' room. We just took it out of the box & hung it on the wall. It did the rest by setting itself & changing from daylight to standard time. To date, it is stilling running fine. The clock was inexpensive and arrived very quickly. I DO RECCOMEND this oversize clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"I have 3 of these clocks distribted around my house. Like other reviewers here, the second hand in one of them freezes up. I take out the battery, it starts up just fine then runs normally for a day or two, then freezes up all over again. So you take your chances with this item, get a good one and you are all set. Get a bad one and you're faced with the issue of packing up a 16\\" clock, getting it to a P.O. and then shelling out some hard earned cash, to keep your fingers La Crosse(d) to get it either fixed properly or receiving a new one which doesn't have this same d****d problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's big- a big piece of junk","review":"I've owned this clock for 2 months. It randomly resets itself to 4 PM, 8 PM or 16 minutes slow at completely random times. As far as I can tell I can't even ~manually~ set it and leave it alone- it takes over and resets itself. It's a nice looking clock- but seriously- what good a is a completely unpredictable clock- even one that doesn't run predictably slow or fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product quality, even wolrse customer service","review":"The product never worked properly.

Poor quality, worse customer service. Avoid this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for a while","review":"I own two of these clocks purchased elsewhere and both of them have second hands that stopped working. Taking the battery out is supposed to start the second hand again, but it just advances 20 seconds and freezes again.

A very poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality - 2 different units shipped with the exact same flaw","review":"Hate to be the bearer of bad news: and before you ask, yes I did contact the company before I sent the 2nd (replacement for the first defective unit) back. When a clock reads Noon, both hands should be pointing at the 12 mark. Both of these clocks exhibited the same problem; when the hour hand is on the 12 mark, the minute hand trails 23 minutes behind (the other clock was 21 minutes). This is after meticulously following the setup instructions, as well as troubleshooting and attempting alternate methods to set the time. I had previously purchased the 20\\" clock, and it was fine, although the first one shipped with a hand having fallen off and some random bar of metal inside the face. So I would caution people considering this clock about the build quality. 3 of 4 clocks I tried had serious flaws (2 for the 16\\" and 1 for the 20\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"clock","review":"The last La Crosse atomic clock that I had was wonderful and I had it for over 7 years. Unfortunately I dropped it and couldn't put it back together again. I bought this one because it is almost the same clock. (A little different).But this clock will not keep the right time. I am in the PST. It would not auto set and then when I do set it, it will not stay on the correct time. It keeps moving ahead two hours. I have reset three times. I am about to throw it out the front door. I hate paying for something that will not work correctly!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good clock, until the works quit working","review":"I bought one of these nice looking, accurate clocks about 18 months ago. That clock had to go back to the factory under warranty when the second hand stopped working. They cheerfully sent me a brand new clock. Now, 8 months later, the second hand has stopped on the replacement clock. Obviously, this clock is not made up to standards of other La Crosse clocks. It's disconcerting to look at a perfect time keeper where the second hand is frozen -- it doesn't seem trustworthy once that happens. I guess I will replace it with a digital clock that has no moving parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great clock","review":"We've never owned a radio controlled clock before, but I liked the idea of it showing the correct time all the time and setting itself. We've had this clock for a few months and it is great. The size is great for the family room (16 inches) and the numbers are easy to read with a modern schoolhouse feel. It makes a soft ticking sound so it might not be good in a bedroom, though. It set itself just as it was supposed to, and I liked it so much that I got a smaller one for the master bathroom. It keeps the family on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Clock !","review":"Worked perfectly out of the box...I live on the east coast so all I had to do was insert the battery, select time zone and set DST in the on position...Everyone who sees it wants one..I did get mine $10.00 cheaper at another site.If your thinking about purchasing this..don't give it another thought... go for it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DST problem - chucking the darn thing","review":"Don't buy this clock.

We've had the clock for 3 years and it has never worked correctly. We changed to DST in March. This is May and it still thinks that it's EST. We've had it and will be chucking it in the trash and replacing it with a new one from Howard Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clock, very big..","review":"Installed in my garage, it's the first thing I see on the way in and the last on the way out. It and my att wireless phone's time are always in sync. You'll want to read the manual though. The first time you put the battery in, you'll set the time zone and daylight savings buttons on the back. After that, it will wait until late at night to sync. Don't expect it to set immediately. Once set, all you need to do is replace the battery once or twice a year, push a couple buttons and you're good. I bought two of the 12\\" versions for inside the house. They work flawlessly as well. The only thing I'd avoid is leaving the 16\\" version laying face up with the battery in. The second hand is heavy enough that the tip will drag on the paper backing which in my case, resulted in an arc where the second had dragged. This isn't an issue when the clock is mounted though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Service, Bad product, Bad Luck","review":"I bought the LA CROSS WT-3161 (Analog Clock) for my office.

John and Flea are in top form and exhibit consistantly phenomenal playing and improvisation. Of the new songs, \\"Rolling Sly Stone,\\" is a keeper and harkens back to Freaky Styley while \\"Leverage of Space\\" maintains the quality of the Peppers' current style. All of the cover songs are pretty amusing. If you're in the US, this is more than worth the extra effort and/or money to obtain a copy.The only things that keep me from giving this five stars are:1) While very good, Anthony sound a little too professional to convincingly rock and roll at times (once again John and Flea mostly make up for this2) Chad's drum solo puts images of Spinal Tap into my head; the rest of his playing is top-notch.3) Why are there no older songs?

The funk rock sound has been lost during the course of the Chili Peppers career, and buying this cd has made me realize that nothing good can come from the new Chili's, they will only sink further down into the pit of pop rock, and will never be heard by older fans of the Chili peppers. This proves true with the release of By the way and the newest release of Live in Hyde."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is disgraceful as a RHCP fan","review":"How can they put out a live album with this setlist?? Two songs from before Californication and they are Under the Bridge and Give It Away. Pathetic. This is the worst setlist possible for such a great funky band before By the Way came out. By the Way is horrible. If you want some real Chili Peppers, listen to Blood Sugar and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Uplift album brought the funk and fun together. You can't get any better than closing an album with Organic Anti-Beat Box Band besides Sr. Psycho Sex. I just looked and aw that is an import and it will cost you stupid people 22 bucks to buy it.

Anthony Kiedis is off key almost all the time, he has improved on this record though. John Frusciantes guitar is just annoying and very thin sounding, especially when Flea is playing his thin sounding bass. The album lacks bass, and bottom end. Chad Smith's performance is solid, and Flea does the job, still with his thin sounding bass.And then there's the setlist! As someone else mentioned, there's only 2 songs from \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\", and none from albums before that. What happened to \\"Me and My Friends\\", \\"Breaking The Girl\\", \\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Fire\\", and the master cover of Stevie Wonders \\"Higher Ground\\"? There's way too many songs from \\"By The Way\\", and almost no funk at all.

The band has a great feel to it. What makes it better is that it is done LIVE, in show at Hyde Park London.Disc 1 has the pick of the songs such as Can't Stop, Around The World, Fortune Faded, Get on Top and Don't Forget Me.Disc 2 has a few good songs worth listening too more than once such as Zephyr Song, Right On Time, Under The Bridge and Give It Away.Overall its a must for any die hard Red Hot Chili Fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you dig science books, get this one","review":"If you are one of those who used to read Asimov'sor Arthur C.

I'm speaking specifically of DNA. While the authors spend a lot of time showing that DNA isn't a simple blueprint, I found their explanations lacking in attempting to come up with an alternative theory, one that didn't seemed to be well engaged with other contemporary thought.That said, the authors seem quite aware of the breadth of content in the fields this book writes about.

I know they'll get back together (eventually!) because they are both in Episode I, but I can't wait until the next book is released. This is definitely a must read for Star Wars fans everywhere. P.S. I'm fifteen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not stop writing Waston........","review":"When I first got this book I read it almost at once, as I read the first few chapters they turned out to be very good. Then last chapters of the book held me hanging my seat, and was also starting to feel sorry for Qui-gon Jinn that Obi-wan had to turn away from the jedi's rules. O was I ashamed of Obi-wan Kenobi in the last 3 or 4 chapters. I just hope Qui-gon and Obi-wan get togather in bopok #6 or I will be one unhappy reader! Jude Waston keep up the great writing! P.s. If anyone wanted to know when Star Wars The Phantom Menace is coming to buy or rent the date is April 4, 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I'm a Star Wars fanatic. I liked this book, but was very surprised that Obi-Wan left. I felt so bad for Qui-Gon! Especially since this is the second time his Padawan left him. The ending was bad. They shouldn't leave it hanging like that. But over-all I loved it. There was lots of action. I can't wait till the next one comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep 'em coming","review":"This series has been just great! My son (8yrs) was not interested in reading until he got ahold of these books. His favorite characters, favorite settings, everything holds his interest.

Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD Ending!","review":"This book starts out kinda slow in the beginning, but has a GREAT ending. I was very surprised about it, and so will you! There are many intense situations that require you to really pay attention to what your actually reading.

Read this book, or else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait a minute...this CAN'T be the last page!","review":"When I finished this book I was numb. I couldn't believe what Obi-Wan did. I rated this book 4 stars because of the ending. I have not bought the next book in the series, so I am still waiting untill I can pick it up and read through it in less than an hour. I read this book, like all the others in this series in less than two hours each. This book was OK...but definetly NOT the best. The book had many good parts, like detail and so on, but I still think each book in the series should be LONGER! I've read a lot of other reviews, and lots of people agree with me on the books being too short. Not that they're not worth waiting for until the next one comes out. I can't wait to read the next one! But as I said, this was definetly NOT the best in the series! I hope the next book is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jedi Apprentice Defenders of the Dead","review":"I don't think this book is as good as any of the others. It is mostly just about Obi-Wan and his Master Qui-Gon Jinn on the planet Melida/Daan where two tribes are constantly fighting one war after another. Obi-Wan makes some friends (as he always does) and meets a group of kids who are coming up with a plan to bring peace to the planet. He then realizes that on Melida/Daan, while staying with this group of kids, he has had more freedom than he has ever had when he was a Jedi. He must decide: Is he to be a Jedi Knight, what he has always dreamed of, or part of this group on Melida/Daan with his new friends and freedom?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on track","review":"Defenders of the Dead, the 5th Jedi Apprentice book, is a realblessing. The first two were excellent, the third good but boring,and the fourth had degraded to pointless meandering. So it was with some skepticism that I finally pickup up this one.At first I was dissappointed...But through the second half of the book, the character interactions between Master and Apprentice were getting interesting, things were actually happening, and we got a neat cliffhanger... I've found myself enjoying the YA SW books again.Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"You're never too old for Star Wars","review":"First, I have to say that I'm in college, and I still like to read this stuff.

The cute little blue case is great, but - the thermometer takes two long to read the temperature.

The medicine thingy is too big and most medicines come with syringes or little droppers which work better. The nasal aspirator does have a strong enough suck. The big green one you get from the hospital works much better - find a way to get more of these. The rattle is cute, but I have toys that I already keep in the diaper bag.

It might seem easy, but the fittings that keep the pole together are made of plastic and resemble screw-like fittings, but they really don't fit together perfectly and if you press to hard, they'll snap and break.

When my Bona arrived I cleaned my floors twice to remove the residue the other cleaner left. Now I get 2 large refills at a time, I don't want to ever be without it. No residue at all and everyone really complimdents us on out floors. I just can't understand why there are complaints.

I ended up buying the SHARK actually and was much happier with that"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but effective.","review":"When I ordered this, I expected the same size Bona as the one that had been recommended to me by someone -- a MUCH larger broom head. There had been no information indicating that this was a small-headed version. So, I was a bit surprised when it arrived.It is easy to assemble & use. Almost fun to push around and under things. I'm amazed by the dust pile every time, especially when I think that there really isn't anything on the floor. The wet clean is easy and effective. And I love just throwing the mop pad in the wash.I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Mop","review":"The key to this product's effectiveness is the microfiber mop. Nearly any solution will produce similar results.The problem with this product is that the mop is shipped in sections that you have to put together, and in our case, within about 30 seconds of its first use, the sections split apart and the mop broke.I contacted the company who sells them on Amazon, and their response was -- to do nothing.So what I would do is to buy a microfiber mop that is one piece, and then buy just about any solution. Cheaper solutions can be found at Home depot etc, and Microfiber mops can be found at Wal Mart.This product works very well, but you can put together a much cheaper kit, and one that will last longer, on your own. To purchase from a company that doesn't stand behind their products is probably sending the wrong message. Maybe this one was defective and the others would have worked for a long time, but if you can't trust the company, it's probably not worth taking a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bona Kemi Hardwood floor clean kit","review":"I was dissapointed in the liquid cleaning product.

I installed two of these in different cars, and in both cases after several months of satisfactory operation they began to fall off their windshields, not because the suction cups had failed but because the tabs they're attached to had softened and distorted so they were no longer coplanar. In fact, the clear suction cups act like miniature lenses, focusing the sun onto the black plastic around them until it actually melts. One suction cup completely melted through its mount.Wrong type of plastic for this application, and it also would behoove the manufacturer to switch to opaque suction cups.

This recording with Simon Trpceski \\"turned the light on\\" for me, and for once I actually liked the work and was emotionally moved by it. His technique is astounding and , to me for the first time, it did not sound as if the pianist was pounding the piano with his fists-the work's beautiful melodies were revealed to me for the first time.The shorter works on the recording are also played very well, but the second sonata, for me is the standout.The sound and musical programming are also outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter EXIT","review":"EXIT is a book every one should \\"enter.\\" It is more than a story of a scholar and researcher's daring and dangerous escape from a communist country to find haven in America.

It is a story of a father struggling to keep his family together, to guide his teen-age children, to maintain his integrity while carrying on significant research at a major university. (The shenanigans of academia described would be comical if they were not true-to life.) It is a story of a loving wife who stands by and supports her husband in times of uncertainty, trials and tribulations. It is a story of courage and conviction, of acceptance and rejection, of success and failure, of love and sorrow. It is a story whose underlying statement reminds us of the importance of love, risk, family, belief, commitment and honesty.

However, I was heartbroken when I finally got the whole album and discovered that \\"I'm Sorry\\" was one of only 3 really great songs on this album. The others are \\"Sweet Spirit\\" and \\"Don't Say No.\\" I'm really into well written, rhythmic, and significant songs, especially when it comes to gospel, but most of the songs on this album have mediocre lyrical content and the words don't flow. Some songs like \\"See Me\\" and \\"Power of Christ\\" seem like wonderful lyrics wasted on terrible beats and production while \\"Spiritual Bizness\\" and \\"Chozen\\" are hot beats with little to no significant message.I certainly was not inspired or moved by this album but I will look for them to do better next go around.

My experience with other similar bikes is that if the bearings fail once, the replacements will fail after a short time as well.For a piece of equipment that is supposed to retail at $600, this is a piece of junk.

Ordered a replacement - that was very quickly dispatched by Amazon via Fedex. This time, the packaging seemed to be intact, but the same plastic piece was broken. The manufacturer needs to do a better job protecting the plastic part..The packing material around the metal parts seems to be fine, if not overdone...Had to haul both bikes up a floor, to my garage so that UPS can pick it up to be returned - giving me a back-ache.

I admit I had my fingers crossed because of the shipping issues noted here, but this package was in good shape, everything in place and undamaged. My husband, who used to put together bikes in his father's store, had only one problem--the assembly instructions (and manual) were for model 231, not 230, and did not correspond altogether with the model 230 we have. The Schwinn web site had the right manual, and an earlier model had a very similar set of assembly instructions downloadable from the site, so this was not an insurmountable problem. I've been using the bike for several days, and find it very comfortable. I've had both back and abdominal surgery this year, so the recumbent position and lumbar support were important to me. I could adjust it easily to my height (5'3\\"), and it is noiseless in operation. So far, an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Great Machine for the Price","review":"I researched recumbent exercise bikes after having used a very expensive one that I liked very much in Physical Therapy. I had a recumbent bike years before that I became dissatisfied with quickly. This bike is actually better than the one at the Physical Therapist's that cost several thousand dollars. The only negative I have to say is when I ride it it I can hear it, but that is probably because I am not using a mat underneath. There is carpeting that I don't care about in the room where I use it, so I didn't bother to buy a mat. Either that or the base area needs to be adjusted somewhat. Otherwise it's great! I would highly recommend it to anyone interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Bad Packaging","review":"This recumbent bike is completely quiet. The only problem with the bike is the packaging. Although the cardboard box did not appear to be in too bad of shape, the bike arrived with a part of the plastic front cover broken off and stuck inside the machine. I had to remove the covers to remove the broken piece. Also a couple of screws were missing - I assume as a result of the damage. However, other than that, assembly was not too difficult. The bike is sturdy and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful purchase!","review":"I had been having back troubles with a bulging disc. All recommendations were that exercise would help. I bought the Schwinn recumbent bike several weeks ago and have been riding 30 minutes a day. My back problems have improved dramatically and I feel much better. The bike was easy to put together and is so quiet. You can watch TV very comfortable and not have to turn the sound up.

That only the main piece was frame and anything connected to it - whether welded on or not was not part of the frame.Don't trust the warranty - not worth a crapp. I was really surprised a name like Schwinn would do something like that.Contact me if you want to see a picture of the weld break.

The front tire frame had a piece of plastic bent out from it that does not look fixable.

It will be impossible to get it back into the box. I have written to Amazon requesting suspension of the charge on my credit card, but they missed the point and replied that they cannot get us the part sooner. They totally missed the point.

The computer that came with it had enough functions to make my workouts interesting enough, and this bike really excels at providing a very smooth and almost inaudibly quiet ride. Perfect for watching television or movies.Assembly was straightforward and well documented with the exception of having to understand an insert that amended how a cable was threaded.One caveat that prevented me from giving this product five stars is that the minimum distance setting between the seat and the pedals is still too large, and riders who are 5'4\\" and under will have trouble pedaling this bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn 230 Recumbent bike","review":"The bike took a few days to get because I opted for the free shipping. Unfortunately there were a few broken pieces from the casing. It didn't affect the functionality of the bike so we decided to not hassle with returning it - especially since it is very heavy. However this must be an issue with Schwinn because I also decided to order one for my daughter in Florida since we liked this one so much. And hers came with a more serious piece cracked. Schwinn was quick to replace the part and send it out; however there must be a problem with their packaging.That being said, I love the bike and it works great. It is amazingly quiet.

I love the workout selections, and it will really let you work up a sweat! I am a 29 year old man in decent shape and some of the higher settings will really push me hard! But it is versatile enough that it can be used by anyone of any age, with any fitness level. I was surprised at how quiet it is during a workout. I usually listen to music during a workout, but I remember the first time I took out the earbuds, I could barely hear the wheel turning!

I had to take the box apart to get the bike out so had no good way to return it. (It weighs far more than a single 50 year old woman can manage.) Amazon offered a refund to cover shipping and I had to argue with them to get any more. The amount they credited my account was insufficient for my satisfaction.

I ordered it and recieved it in exactly 7 days. Many reviewers talked about damage sustained during shipping, so I took a chance and ordered Amazon Prime. I had hoped that that would mean shorter delivery time, thus less damage and thankfully I was right. Instead of FED EX or UPS they used CEVA to ship and they delivered it in to my foyer. It shipped from Amazon's hub in Pennsylvania then to DC arriving here In Alexandria, VA in great shape. The bike itself was easy to assemble. I'm a woman and I did so alone in about 1 hour 15 mins.

This fan not only looks great but is so quiet that the only noise you hear is the wind noise on the high speed, the motor doesn't make any noise at all.

With this fan runnining on low speed you can change youe thermostat by 2 or 3 degrees and it still feels like the same temperature. This saves you money on both heating and cooling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy fan, right price","review":"After doing some research for a ceiling fan for out newly remodeled home, I came across this model. For the price, you can't beat the quality. It is super quiet, moves alot of air and looks great. The paddles are reversible to match your liking.

I used can converters which worked out very well but on hanging the ceiling fans I discovered that the motor unit on one fan was faulty (harsh contact between the motor and housing). Hunter promptly sent a replacement fan and all was well. Once installed I noticed that both fans were making a slight humming noise at low speed (which is not present on another Beacon Hill fan I have in the house) and with both fans in the same room this was more noticeable than if they had been in separate rooms. As a consequence I ran the fans at higher speed as the hum was less obvious. Update: I discovered that the humming noises were associated with a rheostat two-way switch that was used for the original recessed lights and replacing the switch with a standard two-way switch has resolved the issue. The fans continue to perform very well and are nice looking and well-constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Effective Fan and Light","review":"As with every other Hunter ceiling fan I have owned, it is quiet, moves plenty of air, and the quality it excellent.

The installation was essentially from scratch where a new junction box needed was installed and the electrical was pulled. The most challenging part of the installation was securing the light to the fan as this was held by three screws and the amount of wire and capacitors that were housed within this caused the fit to be difficult. The fan did not require to be balanced and the operation is quiet for all fan speed. The amount of light the 3 bulbs emit is quite impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"Very poor design! The canopy will not sit flush against the ceiling.

They can't even hide their narrow-mindedness, as we can see. Every person can read the texts (it can be texts in the books and in the films and anywhere else as well - all our world is the text for reading and understanding) using some interpretative codes, which he has by force of his education and his environment.

I used it as often as possible during pregnancy (a few times per week). During pregnancy, it was very helpful to stretch out the muscles around my hips and pelvis. It also helped out for heart burn issues. The true value of this DVD came out during labor. This was my second labor and I truly believe that this is the missing piece to labor preparation. It works. These belly dancing moves helped me progress through labor very quickly and also significantly reduced all discomfort. There was a HUGE difference between my labors and I think that most labor preparation programs miss the importance of movement during labor. Visualization and breath only gets you so far. Belly dancing should be taught everywhere. If/when I get pregnant again, there is no question that I will pick this DVD up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love this workout!","review":"I have been hesitant with workout videos, because they tend to be too mellow, and I like a little sweat now and then. I initially did the \\"beguinner's\\" section of this dvd and was a bit bored, because it was too slow for me. But the next few times i've done the advanced section. It is so much fun, i love to see my belly in the mirror swaying, you can do your own versions of movements, get lost in the drums and just dance along with the instructor. The 30 minutes go by so quick, and you don't even realize it. I also saw there is an \\"instructional\\" section, where they break down the moves and explain them to you. I am not sure how fun that part is. But i do absolutely LOVe this video. I just wish you could vary the music, i guess i could always add my own soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun, not really a workout","review":"I was very excited to get this DVD in the mail. When it arrived (in a timely fashion) I quickly tried it out. I really had a lot of fun doing all of the moves and it was very easy to pick up the steps. I wouldn't quite call it a workout though. It was more relaxing than anything else. I didnt walk away out of breath or tired, and I'm not sure if it has actually toned anything, but it has kept me active after sitting at work all day.I joke with my family and friends and tell them I am going to belly dance my way through labor, but I do plan to use some of these moves during labor as I am planning a natural delivery. I will let you know how that goes in a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I was a little hesitant to start this. I kept thinking I would look silly, but honestly, who doesn't look silly doing an at home workout no matter what it is. So I gave it a try, and I found that it's really fun, and diversifies my routine. I don't know how much of it I will use during labor because we have been blessed with twins this go around, but I wish I would have had it during my 11 hour no epidural labor with my first! Maybe it would have gone faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Overall","review":"This music is a little on the generic circuit party music side, but it's fun.

I love his work with Jimmy Reed and I have his \\"I Feel So Bad\\" album. The problem with this disc is not the guitar work, but the lazy vocals, and absence of lyrics. Throughout the entire album, Taylor unsuccessfully improvises lyrics that do not rhyme. Sometimes, when the response (as in the Call & Response lyrical format of the Blues) is supposed to be given, Taylor just mumbles something incoherently. Did he regularly perform like this in a live setting? The \\"I Feel So Bad\\" album has some great lyrics, so I'm a bit confused by this release.

He and his friends were inspired to create an experience for their sons, akin to the journey a boy took to become a knight. This book shares their story, examples of what they did, and ways that you could do the same. Wow. What a powerful, life changing moment that really can be so simple.There is nothing more satisfying than knowing your purpose in life and that someone believes in you. If only every young man could have such an experience. Dad's, uncles, grandfathers, pastors, youth pastor's, read this book and be inspired to change a young man's life. To give him direction, a code of conduct, a mission to fight, and a cause to fight for. I'm thankful Robert Lewis and his friends were inspired to guide their sons into men of integrity.

I actually thought \\"man my dad should have read this book\\", until I noticed that it was christian-oriented. My experience is that christianity *causes* a degree of passivity, increases the acceptance of ignorance and conformity, etc. Passing religion to a child encourages the lack of critical thinking, increases the blind trust of unknown people and organizations, etc. Almost every religious person I've known has been weak and passive, doesn't question authority, or simply defaults to always taking the religious-right-wing side of arguments without thinking any further about the issue. I have tried to hammer reason into the minds of religious people without success because they are so intent on believing what they've been convinced of through peer-pressure and unsubstantiated promises (lies).

They are consumed by pop culture, secular humanism and relative morality, each of which does nothing toward providing them the life skills and leadership lessons they need to be productive, well adjusted, loving husbands, fathers and contributing members of our society.

It is a must have for any fathers library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a guide to prepare our sons for true MANHOOD.","review":"I have a young son and I have been troubled at my lack of knowledge in how to truly prepare him for growing up into a Godly Man. When my wife presented this book to me, I couldn't put it down. It gave me wonderful ideas about guiding my son into Christian manhood and to not wait until he became 18 and say, 'Your a man now, so act like it'. I can now take defining moments of my son's life and engrave them into him as steps he is taking along the path to manhood. I honestly believe that many men today cannot say when they became a MAN. They don't have the memory of what made them into a MAN. I am determined to not let my son be one of those men. I am determined that he will not only know when he became a MAN, but also know that he is a GODLY MAN. Mr. Lewis' book has made that possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic approach in a tough Environment","review":"I do like the approaches used by the author and his friends as well as others to bring their sons to a man hood.

Well-written haiku, however. Many of the haiku in this book seem to be sentences divided into three lines. That isn't haiku.

That means you only get 18 levels cause they cover episodes 4,5,and 6. Yet there are TONS of extras that keep the gameplay fresh. Controls are pretty much the same as the original. Some characters use blasters, Jedi use lightsabers and the force. However, this time around the gunners far outnumber Yoda's crew.Also, due to the lack of main characters in the original trilogy, you'll see a lot of Han, Luke, and Leia. There is plenty of puzzle solving and hilarious cut scenes. All of the favorite scenes from the movies (Han shot first,lifting the X-wing,the Ewok song...)have been included.

I enjoy his later offering as well. This recording also is memorable because of the personal, Rod Piazza on harp, Hollywood Fats on guitar, Larry Taylor on bass.

The music is infectious blues rock, which I recommend to any blues lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this really written by Stephanie Laurens?","review":"After Gabriel's great story I had such high hopes for Lucifer, only to be oh so disappointed. This was even less entertaining than Vane's story. This one I couldn't even really finish. I can't tell you how many pages I skipped. I didn't care about the characters at all and the heroine was just boring. At least I liked Patience, I didn't have any emotions whatsoever for Phyllida. Overall my least favorite Cynster novel and a sad way to end the Bar Cynster series. The epilogue was the best part of the book and is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep up the good work \\"Stephanie!!","review":"I found this book to be quite a page turner.

Stephanie Laurens is a wonderful writer and I take my hat off to her for putting together this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"I have read all of the other Bar Cynster series and was not disappointed in this one. I thought Stephanie Laurens did a good job with continuing the story with the last of the Bar Cynster. True, Lucifer did fall in love fairly quickly after meeting Phyllida, but that is the strength of the Cynster curse. I do agree that Lucifer may not have been the best nickname for Alasdair since he was a very nice gentleman in this story.

It is a must read for Laurens' fans..."},{"rating":"1","title":"All About Love","review":"I have read all of the previous Cynster novels, and was somewhat disapointed with this one. I found it to be extrememly slow, and somewhat boring. I enjoy Regency novels for the fun of putting myself in the shoes of the lead characters, and trying to imagine life that revloves around balls, routs, and houseparties. The fun of Regency novels is not only the main characters, but also of the suportting characters and the way they live thier lives. There were no balls, no real supporting characters, and in my opinion, the setting in the countryside was boring. I enjoy reading before bed, and a good book is one that I start at 10 PM and finish at 1 AM. This book lastest me almost a week, because it was so easy to put down each night after only one or two chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"How can anyone say that this book was so boring? it's the whole cynster atmosphere. i think it's great that the series can continue and you follow the lives of previous books, i can't wait for the next installment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"This is the first SL book I've read, and I was not impressed.

I have found all of the other Cynster males to pale beside Devil, and Honoria was a fabulous heroine. I have reread \\"Devil's Bride\\" more than I want to admit. Hopefully the books about the twins will be more interesting since it will from a woman's perspective. I think Ms. Laurens is a talented writer, but Lucifer's story in particular was stuffy and boring (although the romantic/sex passages are always entertaining!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"All this in nine days?","review":"This book is simply too crammed together. The reader is expected to believe that in the space of nine days, Lucifer (Alasdair Cynster) decides to settle down in a part of the country he's never been before on his unexpected inheritance (which hurries along much more rapidly than matters proceeded through probate back then), is welcomed into the local society without any of the hesitation that's common in rural areas and small towns, falls in love with a young woman he had never seen or heard of before, gets her to reciprocate, and solves a mystery.There's no apparent reason for it to be so crammed together. The whole would have worked better if the author had given herself sufficient elapsed-plot-time to develop the social interactions more believably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable!","review":"ALL ABOUT LOVE is a very enjoyable read!

I don't care how it ends. This book is so bad, that it has deterred me from ever reading another one of Ms. Laurens' books again. A lot of pages filled with words just to make the book longer.

I give it five stars!Noble Vision"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely surprise","review":"I was struck by this exceptional novel for two reasons:Firstly, one rarely comes across a novel that has a serious theme about human life and human action, and this surely does. The conflict between the government controllers of medicine vs. doctors and patients who want to be free to act in their own best judgment, is masterfully dramatized. That alone would make it worth recommending this first novel.Secondly, I was struck when I read Noble Vision -- because it is a first novel! It reads as if it were written by a seasoned novelist -- in the quality of the characterization, dialogue, literary skills, and dramatization of the plot.It deserves a very wide readership, both for the ideas and characters it portrays so well, and the excellent stylistic rendering of its important themes about life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"While Noble Vision is an engaging personal story, it is heavy on an extreme anti-government idealogy. It presents a fictional government agency that acts in a manner similar to current for-profit health insurance companies. The author is obviously an Ayn Rand follower and contrives unrealistic black and white situations that are far from reality.I generally enjoy good medical fiction, but I found this one disappointing because of so much emphasis on the author's rather extreme political views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"Great book!

I myself am in the process of joining the health care industry and this book is what i feel will happen with government ran health care."},{"rating":"2","title":"As highly plotted as a thriller.","review":"As highly plotted as a thriller, LaGreca's novel goes far beyond. It dramatizes deeply ideological issues through the real-world effects of a centrally-controlled health system on the love relationship between a neurosurgeon and a ballerina.Who should decide whether someone gets a life-altering medical procedure? What are a researcher's rights over his discoveries? And who benefits from a state-controlled health system? The story is highly engaging, with plenty of twists and turns. It interweaves issues of family and friends with one of the political footballs of our day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good general introduction, helpful to experienced practitioners","review":"This book provides a solid review of basic aspects of neuropsychological assessment. It does an excellent job of addressing diagnostic issues (sensitivity and specificity, the importance of considering base rates, differentiating normal from abnormal performance etc.)It is aimed at the clinician and spends less time on neuroscience issues that do not have a direct bearing on what neuropsychologists actually do. Many different assessment tools and techniques are discussed.

I am not a country music fan, but when I heard \\"Podunk\\" I could see myself as that young girl that left a very small place in Ohio over 33 years ago. Funny thing is, my husband and I bought land out in Podunk in the Panhandle of Florida for our retirememnt. I play this album loud and often sing along. I also like \\"The Clothes Don't Make the Man\\". Keith covers it all. And he also is very easy on the eyes!!!

Other than the first song which I found a little strange, I loved it. The writing on this cd is first rate in my opinion... very entertaining material. I'm planning to buy it later tonight. I saw Keith a few years ago in Nashville before he got his deal. The guy is a real entertainer, and has some pretty impressive writing credits too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anderson who?","review":"This Album has new anti-piracy technology on it. I'm all for having the Artists get their fair share of money, but when I purchase an album I expect to be able to use it on all of my media devices, but I can't use it on the device I use the most, which is my sony HD-3 Mp3 player. So if you have a sony mp3 player save your money and buy another CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get this CD","review":"DO NOT GET THIS CD!!! THE COPY PROTECTION WILL NOT LET YOU DO ANYTHING WITH IT EXCEPT PLAY IT IN A REGULAR CD PLAYER. This means not putting it on your computer to listen to (which I like to do with all my cds), or making a backup copy on a disc if you wanted to. My computer won't even recognize it, so I can't play even it in my computer. Keith Anderson's music is decent however, but there are no outstanding songs or anything on it, and I wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't on sale. I also wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was unrecognizable in a regular computer with Windows XP. Do not get this cd unless you don't ever want to play it in your computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"cowpie deluxe","review":"First of all, this is not country, it's a contrived attempt for second rate southern rock and boogie. And of course anybody that name checks Tom Petty or Aerosmith or ZZ Top or Hank Jr sure isn't playing country. And of course knowing Anderson's songwriting, drinking Jack Daniels is as country as Budweiser. Of course it helps when you're endorsed by JD. But then again Keith Anderson knew that he couldn't make it on rock radio with this,so he went country and he wants you to think he's country and a little bit of rock and roll.And if thats the case then Keith Urban is Tom Petty and Kenny Chesney is Hank Jr, and Lonestar is Aerosmith.

It was a joy to view and it rekindled some long ago set aside interest in Nietzsche's work, Thus Spake Zarthustra. A glorious human story is this film, with ample attention to even minute detail.

With very good production values, produced andfilmed in European locations (with English dialogue) .The book is an award-winner too, by I think Erwin? Yolum, a noted psychiatrist and major writer on sophisticatedhuman psychiatric themes.

This is a real artist, who grabs the listener with less and leaves them with more. The arrangements are spare and elegant.Wow, this is some talent. Those who love her mother's (Elis Regina) wonderful contributions will find her daughter to be equally captivating as a musical force, but far more discerning. I find my ear trusting her incredible control of pitch and breath. She is expressive, but never leaves the music behind. This is an extremely intimate production.You will listen over and over to this. It's like Brazilian jazz on haiku.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware low resolution transfers","review":"I am a big fan of Film Noir and have been happy to see rare titles finally surfacing on DVD.

It was not a studio release, and the bad spelling and the note that copies are issued on demand should have alerted me to the fact that it was probably a sub-standard product. It is 'Thelma Jordon', not 'Thelma Jordan', and this simple error is a clear indication as to its provenance.

I mixed in a little water which made it even easier to apply. But no matter how I applied it, it always dried unevenly and left streaks. Even the best portions of my floor didn't hold as good of a shine as the mop'n'glo did.

Maybe like me, you've watched every Python-Marathon or taped every show, but having these scripts really is the icing on the cake.What's striking to me is the simplicity of the scripts. When you watch the episodes, the gags seem so complicated. Then to see The Dead Parrot sketch reduced to just a few pages, you realize how brilliant those guys were in terms of compression, and in terms of acting. An added plus, for me at least, was to finally see the words and phrases that I never quite \\"got\\" because they were unique to British English.

Two main couples who deny their feelings for each other until the end and all live happily ever after.I must admit that I like her books for the most part but feel that I am reading the same story over and over. Her characters are always beautiful, accomplished and dedicated...and so tortured by painful past that they are emotionally unable to function. They dwell on the past on almost every page and when not in the past they are imagining some hurt being put upon them by the object of their affection. I am beginning to find the stories almost painful to read and want to shake these characters and tell them to \\"get over it, already\\".Having said all that, I admit to being hooked and at least for the time being will continue to read her works. I just wish she would come up with some characters who weren't so fragile...men and women alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a speed read","review":"I've read a number of the author's other books and for the genre they're not too bad. But this book had me throwing it down in disgust. A totally ridiculous story - estranged twins, one of whom has a lion, a bone marrow transplant, two fatherless female doctors, and then some little sick girl enters the story. The totally aimless meandering of the flashback episodes had me skipping miles ahead. Yawn, who cares about these people? I don't even care to continue reading to find out if Caitlin ever finds her father.Besides being boring, this book could have used a good editor. I nearly screamed out loud after one too many sentences that began with \\"which.\\" Someone should tell Ms. Stone that a comma is a helpful device to string those thoughts together.

Sadat X has never experienced solo success, however, he's certainly the heart-and-soul of Brand Nubian. Having said that, Experience & Education is nothing groundbreaking or as classic as previous Brand Nubian releases (dating back to the golden age of hip-hop), but you could make an argument this album was one of the best (and most overlooked) in 2005.The album's highlights Back To New York, God Is Back, What Did I Do?, Ge-ology to name a few - add life into a world of hip-hop that's on the verge of death. Experience & Education is not flawless; in fact - you'll find a handful of filler tracks on this album.

In the context of its affordability, the one thing that did not satisfy me is the design of the trays and how they connect to the case parts that open every time you use it. Specifically, the hinge construction of the trays seems weak and of lower quality and in addition the trays rub against one another every time you open up the case. This suggested that while the case looks sturdy, the trays may not last as long- I'd prefer that the trays open up manually to prevent the undue wear!

When I opened the manufacturer's box, the inside pivot point (rivet) was broken so lid did not work. Looked at breadbox more carfully and there were 2 dents in the top also.This had to have been hand-packaged (inner colored packaging) by a manufacturer's worker who did not care what they sent out.

Most of the authors in those books referenced other OS's, mentioning at least differences and possible ways to work around incompatibility.This author blatantly ignores the growing number of people who prefer secure browsers being developed by the open source community. Possibly the most annoying thing is the statement (without reference) that 95% of all people on the internet use Microsoft IE. Which is interesting because the author also references lots of people using things which are not MSIE (cell phones, PDA's, etc).If you want to start into CSS, you probably know some HTML or JavaScript already, just go to the W3C website and download the references."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst computer book I've ever read","review":"This was the first \\"Dummies\\" book I ever bought and is likely the last. The author has a clear bias against internet standards and is prone to go off on rants about committees and their supposedly bad decisions that make life hard for him. If he had simply stated his positions at the beginning of the book, it would have been fine, but the continual diatribes, many of which are ill-conceived and/or illogical, throughout the book are distracting.Don't buy this book.

However on this one he sings, and that is a bummer. THACKERY is one of the best blues ( or anything ) guitarists today. He has total control over his instrument and uses it to sing eloquently.However when he sings, the whole sound is reduced to average blues. His voice is like a mix of ROY BUCHANAN and a wheezy PETER GREEN. Not very attractive. The material is OK but after the exceptional GUITAR cd doesn't reach nearly the same hight.It is still a very good blues CD, mainly due to the awesome guitar work.

And the thickly interwoven mysteries compelled me to read late into the night.I picked up this trilogy at its midpoint reading the second in the series first (Montmorency on the Rocks). Nevertheless, Eleanor Updale manages to catch up the reader quite quickly on the who's who and sketches the important events which lead up to the current plot. For a yonger reader (I'm not sure I shall admit to being a 20-something reading this book for fun:), I would suggest starting with the first in the series to make the chronology easier to understand.For those children who gobble up Sherlock Holmes, Montmorency will quench their thirst.

The soundtrack has a few good, recognizable songs including Smash Mouth's All-Star. The trick system is somewhat easy to pull off, and as you will find out in the later levels of the game, if you don't pull off tricks, you will not win a race. This really adds to the challenge and replay of the game.Overall, is this the best looking game on the PS2? No. Does it matter? Not at all!!! The gameplay is so much fun, you will wonder why you didn't quit reading these reviews sooner, and just buyed the game.Bottomline...

The very first time I used it, it cleared up about 75% of the pressure going on in my sinuses. Now, i use it twice a day regularly and can't stop raving about it. The only problem I had with it is that it is a little large for my nostril, but what a small price to pay for something so wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design; Ineffective Neti Pot","review":"The design of this pot does not work for me because I cannot get a seal against my nostril and therefore, cannot get the solution to flush my sinuses. Mostly the solution just runs out the first nostril. I rinse my sinuses daily, so it is not that I don't know how to use a neti pot - this one just doesn't work for me. Your results may vary, but I cannot recommend this pot.I have amassed 4 different pots - this one & the NeilMed, but my favorite is the Ancient Secrets ceramic potAncient Secrets Ceramic Nasal Cleansing Pot, 1 Neti Pot. I also a plastic travel version of itNasal Cleansing Pot Travel Plastic 1 Count.I find the SinuCleanse pot to be the worst of the lot, completely ineffective, and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird plastic smell","review":"This would be better if i wasn't inhaling what smelled to me like burnt plastic. After every use i get this smell stuck in my nose for hours even if i have washed the pot numerous times. It worries me that maybe there is some chemical getting stuck inside my nose. I don't know much about different kinds of plastics, but i know my sister have a different one that does not transfer this plastic smell(it's a SinuCleanse brand too)... I noticed because i \\"borrowed\\" and tried hers :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"After all the positive reviews... I guess I was hoping for more...","review":"I generally find myself all congested up before going to sleep. I try to not use things that will give me rebound congestion. I've tried it a few times so far, but it seems to only help me for 15-20 minutes at a time.I have no interest in repeatedly flushing saline through my nose all day to continue the bennefit.Based on all the positive feedback on the product it must work for some folks.I'm sure I'll try it again when hayfever season comes back, or if I get a sinus infection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every household","review":"Works as advertised.

If I could do it again, I wouldn't order this type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squeeze bottle type is better","review":"This teapot style is the original and is outdated. The squeeze bottle works easier and much better to get through a stuffy sinus cavity. The pot works on gravity alone and cannot push through the slightest resistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain!","review":"The first time I used this was at night, right before bed. Big mistake! When I woke up the next morning, my inner ear felt really painful, and blowing my nose magnified the pain.Afterwards, I decided to only use it in the daytime. However, I still get small painful sensations in my ears as soon as I blow my nose right after using the neti pot. I hear really loud \\"scratching\\" noises deep in my head as I blow my nose, and it takes about thirty minutes for the pain and sounds to go away.The packaging says that if your Eustachian tubes are larger than normal, you should cease use of the neti pot. I guess the SinuCleanse Nasal Wash system isn't for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Top Cover Falls Into Pot","review":"Unfortunately, the top cover falls into pot.

Josephson, M.D. F.A.C.S. and I am the author of the book Sinus Relief Now recently published by Penguin Books. The book is about sinus problems, allergy, asthma, snoring sleep apnea and gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD). I am a total believer in patients irrigating their sinuses on a daily basis. Irrigation removes infection, allergens and irritants. I personally suffer from sinus problems and irrigate myself. I recommend irrigation to all of my patients. Netipots are a very effective way to clean out your nose and sinuses. This is an excellent product. I recommend and show you how to use netipots in my book Sinus Relief Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible headaches after using","review":"After the first use, I felt fine.

I tried several times. With salt packet, without, salt reduced to 1/16th of a spoon and my sinus became more irritated instead of relieved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"I bought this with great expectations. I thought it was a great way to travel. I tried it at home first and it was awful compared to the one I use every day. It took forever for the pot to empty compared to the one I use everyday. Also it didn't have to flow that mine does. To use the full pot takes at least 10 times longer then mine.The little packets of salt burned my nose even when I cut the directed amount in half.This is not a good design. I'm sorry I bought it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me","review":"I deal with some seriously congested sinuses at times so I tried this based on seeing it reviewed on Dr. Oz.

I got an inner ear infection from it!!!","review":"When I used the nettie pot I followed the directions exactly as indicated. After using it I could feel water in my inner ear. Nothing I did got rid of it. It was driving me crazy! I went online to investigate & see what I could do to get rid of the uncomfortable feeling of having water & pressure in my ears. It turns out that this is a very common problem with nettie pots. IN the middle of the night I woke up with a fever & my ears were burning. I had to go to the ER, and ended up spending $250 for medicines & ER visit.

I use it daily at night"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but gravity isn't enough at times","review":"I would have given this 5 stars if only there was a way to pump the saline solution into your sinuses, since if you have congestion it may not flow through properly.The basic concept of this device is this, clean out your sinuses with saline solution to relieve buildup and reduce infection/virus. The saline solution is the biggest part since saline does a good job of helping to disinfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"sinu-cleanse","review":"this is a wonderful product. The wash solution is not too strong and does a great job of cleansing the sinus area. It is nice to be able to breathe."},{"rating":"2","title":"SinuCleanse Neti Pot System","review":"Very good product. I had to use it several times before I experienced some relief from the pressure. It's very easy to use, and really gets a lot of \\"stuff\\" out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally strange, but it changed my life","review":"I bought this product out of desperation. I suffered from chronic sinus infections for years, and it got to the point where I was in constant pain and could not get through the day without a nap. Medications didn't help me at all.I was a bit hesitant to use it because I was worried that it would hurt and/or add to my constant nosebleeds. It did neither.After the first use, I could breathe through my nose again. After using it for a few days, I didn't need to take naps to make it through a day. After a week, I was totally free of pain and feeling great. It is AMAZING.The first time you use it is very strange, but after that it becomes natural. I found that if I tilt my head down so that it is almost parallel with the ground I get some ear pain when using it, but keeping my head up more as it suggests in the instructions prevents this.If you are considering it, it is a cheap option that is definitely worth trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"big nose","review":"I am a big believer in neti pots and think they work great. This particular model has a HUGE hole which requires a larger nostril size to use. I was very disappointed and will return for a different type....one with a more pointed end makes much more sense. Just a caution, if you have a smaller nose, get a different model!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After one use, I'm hooked.","review":"After seeing this on Oprah (my wife was watching of course), I thought my habit of buying Claritan a couple times a month would warrant an effort here.

My sinuses are clear and I am not running for my decongestant again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked once but after that makes you sick.","review":"The first time i used this it worked great. after use i cleaned and sanitized it and put it away. the next two times i used it i got lightheaded and dizzy. and no its not because i used water that was too hot. i do not recommend buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLACEBO EFFECT","review":"No neti pots do not work for me no matter what nor does any saline solution. Is it because I have stubborn sinuses? Is it because if have a deviated septum? I laugh when doctors suggest these things...it always makes me WORSE. The water gets stuck up there and it burns and nothing comes out...I get really bad headaches afterwards. Sometimes it clears me up for like 3 minutes only to come raging back (stuffiness and headache) and clogged worse than ever. I seriously don't see how people really think this work...but to each their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains BPA","review":"No thanks, I don't think I need another BPA plastic item in my house.

The next day, when blowing my nose, my mucus had a significant amount of blood in it, followed the next day by a very painful sinus infection that has so far lasted a week. Of course, I can't guarantee that this product caused it, but I won't be using it again without distilled water.

I started when I developed a horrible sinus infection that lasted for months. It wasn't until I started using this system that the infection finally went away. Now, whenever I feel a cold coming on I use my Sinucleanse for a few days and it's gone. It takes some practice getting used to the whole procedure especially when your sinuses are clogged but if you are persistent it really helps so much and then you can maintain very easily. I recommend it to all of my friends and family. I also saw this on our local news channel as one of \\"doctor's best kept secrets\\". An allegist was recommending it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"For all problem sinus people get this. I have been able to go off mouth drying allergy meds, I get over colds faster and even my 82 year old mother is using it. I bought this for a little girl with big sinus problems.

Amazon is the best place to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to","review":"Doing this to yourself is a little tough to get used to... it feels like water-boarding, lol. Seriously though if you do it right it's not bad, it only feels like you dove in the deep end of a pool and got water up your nose.After I blow all that water out of my sinuses I clog up again almost immediately but within 10 minutes I'm breathing clearly. I don't need this every night but the nights I use it I get much better sleep.I could add that I feel an entire packet of salt is too much and I only use about half of one.

The beauty of this neti pot over some of the seemingly fancier ones is that its dishwasher safe & certainly isn't going to break if you drop it.

On the game the computer gets harder to beat along the way so you always have a new challange to face. It also comes with some cool cards to add to your deck. The only thing that bugs me about this game is that you have to type in the code on your cards to get them into the game. I think that's Kind of a skeem to make you buy new cards. Otherwise it's a great game! So if your a Yugi-oh fan I recommend it 100%!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Although I haven't gotten the game yet, this and all the other Yu-Gi-Oh games look really fun, especially this one and Forbidden Memories. It uses a lot of strategy, plus there are some really cool cards-and specials. If you get a new one in the box are three cards with a code that you can use to get it in the game. The best part is with the right code, every time you win a duel you get a trap or magic card from a certain player. This looks like one of the best games-perhaps even better than Zelda. I plan on getting it as soon as I find it (which might be a while. If you like games that you need to use your brain on, not just strength, this is the game for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yami Yugi's Review","review":"This game may not look good to the eye but the stratagy in the game and the exitment will make u want to feel like u are a true duelist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY COOOOOOOL","review":"this game is incredible!!!i love it, with the deuling and by the way, if you watch the show youll probly do better because you know how to duel and really believe in this awesome thing they call Yu-Gi-Oh!.much like pokemon, but it has 1 thing that pokemon doesn't-fun while at the same time you use your mind and beleive in what youre doing. i would play the card game also but people think its dorky and it'll ruin your reputation-but dont get me wrong, you can play the game boy game without worrying about your popularity. i just cant explain how fun it is combining magic cards with monsters, its like it was a game ACTUALLY made for the fearows of Ancient Egypt.

Not in this. You sit in the main menue the whole time and just keep playing cards the whole time, not once do you leave the main menue. It is extremely repetitive and not worth 30 dollars, however if you are really into the card game and have a lot of money to waste it might be okay, however most people dont have too much money to fork over for a game that wont be too fun. I hope this review was useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rules!!!!","review":"This game is AWESOME!! In this game you get to face-off against about 96% of the characters in the show.

(in fact, you can't use it because it isn't in the game.) to fuse, simply put one card on top of another. if your fusion does not work the bottom card is destroyed. save your money and buy eternal duelest soul. i have played one of the japenese games that makes up (esd) it's good.

The price is also good. The front edge has a fairly sharp edge to slide under whatever you're serving.After quite a few uses, however, I am downgrading this item to two stars from four. I found a weak spot--literally. The blade is very sturdy and so is the hollow handle, but where they join, the metal is very thin. I found it bends easily when scooping up a large portion that is stuck to its tray, with icing, for example.Also, the rest of the line is quite limited. The other pieces like the spoons and tongs are poor functional designs. Thus, this item won't match anything else you own. My advice: if you use this (and the pie server) just for serving and you're gentle, you'll be OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime","review":"Talented Writer/Director Henning Carlsen does excellent work here, as does actor Per Oscarsson in leadrole.Fine adaption of what may be my favorite novel of all time, Knut Hamsun's HUNGER.Waited decades to see this.

That's high praise from me, because my belief has always been that no matter how terrific a filmed version of a fine novel is, it can never be as good as the book.If you love Hamsun's beautifully written novel, you'll enjoy this remarkable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"reminiscent of screwball comedy/romances","review":"This book had me chuckling with its light screwball comedy/romance flavor. Watching big city writer B. J. fall apart both physically and emotionally on the quirky island of Ana Lia while trying to deny her growing interest in the local vet, Hobie Lynn, is a series of comedy of errors. Before B.

If you set it in a bowl the weight of the handle teeter totter's it out like a catapult, and if you set it in a shallow ban on the stove it can, and has, catapulted out with hot sauce all over you and the floor.

The 'cupped' part is extremely thick - WAY TOO thick! I was going to use it as a basting spoon and a soup serving spoon but can't because the thick sides can't scoop up enough liquid for basting and odors of soup seasonings (especially garlic) linger on it. I can even smell the dishwasher detergent on it after it's been throughly washed. I wanted to send this back soon after it arrived from looking at it, but all that trouble for an $11.00 spoon??? NOOOO! I'll figure out something it will be useful for after my suspicions (plus even more problems) proved to be right. Maybe I'll scoop dry cat food with it.

It is a collection of other people's memories. In some of them you have no idea what they are talking about, unless you were there. Others are self-serving. Others are whiny.

This is an excellent idea for a book, it just need to be written better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expose of the investor-owned electric utility business","review":"This is a detailed expose of overcharging for electricity by investor-owned utilities during the 1960s. It's full of exacting research and it's a great read to boot. And I'm not just saying that. In the March 9, 1967 New York Review of Books, Ernest Gruening called \\"Overcharge,\\" \\"a blockbuster, and it should be read by every user of electric light and power. It describes and documents how the privately owned public electric utilities charge the consumer excessively, and by erecting and subsidizing an elaborate public relations structure, deceive their victims.\\"Overcharge: How Electric Utilities Exploit and Mislead the Public, and What You Can Do About Itby US Senator Lee Metcalf and Vic ReinemerDavid McKay, 338 pp"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballet: Flames of Paris","review":"Outstanding. Natalia Osipova is right at the top of her game and an absolute joy to watch. Despite her stealing the show the corps de ballet and other principals are by no means overshadowed. Ivan Vasiliev also performed magnificently and the pair were perfectly matched.The story of the French Revolution is well told in dance and the haunting music so evocative of the time and place. Folk tunes are picked up and of course La Marseillaise is showcased.This will appeal to all, both newcommer and connoisseur alike. An outstanding example of the genre.Budding dancers can learn a lot from examining the finer detail and the bonus section interviews are riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy editing","review":"Most \\"investment advice\\" books suffer from poor editing, both of the 'grammar & syntax' variety, and, more distressingly for this genre, flat-out incorrect information. Klines's book is no exception- the grammar & syntax are fine, but her book is replete with factual errors and misstatements. For example, on page 207, she defines a synthetic long futures as \\"sell a call option, buy a put option.\\" Wrong. That is a synthetic short position. Similar errors pervade the book.One useful feature is chapter 3, which presents futures contract specifications. However, even here, some of the information is occasionally confusing or misleading.This book is published by McGraw-Hill, a highly reputable house. My surmise is that McGraw-Hill has no financial experts on its editorial staff; otherwise, it wouldn't tolerate the publication of such a sloppily-edited piece.

I had heard some horror stories of customers receiving the discs in terrible, scratched condition and the packaging being of poor quality. I had also heard that the quality of the films wasn't very good. But I really wanted this set as it's extremely rare to find any Fox films (pre 20th Century Fox) commercially sold. The package arrived in excellent condition. It was very carefully wrapped and packaged. The discs were all in great condition.

I haven't watched them all the way through to ascertain whether they are usable or not, but I'm betting that at least one will not play all the way through. The books (that cause all the damage to the discs) are little more than a collection of still photos.

I bought these because I thought the trend in more recent reviews was saying they had improved the product. But they haven't. They don't look awful, but the plastic viewing pane is extremely cheap, mine were poorly fitted and the decorative grooves did not line up well and were scratched when I took them out of the box, and the metal is very very thin.

I wasn't really wanting to spend $100+ on All-Clad canisters, which consistently get good reviews, and many of the flip-top types I'd seen looked a bit flimsy. So I went with these, classic looking and mid-priced. Unfortunately, when I put flour into the large canister and closed the lid, flour squirted out the canister \\"window\\". I'm not sure if I just got a bad set, but definitely sending back and won't be buying these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I had read the reviews on Amazon about how great these canisters were, but when I received it, I was surprised to find that they were of poor quality and felt cheap.

In general, it wasn't what I expected and had to return it as soon as possible. Too bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I needed for stuff","review":"I have been shopping for a set of canisters for many years but they were all too small. A bag of flour would never even half fit in the largest of most canisters. The largest of these (4 quart{16 cups}) will hold all but a little bit of a bag of flour. I like the look of the stainless steel and the fact of the seal around the lid. The only draw back to this product is the acrylic window in the side. I was afraid I would poke it out when I washed it by hand (it feels flimsy), but it turned out okay. They look great and the ability to see how much sugar and flour you have without opening the lid is a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Perfect","review":"I love the polder stainless steel canister set.

The clear window in front is lined with a dull finish and makes the canisters look cheap. Also, the canister are somewhat hard to open when you are trying to bake or cook. Something with a nob, handle or lift would have been better and easier to open.

It made it look like it was poorly made and when I felt the clear window on each canister, I found that these are made out of cheap plastic that I can move and press in with my fingers.

The pacing I think is what bothers so many about the game. It can seem tedious if looking towards the invariable end. But if taken as a journey the general wandering around and loot gathering is exactly what you remember from every DQ game before and since.For an entry point into the series DQVIII would be the better game.

The fighting is just as boring as the storyline, and the plot seems to fall out of no where into your lap with little explanation as to how the son of a fisherman would be best buds with the Prince. Furthermore, there's just no excuse for those horrible graphics, other then laziness. The cut scenes don't even have a small bit of sound, like walking or a rock slate being slid open. I'm all for games that focus on storyline before graphics, but this one dropped the ball in Both areas.

With all the time that's spent unfolding the plot in the beginning, you would think they might have made it a tad more interesting. There is a good hour of aimlessly roaming around, talking to people who have nothing relevant to say, and not knowing where the heck you're even going before you even encounter your first battle.I was enchanted by the original Dragon Warrior for the NES, and I even thought that the next two sequels were OK, but this game does not bring back any nostalgia of the old school gaming experience.

I have to admit I couldn't wait 4 or more hours just to get to a battle because the story is just so boring. I winded up looking on youtube to see how the battles looked and it actually looked like something even worse than the battles that can be made on RPG Maker for playstation (for those of you that played that game you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.)

Once you have one, you can mix and match all your felt sets or even use your felt pieces on a felt easel if you have one.The Felt boards are good quality and stiff - perfect for using on the floor, lap or even in the car.The Felt pieces are made of good quality felt - depending on the piece some have been printed on and others left plain and they can be overlapped and moved about as much as your imagination allows. It's a wonderful tool to get your child to tell you a story about the picture they made.What I like about them is each set comes with a special carry bag made of plastic. The felt pieces can be stored in side - zipped locked with a easy to use slide lock and then clipped onto the handle of the felt board. This is perfect to carry around the house or even to Grandma's or to keep your little one busy in the car or while waiting for food at a restaurant.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring....","review":"My daughter received this feltboard for her 3rd birthday.

It reminds me too much of Motocross Mania on PS1. Unlike MX 2002 with RC, in this game you sort of just hold the throttle on and steer around the track. Although the framerate never slows down, and is much faster than MX 2002, it doesn't makethe game is any more fun. And there are a few quirks which are irksome...If you hit the brakes, the bike stops and takes a few seconds to get up to speed, and in that time most of the pack will pass you. It's almost impossible to crash, and if you fail to make a corner instead of crashing you will bounce straight up in the air.The amount of tracks is a plus, but they all seem the same. There is nothing distictive about them, and after a few laps you won't know the difference between Namur or any other track. The tracks are all grainy looking, which is kind of a bummer considering the other games on PS2 and their clarity.I would recommend renting first, and if you like it after a few days, then purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best MX game so far!!!","review":"I love to ride motocross, watch it and play it in games. I have played many if not all MX console games. This game has the most realistic physics, which to me, is the basis for any good MX/racing game. To me, the game captures the feel of riding, with smooth turning and acceleration. It has pitch (wheelie) control, which is an essential element ignored by other games. The jumps can be exaggerated, but also carefully controlled and mastered, which requires actual timing of double jumps, triples and rhythm sections.Graphically, it still holds up after several years and is still a blast to play!

It is nearly impossible to get the crabgrass \\"wet enough\\" to activate the product and if there is even the slightest breeze, forget applying the product as the fine-grained powder will blow all over the place. The applicator clogs (because you are shaking it on wet grass) and does not make for easy application.

This show has the potential to get better for many years to come and has a really good, clever humor to it.Also, compared to its first season, The Office is really coming into is own and while it does stay awkward it's lost some its bleakness that shone through in the first season. This lighter feel to it can most be recognized in Pam's character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"it was good. the girl i gave it to LOVED it and i was really glad that it came in time otherwise i'd still have it and be really tempted to watch it hahaa"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest shows on TV","review":"A lot of people don't \\"get\\" this show but if you have a sharp sense of humor and appreciate some physical comedy mixed in you will love the office.

No more self consciuos comparisons to the original British show. This one is clearly better.

Also I have to say that I have been really disappointed with DVD packaging and presentation from a lot of companies but I think that this is a perfect example of what a good DVD box set should be, and the special features complement the series really well.P.S When you're done with this get My Name is Earl season one on DVD - another great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the UK original, but...","review":"The American adaption of this UK TV-series is not as good as the original, but Steve Carrell really does a brilliant job!

I loved the earnest characters, the drab office backdrop and the razor wit of Ricky Gervais. I also enjoy Steve Carrel, but this show has done nothing to grab me. Believe me, I have tried. I've watched all of season one and got one fourth the way through this season. The actors portray their characters so deliberately, not subtly. The jokes seem so forced. I did my best, but Gervais' Office will always be THE Office to me.Why do we Americans feel the need to remake and repackage everything popular that exists outside of our borders? If you asks me, it does not speak well of us as a nation and makes us come off as very close-minded and self-centered."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It!","review":"I think that the BBC version is one of the funniest things that I have ever seen. Clever, witty, outrageously funny....I saw 3 episodes of the NBC version and didn't even smile. Very boring, unfunny stuff.

In doing so, it lost all of its punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dwight shows off his \\"karate\\" moves","review":"I'm a little partial to Office episodes. As a huge fan, there has not been one that I didn't like. In this episode, Dwight is bragging about his Karate moves and makes Michael look like a fool in the office.

But it is really disappointing the way these DVD's are packaged. What ever person decided to go with this packaging should be FIRED! I handle my DVD collection with care and yet still both seasons that I have that came with this packaging end up with massive scratches with render them unwatchable. There is little more annoying than getting half way through an episode that you are really into and having it freeze because the DVD is scratched. I realize in the grand scheme of things this is minor but I am not rich and cannot afford to replace these. Luckily I have Netflix so I can get this season on instant viewing but it doesn't have the extra's that I bought the DVD for. My recommendation if you buy these, put them into a DVD book and don't leave them in their original packaging. This goes for Season 2 and 3.

My daughter-in-law and I discussed this book at lenghth and decided it is not a book that needs to be added to my Grandaughter's library.

He has amassed an admirable body of work over the years, despite (or perhaps because of)) lack of widespread acclaim. Great chops, solid writing and gritty vocals. This CD stands out, however, for its tight, funky arrangements. Those crisp, punchy horn fills add a groove to Cain's songs and give each one a distinctive sound. And the rhythm section could make your grandma sound good. Coupled with Cain's many other assets, they make this perhaps the finest of his many fine projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Classic Fifties Torch Albums","review":"Plenty has been written about Julie London's terrifically sexy and understated voice, but this is where it all began. These two albums (\\"Julie Is Her Name\\" was her debut) best capture the sound associated with her- a soft voice with just guitar and bass (Barney Kessel and Ray Leatherwood on \\"JIHN\\"; Howard Roberts and Red Mitchell on \\"Volume II\\"). Julie's definitive classic, \\"Cry Me A River\\", is the first track here and sets the tone for what follows. The catch: these two concept albums, recorded in 1955 and 1958, respectively, were not meant to be heard as one continuous piece, and the combined length may diffuse some of the energy here. You may want to play tracks 1-13 and come back later for 14-25. And if you're only going to buy one Julie London disc (or, rather, think you're only going to buy one) I'd go for Rhino's \\"Time For Love\\" first- these are classics, but that one's a better overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a CLASSIC!","review":"What can I say about these two albums? Absolutely brilliant and enchanting. The stripped down guitar/bass backing really brought out the intimacy in London's voice. The sound is sultry, intimate and gently swinging. It just doesn't get any better than \\"Cry Me a River\\". Her subtle phrasing and gentle delivery are impeccable. These two platters were true milestones in American music. Quiet, gentle swingin' perfection. Add a martini and you are in absolute heaven. A Masterpiece. There will never be another Julie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guitar & vocal masterpiece","review":"How many great jazz albums can you name that feature simply a voice and guitar? There simply aren't that many around - Sarah Vaughan's \\"After Hours\\" comes to mind (although a bass is present as well), and Ella's four albums recorded with Joe Pass. (Although Ella's best guitar duets are found earlier in her career, such as \\"Azure,\\" \\"Solitude,\\" and \\"In a Sentimental Mood,\\" from the Ellington songbook; as well as \\"Detour Ahead\\" and \\"Angel Eyes,\\" collected on The First Lady of Song collection; and \\"Wait Till You See Her,\\" on the Rodgers & Hart songbook.)

It also takes a couple hours for the outside remote to produce it's first accurate readings and a day or so for the weather predictor to give an accurate weather prediction.

The description should tell you that the lids are plastic with a thin chrome-color coating. Even though the lids were covered with plastic to protect them when shipped, they arrived scratched.

While the rest of the spice rack looks great, the lids are what you notice and they make the whole product look bad. I wanted an attractive spice rack to sit on my counter, but I don't even want this hiding in the cabinet. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea...Poorly Executed","review":"Just got this set and was excited to get my spices into them. The rack is compact and fits my city apartment wonderfully. It's exactly what I was looking for. But...and it's a big one...the lids on these things are useless. The shaker lids have holes way too small for any of your spices that aren't granulated to fit through. Some other reviewers have mentioned that McCormick spices lids fit and that's true, but McCormick no longer uses those lids and have switched over to lids integrated into the cap. I only have one in my collection that I can re-purpose. The screw on lids and chrome plated plastic, not great but fine for the price, and the screw tops aren't anywhere close to airtight. This combined with the clear glass means your spices will quickly be degraded due to both light and air.Sad to say these are going back and I'll have to keep shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy, Small-Footprint Spice Rack","review":"This spice rack is handy for a small kitchen, takes up very little counter or cabinet space. It is extra easy to locate spices on it, and to pull them and replace them, facilitating a grab and sprinkle cooking style.I gave it four instead of five stars, because I find the spice jars just a little too small. I also wish the curved slots were big enough to hold Trader Joe's spice jars. I'm glad I bought it, because it sure beats the crowded random bottles-on-the-lazy-susan system we had before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clara's Heart","review":"I couldn't watch it, because it wouldn't load.

If the money isn't returned within the next 48 hours I'll be contacting the BBB & will not be doing business with you again!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly unprofessional","review":"Reading throug this mess was like banging my head to the wall. Niles is undoubtedly one of the most talentless writers in the TSR/WoC branch. The whole book is on autopilot, characters fall out and then fall back in, but you don't care, because you can't get a hold on them. The villain and the surprise, even the setting are all obviously just plot devices, I couldn't care less. The dwarven kingdom has never been sooo boring and dull. There is no sense of time, doom and loss, and the whole is impersonal. Skip it and you won't miss a beat [in the series]."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dwarf tale of Thorbardin","review":"I have never been a maniac about the dwarven realm of Thorbardin, but this book opened up my eyes. I must admit the introduction of daemon warriors and the platinum egg inticed me into further reading the story. Other than Weis and Hickman, Douglas Niles is one of my favorite DragonLance authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill em all, let Margaret sort em out","review":"I was not particularly impressed by \\"The Last Thane\\". On the whole, it was one of Doug's lesser works in my opinion. While he had some really good material in going into depth about life in Thorbardin, and the relations between dwarven clans, it seemed to me like he was just trying to see how many dwarves he could kill off at once, so no one would wonder where they were when the Fifth Age writing started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra-flexible turner","review":"This turner was much too \\"soft\\" for my taste; the neck is bendable to the point that it makes it difficult to use. I have several other Kitchenaid products which I really like, but this one is going to be replaced soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I didn't buy this from Amazon.com, but I can't resist writing a review nonetheless. The handle is so heavy that it flips the turner out of the pan unless you have it in the pan up to the handle, and the handle doesn't take the heat well. Today, the thing flipped out of the pan onto the floor, and it broke in half where the turner meets the handle. Someone designed this tool with good silicone, nice appearance, but serious problems with functionality. Wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, too thick, too bulky","review":"This turner LOOKS impressive, but that's all I can find favorable about it. It's too thick to slide under food, too rough to let food on it slide off, and too bulky to store in the crock with the rest of the turner utensils. Meal after meal, I grab the old, ugly, scorched turners instead of this. When this is the last clean turner in the kitchen, I handwash a dirty one. I'd throw it away...but it was a present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max Pain!","review":"Do not waste your time buying this awful tedious game! It's a Tombraider wannabe except Max can't climb, can't swim, can't drive a car, can't ride a bike, can barely jump. A lot of can'ts! All he pretty much does is shoot and shoot and shoot! To brake the monotony, the creators of this game torture you with a blood maze in the dark. Trust me you don't wanna know! What really stinks about this game for playstation2 is you can't save your progress, rather the game has save points done automatically for you. It's bad enough you have to play through it's pathetic chapters with neverending storytelling but you must endure repeating it over and over again until you complete the level. Unless you are in prison or have no life DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! In one word \\"PAIN\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Game.... for PC","review":"Max Payne is a great in every sense of the word.

Do NOT buy this for PS2. Buy it for PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this game","review":"This was one of my favorite PS2 games to play, aside from Grand Theft Auto of course.

Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best shooter ever, but for Ps2?","review":"I have the Ps2 and love it, graphics are great and games are fun. Max Payne, however, is the greates shooter ever and is amazing in every way. The graphics require more than the Ps2 so they will have to downsize the graphics. I wouldn't buy it for the Xbox either. The graphics are a little bit better but not much. Ps2 and Xbox wouldn't be worth the money. Buy it for PC, then you can fully enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they make it for the PS2?","review":"Why buy this on the PS2. It looks horrible on the PS2. It looks so much better on the PC or wait for it to come out on the XBOX. The game itself rules and deserves game of the year honors, but whatever you do don't buy on the POS2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"For one, I never use Analog mode on my PS2 controller because it sucks so much and when I found out that this had Analog mode on automatically, you couldn't turn it off, and you couldn't use the D-Pad, I was pretty (upset). So what was the actual game like, you ask? Well I must say the graphics were pretty horrible. Max's face is so flat, he looks like an ape. This would have been fit for the Playstation and it was only put on PS2 to keep it among the newer consoles and boost it up. The plot is also mediocre and exploring just plain sucks. There are so many doors and you gotta keep checking them and checking them until you find the one with the bad guy in it. Fortunately, I rented this and now I know what game to stay away from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun at all...","review":"This game is pretty bad. The graphics look like something from an early Playstation (v.1) game, the controls are awkward, the acting is horrible, the storyline is boring, and it tries milking that cheezy Matrix style slow-mo effect for all its worth. Even if you do happen to enjoy playing the game, the gameplay is interrupted every couple of minutes for a new \\"chapter\\" and more bad story to unfold."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"this game is good but there is 1 flaw i am going to mention and is the scariest. u are playing in a dream i mean nightmear u are walking through the hall and it seems like ur getting farther away and when u get close to the black u see cloud wallpaper wit blood all over the place then u here the baby crying like it is dyeing then u get to the end of the hall and u see total darkness u have to walk on a blood trail trying to find the end of the dream. and the bad thing is u dont want to fall off the trail cause the baby will screem and cry really loud then u end up at the beginnig and u have to do it all over again poor baby"},{"rating":"2","title":"The game and the storyline are truly excellent.-by Izo","review":"\\"Max Payne\\" has the best storyline I've ever seen before. I've really never seen a game that can go that deep. The story is realistic and in many ways dramatic and sad at times, although there is some humour within the deep drama of the game. It's stylised cut sequences, excellent voice acting and comic book feel gives this game the right atmosphere.On top of that it has used ideas from \\"The Matrix\\" to produce interesting and exciting gameplay. The polished surroundings, storyline and range of weapons keeps you interested. Its something that just hasn't been seen before, a truly amazing game. I think the \\"BAFTA\\"-\\"Intereactive Entertainment Award 2001\\". Was well worth the effort. WELL DONE! To everyone involved with \\"Max Payne\\". It'll be a classic in years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREAM SCENES RUIN IT","review":"This is an outstanding game up to a certain point. Max gets drugged many times throughout the first stage and during his non-sober phase you are forced to run through this twisted, perverse, and irrelevent series of levels that really don't tie in with the style of the game. It toes the line with the Seance (spelling?) crap, but then it just goes overboard when a good time of shooting up highly dangerous mobsters is spoiled by a dumbfound chemistry that 3D Realm must have deemed necessary when introducing a devil-crazed lunatic mixed with a downright disturbing little \\"jump from one glowing path to another in a pitch black room while blood is dripping on the screen and a baby cries in the background\\" level. How that ties in to the gang war is just beyond me. Regardless of the fact they want you to experience Max's pain, I'd rather not have the future enjoyment of the game lying on some bull mandatory levels that just downright suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been alot better","review":"I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed. The controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90% was bad. The story line was basically typical, it really didn't hold my interest for long. I did beat the game because I spent $50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that. I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did. It's worth renting but definately not worth buying. Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool game!","review":"You're a cop in New York! They killed your wife and daughter and now you are mad! This is a very cool action \\"Syphon Filter\\" type of game! The story is great and the effects in this game is what sets it apart from being a syphon filter copy! The \\"bullet time\\" effect is the coolest thing I have ever seen in a video game. The slow motion matrix style action scenes, the blood and violence, and the story line make this video game play like a movie! The best way I can describe it is syphon filter meets metal gear solid! Once you get use to the controls, and I must say the only reason I didn't give this one 5 stars is because they are a little complicated, you will enjoy this game!! I can definitely see sequels coming down the road.Cool stress relieving kill everyone and ask questions later game, check this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cool Gameplay","review":"While the game is too linear for my liking, the character control is outstanding. I have a wheel-mouse and it was the perfect control for this game. This has the best controls of any first person shooter type game that I've played. There is also a slow motion mode you can go into that is very much like the bullet dodging scene in the Matrix. The cut scenes between chapters are intentionally setup in the form of a graphic novel which I found to be an interesting way to present the plot. The only real complaint I have with the game is that it's too short. I beat it in 3 or 4 days just playing a few hours a night after work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game, with one flaw","review":"This game was a good shooter, and the graphics are great.

A fugitive undercover cop framed for murder, and now hunted buy the cops and the mob. Max is a man with his back against the wall, fighting a battle he cannot hope to win.I would have to say that the story is well played out and the plot twist are Cool. I also like some of the chracters max runs into, ( one of them is a russian bad guy who has some many morals and rules it almost makes him one of good guys).If i could do some work to this game the only thing I would on is in some parts in the game I would like to work on the graphics a bit, becuase cars are not what they could be and building might look a little better is some levels.

Max payne is a very frustrating game that gives gamers a headache. Average graphics, average gameplay and horrible control. Game play becomes a very challenging task since one analog stick is for moving and the other is for aiming. Put it this way, for the hours that I spent playing this title I could never grasp the controls perfectly. Overall I recommend renting first to see if you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Ok I want to start off by saying that there must be something wrong with you if you don't enjoy this title. If you don't like it well then you probably have no appreciation for the hundreds if not thousands of hours it takes to make a masterpeice like Max Payne.Ok now that I said that I would like to inform the rest of world that you need not compare this game to GTA3 on account of it not being made by Rockstar. If you notice on the Ps2, Xbox and PC versions that Rockstar was the publisher....not the writer. There I said it. Get this game for computer if it can handle it. (...) I'm absolutley serious when I say this is a good buy. Go get it....today.....scroll back up to the top of the screen and press \\"Add to cart\\" right now. You wont be disapointed.

Don't be fooled into thinking that the graphics are high-quality by looking at the back of the case or seeing the commercial, because they are in fact slightly poor and less than satisfactory for a game designated to the PS2 console. The storyline is intelligent, and that is probably it's best attribute. The characters are somewhat blocky and you have only a little white dot used to aim at the enemies, which, at specific points in the game, becomes extremely frustrating. The characters in the movie portions of the game are not well assembled and this makes them look like their limbs are broken or something to that effect. I highly recommend that you do not purchase this title. If you want a game by Rockstar, get Grand Theft. Max Payne [stinks]."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAX PAYNE","review":"This is a great game played on Sonyplaystation2,I just bought it and can't stop playing it,it will make your heart beet faster when playing,buy it,it's worth it.............."},{"rating":"2","title":"the fun doesnt last for long","review":"This is a very fun game but it got cut kinda short.

Unfortunately, some controls do not translate as well from computer mouse (or gamepad) to PS2 as they could.I had such high hopes for this game, but I am just not able to use both analog joysticks, the L1/2 and R1/2 buttons, and the button pad at the same time. Call me uncoordinated (despite the fact that I have been playing video games since before there were home video game systems!), but I don't want to give myself carpal tunnel syndrome from playing a game!I would also like to state that \\"bullet-time\\" was a neat style of visual effect in the Matrix.

It reminds me of the Blockheads from The Gumby Show. The \\"cut scenes\\" are stupid. Its like reading a comc book. It shows what they say above their heads, and has still pictures. The controlls are even worst than the graphics. You have to use both the left and right analog stick to control the character.

Songs are pulled from a variety of Blue Note and Mercury issues.I've also looked at the French issues (chronological classics) and also was struck by their super high prices. I'd start here instead to build an Ammons collection.FYI: Windows Media Player will lookup a single CD version so you'll have to do a bit of typing of song titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"thats good, no thats bad","review":"Yes a reminiscent of that old joke thas good no thats bad.

We read it every day again and again and again.

Before I learned to read, I had someone read it to me over and over again (the Japanese version with excellent translations!). After I learned to read, I read it to myself again and again, day after day. To me, this book is a lot more exciting and entertaining than most Hollywood movies. As a child, I got the very basic idea of life from this book: THINGS JUST HAPPEN in life, good or bad, but you can keep going by quickly accepting the reality and by being natural, spontaneous, responsive, etc. The more I live, the more I like this book. To me, it is very philosophical. And it's funny, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story","review":"Enjoyed the book tremendously. My students did as well!

They actually told me even though I paid for guaranteed delivery on Dec.24th, it actually means a guarantee of 2 business days. ARE YOU KIDDING ME.

We are fans of both Angie Harmon and especially Sasha Alexander but they both feel terribly mis-cast in this series; the chemistry between Sasha and Angie feels forced. Rizzoli's parents seem equally if not more mis-cast, and I would cringed every time they had parts in an episode. The actual cases that Rizzoli and Isles have to solve seemed very generic (cue the mandatory serial killer that fixates on the main character). We had great hopes for the this show but characters where not interesting enough to keep us watching the generic plots. I give the series two stars instead of only one, because at least it isn't reality TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"KICK BUT SERIES!!!!","review":"I love this show!!!! Best tv show ever!

It is not available in the UK and I bought the DVD expecting so much and it was so disappointing. I accept that there has to be a degree of artistic license, but this doesn't come close to what I was hoping for. There is very little connection to the books. Jane married Gabriel and Maura was having a \\"relationship\\" with Father Brophy. What happened to this? I definitely won't be buying Series 2 when it is available. Angie Harmon is a great actress, but she doesn't come close to what I thought was Jane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Ia m a fan of Tess Gerritsen and i have read all of her books; this TV series is a real let down, I don't know how it can possibly make it to another season.

However that was short-lived. The ME tries to hard to sound like Temperance Brenan from Bones, completely overdoing the scientific mumbo-jumbo and ignoring intelligent responses. Then there's the usual 'let's beat the audience over the head with our liberal agenda' nonsense.We bought this series because we had seen the first couple episodes, but it went so far downhill after that, we sent it back for as a trade-in to Amazon. We should have guessed -- Made in Boston, gonna be liberal issues instead of fun story lines.If you are entertained my inane and simpleton chatter, and want some more feminist brain-washing, this might be for you.If you are tired of Hollywood trying to dictate their agenda and lack of morality, you won't be able to sit through this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Fantastic Series!","review":"Rizzoli & Isles is the best crime drama series out today.

This series combines the girl power the world loved so much in the Spice Girls with the genius of Bones and the light, yet respectful, humour of Castle.

The problem with this season is simple, and I believe obvious to any one who has seen it, there aren't enough episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I first saw Season Two on TNT, which I enjoyed. It is a great mixture of a tough cop and knowledgeable doc. These two ladies, their family and their male sidekicks make a great story. Since there are several \\"medical-person-turned-crime-solver\\" series today, this one has an edge to it that is very good. It was great to see what I had missed in Season One with this DVD set.

Leaves me wondering who is right and what exactly Mike Austin's method is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most polished of the Austin swing resources","review":"It's a shame there isn't a complete and polished reference for Mike Austin's swing theories, because his swing style is really powerful, yet effortless. This DVD is the most polished of the bunch. At least, with Austin sitting there in a lawn chair, you know the man himself approved of what was being said...always a worry with Shauger's stuff. Lots of footage of a younger Austin swinging in addition to Dunaway. It is full swing only, no 1/2 or 3/4 shots. I'd call this DVD a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"...absolutely essential !!!","review":"Dunaway's explanations (not to mention demonstrations) are as clear as anyone could desire.

That is the task of the author as he takes the reader across the United States in search of this most average of all people.

Throughout the book the author narrows his search by expanding his criteria as tries to find this person by finding an average town, a commonly named street, an average religious belief, average marital relationship, etc. He even finds several very interesting relationships such as the average person lives within two miles of a park, three miles of a McDonalds and twenty minutes of a Wal-Mart.

Unfortunately, the heels on these shoes are as wide as the front of the shoe, and I could not lace them up enough to keep the heels from slipping. I have never seen such a wide heel on any shoe. Why do shoe makers assume your entire foot is wide? These shoes might work for someone with swollen feet or a very wide foot all over, but they did not fit me at all in the heel. They are not as clunky as many wide shoes, and the leather was soft. I am returning the shoes, and continuing my quest for a wide, decent-looking shoe with a normal heel width."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorites","review":"I have worn Easy Spirit AP1's for years. I have bony ankles and these shoes are cut low, so as not to hit the bones. They have great traction and the leather lasts and lasts. I generally pay $70, so $53 is a great price. The white leather does get dirty. You can throw them in the washer. (NOT the dryer, of course). I have found that they can be polished with the good, old fashioned \\"Hollywood Sani-White\\" that we used to use for children's and nurses' white leather shoes. (Shake well before using!) This does get chalky, so I then buff them and spray on a clear polish. I've removed the sockliner and replaced it with magnetic insoles. My feet and knees never hurt anymore.

There is no bibliography at all, and whatever occasional footnote one might find is merely Woolley elaborating on his own thoughts. I do not remember Wooley once referring to a particular archaeological find or text that is supposed to support his ideas, other than a vague mentioning of the famous Stele of Hammurabi, and in this case he provides no physical data. The book has nothing to offer anyone who wants to seriously research the Sumerians for the purpose of drawing independent conclusions. The book might be interesting to those who simply want to hear Woolley ramble about his interpretation of what happened in the time of the Sumerians and what life was like for them, but even then the book is no use as Woolley's theories are dated, inaccurate, and unsupported.This is not scholarship.

The cinematography is excellent, and the story is chilling and heart-breaking. It puts the shameful horror of the holocaust into personal stories of all sides.The fact that this miniseries is not available on DVD is unfortunate; I think many would like to watch this again, or for the first time. While the subject matter is depressing, it's important for all of us to face even the most unpleasant episodes in human history, to feel kinship with those harmed, and to be aware of the danger of this horror repeating itself.Highly recommended, if you can find a copy. Please bring this out on DVD soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holocaust DVD Review","review":"I first saw this series as a 9 year old on TV in 1979 and I really loved it back than. At that age, most of the ideas of the series went straight over my head. I have seen the series on DVD in 2008 and this is really awesome. It's really worth watching. And also serves as a really good example of history coming to life on TV too.Another thing. On TV, this series ran for 9.5 hours. On DVD (and VHS) it runs for 7.5 hours. The quantity 60 * 7.5 / 9.5 gives 47.4 . ie 47.4 minutes of TV show per hour and 12.6 minutes of adverts per hour. The legal maximum of TV adverts per hour is 13 minutes here in Australia. I guess it's the same in the USA as well. This calculation assumes that on TV, Holocaust was interrupted by adverts. Being on NBC, I think this would be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give this ten stars if I could","review":"Suspend your disbelief that one family could be involved in every major event of the Holocaust. The point is this is an outstanding mini-series with performances by actors that have gone on to become some of the best of their generation, most notably Meryl Streep. I first saw it as a TV mini-series and have revisited it several times in the intervening years. Each time I watch the series, I see new facets within the production that I did not focus on previously or come away with a clearer understanding of events during this horrific time period.

He would treat people really bad, that don't have blond hair and blue eyes by not giving them food or anything. The people that got treated really bad had more work to do and if they did something bad they would get burn or shot. They would separate the girls from the boys they would each be in a different side. Also they would separate the families. They would die without food and water. There were billions of people that would died and get burned or berried underground.

My younger self came away with the impression that Jewish sufferings were placed above those of other victims of WWII.

Indeed, the 1970's was the time that placed the Holocaust in a dominant position in US culture and education.

This mini-series was quite below par when compared with those two series. One can see why good writing is important to a mini-series and why Holocaust fell miserably short in this endeavor. I also didn't understand why the director had some of the key Nazi roles (Dorf, Heydrich, & Eichman) played so one-dimensionally. The actors chosen to portray Heydrich & Eichman didn't even begin to look like their characters, much less present a performance that would make you believe them as such.After watching a couple hours, my wife and I put the DVD back into its container and saved ourselves from further misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holocaust","review":"There is no better tribute and drama depicting this horribly awful era in mankind.

The series shocked many Germans and was a great success. I waited quite a while for the release of this series that I loved. It was moving and realistic. It was one of the best performances of Streep and James Woods. I was disappointed with quality of production. The picture was not as sharp as most 1940's conversions from film to digital format. Also the missing segments left the series disjointed. The transition form one scene to the next made no sense. Who ever did this release did not do a favor to this wonderful series.

The people appeared to be clean shaven, wore clean clothes and never looked like they had missed a meal. The depiction of the barracks in the camps appeared to be clean and spacious. It didn't leave the feeling that this was a truly terrible place to be, more of a summer camp type environment. Perhaps it was the best production that they could do 30 years ago but there are more realistic historicals available today that give a more accurate idea of what the life was really like.

The tapestry is woven of the doctor and his stalward wife as his family and extended family is removed, one by one, from the face of human history.

Can't blame the campaign as much as the media who eagerly lapped it up...the large corporate media the right wing so often called \\"liberal.\\" What b.s. These large multinational corporations are big business. Big business who #1 want the government to get off their backs, and #2, LOVE having free stuff from Bush's staff...they don't have to pay for the pretty images.

While RHV can definitely hold a mix down live, this CD is completely lacking in any character or demonstration of skill. News flash to everyone who enjoys the 'super fast mixing': this CD was constructed almost entirely in the studio. If you're going to cheat and rapidly layer tracks on top of each other this quickly, at least show some skill and pitch-adjust the vocals to match the track you've bastardized into a 15-second blurb before cutting the final copy.

I imagine it would support itself fine in a large roast, but It sure doesn't work in a chicken, or in a turkey, or in a pork tenderloin. So I can't even say whether it actually tells the temperature accurately or not, because it's never yet been in the oven. What's the point of having a meat thermometer if you have to have ANOTHER meat thermometer to use for all the times this one doesn't work?

After a while, we decided to use a second probe (one that cannot stay in the oven) to compare. Luckily we did, because the second probe registered close to 130 degrees. We left the Polder probe in and continued cooking a little longer. All in all, the Polder probe was about 20 degrees lower than our second probe. Dinner was saved by relying on our second probe.

These were well worth the risk. Very easy to mold to ear. I followed the direction to the letter, but added about 20% more time than the directions say. I had no issues with anything. They molded perfectly and are very easy to put back in. I'm guessing some people got bad batches or they just didn't follow the directions because these couldn't have been any easier to do. These are a very good product and I am very satisfied with the purchase. Highly recommend. FYI - there is a video on the radians web site or youtube to watch someone do the process.

Totally useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, poor product","review":"I read all the negative reviews and thought those people must be doing something wrong. I purchased two sets of earplugs. The first time it didn't work. Never set up when I separated into two portions for each ear. With the second one I bought, I thought I would mix everything together and try both ears together. I let them sit in my ears for about 35 minutes. Still no change. I put them on the counter and left for a few hours. When I came back it had set up. For them saying it only takes 10 minutes, that is wrong. If you buy this, expect to sit a long time, unless you are a lucky one and it worked right for you the first time. I tried it twice and it still did not work properly.I have researched this type of product. You can find this through craft suppliers for making molds. I am going to try that route and see if it works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't seal well enough","review":"Really isn't giving much protection since I couldn't get it to seal well.

They do work well, but they are not as pictured or described by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disregard the negatives","review":"I've been using Hearos \\"soft\\" earplugs for about a year for sleeping and concerts, but they cause my ears to hurt after a while. I've resorted to cutting them down to make them even thinner, but they get lost and dirty fairly easy. The Radians earplugs are a great step up. They cured great, and block out more sound than the Hearos. I was hoping they would be a little softer, but they actually don't hurt my ears even when I sleep on them (with my head on it's side). I only discarded about a quarter of the material. I don't think I would have had enough to make two pairs. I kept my mouth closed during the curing process, and they seem to fit just fine. I would recommend these over any disposable or non-custom earplugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Well For Me - Recommended","review":"Radians \\"Custom Molded Earplugs\\" were recommended to my son and I by other members of our local Trap Shooting club and we picked these up at a nearby specialty store. I am really glad we didn't see all of the negative reviews posted here or we might have passed on this decent product. Here are my observations:+ Easy To Follow Directions; simple and straight forward, wash your hands and clean your ears out, divide the two different types of putty in half, mix half of each together very thoroughly, mold into ear, wait at least 10 minutes, and remove. Repeat with the rest of the putty for the second ear+ Good Protection; provides enough attenuation for Trap shooting+ Plenty of Putty; enough for two setsThese work well for us and wouldn't hesitate to get more if we need them.Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"1","title":"They never set","review":"Followed the directions exactly. Washed my hands and ears (the directions said to do that). Left them in my ears for 40 minutes (no kidding). When I tried to remove them they were just as soft as when I put them in.

However, I followed the instructions and left my mouth open about 1\\" while curing and it creates an excellent seal.I did not use this product as directed as I added headphones. The sound quality is excellent and my ears don't hurt from using the universal plugs. I now wear these all the time under my helmet while riding my motorcycle.Product claims 27dB NRR. I think the best ear plugs are rated at 30dB noise reduction. This doesn't seem like a lot, but note that sound can travel through any ear plugs or through your bones. I've used the 30dB NRR ear plugs and they were not comfortable. This product is very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"This product is difficult to work with.

No more discomfort from foam plugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works pretty well, just wish it was a little softer","review":"The reasons I'm not giving this 5 stars is because 1) it should come with screws and a string and 2) the putty isn't quite soft enough. I have to really mash it in to get a good fit. 3) Additionally I have larger ears and there isn't quite enough putty.Other than that, this is a great product. It dries super fast and of course fits ears perfectly. I've ended up buying extra so I can make new molds with more putty. I want it a little deeper in the ear and more coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"radians custom earplugs","review":"I was looking for a custom moldable earplug for my bluetooth. Everyone knows what the downside of using the earplugs that come with every bluetooth out there right? So I found this product. It is a 2 part putty much like epoxy, You knead equal parts together then mold it into the ear cavity. Well...after the material cures, the material is still pliable but it doesn't stay together and finally starts to crumble apart. I could not use this product for my intended use let alone for earplugs.the idea is great but I definitely would not recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!!","review":"The bad review had to be a bad batch.

I did 40% white and 60% colored as well as 40% colored with 60% white. All 3 mixes never set up even after letting them sit overnight and trying gently warming them for about 30 minuts at 150 in the oven.It seems like their quality control is just crap, don't risk it.

The instructions noted to leave in ear for a minimum 10 minutes to start the cure them remove if ready - with an additional 3 hours of curing before storage.

After 45 minutes they were still runny, about the consistency of gum. I removed them, which wasn't easy, and placed them back in the original containers. After 3 days it's still like Silly Putty.

I purchased these to use as for the intended purpose and followed the directions exactly, but the mixture failed to cure in my ear. The horrible thing is that once it is even at the entrance of your ear canal but still \\"pasty\\" it is impossible to get out without working at least some deeper into your ear. Long story short, one $150 emergency room visit, and a follow up with my regular doctor later in the week is what this ultimately costed me. I could have gone to a professional and had some made for less than that! As an adult I should have listened to my gut and stopped before putting silly putty in my ear.

My son really loves construction and asks a lot of questions. He takes what he learns and plays outside by digging and building.

They are unbalanced between lows and highs, you end up getting both extremes. The speakers crackle some times. In terms of construction, the sub is uncovered on the bottom so it can be easily damaged. The speakers and sub are lightweight. That may be an advantage and disadvantage.

On a positive note, they looked nice and had decent sound quality considering the cost. For $20, they seemed like a fine investment and I was a happy camper for several months.

There is also no control over bass level. The satellite speakers crack with high pitched sounds and sound terrible without the sub. Spend $80 and get the Boston Acoustics Horizon MM226 2.1.

From the get go, when the speakers were on, I would hear faint radio music and I would get occasional clicking/screeching noises. Now I just get screeching/static like noises about every few seconds. It's so distracting to be on a phone call with all the background noise coming from the speakers, not to mention, its really difficult to hear the person over the sounds the speakers make.

The sound is under-toned, but very clear. I got the white-gray version for my laptop and the black version for my desktop computer. Get the black ones, much more sleeker and simple.

The subwoofer on that system shakes the floor! This one doesn't do that but, it does have nice clear sound. I paid about $10.00 more for a system that had a subwoffer. It was well worth the money.

As others have noted, the speakers pick up radio frequency interference. Mine make a -loud- and very alarming noise a fraction of a second before my cell phone rings or gets a text message. They also make a strange sound when airplanes fly overhead. Additionally, I get a low hum from them when music is not playing.Since these are not sheilded, they may also cause problems (interference) with CRT monitors, but I cannot verify this as I have LCD's.All in all, I would definitely NOT recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"They pick up the noise from electrical currents as soon as you turn them on.

Wrong!The sound quality is so-so. Not terrible, but not too great either. The mids are not full enough, which perhaps is expected from speakers of this price range. The subwoofers are reasonable. Overall, the sound quality, while not great, are still deserving of 4 stars because of the price factor.The reason I am giving it 2 stars is the ANNOYING sound it makes every few minutes, just before a cell phone is going to ring, or there is some electrical disturbance, and sometimes for reasons unknown to me (perhaps a cell phone 20 feet away!). There is no shielding whatsoever. The noise is highly disturbing, and EXTREMELY loud (it doesnt matter if the speaker volume is turned down). I was actually woken up from sleep last night by a terrible screech it made around 1 AM. In short, it has made the speakers unusable for my purposes and I am going to return them today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound for my needs.","review":"I bought these speakers to use with my laptop in a small work area at home.

This book is 134 pages and 15 of those pages are synopsis and opinion on OTHER self-help books.If you read the original works instead of this ludicrous summary you will get far more out of it.

The authors present in one manageable volume lessons from the top 20 time management books on the amazon.com website. The book is divided into 6 sections and 25 short chapters covering diverse subjects such as identifying one's own values, writing a mission statement, organizing living and work spaces, overcoming procrastination and managing stress. In addition, there are helpful reviews of the 20 time management books the authors chose along with reviews of other helpful books such as Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, one of my personal favorites.

Everything else was just fine. None of our other DVDs have this problem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Sexy!","review":"I watched An American in Paris last night and was delighted with the movie! Gene Kelly had sex appeal and a great smile. His dancing was incredible and energetic. Leslie Caron was sweet. The clothes she wore were very attractive so French! Finally, the score contained most of my favorite Gershwin tunes. They don't make them like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Kelly","review":"This is one of Gene Kelly's greatest movies. The dancing is so fantastic. Leslie Caron was absolutely perfect for the role. I saw this movie when it first premiered and it still is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Musical","review":"I found this film to be average. I find most musicals (especially MGM productions) to be tedious, so that probably contributes to my lack of enthusiasm for it. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is Gershwin's great music. For fun with friends, or by yourself, wait for the \\"An American in Paris\\" ballet at the end of the film. When the section comes on, where Gene Kelly is dressed in an off-white outfit, and wearing a Ty Cobb style baseball hat, watch with the sound off."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED AND BORING MUSICAL","review":"I am a HUGE musical fan especially the musicals of yesteryear but I have always considered this film to be boring. Gene Kelly always irritated me - a fantastic dancer and singer but he never had any talent for acting and he lacked masculinity."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most enjoyable musicals I have seen.","review":"I was never a huge musical fan, but this movie changed my mind. It has everything- light heartedness, sadness, a sweet and simple love story. I found the ballet a little overwhelming, but interesting both as a dance, and as an imaginative use of French painters' work. Each section of the ballet is in the style of a different painter: Dufy, Renoir, Lautrec, Van Gogh, etc., choreographed by Kelly, who does an incredible job. The movie has something that makes you able to watch it again and again--if only for the exuberance of I Got Rhythm and 'SWonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"GENE KELLY AT HIS BEST - WONDERFUL MUSICAL","review":"This film has eveything going for it: great Gerswhin music, great visuals, the beauty of Paris (despite being filmed on a backlot), a fine script, the lovely Leslie Caron, the humorous Oscar Levant, the amazing talent of Gene Kelly, a still-breathtaking 17 minute ballet, choreographed by Kelly, at the film's climax, and ROMANCE!

I thought it would be like Singing in the Rain, which is one of my favorite musicals. Instead, I get cheesy acting, overproduction, a sub-average dialogue, and the worst plot for any musical I've ever seen. The music was commendable, which is why I give it two stars. But the dance numbers and the movie in general are so overproduced, it's practically megalomaniacal. As stated above, the acting and dialogue are boring. And not only is the story beyond cliche, but in the end the guy gets the girl for no reason we can think of, in the most vile Hollywood ending ever. Stick with The Music Man instead. Or Singing in the Rain. Or Showboat. Just not this . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This film starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron is the greatest musical of all times . the romance is not sappy,and it has great songs and dance numbers the music is also written by George and Ira Gershwin and 15 minute record holding dance number and it won seven oscars including Best Picture \\"Who could ask for anything more\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"ohhh baby! i luv this movie","review":"!!!I freaking luv this movie so much, I cant get enough of it!!!

It has so much going for it - great music, dancing and cast. The music is by George and Ira Gershwin and of course it never hurts to have Vincente Minnelli as director.The film marks the Hollywood debut of Leslie Caron and she makes the most of it. Oscar Levant is mostly himself with several memorable lines such as this particularly self-deprecating one: \\"It's not a pretty face, I grant you, but underneath its flabby exterior is an enormous lack of character.\\"AN AMERICAN IN PARIS won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Story and Screenplay, Color Cinematography, Color and Direction, Score for a Musical Picture and Color Costume Design. The main competition for awards in 1951 came from THE AFRICAN QUEEN, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and A PLACE IN THE SUN."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever","review":"Has to be one of the top musicals of all time. Basic story line of guy meets, loses, regains girl enhanced by masterful choreography by Gene Kelly. The 18 minute ballet at the movie's end is, I believe, THE finest recording of dance. The director knew where to place the cameras so the dancer's moves were properly captured; I think Kelly had a lot of input into that.The sublime simplicity of the dance by the river, the innate storytelling of the ballet... in short, this movie cannot be missed by anyone with a love of dance. (Some of) the songs and Oscar Levant's piano fantasy aren't too shabby, either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"Gift to dtr. for Christmas, she's seen it before, but wanted it to watch over and over.

I am convinced that watching this film has taken years off my life. I have lost sleep contemplating the depths of this film's poor quality. I would think that the extremely talented Gene Kelly would not have even wanted to be associated with the same studio that produced this film, let alone star in it. What astounds me even more is that those who have seen it do not scorn this film, instead they actually praise it and have the audacity to call it a classic and a masterpiece. I am truly appalled by anyone who likes this film. It's not even that I do not care for musicals, Singin' in the Rain is my favorite film of any genre. If you have not seen this film, or only have vague recollections of the ballet sequence, it is not to late to save yourself from the worst cinematic experience one could have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A viewer in Hell","review":"I am a great fan of Gene Kelly, however this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have painfully sat through Earnest Goes to Camp. The script is horrendous, and Gene Kelly's character is repulsive, chauvinistic, and blatantly impertinent . In the movie he tells Leslie Caron's character \\"With a binding like yours people are going to want to know what's in the cover.\\" The famous ballet sequence is remarkable but it is too little too late to save this pointless and obnoxious movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY IS THIS FILM REGARDED AS A CLASSIC?","review":"Why this film has been regarded as a classic is beyond me ? I am a great lover of musicals but this film bored me completely. Even seeing it again in recent years my opinion hasn't changed. I have always loved seeing Leslie Caron on film and also on stage but the real problem with this film is Gene Kelly. The guy may have been a superb singer and dancer (I have no complaints in this regard) but as as actor he was pathetic. Before you criticise me just watch any one of his films and study his acting - there isn't any."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American in Pain!","review":"Wow. I am great fan of musicals and I think Gene Kelly is extremely talented. HOWEVER! This film was indeed THE WORST I've seen him in. The plot, characters, music, and even dancing completely failed to entertain. The \\"amazing 17 minute dance sequence\\" I was made to look forward to was absolute torture! We continued watching it in hopes that something wonderful would happen. Painfully, it extended AT LEAST 17 minutes, pounding out the same obnoxious tune. The dancing all began to look the same and I was ever so pleased to find that the movie ended shortly after. Stick with Kelly's good stuff - Singing in the Rain, On the Town, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pardon MGM's French","review":"Thanks to its lengthy ballet finale, visual homage to French painters and Gershwin score, some people (or at least Oscar voters) apparently mistook this for some kind of high art in the early Fifties. Today, it is simply hoity-toity snob torture of the worst kind and damn near unwatchable. Kind of telling that whenever the movie is excerpted in tributes today, the only scene you ever see is a few minutes of that endless dance sequence at the end.

Additionally, it is a sad commentary on the field of horror today. Barker is fast becoming a parody of himself: his bookending \\"stories\\" in Revelations, if you can call these underplotted and overpretentious works \\"stories,\\" are foolish and dumb, as is every story here with the exception of Richard Christian Matheson's story, which stands out like a jewel in a pile of garbage. In general, these stories are unconnected except in vague ways, are poorly written (even Joe Lansdale's story is pretty crappy, which quite surprised me), and are self-important to the point of hilarity. For true horror, read Thomas Ligotti or Kim Newman. For contemporary dreck that almost makes Ann Rice look decent (quite an achievement, believe me), try this weighty book of self-important nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes that was bad","review":"Words fail me, which is not usual at all.

The story takes place at the Citadel in Charleston, SC. Will McLean, is a basketball player who, despite having mixed feelings about the institute, has established three extremely close friends and has found a niche as the Captain of the basketball team his senior year. Things start going astray when he is asked by \\"The Bear\\", the disciplinary Dean, to watch out for the first Black cadet to be allowed to enroll in the school (in the mid 1960s). In trying to protect the young man from unjust hazing and torture, Will comes upon a secret organization known as \\"The Ten\\". His knowledge of the organization puts him and his roomates in great danger, as Will faces challenges that nearly break him. This book is not only beautifully written, but is Conroy's most intense. It is certainly one of the best books I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's not another one like it","review":"This is my first book review on Amazon. How should I describe this fabulous book? As far as novels go, nothing really compares to it. Conroy writes literature, not cheap Grisham or Patterson-like fodder. There are scenes in this book that are etched in my mind forever. Like another reviewer, I want to tell friends and strangers alike that they should read this book. The experience Conroy describes is brutal and yet Will McLean emerges a true Institute Man. It is the one book that I have read that had me laughing on one page, almost crying on another, and so angry at the end I wanted to kill some of the characters. I've read all of Conroy's books and Lords of Discipline is the very best. You will not regret reading this work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This book is great.

The characters were well developed, and I felt that I really understood them and their motivations and the love-hate relationship they had with the Institute. Some parts were very hard to read, and since the author actually graduated from the Citadel I imagine much of the story is close to an accurate depiction of life there at that time. Another reason I liked the book so much is because of the rich descriptions of life in Charleston, S.C where the book is set.

This is one of the best books I've read in years. Together with other books of Pat Conroy that I've read, The Water is Wide and Prince of Tides, a heroic character emerges - someone who triumped over trials of agonizing proportions, who was gifted with life events that made for a gripping story, and the ability to tell that story with literary flair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely riveting","review":"This was a fantastic book. I enjoyed it all the way through, but towards the end, I absolutely could not put it down. I just spent the entire day curled up in a chair reading it; I had to find out what happened.

He has a style of writing where he, just as most passionate writers, get caught in the moment and lyrically write from the heart. McLean's experience through military school is something that everyone should read. Even if you are not the least bit interested in the military or it's politics, one can still learn something from this novel morally based on honor, entrapment, betrayal, friendship, and life change. I reccomend this book to both men and women who want to be moved by a page turning, eye watering, and heart opening novel.Thank you,Pat Conroy for giving me the knowledge of how brutal life can be, and thank you for an experience I was able to learn about. You are a brave soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from a high school senior","review":"The Lords of Discipline is an entertaining and educational work of literarty art. Pat Conroy smoothly ties together all the essential elements of a good read: enthralling conflict, realistic character development, page turning mystery, bittersweet romance, laugh-out-loud humor, and heart warming friendship. This jewel of a novel may sound too good to be true, but I urge you to find out just how great it is. In addition to thoroughly enjoying this book, I gained a better understanding for the way of life at military schools, as Conroy shares from his first hand experience at the Citadel. He feeds his interesting veiws and insights to us through the main character Will Mclean, who is a lovable, intricate guy. Aside from plot and characters, Conroy's lyrical style is enough to draw you in alone, especially in his indepth descriptions of Charleston,SC.

Jasper becomes indebted to a wizard, and helps him figure out who beheaded the blacksmith's assistant and the king's envoy. This isn't all the book has in store though, but I shall tell you no more on this topic. I gave this book 5 stars because it was a mystery, a personal favorite of mine.

They are advertised as a childproofing product but could be useful to anybody who has a freestanding TV and is worried about tipping. They apply easily and seem to hold quite well- an adhesive pad seems like a weak bond, but keep in mind that these straps must resist pulling/dragging motions and not lifting; for this task an adhesive pad is excellent.The straps are an unobtrusive black that matches the piano finish on contemporary electronics, if your TV is in a cabinet of any kind they will pretty much disappear.

I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to know more about the Middle East and the history."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot and characters are neither believeable nor plausible","review":"As one who loves to read about Israel's heroic triumphs over the Arabs, I bought this book and drooled all the way home, just couldn't wait to devour it. The first few chapters were actually intriguing, very down-to-earth, and even funny -- if you're familiar with Israel's annoying bueaurcracy, the part about the tourist's troubles in getting his brand-new Porsche into the country should be amusing. Unfortunately, the plot eventually gets too close to being a cheap soap opera. I never actually finished the book because I simply could not stand the love affairs, the melodramaticism of the characters, the fact that they were all famous and good looking and important -- it was all too damn Hollywood. I was truly disappointed. What I thought would be an intriguing historical fiction novel turned into a mush of a romance. pulp fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good look at the last 50 years of Israeli life/history","review":"In \\"The Hope\\" & \\"The Glory\\", Wouk portrays the birth of the State of Israel, its turbulent coming of age and its development as America's staunchest ally in the Middle East, warts and all. Real people populate the books as well as Wouk's fictitious characters. For those of us who have never been to the Holy Land or who never experienced the Holocaust firsthand, you can't help but walk away from these books with a better understanding of why Israel is so important to Jews around the world. The reader also develops a working knowledge of the behind-the-scenes machinations of the Israeli and American leaders during the many Middle East crises of the last 50 years. I have been a fan of Wouk's for 40 years and was amazed at the lack of publicity these two books received when first published (I came across them by accident while browsing in a bookstore)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Surfski Kayaking","review":"I've been using this for about four years now.

The characters were wooden and one dimensional---I couldn't even sympathize with the heroine, Lauren--no matter what she went through. The supporting characters were not well developed at all, and the ending was predictable and flat and truth be told---totally disgusting. Andrew Billings also need have someone proof his story. Lauren, the protagonist was a vegan, she wore cloth Keds and hemp sandles because she abhorred leather, got rid of her Rover because of the leather seats, yet midway through the story she whips out her leather checkbook to pay her protector, Matt.

Unlike pokemon, the idea for staying in one spot and training and battling one monster at a time is way better. You take a monster, ethier from a household CD or DVD, or from collecting disc pieces in the game and getting a monster, then you take it home and give it training excersises. It soon will become strong and loyal enough to put it in battle with another monster. It will ethier win or lose, and ethier way you gain stats of experience. If it wins, you take home a trophy, money, and be able to compete in a tournament of a higher level. If you lose, well, let's just say your monster needs more training.I'd say that this game has awesome graphics, very good gameplay, and a decent addiction level. The only problem is that some of the songs can get really annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"only missing two things...","review":"I would have given this 5 stars but.... It has no way to breed the Monsters together like you could in the first two games.I love the new faster battles you seem to have much more control and the Graphics are almost perfect almost like you are watching a cartoon.

I do like this very much though."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cute, but...","review":"This game is pretty cute. It's graphics are a little lame compared to what they are supposed to be being it is a PS2 game, but I guess that's what they do to you when your only so young. One main problem I had with this game is that it is incredibly boring. Every 5 minutes or so it supposedly a \\"new\\" day, and every day you train your monster. Every month you feed it, and every season you go venturing. It's really practically the same thing ever 20 min or so, and the only differences is when you battle and when you move on to a new training land. Really, I don't think that you should get it unless your child is really easily amused."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Game","review":"this game is fun. there are new monsters to unlock, the battle system is good, and the story line is good too. but lolocking monsters can take a long time if you have alot of C.D's.

It's got everything in one!!! A bit of rpg in venture, lods of strategy, it's go the action in the battles, and there's constant adventure. The only reason I gave this game 4* instead of 5* is because the game is repetitive. Not too much but not too little.E.G.The attacks always show the same movement, same with the training session. but you get to chose from 5 different continents to train on and you can move from 1 continent to another.So rent before you by because there are some people who simply hate these types of games.(very few I hope, I loved it!);)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Very very boring. This game is mostly about reading. You sit there and read and read and read what the characters are saying. When the characters finally shut up, you're left with nothing to do. You feed the monster, you make him sleep, and you 'raise' him. Neither the game nor the instruction book tell you what buttons on the controller that you must push in the battle sequences.

I had a hard time putting them up straight and keeping out the bubbles. Make sure your windows are not cold when you apply them, otherwise they won't stick.I like them because, like I said, they kept the sun out of my son's eyes, but they are an eyesore. At least from the inside of the car. Maybe that's my fault, I don't know.I wish they could make these like real static cling that you can dip into water then squeegee them onto the window.Also, be careful when you look behind you, when you change lanes.

I may have a bubble or two under my shade, but it works great and is easy to see through - much better than the blasted roller shade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy install, but too dark","review":"I purchased these to install on the rear window of my sedan.

Yes, it is as difficult to handle as that.

In fact, I trimmed and fitted it to the top half of that window so the shade hugs the top edge. Neither the top trimmed edge fitting into the window frame nor the bottom edge sliding into the door has lifted, notched, slid, or shown any other defect. The shade trimmed easily and neatly by applying it to the slightly-lowered window and running a razor at an angle along the edge of the glass to slice it flush.Since installation, the shade has remained secure and attractive through innumerable complete rolls up and down. It's been about eight months now, without incident, and I still have a full spare and a half out of the two-pack in case I do need to replace it. My morning commute with the sun directly from my left side is no longer torture, and all for the effort of ten minutes and four bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough","review":"Long and short of it - I'm getting my windows professionally tinted tomorrow. This screen just isn't enough for a rear-facing baby, who's frequently blinded by sun coming through the rear window, and around the edges of this screen. If you have a rear-facing infant and won't be in the back seat to monitor the sun on her face, I'd recommend professional tinting. If you have an older child facing forward and are looking to save money ($4 vs $250) then this screen is probably a fine place to start. In fact, I wouldn't be convinced that it's essential to get my windows tinted if I hadn't tried this shade first.But if you are going to use it and want the sun well blocked, you might buy two and cut extra strips to fit around the edges because quite a bit of light comes through around the top and sides of this shade, since it's not fitted exactly to your windows. It looks ugly, but isn't a bad temporary solution (e.g. for grandparents having the kids for the summer, or that sort of thing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stick on","review":"You are better off getting the ones with suction cups.

I cleaned my windows and then applied the shades. They went on easy since it is rolled up on a foam tube, which also helps create static that it needs to cling to the window. I've had in on my car for 2 months now during the summer, which has been in the high 80's and 90's. Other shades i've used have fallen off in just a couple hours in the sun. I also like that I can roll down the windows with the shade still on. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"My 8 year old 'vampire' son kept hissing in the backseat of my car that the sun is shining in his face and it was pretty annoying. I bought this because of the price, but didnt read through the reviews or the item description as to how it really is. It looks like cheap black thick plastics wrap, but it does the job.

Simple to install and just as effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you paid for.","review":"Well, I know I paid less than $10 for this product. I placed it on my windshield based on the instructions provided and there were air bubbles everywhere. It's really sticky so you must be extremely careful as to not damage the cheap plastic. It's almost impossible to get rid of those air bubbles. I drove my vehicle for about 2 weeks with it on. You can see outside but it's very difficult for others to see inside unless they look very closely. Which, I really liked..

I simply don't have the patience to adjust and readjust. That being said, it did serve it's purpose, and that's reducing the amount of sun that gets to my son, but my biggest problem with it is that it is very dark. I read the reviews of others, and thought I would be able to handle the darkness. It was only installed on the back driver side window. But after driving with it for a few days, i found myself checking and re-checking my blind spot. Maybe it just takes getting used to...but I've since removed it.

Basing a manga and then anime on basketball was a brilliant idea and Sakaragi may only be a self proclaimed basketball genius but this show really is genius.In fact the only bad thing I can say about this series is nothing to do with the series itself but the lacklustre release of it. If this DVD release had proper subtitles and not subtitles for the hard of hearing it would be my favourite release of all time (The Japanese voices are far superior in range of expressions) but there is nothing more annoying than seeing the word panting appear on screen every time someone runs or growls whenever they growl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature","review":"Lame Lame Lame.

As a Financial/Estate Planning professional who has worked with CPA's for many years, this book has really helped me work smarter with the CPA's that I work with. I have shared Nick's book with every new CPA that joins our organization. Nick's theme throughout the book is, \\"the client always comes first\\", and that your not going to sell them anything until you know exactly what they need and what their goals are.

This only covers through The Sum of All Fears (his sixth novel), so it's a little dated. But it's still worth taking a look at since this first group of books is certainly Clancy's best. It begins with an analysis of each of those first six novels. Next comes a big section of Q&A with Clancy where he gives his views on foreign policy, gun control, and all sorts of issues. Then there's a glossary/reference section which defines important characters, military equipment, technology, etc. in his books.

Also, I have noticed an odd taste when I use it in anything heated. Once, when making whipped cream, after scraping the bowl I tasted the whipped cream off the spatula and it was definitely what had made my other food items taste off. I don't use the spatula very often now. I have better luck with my Le Creuset spatulas and my Williams-Sonoma ones as well. So with a weird taste and smell I'd have to say two thumbs down.

I do have to admit that there were funny parts to this book, and I actually kind of liked the ending (despite the fact that a lot of the events leading to it were highly unrealistic). But, it was actually painful to get through the entire middle portion of the story! I was very disappointed in this book. Unless you are a HUGE Jenny Colgan fan, I wouldn't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny Until It Falls Off The Rails","review":"\\"Talking to Addison\\" begins as a very quirky, funny, British read, with its protagonist, Holly Livingstone, spewing one liners about and insults to her insane flatmates, coworkers, and the world in general. The author does well in establishing the novel's place and in creating Holly's voice and, to a certain extent, her friends. However, the characters and the subject are all things we've seen and read before, in more successful ways. Holly and her cohorts remain two-dimensional, underemployed, disillusioned twentysomethings. As for the plot, it carries along nicely until the final third where it completely goes off into a far-fetched farce. While the last act holds a few smiles, all I could do was wonder where Addison's mother was in all of this mess, as she completely disappears at the most crucial time. The novel becomes unbelievable and loses any of its earlier charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun little romp through the world of computers and amour","review":"\\"Talking to Addison\\" was a really good read, and a fun one. The book is set in England and has a lot of British bite to it, which I always enjoy!This is the story of a girl who is unlucky in her choice of roommates, often unlucky at work, and also unlucky in love, and the story of how it all gets turned around.The story is full of laughs, full of \\"D'oh!\\"s, and at times poignant and serious. I enjoyed the book very, very much and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good purchase","review":"What can i say ...

It looks good, fits very tight in the 12v receptacle and I like the color indicating charge state. The end that plugs into the phone has a 90 degree elbow and on my w385 it puts the cord what i would consider upside down. That makes it get in the way of the vent mounted cell phone holder I bought at Wal-Mart, but it works fine with the other one I have, an S-Type I bought at an auto store. That said I think the fault lies with the cell phone holder, the sides are way too wide and make it impracticle.

The author made this book highly readable, while still being careful with his information. If he was not 100% sure of a piece of information, he would say so and present the reader with two different ways of looking at it.This book also contained great summaries of each and every one of her movies, starting with the silent years and moving all the way up to her infamous science fiction flicks.All through the book, Quirk gives us the bare facts, some of which are quite shocking and do show Joan's dark side. In the end, however, Joan comes through as a good human being, but more importantly as a great actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Very Long Slanted Movie Review","review":"Buy this book ONLY if you would like to read a very very long and very slanted (sometimes bitchy) movie review of Crawford's films.

OK, so they wanna refute Christina ... but, geez, guys, how about a little objectivity? Or new information? Or how about some photos that have not been used and re-used in every Crawford book since the Jazz Age?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fair and Balanced","review":"I am a 22 year old college graduate. This gift was given as a graduation present and I was excited. It had some interesting facts in it about her movies but the book is totally biased towards joan. She's painted as a saint for the most part. It is honest in some respects like how in the movie Johnny Guitar she feuded with Mercedes Mccambridge and how she slapped and hated men that rejected her.It bashed poor Christina too much. She probably did want to be a star and like her mother but she did not deserve what happened to her. Even if she was a bad seed (like the book painted her to be) it was because joan was such a bad mother. kids learn from their parents usually. Buy it for the films only forget about what it says about tina. Its not fair and balanced but its ok for filmography fun facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately NOT the 'Essential' biography","review":"Having only recently become a Crawford fan thanks to finally getting to see \\"Whatever Happened To Baby Jane\\" (thanks Amazon!) and recently reading \\"Bette and Joan,The Divine Feud\\"... I was really looking forward to discovering much more the about the real person behind the legend and myth. Unfortunately this biography doesnt give you any of that. If you are looking for an in depth analysis of Ms Crawfords films and acting style then this is for you. Whilst I do tend to agree with the authors that 'Mommie Dearest' is very much a one sided hack job, this book does not go very far to counteract some of the stories presented by adopted daughter Christina in her biography, and present a balanced portrait of Ms Crawford flaws and all. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was very interested in the true life of Joan Crawford after seeing \\"Mommy Dearest\\". This book starts off well, but then quickly goes downhill. Describing in detail about each of her movies- such as who co-starred or what the idea of each movie was. I didn't order the book to get a movie review and that's about all it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This is the worst biography ive ever had the misfortune of reading.It provides no real insight into Joans character and is loaded(too much ) with detailed plot summaries and key scenes of ALL HER MOVIES(over 70).A brief plot symnopsis and maybe a note of key scenes of her LANDMARK MOVIES instead of all her movies would of been appropiate.There's no sense of actually getting deeper into Joan Crawford as a person.All it was was she drank out her fith of vodlka(100th proof) and carried on a affair with so and so then a LOOONG summary of her next film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hagiography--emphasis on the hag","review":"This books claims to be a serious study of Crawford's life and art--in truth it is nothing more than the gushings of two fans, one of whom clearly was one of Joan's many \\"pals,\\" willing to excuse any bad performance or ill-mannered action because they were allowed to be in her circle. The writers completely disavow any possibility that Christina Crawford told anything true in her memoir--with no more evidence to support their claim than Christina provided for hers. Their commentary on Crawford's performance is shallow, amateurish, and laughable. Shame on a university press for publishing this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best after all these years---","review":"As an avid fan of the late Joan Crawford, I did find this book disturbing. It gave me information that I had never read before. It saddened me to see what her childhood was like. No wonder she became a woman driven to succeed. When I finished reading the book, I left with a sense of sadness and regret. She was molded by her father's abandonment, her step-father's sexual appetite, and then a family who wanted the success she worked so hard to achieve. I am glad I read this book. I still appreciate the actress that I call my all-time favorite. Thank you, Joan Crawford, for everything. She had it rough, but she still persevered to be the best she could be. As a fan, I can only thank her for the years of entertainment and the excellent movies she has left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, Spain","review":"As with all Naxos Journey disks, I wish they would indicate what you are looking at in the movie.

I ended up with a nose bleed and I have never had a nose bleed in my life!! After I filled it I decided to move it to another room. When I lifted it up the top detached from the bottom after all of my hard work. We know now to only lift from the bottom. I was so tired and frustrated that I did not insert the shelves.

On top of the fact that once the baby is mobile I will probably have to throw it away because it will be dangerous to have in the room.

Do yourself a favor--spend a little more money and buy a higher quality product that will last longer and will be easier to assemble.

I thought I would like it when I added it to my registry,but was quite displeased with the amount of effort it took to try to assemble it. It was very flimsy and tedious to try to put together. My husband even expressed a few swear words. Well, we packed it back up. We didn't bother to try to finish it. We returned it and got something else off of our registry. I highly DO NOT reccommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waster your time","review":"When I went and registered for this cart, the display was pre built and looked very sturdy for the price. I received 2 for my shower and decided to keep both. I have put together many different types of plastic carts before and was not worried about this one. Well the day after my shower, we decided to start with the organizer. The directions were ok but a little confusing at first. It took 1.5 hours to assembly and the small tabs began breaking without any real force. The separator shelves never laid right and 1 wheel broke off prior to finishing all four. The idea is great but the time and effort it took to put it together and the quality; made us decide to return the 2nd cart. What a disappointment!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult","review":"Putting this thing together was an absolute nightmare. It took hours!

I CAME UP WITH AN IDEA I USED THE WHITE CABLE TIES TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN SEVERAL PLACES. I RECOMMEND CONSIDERING ANOTHER PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Frustrating","review":"We bought this because we thought it would be helpful to have an organizer for the baby stuff and it was inexpensive. We also thought we would be able to use it in the garage when we no longer needed it in the baby's room. The only thing we didn't count on was how difficult it would be to put together. My husband got terribly frustrated with it. It took quite some time to put together because it doesn't have very good instructions and the pieces don't fit together very easily. Our lid broke while the wheels were being put on the bottom. Once it's put together, you pretty much have to take it apart to change anything which is a complete waste of time, not to mention you chance breaking something in the process. The only good thing is that it is a nice little organizer, although small. While it is nice now that it's put together, we definitely would not have bought it if we knew how difficult it would be to put together in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly impossible!","review":"This was nearly impossible to get together. My hands were extremely sore after attempting to assemble this product. Just as one piece would snap together, another would come apart! I think I finally have it together, although one side of the lid that holds it in place broke off in the process. Also, I don't have the wheels on it because it is impossible to get them to snap into the clip unit. I put them on a hard surface as the instructions say to, and put all my weight on it and they will not snap in. I have tried all six of them. I just hope that once it is in place and things are put on it that it will stay together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to put together- wheels wouldn't stay on","review":"I bought this a while ago for my son. It took me a long time to put together and I had put together a crib, swing, highchair, etc. all by myself so it's not like I am incapable of following instructions. The wheels wouldn't stay on mine because I snapped a piece off when putting it together lol.

I ended up just throwing it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated Fingers","review":"This product was one of the hardest items that I have ever put together.

I bought it and left it in the box. Now that I'm closer to my due date, I took it out to assemble and was instantly frustrated. The pieces are so hard to \\"click\\" into place and if you mess up then it's almost impossible to take it apart without breaking it. I only put one cube together and decided to return it...definately not worth the hassle. There's got to be a better quality cart out there and I intend to find it...even if I have to pay more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Well thats what I think anyway. I got this at my babyshower, they had put it together for me so I dont know how hard that is.

As long as it doesnt fall apart it would be a nice item to have, but this one is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instrutions Stink","review":"I agree with the others on the instructions.

However, I have an advice, if you have trouble fitting parts together - you can GENTLY tap them with a hammer and it makes them snap in place really easy. It took me 30-40 min. to assemble the whole thing and I am 37 weeks pregnant with twins.Update: This is one of the most useful things in the nursery. I use it daily and push it all over the house and nothing on it is broken as of yet (3mos)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time!!!","review":"I registered for this and recieved it at my baby shower, even after I read the poor reviews on it. My husband and I set it up together when I was 8 months pregnant, and we never got it fully assembled because one of the pieces that connects the top shelf to the bottom shelf snapped off and broke, and the wheels kept falling off. It's also not very sturdy at all, and it kept collapsing. I found a nursery cart for the same price at Babies R Us, you can't buy it off the internet though, but it's way better. It's made by HOMZ, and it's made out of wood and canvas. It's easy to assemble, and it's sturdy.

The box says no tools required......well I have been using the end of a screw driver to bang the panels together because I my hands hurt and I have cuts on my hands from trying to put it together without the screwdriver.

I initially set out to put it together myself, after struggling for a 1/2 hour with 3 of the pieces I handed the task to my husband. He looked over the long and inadequate directions and proceeded to get it together over the next two hours. We were missing the lid it says it comes with, I have to call the manufacturer to get one sent to us. The cart ended up minus the shelves because they were to hard to put in after the whole thing was precariuosly together, and I do mean precarious because as you will find out if you to purchase this item you get one piece good only to have it come undone when you attempt to attach another. I advise all to think hard before wasting 20.00 on this item, and look for organization of some other kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as nice as it seems","review":"When i had purchased the organizer, i thought of the necessity that i might have. First, Putting the cart together was very difficult. With an infant time is very precious. Once it was together, it did do the job, after about 2 months two wheels had broken off. I had tried to glue on the wheels, but no good. eventualy I had to throw it out. I guess, for the price and for the 2 months of usage, it was worth it. But, I would not recomend this item to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!!!!","review":"This was the most difficult piece to put together. Several of the pieces broke off during assembly, so I exchanged it for a new one thinking it was a fluke. My boyfriend was designated to put the next one together, and he had the same problems; pieces were very hard to put together and would snap off (directions were also lousy).

My husband can build or put togehter anything, but this is awful, the directions do not work. THe plastic pieces break off.

Yes, it's kind of hard to lock the pieces together, but the instructions describe the easiest way to do it and once you figure it out... it's simple... no need to apply excessive force here... once ready it looks and feels sturdy enough to last for as long as you will need it for nursery use (at least two years I guess).

I did try to get a little ahead of myself a few times and did not refer to the directions, and that is where I would have a problem. I managed put a few things on backwards but easily corrected my mistakes after I actually read the directions. When it came to snapping parts together that I thought I would not have the stregnth to do I used a rubber hammer, but a regular hammer with a small towel wrapped around the head works too. I did not have any problems with pieces breaking. I think you'd have to really lose your temper and take it out on the parts to break any of them, as the pieces are pretty sturdy. I use the hamper part to put toys in since it is kind of small. I have a larger hamper I use for dirty laundry. I would suggest purchasing and when assembling, if you'll simply follow the directions... all you need is just a little patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Frustrating!!!","review":"I don't even want the darn thing anymore after trying to put it together.

So he carried it into the baby's room and we tried to put them back on. Not only did they break off, but they broke off the tabs that they slide into making it impossible to put them on! Then we tried to take off the front three and could not get those off at all! This was more work than it was worth.

It has filled the void for Neon tuners everywhere, there isn't anything else like it out there. This book is carefully written and progresses from one system to another and shows how each one works together to make your car achieve better performance (with balance). The only thing it doen't cover is automatic transmissions. The author is both knowledgeable, truthful and \\"gives it to you straight\\" in this book. There are no inappropriate ads for racing/performance parts/companies in this book either; the author simply gives his recommendations as to what he has found to work. This book is appropriate for all skill levels and is not full of technical jargon. The book IS a must for anyone interested in modifying their neon, whether it's for the street, drag racing or some serious autocrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concise guide to the care of Pythons.","review":"This is a good book for the beginning python owner and a good source of general information from choosing, housing, breeding, and caring for pythons. It also has a section describing the care and characteristics of different species. One great section actually illustrates rather than decribes the sexing of pythons, which is impressive for a book this size. I have herp books in my collection costing 15x as much that do not illustrate this process. For the cost, a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Overview of Pythonidae","review":"Like most herp care books currently on the market, this is a good once over the world look at the captive care and husbandry of pythons.

This concerns his parents and superhero grandparents as they live their lives in a lightning bolt shaped house in Anywhere, USA.

The 15 minute plus Fishwater > Superstition > Fishwater jam starts the cd off on a great note, but the later songs tend to head off into noodle land with the horns taking front and center a little too much. Of course, it would have been hard to live up to the expectations of another \\"Light Fuse...\\". The jazz infused \\"Beehive Jam\\" is a good representation of the bands improvisational skills, but tends to wander on for too long--I think this was done for the benefit of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band.

To those who are contemplating buying this album....do not hesitate any longer, its damn good. Anyway, if you decide not to take my advice, spend your money on a ticket to see these guys because they are a combonation of an explosion of creativity and tremendous musical ablity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prep School Hippie's Delight","review":"Another joyous occasion? Yeah, right. More like another grand opportunity for a no-talent band to rip off a bunch of middle class college kids...who are actually only in on the whole thing as a good excuse to take drugs, get a t-shirt, and have a few cool stories to swap around the fraternity house. But, hey, if widespread panic (THE panic, ohmigawd did you catch the redrocks show???!!!!) is what floats your little sell-out boat, \\"Another Joyous Occassion\\" is your new favorite cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still reading? Then you probably already know about WP...","review":"It is my opinion that any album by Widespread is worth having. If you're familiar with the band and even have some solid bootlegs, this album probably won't blow you away. An important note is that this is the first album released under Widespread Panic Records - thus it is likely that they were psyched to go ahead and release something. Don't get me wrong...the boys won't let you down! There are plenty of solid jams. But the techno-Arleen seems a little tacked on, and the album as a whole is perhaps merely \\"representable\\". Methinks they were just eager to get WPR rolling. Good luck to this outstanding band as they take control of their own production. I think a lot of us are looking forward to more well thought out releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Widespread Ventures Into Joyous New Territory","review":"Another Joyous Occasion seems to be the perfect title for Widespread's debut release under their own label. This CD, like many albums by \\"jam\\" bands, gets better with each listen. Along with traditional crowd favorites such as the Fishwater>Superstition>Fishwater segue, Widespread gives us a nice dose of experimentation with a little \\"techno\\" in Arleen.Widespread Panic proves with this album that they will not be forced into the constraints of a particular genre of music. The fact of the matter is, the music on the album is spectacular, thanks largely to the magic of John Keene's mixing. Thanks, Widespread, and everyone be sure to pick up this album. Heck, it's only half the price of a concert ticket and who could ask for a better setlist. BTW - Check out Beehive Jam, it really starts smokin'. This live album by one of today's most underated bands will surely stand the test of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For DDBB and WP fans both-- play it loud","review":"This is really a collaboration between the two bands, despite the DDBB \\"guest star\\" billing.The treatment of \\"Superstition\\" is worth the price of admission all by itself. Despite the number of tracks listed, this disc is really just several extended jams. For someone who wants to hear a band play A Song there will be some disappointment. But the sheer power and invention and fun of so many players jumping into the the next cool idea is irresistable.This is a great live disc, a great, fresh listening experience. If you are a DDBB fan, you'll love what happens when they get a full kick-butt rock band to sit on, and WP fans will love the depth and breadth that the horn band gives them. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"scapes out bowls great","review":"After trying out a few spatula I would have to say this is the best one I have used so far.

The scraper head has a stiff, plasticky feel, which makes it harder to scrape out a jar. It also doesn't clean well in the dishwasher -- I don't think it is 100% silicone. The big handles remind me of a car's hood ornament. They take up too much space in the drawer, and the slight increase in comfort doesn't outweigh their other flaws. I just put my set in the pile for our local recycling center's swap shop.

So of course Dworkin compared the abuse of women to the Jews and not to the Ukrainians. Dworkin is Jewish, so one would expect the Jewish comparison, but still, I personally am sick of hearing every evil person compared to Hitler and not to Stalin. So now she tells us that all men, men as such, are Nazis. Ho-hum, yawn. Please pass the butter. This thing about women being, so to speak, the chosen gender (cf. the chosen race), is too silly for words. She suggests that women should go off and form a nation by themselves, and have nothing more to do with men. Oh, really? And just how is the human race to continue to exist under such conditions?

So, we read it over and over until we had to renew our borrowing time, then finally after a little searching over this last summer, we bought it used from an old library. It is now in our collection forever. The illustrations of course are the most exquisite, and the representations of the alphabet give any reader a taste of Swahili culture and pride. My daughter knows every word in this book, because it is part of her culture and the book is so enticing, she egged to learn more from this pair of author/illustrator.

He spends a good deal of the book seperating Christians into groups and showing which group is \\"best\\" in his opinion. For Christians who haven't developed their own sense of scripture and the teachings of Christ, this book can be misleading and cause people to fall into judgment of other Christian groups. As a Catholic I found the book highly offensive because I know Barna counted me as a \\"non-born-again Christian\\" and that I fell into the bad Christian catagory, which I don't agree with. Christians should respect all other Christians no matter what their denomination, we should not be divided, we should be united.Barna owns a marketing and researching firm, he is not a biblical scholar, he's just trying to market HIS OWN misconceptions to you, which you don't need, SAVE YOUR MONEY, tith it to your church or a charity, don't waste it on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. Barna spends lots of time pointing out errors in modern Christianity, but very little on what to do about it. I didn't find anything in the book that would help me \\"think like Jesus\\" more or make \\"the right decision everytime.\\" The book seems to be geared more for new Christians rather than those of us who've been believers for awhile. And newer Christians wouldn't get any closer to thinking like Jesus by reading this book, though they might gain some useful knowledge.I wish I had read some of the reviews before buying it.

It is making this connection that is the book's greatest strength. Rather than just telling students \\"how to\\" do something (which Dennis' book does very well), it explains to students why they are asked to read, study, and prepare the way we ask them to read, study, and prepare.We now require this book as part of Orientation, and we devote several Academic Support lectures in the first year to a more thorough discussion of specific areas covered by the book.Mario MaineroDirector,Academic Success ProgramWhittier Law SchoolCosta Mesa, California"},{"rating":"1","title":"MEDIOCRE ADVICE","review":"This book, like several others in this genre, provides the reader with different nuances on how to brief cases, take lecture notes, study for exams and other components that every other book in this field suggests.This book is a rather long and difficult read.

They never mentioned how hard the life was for most people. The majority of settlers, in fact, failed. Some died from disease or accidents, others simply discovered that farming was not as lucky or simple as they had been led to beleive. The climate was against them. Finances and the market were as much luck as anything. If they didn't draw the best of land as a homestead, it was pretty much a no-win situation.Ise's plain spoken story illuminates the situation well.

Ugh. I watched it to the bitter end, though, hoping it might get better, but it didn't. It would almost get some momentum going and then...thud! The best I can say about it is that the actors portraying the three principals were endearing, and trying their hardest to make the best of a bad situation.

Boomtown was something special and still is to the people who fell in love with the stories and characters.NBC was STUPID for letting go of this amazing show.

The top wouldn't even go on the bottom so I tried bending it to fit and it snapped right away. Cheap cheap cheap! Looks decent but is definitely not high quality material. Shakes bad when pressed with just one finger and the bottom third \\"leg\\" is not a hexagonal screw as it states in the instructions but is a fillips. Terrible instructions and it wants you to screw it to the wall with some light tethers but has no holes for the tethers as stated in the instructions. . . I regret buying them. The only thing steady about these is that fact that they lean on a wall. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, cheap, cheap","review":"These shelves are very, very flimsy.

Regardless of what should, would or could, they get one star but really deserve none for this mishap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The predrilled holes in bottom post J are opened wrong side","review":"Everything was ok before I tried to assemble the bottom parts. When I tried to do, I realized that the predrilled holes of bottom post J are opened to wrong side. Inside holes had to be outside, outside holes had to be inside. What will I do with these unassembled parts? This has been a trash right now. I cannot return this because it cannot be put into its box again. It is just a waste of money. Dont spend your money on things that you have to assemble. It is also waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price.","review":"I bought this as I wanted a leaning shelf that was under $100. I assembled it by myself even though the instructions said to have 2 people. It probably would have saved me 5 min. The instructions were pretty simple and the shelf looks good.

The right leg was missing holes for the wooden pegs at the bottom of the post.

Got this to put together for a guest room being redone in a sort of minimalist, post-modern style. Thought it would be a cool accent piece for guest-room books and DVDs. I am good at cobbling these sorts of things together even if the directions might as well be xeroxed in ancient Sanskrit, but this thing was NOT worth my time. One of the few true nightmare \\"assembly required\\" products I've encountered and the finished product was underwhelming, to say the least. The material is super-cheesy, the thing has a tendency to list in one lopsided direction, and the shelves are wobbly/unstable. Often, the blood/sweat/tears required to assemble is mitigated by a decent finished product. This is not remotely worth your time or the abject idiocy you will feel upon seeing it after 2 & 1/2 hours of ridiculous assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall good","review":"looked great after i assembled it. that being said. was not exactly easy to assemble. the holes didnt line up, the instructions were wrong and some of the pieces didnt fit.

However, I would not recommend it. To put it together you basically build each half then put the halves together. When I received mine the place where the two halves line up did NOT line up quite right and there is a visible gap where two halves meet.

Unfortunately, instead of stopping when she discovered the screw holes were too big she tried to improvise with duct tape and super glue. About 10 minutes after she got it up the kittens jumped on it and the whole shebang came crashing down. If she had not put it together, I would have returned it, but the broken pieces were our fault.

It looks great with my modern furniture and was so easy to put together. The directions said that it requires 2 people to assemble, but I was able to put it together easily by myself and I'm pregnant in my 3rd trimester. It also came with 2 straps to be able to attach it to the wall for child safety (most other furniture only comes with one strap). I will definitely buy a matching bookshelf in the future.UPDATE : I've changed my rating to a 2 star. One of the shelves broke the other day under the weight of our books.

I've read my share of manga and my experience so far with this series is that it's relatively poor. It's really a quite juvenile and episodic fantasy about having a goddess for a girlfriend, without any real thought as to the ramifications of some events (questions arise such as, if it's as easy to get a wish as dialing a wrong number, why isn't the world filled with people who have their own wishes fulfilled?).

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disc one is better than disc two","review":"A pretty good collection by any standard, but the inclusion of Michael Bolton, Gloria Estefan, Britney Spears, etc. kind of ruin the second disc. (But the first four tunes on that disc are great!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas CD","review":"The CD was received timely and in good condition. It includes John & Yoko's Happy Xmas (War is Over), McCartney's Wonderful Christmastime, and Elvis' Bluse Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical Christmas","review":"This CD is full of good songs for everybody, the young and the old, it brings back a lot of childhood memories, and creates new memories also. It is a keeper for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmph","review":"A christmas CD indeed. Yeah, there are some tracks on here that you need for Chirstmas, but it could've (read: should've) been one disc. Get Britney, NSync, and Boyz II Men off here. If you want some contemporary twists on classic christmas tunes, you should pick up a copy of \\"(It's a Punk & Ska) Christmas Gone Wrong!\\" if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Christmassy","review":"This CD is great for Christmas! It has great songs on it such as Wonderful Christmastime, Home For The Holidays, Happy Christmas, and Let It Snow. The old songs are better than the modern ones in my opinion, but the modern ones are pretty good too. It is great for Christmas. I will definitley recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Search Ended","review":"Ever since I was about 9 years old and I heard Paul McCartney's Wonderful Christmastime I have been looking for ax-mas CD that had it on there, with no luck. Imagine my delight when I finally found a CD that had it on there. I realized i had to have it. This is a must have for any person who collects Christmas CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"60% Classic Tunes","review":"I must admit, I was skeptical when I saw the \\"NOW\\" series was putting out a Christmas collection. But I was pleasantly surprised at the song selection. In fact, just about every song on Disc 1, and the first four songs on Disc 2, qualify as true Christmas pop classics. About the only classic songs missing are \\"The Chipmunk Song\\" and Harry Simeone Chorale's \\"Little Drummer Boy\\". I can't think of another single Christmas CD that can top Disc 1's collection of classics. But once we hit Michael Bolton on Disc 2, the timeless quality evaporates. Yes, there are some good, more contemporary tunes, but they don't measure up to the long string of Christmas hits preceding them. Maybe time will tell if they acquire the beloved status that \\"White Christmas\\" and \\"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\\" have. I do recommend this collection, though, even if, like me, you end up playing the first disc at lot more than the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation of Holiday Classics","review":"If you wanted to burn your own holiday CD, you couldn't do a whole lot better than the choices made on \\"Now That's...\\". Disc One, in particular, puts some of the greatest Christmas songs of all time on one CD, from Nat King Cole's \\"The Christmas Song\\" to the Carpenter's \\"Merry Christmas Darling\\". There isn't a bad cut on the first disc, and extra kudos have to be extended for including Bing and Bowie's \\"Little Drummer Boy\\", and my favorite ho0liday sing-a-long, Burl Ives' \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\".After the first few songs, Disc 2 falls apart slightly, particularly in its attempt to add a \\"youthful\\" touch by including N'Snyc and Brittney Spears. And the person who decided to use Joe's recording of \\"This Christmas\\" instead of the Donny Hathaway classic should be shot. But Disc 2 is saved by the inclusion of John and Yoko's Merry Christmas (War Is Over), and Band Aid's \\"Do They Know It's Christmas\\".All in all, this is a great disc for the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastiest Refried Beans I've Found","review":"Far and away the best canned refried beans out there. I must not be the only one who thinks so because they are hard to find even at Whole Foods. This specific variety is often sold out. So easy to buy a case at Amazon! The 12-pack I received was shrink-wrapped in a cardboard tray and packed in another box, but not well enough. Due to the poor packing, all cans were dented at their top...every single one!

After installing some of the games, you may find it hard to learn how to play. Games like Theme Hospital and Sim Copter are easy to learn because of the tutorials that you can run. Other games like Sim Earth and Sim Life are more difficult because no tutorial is supplied and it can take quite a long time to search through the help file and find that certain section you are looking for. One note to consumers is that Theme Park will not work unless your computer's DOS version can recognize a mouse. Most of the newer computers are capable of playing Theme Park. Any computer manufactured before 1998 may not be capable of running Theme Park. Check with your computer manufacturer for more information and to find out if you are capable of running Theme Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution","review":"Buyer beware.

The best function is that the light automatically shuts off after a while. . .a HUGE plus (anyone who's ever given a flashlight to a toddler and had to replace the batteries daily because it was left on is probably with me on this one). It's made my daughter eager to explore the dark areas of our house rather than be afraid of them. The only problem with this toy is that the handle is fairly big around. The age suggestion is for 18 months and older, but my two-year-old can't reach all the way around to turn the light on by herself. She has to keep running back to a grown-up each time it shuts off. Otherwise, it's a fun and VERY durable toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON THIS SELLER!","review":"JUST LIKE ALL THEIR OTHER MERCHANDISE, IT'S OVERPRICED!

I like the hardware but the base map is complete rubbish and you need to have a memory card and buy optional map software to get a usable unit. The problem is the copy protection on the software ... you must have the distribution CD in the drive to load the software and backup copies are not allowed. To add insult to injury, if you damage your distribution CD, Magellan charges the outrageous price of $25 to swap for a good CD. All in all, the negative points on the software tip the scale to Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"The GPS consistently showed me 50-500 feet from my actual location.

Provides a nice overview of modification possibilities. Gives the reader a lot of ideas to build upon. Does a good job of explaining ramifications of modifications (good and bad) and why some are necessary (for example, structural/frame mods). The only thing I did not like was the lack of color photos throughout. Often I had to look at the black and white photos several times to discern details in the parts I was viewing. The photos were often too dark (most likely from the printing process) and lacked the necessary contrast to identify details I was interested in. I think higher resolution color photos would have helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than a star because it don't work","review":"I've bought Triple Play Baseball twice (the second time two years after the first time, out of stubborness).

This work by Gail Hannah is an important, and accurate, description of Reed's visual design methodology that has had far reaching positive consequences for our nation. Anyone seeking to understand how the visual design of three-dimensional objects can be taught, and subsequently successfully implemented, will appreciate this book. The practice of designing three-dimenional objects for use by people is an oft misunderstood subject since it is not conventional engineering nor an art unto itself. Industrial design is a unique combination of skills that forms a bridge between the end user of objects and the manufacturer. Hannah's work on Ms. Reed, her origins, and her teaching technique, begins to fill the gap in our knowledge of American ingenuity and our ability to invent. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"The book is old and pretentious. It describes Design as it was some sort of a religion (with Roweena as its prophet), that a Designer needs to stick to some basic rules, in order to generate a beautiful product.It doesn't really take the engineering part into consideration. For example, that a functional product kept very simple is usually beautiful.Also it hardly has any examples and some of the few are about 30 to 40 years old and not really convincing either.Maybe this book explains why most cars from the 70ties are somewhat unsightly.And last but not least the letters are pretty small, a pain to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice upconverting DVD player","review":"I am happy with this upconverting DVD player.

I give this Cd 4 stars because it is indeed a solid CD and there is plenty to hear on it, there may not be a whole lot of depth to it. It is a pretty simple Disc but one definitly worth hearing a couple times but after that i don't know. THe highlight of this disc would be the fourth single \\"Alive\\" which is an awesome song. Which is the only reason i bought this CD. There isn't Much past \\"alive\\", a couple alright songs here and there but that's about it. Only buy this if you know what you are getting into."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing movie","review":"I recently had the opportunity to view this film in its original IMAX format and it was quite an amazing experience. As someone who has recently taken a strong interest in the sport of skydiving, as well as BASE jumping (which I have yet to try), I found this movie as intriguing as any I have ever seen. Not only does this movie provide continuous outstanding shots of professional skydivers and BASE jumpers from around the globe, but it also takes you in great depth, into what goes on inside a person's head, and body, when they take life to the edge. Adrenaline Rush is a fun ride, and provides spectacular insight into what makes people push life to the extreme. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who as ever thrown themselves out of plane, off of a cliff, or anyone who has even the slightest bit of Adrenaline Junkie in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mediocre","review":"As far as Imax / bigscreen films go, this was only mediocre. The resolution is not up to par (not surprising, considering the weight of a true Imax camera). This is really more of a typical PBS show for the movies. It ends well, but the content is a little thin. The air shots, though, are very good and the skydivers are talented. Seeing the da Vinci parachute is obviously unique and worth the entry price for scientific historians or parachute / skydiver aficianados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adrenaline Rush (IMAX) (2 - Disc WMVHD Edition) (2002)","review":"Being the first WMVHD content disc I've purchased, I can't speak to how it might compare with other titles out there in this format, but it didn't disappoint and in fact it has inspired me to get back into skydiving. I did find it to be a little short in running time especially considering the little 'history of Adrenaline' segment which wasn't in keeping with the rest of the content. It's for these two reasons that I didn't give it a five star rating, but if you're after HD program content to play on your computer, and you don't suffer from vertigo, then this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and uninvolving","review":"Lisa Goldstein has a good reputation in fantasy circles, but on the basis of this book I have to assume either that she is highly overrated or else that \\"Summer King, Winter Fool\\" is not particularly representative of her work as a whole. Some nice work in creating a promising setting and some intriguing ideas along the way are deep-sixed by a formulaic plot and characters who stubbornly refuse to come to life. Ms. Goldstein ignores the essential injunction to show, not tell, and the book hurries to its ending without creating the slightest tension along the way. Inexplicably recommended as one of the best fantasy novels of 1994 in Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling's annual \\"Year's Best\\" anthology, which is normally a fairly reliable source for finding quality fantasy literature.

She was already used to other lift-the-flap books and immediately took on to this one.What we both love:1- She loves the flaps because they are just the right size for her hands. I like them because they are not too big like in her other books (the larger the flaps, the easier to rip!)2- Simple, straightforward text with short lines on each page.3- Great colors.4- Repitition throughout and babies love consistency!This became her favorite very quickly and 5 months later, still is!A definite book to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites!","review":"I am a speech language pathologist who works with children birth to 5 and this is one of my favorite books.

It is a lift-the-flap so it was interactive and captured her attention. Also, it gives visual hints of what the animal is so that they can try to guess before they lift the flap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for babies under 1 and older too","review":"Dear Zoo is a cute but simple story, with a flap on each page that varies slightly for variety but is simple enough for my little one's hands. One issue we've had with some flip books or feel books is that they don't have an activity on each page or some pages are duds compared to others. These are all pretty consistent. Also, the flaps are sturdy, which is important since my son will tend to try to pull and bend.The words develop into a simple rhythmic story that is easy for young children to follow, even if they don't yet understand the words. My son is fascinated by this book and I love it too. I'm very glad I bought it and I would give it as a gift and/or recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My 19 month old daughter loves this book.

Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very cute story, but book was defective and of poor quality","review":"I used to read this to my niece when she was a kid many years ago, and she loved it. We'd enjoy opening the flaps and talking about the animals behind each flap. I bought this intending to give it as a gift to a friend (and got the mini edition so I could mail it to her), but even though the story is the same, this mini-edition is flimsy and the one I received was defective. The flap on the third page was improperly glued and tore the page. In my 10 years of shopping at Amazon I've never had to return anything, but will do with this book since I'd be embarrassed to give it as a gift! I'm buying the regular edition (board book) instead despite its bigger size."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible message","review":"I read a review of this book once before, and have to agree...this is the worst message to communicate to a kid.

I would have preferred a new book as I was promised in the description!"},{"rating":"1","title":"caution with adopted children","review":"As a mother of an adopted child and a psychologist, I am concerned about the message this book sends. The child in the book wants a pet, but because they are unacceptable, he repeatedly sends them back.

She says the next animal even before we get to the page. She also makes each animal sound (except for the camel because Mommy and Daddy don't know what sound a camel makes). The flaps are more sturdy then some other flap books she has and thus less likely to get ripped. There's a good reason this book has been a favorite for 25 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite must have!","review":"My 18 month old loves this book, only second to Eric Carle's \\"From Head to Toe\\".

We love all of the flaps that open with the animal inside.

I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"by far, my son's favorite","review":"My son is 10 months old and he spends so much time with this book. He seeks it out, plops onto the floor, and lifts the flaps over and over.

I'd read in an article in a parenting magazine that this was a \\"must have\\" book, so I ordered it from Amazon. After a while though, it grew on me. My girls love lifting the flaps to see what the next gift from the zoo is. They never tire of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a favorite in our house!","review":"This has been my twin toddlers' favorite book since it arrived two months ago. They bring it to me at least three times a day for reading! They are quiet with suspense when I read, \\"so they sent me a.....\\", and giggle when they open the flap. It's helped them learn to point out animals in other books; in a collage of different zoo animals, they will point out the elephant, camel, et cetera, when asked. Love it! We may need a fresh copy after another two months of heavy wear, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very engaging for a 9-month old","review":"I introduced this book to my 9-month old son, who immediately took to lifting the flaps like a pro. This cooperative reading of the book, makes the required multiple readings entertaining rather than tedious. We've never had a concern about the sturdiness of the flaps, as these are a bit thicker than some other books we've run across us. Although, please note, my son hasn't figured out that ripping pages might be fun and is appropriately gentle with books. He is now 21 months old and still requests this book often. This was also the first book, I saw him browsing by himself, at about 12 months old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this for my 3 month old son for Christmas.

He loved flap books. I kept this one in the diaper bag for entertainment while we were out or while in the car. Simple words with repetition and explaination of each animal action. The great thing is when he turned 3 he started \\"reading\\" himself. He memorized the book so smiled wide with the turn of each page and the lift of each flap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book!","review":"This book is very cute.

Other than that, its a good book and my son loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This is such a great little lift-the-flap book! The words are simple and catchy, and the story is funny. Even I like the story, so it makes it more fun for me to read it over and over again. My baby loves to lift the flaps and look inside. The flaps do stick a bit (as all lift-the-flap books do), but I find the material this book is made of to be quite durable. None of the flaps have ripped off yet and we read it almost every night at bedtime. This is the type of book that pleases both baby and parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite book","review":"This book is a favorite of my granddaughter, laughs at every page and wants to read it over and over, making the elephant appear and the lion roar!

The text is nice & large, & the pictures are bright & simple for little ones. The flaps are interesting & varied, but are not as durable as they should be. Also, I felt that the name of the animals should be included somewhere, so there's a connection between revealing them & saying their names."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute","review":"The paper engineering in this book is very cute and easy enough for my 10-month-old daughter to work on her own.

It takes forever to load maps (once you get that software set up) unless you have an SD Card Programmer (they don't tell you what that is either). The expansion slot is hidden underneath the batteries, so if you have to swap SD Cards to move to a new region, you have to remove the batteries first.Once you do get everything set up it works OK, but if you want something to help navigate the highways and byways of America without getting lost you'd do better with something dedicated to that (either the Garmin or a nice set of paper maps).I won't be buying anything more from Magellan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"The Meridian Platinum sucks up battery power quickly.

The final two cuts recorded live in Germany really capture the enthusiasm of the band and the audience.

Interestingly enough the details of the war in Cuba support my memories of those events, although \\"battles\\" is mistranslated to describe all military actions however small. Cowardice of the Marianas reported by such as Norberto Fuentes (see below), and is not consistent with my memories that recall these women as being irrationally brave, but such is the fog of war. On the other hand Puebla portrays a courageous Castro an exaggeration of reality, since his caution and discrete retirement from the battle field is legendary.Fuentes, Norberto 2004 La Autobiografia de Fidel Castro (Paperback).

I tried to read all of the MacGregor series, but by the time I got to the Grooms, I got bored with the predictability of the story. I'd just finished the second part (Duncan), quite disappointed, and wasn't looking forward all that much to the next set of perfect, confident, brilliant, strong characters. Then comes Naomi. For the very first time Nora Roberts introduced me to a female character that I could truly identify with - completely down to earth, worried about her diet and her weight, trying to be good at what she does but not overly confident, searching for her inner beauty and her identity, shy..., she's actually blushing and stuttering and mumbling. I was charmed, and intrigued. For the life of me, I could not suppress the giggles or the tears. Here's to a diamond in the rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easy reading romance","review":"I loved this book and have since continued on reading all of the MacGregor books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

I don't mind books about other family members but story after story after story about the same family members and now a re-issue of the beginning of the same family is a bit much.

It was one of the sweetest, yet well written romances that I have read in recent years and was looking forward to continuing with the series. The Macgregor Grooms was nowhere near as entertaining!It seemed that Nora Roberts was following a formula and simply plugged in names in a set of events that varies only mildly from vignette to vignette. She borrows too much from the previous book as well. Somehow the grandfather seemed more pushy and less doting here as well!Not really worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she spending too much time with her alter ego Robb?","review":"I like Nora Roberts, I really do. I have all of her books - but this one and the Mcgregor Brides - I donated to charity. I think the problem is she has written so very many fine novels, that her loyal fans, anticipate more from her than those who are reading her for the first time. She needs to go back and rework these (and send us all free copies). Also the Mcgregor Bride doll is an insult to all who have truly read this series - it doesn't even look like one of the fiesty Mcgregor women!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This family is too perfect to be real","review":"I recently read both the MacGregor Brides & Grooms, and that was ENOUGH for me! These people are just too good to be true, all gorgeous, ivy-league educated, to the manor born and brought together in marriage by their 90-something patriarch Daniel Duncan MacGregor(he must be pushing 100 by now). Old Daniel is the ultimate meddling, busybody grandfather who means well but pushes prospective mates on everyone in his family, God forbid someone decides to pass on marriage and family and be on their own! These two books were it for me, and I think I'll stick to the other Nora Roberts stories I've always enjoyed over the years. This series is too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did she write this one??","review":"Did anyone notice how easy love is???

The short length required to fit three stories into 1 volume is not long enough to delve into the characters.

I laughed, howled and wiped the tears away just to keep on reading.

At least these guys have a clue as to what Granpa is up to(the Brides didn't) and with typical male arrogance believe they can side step his plans for them. I especially liked D.C.'s efforts to \\"save\\" Layna (sp?) from his Granfather's machinations (giggle.) My only gripe is that we now have to wait until NEXT YEAR for the next installment!!

It's not the songs that were bad, at lest not on her lp's for MGM. Her MGM lp's featured sateful arrangemets and good standard tunes, it's her clumsy phrasing, and lack of swing(you'd think she never heard a Louis Armstrong album before). Her annoying lack of any sort of swing or rhythm, and her oddball phrasing make her just above Patti Page & Teresa Brewer, but nowbere near the great Rosemary Cloone, Keely Smith or Doris Day, and light years away from Ella Fitzgerald.James sounds like the same awful singer she was in the 50's, yet she's singing some new awful tunes(no standards).

As for the ending, it couldn't havebeen any less ironic or ridiculous. No subtlty or believabilitywhatsoever.

It's meant to be visceral but it just comes across as gratuitous - not to mention tasteless.It's a filmization of a 1982 David Mamet play and reflects is stagey origins in its claustophobic sets and artificial situations. The descent that Edmond (played by William H. Macy) takes from respectability to madness is not convincing and one is continually asking \\"what exactly is the point?\\".\\"Edmond\\" is hopelessly dated and shallow and it was a big mistake to resurrect it on screen.

Not \\"Mamet\\" as you now think of him.","review":"The DVD box is very misleading. The actresses all have small roles, though Stiles is great and beautiful in her short appearance. There is no handgun in this movie; it's only pictured on the DVD box to make it look more interesting.Macy's acting is not as great as other reviewers claim; he seemed to keep his long rant at the same intensity for most of the movie. I didn't buy into his character's extreme actions. As another reviewer put it, this movie is more of an assault. It should have been rated NC-17.This is not Glengarry Glen Ross, nor is it Spartan, The Spanish Prisoner, or The Winslow Boy. It's not even About Last Night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghhhh.","review":"If you want to see the three main female characters of this movie display some of the poorest acting you've ever seen, by all means rent or buy this film.

So far I have not found any. On positive reviews I see comments about how the movie is \\"dark\\". If you want to see a \\"dark\\" movie go see something else. About a third to halfway through the film this thing goes totally off the rails and becomes an incoherent mess. This movie is terribly written and the main character's actions are totally unconvincing. And to those that say he's mentally imbalanced that may be true but his behavior at the beginning and ending of the movie make no sense to his behavior through the rest of it because the script and the acting do not allow the audience to understand his motivations. Bottom line, this movie is totally absurd.

Frustrated over his situation, he takes to the streets going to strip joints, peep shows and massage parlors. As the night goes on, he runs into street hustlers and puts his life at risk, getting mugged. Finally, his rage gets the best of him and then he puts himself in the last place he'd want to be. Then he has no other choice but to be content in his position and make the best of it.

I have been discovering the hard way that many, if not most games that came out before Windows XP (my current operating system) are totally incompatible with Windows XP. Superbike 2000 is no exception. I even visited the EA Sports website and contacted technical support and they provided no answers. In fact, the tech support personnel, themselves, attempted to run the game on XP and they told me that they were unable to.I wanted to purchase Superbike 2001 as well, so I asked EA tech support if that, too, didn't run under Windows XP and they told me that it didn't, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is great.","review":"This whole cd has great music.

She instantly became my hero. The book is instructive without being preachy, and gave me a sense of Harriet Tubman's incredible strength of character, determination, and courage. In the pages of this book, I found a Great American. She has been a role model for me ever since I read this book. Consider giving this book as a gift to a child you love.

The jam is easy to fix and occurs when the character slips off his platform and gets caught between the platform and the rotating wheel. This is followed by a loud clicking noise. Unfortunately it is very difficult to keep the character on the platform. Now my son lets the character drag behind on the ground to keep it moving along.The other items in this line do not have this problem as there are no rotating wheels, so I would recommend you purchase those, but probably not this one.I wanted to add that we love the Rescue Heroes line so I didn't really want to say anything negative, but felt like I should to spare others the frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I took these for months and they didnt do anything.

The production is fine and some of the music shows promise, but the unfounded arrogance prevalent (especially in the laughable liner notes) set a bad backdrop from the get-go.

The guitars aren't mixed well on the ( especially during solos) 95' pressing of the CD. I don't own the re master. The lyrical writing on this record is very engaging. I found topics such as misanthropy and viking slaughter to be very delightful. The tracks BERSERK and AGAINST THE WORLD are perfect examples of this album's potential.

The Characters were some of the shallowest I have ever encountered, and the plot was banal-to say the least. I was also rather put off by the graphic and seemingly gratuotous nature of some of the violence--not usual for MZB.

But there's a difference between music written to literally accompany dance and music stylized in the form of dances, meant primarily for listening. Bach did not play Saturday night dance gigs in Leipsig nor did Chopin play his waltzes in Parisian ballrooms. Tempos (and flexibility within those tempos) need not be based on realistic assumptions of how people may have actually danced bourees and minuets. There were enough differences in style among Italian, French and German strains of late Baroque music (and dance) that one should be cautious about any definitive rules here.

Yes, the story is all there... but, you'd think with a nice cover - it would have more pictures. Most of the pages are just words which isn't very fun for a toddler to look at. And, the pages that do have pictures are kind of dark and a little blurry. It's not terrible - but, it certainly could have been a lot better. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A board book that's not for toddlers?","review":"I usually assume that if something is available as a board book it will be geared toward infants and toddlers. However, my two year old son (who is very excited about Santa this year) cannot sit through more than a page or two of this. There are hardly any illustrations, and the few that are there are very dark and hard for him to make out. It is clearly designed for an older child with a longer attention span, so I am left wondering why it was made as a board book. And truthfully, even with the attention span to listen to the story without any pictures, why would you want to? There are so many other beautifully illustrated versions of this book. I would not not recommend settling for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Santa","review":"The illustrations in this book are generally good, but the big man himself looks downright scary.

I consider the book to be very small and the illustrations are more suited for adults. Santa has very scary eyes in a couple of illustrations so I don't think this book will do much to help my Santa-wary toddler. However, my biggest complaint is the font in that it is very small and I know I will have difficulty reading it in a dimly lit room at bedtime so I would much prefer a bolder type for that very reason.

I don't blame her. The reindeer are wild-eyed and this version of Santa has a glimmer in his eye that's more mischievous than joyful. He's actually creepy in some of the spreads. This Santa looks like he's breaking and entering when he's about to go down a chimney. I'm not kidding! The illustrations also have a side story that's unrelated to the verse -- something about a gift for the father from his childhood or something?

We've tried a few glues, and none are really holding it in place. I'm not pleased that the one thing they are made for they cant accomplish. I understand they aren't real boots and I don't expect them to do real boot things, but mild walking on level solid ground with nothing more crazy than walking and generic poses for pics in them, and they fell apart.

They are not that comfortable, and they're pretty big on me, as I'm a size 10 and they're more of an 11. But all of that was expected, and with some added padding and gel insoles, they worked out pretty well.The issue here is that the quality is very poor. After their second night out, the sole of one boot became almost completely detached and had to be glued back on. The imitation leather is also beginning to show small cracks in a few places.

The songs tell a vague tale of a good love gone bad. The cowboy lyrics notwithstanding, this collection shows Nelson not seeking new paths but writing and singing very old-fashioned songs of love, sin, and redemption, the ultimate trinity of country music. Most listeners will assume that Nelson wrote the greatest hit on the album, the title cut, but it dates from Worlf War II and has been recorded by the disparate likes of Roy Acuff and Elvis.

His songs ring true, but are rarely sappy.That's why I truly appreciate this album. It is somewhat of a 'country opera' in the way 'Tommy' by the Who is a rock opera. It is a story about a preacher in the Old West, but words can't do it justice.No huge songs except for 'Blue Eyes' which is excellent.

I don't have a fenced-in yard, so this is a great idea to let him walk and explore \\"freely\\" outside without having to hold his hand all the time or me having to worry about him running in the street. It definately increases his independence and adds to his quality of life. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the straps that cross over his shoulders are rough and rub on his neck a little, so I'll have to get some strap guards so they don't scratch or irritate his neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good","review":"We bought this harness and the Kiddopatamus harness and this one isn't as good.

It is hard to believe that Fools Game is fiction. It is so written that you might feel you were reading a narration made from government reports found through the Freedom of Information Act. Fred Wolf's writing style is that realistic. His narrative style places him among the great writers of this genre. Especially to be commended is the scene in the Canadian Wilderness. The reader will be led from an event in Manila though North America and then Europe.

The cardboard is fairly thick and sturdy. The pieces are shaped like the countries: I wouldn't buy a geography-puzzle without this valuable learning feature. It's colorful in an aesthetically appealing way, and country names, as well as bodies of water, are clearly marked. The box says it's for ages 4 to 104, and I think that's pretty accurate. I bought it for myself, and I'm finding that I remember where countries and seas are much more so than when I simply refer to a map.

But, this puzzle was $6.99 and the Montessori puzzles are around $30-$40. So, I figured I'd see how these did.Well, I think that the benefits of the Montessori puzzles are that they are made of wood and they aren't labeled. Instead of learning all of the countries by their shape and location, sometimes my daughter just reads the name of the country.Meanwhile, it's still a great puzzle and definitely worth the price.

Sure, this is just Lee's take on the \\"Haunted House story,\\" but he twists it so far beyond recognition, you have to respect him.Some say he's nothing but a \\"splatterpunk\\" writer, but I disagree - his work has a certain visceral esoteria to it. He weaves his own mythology deeply among the abominations written on the page. It's Edward Lee, if anyone I've read in the last decade, who deserves comparison to Clive Barker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unapologetically Sexual Nightmare","review":"Make no mistake, this book is unabashed terror porn, with rife, vividly cruel sexuality. It's explicit in terms of both sex and scenes of unimaginable violence, sort of like what \\"My Life at Rose Red\\" would be like if it were reimagined by Larry Flynt and Marilyn Manson. Edward Lee's work has appeared in famous horror anthologies including the \\"Hot Blood\\" series.If you realise, however, what you are getting into, this book is well-written and a capitvating read.

The book is filled with too many descriptions of sexual activity and a gerat deal of detail in to demonolgy. To the point of the preverseity. I am not a prude but after reading this book I wanted to spend the rest of my life taking a lot showers and becoming a monk.The thing that really bothers me is to which the detail the author writes some of the demonic sceans.

Marcantel, who is said to work in the English Department at the University of Virginia, sadly lacks the advanced vocabulary a woman of her stature should have. Despite the fact that the extent of her research is evident, perhaps she should have spent more time using a thesaurus so that the text would be more rich and challenging.

It's one that I actually like to do (makes all the difference in whether you choose to exercise or not). In this workout, it's got a mix of dancy type moves that are easy to follow because Juliane (the instructor) teaches them in a cool format - each pattern is taught to you at three tempos. It's done first slow, a bit quicker and then at full tempo because by then you'll know the moves. Then there is a new pattern to learn at the same way and just before you start to get bored she changes the moves to keep it fresh and interesting. There are the usuall cha-chas and mambo style moves but its still a fresh take on other workouts. She is a good cuer which really helps you get through the moves and before you know it, you've done the full dvd. I like this one and try to mix it up with other workouts about 4-5 times a week. I'm not bored yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERY fitness level? GRADUALLY step up? NOT!","review":"I was very disappointed in this video. When they say every fitness level, they mean in shape.

I work out everyday with videos. I was excited to get this video since I love to dance and figured it would make my working out more enjoyable. NOT TRUE. I did this workout maybe 2 or 3 times before I had enough. For the money I paid I was so disappointed. At this point because I was so unhappy with this video I have shyed away from buying any other dance videos. I did own the NYC Ballet and that is still one of my favorites so I will stick with something like that. I have tried to get into this one a few times and within thr first 10 mins I have lost all my interest.

I guess I was expecting the cha cha and mambo that was advertised on the back. No real dance steps here, just another version of jazzercize. And the music is terrible. Why can't they put real music on these things? I turned off the sound and put on a favorite CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Experienced Dancers Only","review":"I liked the instructor and the music and the dances. I'm certain that EXPERIENCED dancers would love the DVD. I would have given this 5 stars if the instructor had taken more time in teaching the dance steps. It would have been great if she would do each step very slowly several times. It would have been ever greater if she would turn her back to the viewer as she did the slow demonstrations. I got so confused trying to keep up and watching her do it watching her front instead of her back. Any, since that didn't happen, and since I didn't want to take the time to keep rewinding until I got it, I just danced my own dance to the music and decided to get rid of the DVD. I'm sure it will be perfect for someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put, HORRIBLE!","review":"I rarely like to give negative reviews however I can't help it. Received this in the mail and was eager to try the DVD. Within 5 mins I was helplessly lost, within ten mins I quit. The steps were too complicated for me to follow and too involved.

It doesn't catch such blatant spam as \\"Banned government CD\\". I started getting a lot more of these when I installed their software. Since it'd be very easy for them to update their software to block these emails, I have to conclude they are behind it. How else could a company be so incompetent as to let them through?Also is the issue of forcing users to pay for upgrades. See they stopped updating the definitions to 3.0 so if you bought 3.0 and want it to catch the latest spam, you have to PAY for an upgrade to 4.0! This is downright pathetic. As soon as you pay for 4.0, they'll have a 5.0 waiting for you I'm sure. Think about it, it only costs $20.

That single was GREAT. I have tosay that I really expected so much more of a group with such great potential. They seemed to have a more decent look with the release of their first single, which was a really nice song. This song has several sexual tie-ins which really make the song pretty annoying. It sounds like some of the other songs out there, but I gave it two stars cuz it was a pretty catchy song. I don't want to offend the group in any way, cuz I like them, they sing well.

Christians or inteligent people will learn from this book, and realize that the Devil is smart and fools many into witch craft(& by the way there are no such things as good witches), and other sourcery. However God \\"Jesus' name\\" holds authority over all the evils, and God is so much more powerful then the Devil. Who do you think sent Lucifer, a former angel, to Hell? God!

The grated tofu (I assume it is the tofu adding the grittiness to the chili, anyway) is very unpleasant. It didn't taste like tofu, or anything really.. It just felt tough and like plastic. The texture it added was not enjoyable at all.The flavor wasn't anything to rave about either. It was alright, but I couldn't get past how gross that grit was so I wasn't able to eat much of it.In the future I won't take short cuts...

This book seems well researched with the potential to be an excellent story. However, the details overwhelmed me and caused confusion instead of clarification. According to his introduction, Demos supposedly attempts to make a transition between purely fact based history and historically fiction. He fooled me. Had I not read his introduction, I would have thought this book was the result of an extensive research paper regarding a specific captive. The basic outline of the book seems interesting, and I was even excited after reading the sypnosis. However, Demos fails to make a connection with the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically accurate but Dull as hell....","review":"Normally, the genre of historical fiction is a very interesting read. However, in this book, it is, for lack of a better term, quite boring. If you're looking for a breezy read, this isn't the book you want. If you're looking for accuracy and a story that may be better in movie form, here's your screenplay. Demos' format of breaking up the flow of the book with actual quotes, manuscripts, and other correspondence really takes away from what could be an interesting and quite intriguing story of an upscale colonial Massachusetts family torn apart when a daughter is not \\"redeemed\\" from her savage captors and in fact assimilates their culture.

It has been several years since I finished it, so I am sorry that I cannot cite specific examples in this review. In general, I found it to be full of unsupported conclusions, vast misunderstandings of the Colonials involved, and almost entirely misleading. That it is still in print, and recommeded by many, is a testament to the paucity of knowledge of this imporant period in our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding historical vignette","review":"The Unredeemed Captive is an outstanding chronicle of life in Puritan New England, the surprisingly fluid interface between native and immigrant peoples, and the fixity of early 18th religious beliefs in English and French North America. John Demos is scrupulous but not tedious. He manages to convey his sympathies for the affected parties without producing a melodrama. The book is a story of the abduction and adoption of American settlers by Iroquois people, with elaborate and surprising repercussions. Despite this potentially explosive subject matter, Demos chooses an even-handed approach, with fascinating vignettes on the Puritan belief system, the French-Iroquois alliance, the Iroquois family structure, and the troubles of native peoples who sought alliance with English settlers. I think Demos struck the right balance to capture the interest of non-historians and yet create a richly-documented source.

The better your graphic card, the further you will be able to see. The new diagonal pool tool is handy too, I've made some interesting shapes with my water.I think one of my most favorite objects with this expansion are the colored lights (the lights can change the color of the room). That really helps set the tone for a variety of clubs or diners that I have built.

The album spawned three big hits. \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today\\", which in my opinion is a great country song and one of his best and most moving hits. \\"I'm Not Ready Yet\\" and \\"If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)\\" were the other hits from teh album. The remaining tracks are exceptionally strong, without a weak track in the bunch. The songs are simple, direct, and emotionally powerful, even with the smooth production. This album is the sound of George Jones at his peak and it's the highlight of his later years. The album also features 4 bonus tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weed killer","review":"I purchased this from Amazon recently hoping to find something better than Roundup.

In other words, there is rarely anything new in his books, and in some past books, most notably his book on Ulysses Grant, there are some glaring errors that any author/historian and editor would be ashamed of.This book is, however, a good read. In fact, while there's little that is new, there are pages here that are just as good as anything in a JFK biography. There's a grace to some of the writing in this book.Sometimes I found myself cringing at some of his sources (Seymour Hersh's book comes to mind), but for the most part it's assembled well.Despite the number of JFK books out there, there are few one volume titles out there. This might be a good place to start if that's what you're seeking."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZ","review":"Mr. Perret somehow succeeded in writing an incredibly boring book about a man who lived an extrodinary life. The book is also marred by continuous misstatements of fact and poor research. To those looking for a good book on JFK, I advise you to take a look at Nigel Hamilton's \\"JFK: Reckless Youth\\" for illumination on his early life, Richard Reeves' \\"Profile in Power\\" for a broad look at his presidency, and Arthur Schlessinger Jr.'s \\"A Thousand Days\\" for an intimate look at his presidency that also gives you an excellent sense of who he was as a person. \\"Jack\\" isn't worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is the definition of the adicts","review":"this cd has all of the adicts' greatest hits, exept for the songs on \\"songs of praise\\" you should also buy that one too. this is just what the adicts are all about if you want to get into a good punk band then i suggest you start off with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey hey I wanna chinese Take-away....whooo whoo whooo","review":"One of their best releases.

I am a high school drama teacher, and I have 14 and 15 year olds who can act better than these so-called professional actors! The direction was horrible, too. They say that this was probably how Shakespeare was actually played in the 16th Century. Bull! If any acting company ever played him like this, they would have been out of business really soon.

The audio was unitelligible, large parts of the play were out of focus and the digital navigation was impossible to use. While none of this is the fault of Amazon, the end result is a little like selling a book with several chapters missing.

However, I often wonder, how much of what he writes lyrically is done as tongue-in-cheek material vs. ��ber right wing/redneck/jingoistic BS -- only Lee knows for sure. Regardless, there's something compelling about this band; I've always enjoyed Lee's unique vocals, and I'm glad that he's still playing music, even though he's now old enough to start collecting social security!My top five favorite songs on this album are (in no particular order): 1) USA 2) Back to do Battle Again. 3) Demons Sticking Pitchforks in My Brain 4) Ugly as You 5) Public Hangings.Beautiful, free, for victory...

I thought this might work. Well, the nature sounds are the WORST I have ever heard. The LCS is not that big or bright and the snooze button is very close to the OFF button which is not good. I guess for someone who really likes gadgets and studies their new electonic toys may like this clock, but personally I found it confusing. This is not a pull out of the box and use clock. I swear you couldn't figure out how to set the alarm without the manual. You have to push 3-4 buttons to accomplish it. What we wanted if for was useless and there was WAY too many stupid extras. We ended up selling ours at a yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK But Not Perfect","review":"First of all, the nature sounds are horrible and completely unrealistic. If you're considering getting this product just for the nature sounds, you're better off buying something else. If you're an audiophile and are easily annoyed by poor sound quality of radio stations and plan on using this as your primary radio, then get something else.Otherwise, it works okay as an alarm clock. The light is dim enough not to be annoying when I am trying to sleep, and I am really sensitive to light in my bedroom when trying to fall asleep. The alarm goes off on time. I can set one alarm with the buzzer and one with the radio for a backup alarm if I fall asleep after turning off the first alarm.I'm sure there are better alarm clocks out there, but I have a hard time finding alarm clocks without annoyingly bright digital time displays that keep me awake at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 days and kaput","review":"After some careful research, I bought this product and was pretty satisfied. The buttons are complicated and it isn't straightforward, but after reading the manual - I pretty much grasped it. It comes with a 90 day warranty which is great until you read the fine print. It will cost you more in shipping than it is to buy a new one. Mine worked for 120 days and then the speaker component died. Still keeps time. No sound. Imagine my dismay when I overslept after buying a new alarm clock. This is a poor choice and poorly made. Spend a few extra bucks for something else. By the way, this isn't Timex, it is a rebranded SDI technologies alarm clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for 3 months........","review":"I've had 2 of these and my sister in law also purchased one.

Don't buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Clock radio with nature sounds","review":"My son got this clock radio for the wind\\"natures sounds\\" feature. He needs some type of white noise to sleep. The wind blowing sound worked great. The best part is that he can keep the sound going all night long unlike some other clock radios that only have a short timed noise feature. However, the price we paid was so much less and we bought it new. We paid $24.99 new at BJ's Warehouse Club 3 years ago. So not worth $140 USED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous!!!!","review":"Not only is this easy to use the number of functions it supports is amazing. We use this in our kids room with the nature sounds feature on at night for background noise to help them sleep. The clock also has big easy to read numbers so my 5 year old can now read the time on her own. Great buy....I recommend this clock for anyone who needs something simple and easy to setup. Those other people who had difficulty using this may need to just brush up on their basic reading skills because the manual couldn't be easier to follow, believe me some of my 2 year olds toys are harder to figure out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Radio","review":"After investigating numerous clock radios, I chose this one, and I'm not disappointed. I had a few requirements that eliminated many of the available radios on the market. Because of constant, brief power outages, I not only needed a back-up for the time, but I also wanted to retain my radio presets. This radio does that, and the fact that it's digital, has many alarm features and options, and also looks very good prompted my decision to get it. It sounds great and I personally found it easy to understand and operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex T309T","review":"Enjoy the large display with dimmer feature.

The battery back-up for power failures is also good, and I like the feature where you can set it to different wake-up times for the week and weekend. However, it is clunky to program, with the \\"instructions\\" being insufficient help. The radio is easy to set for listening, but the alarm radio reverts to the factory preset, and it is difficult to figure out how to set it. The \\"nature sounds\\" are really lame as well, because the audio loop is so short. For example, the wave sound is one wave and a bird call so you can go nuts hearing \\"whoosh, squawk, whoosh, squawk, over and over. The \\"forest sounds\\" seem fake, and so on. The only decent one is \\"wind\\" because wind sounds the same no matter how short the loop is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Great clock for the $$.

Instead of a harsh beeping in my ear, I now wake up to the sounds of the ocean and seagulls (one of four nature sounds you can choose).

I find that I don't need to hit snooze nearly as often as I used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time setting is SLOOOOW","review":"It takes way too long to set the time and alarms. You need to hold down the Forward button forever!

First, everytime you set the alarm, it confirms with a loud beep. This makes it impossible to set the alarm without waking my husband if I crawl into bed after him. Second, the buttons are so hard to push, that I have to hold the back of the clock when I'm setting it so it doesn't fall off the night stand. This shouldn't have to be a two-handed operation.

The nature sounds don't work, all I get is obnoxious beeping, and setting it is a pain. If I set more than one alarm (out of the three) a day the only reason it helps me wake up is because I get so confused trying to turn the alarms off that I can't fall back asleep, and start my day grouchy. This is the worst alarm clock I have ever purchased, and my roomate agrees that the beeping is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of c---p","review":"The Timex T309T started out fine, I got it because it had a digital radio which was hard to find at the time.

Now, I can hardly hear it from three feet away. I would NEVER NEVER buy this radio again, and now I would NEVER buy a Timex radio ever again.

The placement of the snooze button and \\"turn the alarm off, really off, for keepsies\\" button is a fatal design flaw for an alarm clock, as it's way too easy to accidentally turn the alarm off when you just want snooze.Another irritant with my alarm clock (I imagine it's just a defect in my particular clock, as I haven't seen it mentioned elsewhere) is that the battery backup doesn't appear to work at all. Which is obviously bad if the power goes out in the middle of the night, but also bad at other times, since reprogramming the thing is a rather laborious process, and somewhat fraught with peril (the AM/PM distinctions aren't always clear.)Nice radio, though, and attractive, but fails at the tasks I need it to be most reliable at performing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex T309T Clock radio","review":"This radio performs very well, the alarms can be set as advertised, while the natures sounds are computer generated, they are pleasant, and the remainder of the electronics and programming work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex Let me down...","review":"This is a fine clock with its multple alarms.

Someone else mentioned this before, but the LED is meant to be viewed from above. The alarm does have settings for adjusting the brightness of the orange LED, the problem is that it's illuminated from top - down, and instead of the numbers being illuminated the background is illuminated in orange. So basically, if you try to read the time when you're looking up to the clock (i.e. if you're laying in bed at or below the level of the clock), it will be harder to read the time because the light (coming from top-down on the display) will interfere with your ability to distinguish the numbers. Very poorly designed, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this alarm clock","review":"I have bought maybe 6 of these over the years because I wanted the nature sounds and the radio for 2 different alarms to be used. Plus I used them in 2 different locations. Each version I purchased had different complicated directions to use them. On a number of occasions I would make a mistake and the alarm would not work.But most importantly, why have I bought these over the years. Because after a short period of time they broke. The radio would not work, the nature sound did not work. The reception got worse. I would have to hold the clock in order to hear the news if I were listening to it. These lasted about 1 year.So I have purchased another brand now and will live without nature sounds.Plus this is really a very ugly looking clock. It also has a thin wire like a string off the back as an antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it if you like it dark","review":"This thing is so bright, even at its dimmest, that we put layers of window tint over the display- but of course now we can't see it in the daytime.

Awkward button configuration and operation. The names are painted on and lettering wears off easily. Then, you have to write on the a,b,c, etc to know what to push to reset it. The automatic daylight time update function failed even after waiting for the previously offical time to pass. I threw mine out and it still operated."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"I got this as a present a few years ago, and I loved it. I used it for about a month and it completely died on me.

U turned it on and was immediately impressed by the sound quality. I could hardly believe that it was coming from a fair cheap alarm clock!The T309 has gobs of extras - three alarms, multiple choices of alarm sounds, sleep sounds, etc. Plus, it's compact and looks better than your average alarm clock. However, I can't say that I was impressed with the button layout which doesn't appear to be very intuitive. Perhaps with regular use this isn't an issue.I ended up buying the 318 (the retro look is what I wanted - the sound isn't as good, however), but I think most buyers would be extremely pleased with this model especially if they're on a budget and want fairly good sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, for your own sake don't buy this clock.","review":"This is my roommate's clock. It's 5:00 in the morning, and I'm just trying to figure out how to set it so I can wake up for class in 3 hours. So far, I've visited the TIMEX website, (which was IMPOSSIBLE to navigate, and didn't even have a section for non-watches) read these reviews in hopes of finding out how to set the freaking thing and messed with it for like 45 minutes, and I've gotten nowhere. Holding down the 'TIME' button makes the time on the display screen flash, but pushing the forward and reverse buttons (at least on my model) does absolutely nothing to change the hour it reads. It keeps randomly making horrible nature sounds even when I don't press anything. It's is a faulty piece of crap that is difficult to use in the first place, and goes haywire within a month of its purchase.I just want to sleep, and this clock is making me wanna die."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all its cracked up to be!!!!","review":"while the design of the clock is appealing, it fails miserably in function. the face of it is angled up, so it has to be placed lowered then your bed so you can see the time. i like to have my alarm clocks across the room on a shelve so i have to literally get out of bed and turn it off which in return keeps me from going back to sleep. even if the clock is exactly level to you, you still cant tell what time it is from across the room. this is truly an awful design for any alarm clock. also the volume wheel is behind the alarm clock which is awkward to get at. but the worse thing yet is the setting of the time and the alarm its just a pain in the arse, you have to go through all the hours and mins to get to the time you want, it doesn't have a thing where you can set the hour, and mins individually so it takes a few minutes to set just hope your electricity doesn't go out allot. i bought it and took it back the next day, truly very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock does not keep good time","review":"I bought this clock radio several years ago for the purpose of having a CD player next to the bed to play audio books and as an alarm clock. For playing CDs it worked perfectly. However, this radio has never kept good time. It always runs fast, it adds a minute about every third day. Within a month it is around 10 minutes fast, thus completely unreliable. How can the most basic function for a clock/watch company not work correctly????Furthermore, the light given off by the display is so bright that I am forced to lay a cloth over it at night.I would definitely not recommend buying this product unless you do not mind reseting the clock once a month (not a big deal, but should not have to be done for a digital clock)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sounds, terrible clock","review":"We've been using this radio for the last year and enjoy waking to the gradually increasing nature sounds. Problem is that the \\"clock\\" keeps terrible time. The clock will go out of sync with a regularly updated clock source (cable box, cell phone) by a minute within a month of setting. Over six months you're getting up more than 5 minutes later than desired. Not sure how the manufacturer could make such a huge mistake. It is the worse clock in the house.

In my opinion this tank could be somewhat better with just a few modifications from the factory. The tank vent and fuel line hookups are different fittings, making interchangability difficult. I had to install the tank reverse of what I am sure is intended due to the very large protrusion of the filler neck; this necessitated the reversal of the vent and fuel line fittings. I had to purchase a seperate pickup tube assembly to work with the vent fitting.This tank would have been perfect for my application if either the filler inlet were not so high above the deck of the tank, or if the fittings were easily reversible.Overall, a well constructed product. Suits my needs well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not riveting","review":"What I probably enjoyed most about this book was learning about the early part of Murray's life. I was amazed that he served in World War II and how success he was in his advertising career before Formula 1.I found much of the story after this a little repetitive and hap-hazard in way that it was presented. I also felt it was also drawn out in many ways which was disappointing. The information about the growth in popularity and the behind the scenes of Formula 1 was certainly of interest to me being fan but as I said a little drawn out.If you are a fan of Murray and are interested in how he came to be the voice of Formula 1 then I'd recommend you have a read. If you are looking for an insiders look at one of the biggest sports in the world I'd suggest another book maybe more appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogance at its worst","review":"Technically, this book is not a disaster: the basics of sport fencing are covered reasonably enough.But the author has no respect for the tradition of fencing, nor does he come off as being more than anything than a \\"Sport Fencer\\" and semi-literate jock who has nothing but his own glorification in mind when he writes.The most intolerable and tedious part of this tome is the \\"Fencing Journal.\\" I must applaud whoever his maestro was, because he must have had the patience of a saint to put up with the author's temper tantrums, disgraceful behavior and overall infantilism.This book is asinine. I would highly recommend Nick Evangelista's books and BY THE SWORD by Cohen for a true sentiment de fer. Avoid this piece of garbage like the plague, or if you must sbject yourself, get it at the local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Summary of Fencing Techniques","review":"The first part of Mr. Werner's book covers the basics of the three weapons (foil, epee, and saber), and the second half is a autobiographical account of the author's experiences begining to fence. The first half of the book is very light...not explaining footwork, stances, or bladework in enough detail to be truly helpful. The photos used are not very helpful either, even though the use of PVC tubes over the blades to increase visibility in the photos is a good idea. The journal is interesting, but leaves me with little respect for the author. He comes across as whiny and slightly juvenile in his approach to fencing. I would pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tin Pan Alley Goes to War","review":"One of the best general discussions about popular music during World War II currently available.

While the music is set in a bluesy/folk style, remember that both Brian andFlouridewere Bay area legends of the Mabuhay Gardens punk scene, but I assume you already know this if you are searching for this disc.

The songs seem to be a compilation of 3 musical groups, with the \\"piano-bar\\" style being the best It reminded me of weddings from the 1950's:piano player \\"sounded\\" ;\\\\like a cross between Carmen Cavallerro and Eddie Duchin. The second group may have been the Harmmonicats, don't know as there is no listing of any participants. The third group came off as a weak Ziggy Elman Orchestra : not making the grade.

The author goes to great pains to argue that it is hard to make a living in rural VT. This book seems like something the author and photographer did to pay their bills while living in rural VT, not because they had something to offer. I found the book quite disjointed. It wasn't chronological, thematic, person-centered or anything else. I ended the book not having learned much about the people, their farming, or much else. The pictures were nice, but I wasn't really looking for a coffee table book; I was looking for a book about people farming on a small organic farm in VT, and did not get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a book about organic farming or about a marriage falling apart?","review":"I was expecting a book with more details on how organic farming is actually done. Instead, I found the book to be more a drama of a marriage in danger of falling apart. I found that the author seems to portray characters very negatively. I came away from the book saying, \\"I certainly wouldn't want this author to do a book about ME!\\" I also found the book to be clumsy to hold, and a funny shape for good reading. It seems like it is meant to be a coffee table book rather than a real read. My biggest disappointment, however, is the simple fact that I was looking for a book with ideas on how to actually make an organic farm work, but instead found a book that portrays organic farming in such a negative light that who would want to try after reading this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Polder 9102-87 Add 'N' Weigh Kitchen Scale","review":"Did not work.

I have a difficult time accepting that these are staged because the ANGER and SURPRISE from those calling in feels too real. I can only imagine the stuff RePete has in the vaults that his other victims refuse to sign releases for - there MUST be even MORE where this came from. That's what makes the last two releases of the four the most funny - the ANGER and DISRESPECT. The first two were more about making the other person laugh; these, on the other hand are about making the person on the other line VULNERABLE to ABUSE. Junkyard Willie and crew are SCREAMS. This is GREAT stuff - absolute GOLD. Not only that, but I still laugh hard even after multiple plays.

Please release it! What an awesome musical! Definitely one of my all-time fav's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the name implies","review":"Very disapointed. Not what the name implies. It is in fact all about the auditions. Very little or nothing about the making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Please Do Justice to \\"Miss Saigon\\"","review":"As some of the reviewers below have pointed out, this DVD is primarly about the auditions for Miss Saigon, and in that sense it is merely a \\"tease\\" for those of us craving to see the actual musical on DVD. And while it is exciting to see Lea Salonga audition and be selected for the lead role, it is overall a very disappointing DVD because of what it is not. I cannot understand why Miss Saigon, one of the greatest musicals ever, has never been filmed for DVD release. Perhaps if the recent DVD release of the musical Chess (another fantastic musical) with Josh Groban is successful, someone will release this outstanding musical for the enjoyment of generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heat is on!","review":"I loved this video! I am a huge theater buff, who's been in quite a few plays and to see all of the elements come together for one of the greatest shows ever, rocked! I always wondered how they found Lea Salonga, who I adore, and I loved seeing all the drama and tension that goes into making a show. I have to say, I was a tad dissapointed that they didn't show more snippets of the show, but the parts they do show I loved. I would have liked to have seen more of Simon Bowman (the best chris ever!)but overall, I loved the movie, and like I was there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't seen it, but not quite what I'm looking for","review":"I think this would be an exellent documentary, but what about those of us who want to watch the actual show? I may sound toodemanding, but I can't drive to all the larger towns that have regular showings of this. I have seen the show once at MSU. But I would also like to have it where I live, so when I want to experience those feelings that the story and it's characters bring out, I can just pop in the video(or DVD) and be satisfied. True, it may never completely acomplish the \\"full-effect\\" of see it live, but it's close. All I can find is the making. If anyone has the entire production, let me know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great resource","review":"I think that this book is very well written for the age that it was intended for.

After fiddling with it close to an hour, I went on YouTube expecting to find the trick that would make me feel foolish. Nope. Even the HP website was a bit vague. In some places they seemed to suggest the 49x and 49a both fit the same range of models. They do not. The 49x fits LaserJet 1320, LaserJet 1320N, LaserJet 1320NW, LaserJet 1320T, LaserJet 1320TN, LaserJet 3390, LaserJet 3392. Hopefully Amazon corrects their compatibility guide soon.

It has been a long wait and I'm going to be the first to buy the next DVD, or next 9 episodes. Wish MPI would put them out a bit faster, though.

He stated Robert Maitland who was only in the election because of petition. He did not ask to be in the election. He was also accused of be negative towards the Bishop until Rev. Maitlands' retirement. I know first hand Rev. Maitland had much better things in his life than to sit at his desk all day and make up ways to be critical about Bishop Spong. I read the chapter about Rev. Maitland the day before his memorial service was held, he was my father. Bishop Spong has a one sided thought when it came to the Bishop of Newark election. He was not the great one he thinks he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The courage to be free","review":"While not as gripping or intriguing as his theological works, this does provide some personal context for those who are already familiar with those works. As a gay man who was raised as a Roman Catholic and still has a deep, questioning sense of faith and spirituality, Spong's works and lectures (on his occasional visits to Australia) have long been a source of inspiration. As others have mentioned, the other value of the book is its demonstration of just how flawed and human the Episcopal Church and the wider Anglican communion are as institutions. In this, they are by no means unique, but thanks to charismatic and courageous individuals like Spong, both seem to be on the road to change and reformation - albeit a long and halting journey. I'm looking forward to his new book on eternal life in late 2009 and (hopefully) some Australian appearances as part of the book tour"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book would stand alone even if not written by Spong...","review":"This is a well-written biography and many parts of it can stand with pride as JUST biography without needing to have been written by one of the more prominant thelogians of a generation to sell books. Spong's life IS an interesting story-- he has seen a lot and done a lot, and because of that, his life story is worth reading.Setting that aside, this book provides great insight into his theology AND ALSO into the process of one man's travels through a career in the Church. You can see him struggle, you can see him scheme. Unfortunately at times, you can still see him bitter and seething over people with whom he had conflict (though many of these were for VERY GOOD reasons.... I was still a bit put off by it...)This is probably my second-favorite book by Spong: if new to the author, I would read 'Why Christianity Must Change or Die' or 'Liberating the Gospels' before this, but still, I highly recommend this book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"My FAVORITE","review":"This chili is delicious.

Aside from the In Petto Mix of \\"Toca Me\\", I didn't warm up to that track - and personally I feel the vocals add to it. Either with or without vocals though \\"Toca\\" is a killer track. It may have become more commercial as a result of the vocals, but this is a track that may help trance break into the mainstream (which may be negative or positive whichever way you look at it). Could be a big summer dance hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"a behind-the-scenes look at my favorite show","review":"I am a SERIOUS _Mary Tyler Moore Show_ fan, and this book was on my wish list for years.

I have the original LP and looked forward to hearing Anton Karas's wonderful music in a pristine recording. Imagine my dismay when it merely turned out to be audio tracks from the movie.

Hopefully the REAL soundtrack will someday be made available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Discoforme soundtracks! www.discoforme.ad","review":"What a rip-off! Discoforme, the maker of this soundtrack and others, makes no effort to bring you the music from this film, it just takes the sound and reproduces it without any refining. A very lazy and negligent method and that gives you a total of only about 10 minutes of music and 35 minutes of yada type talking ON EVERY TRACK. This spoiled it for me, fer sure. If I wanted all that talking, I would have bought the DVD. This is obviously their method/shortcut, as another CD, \\"Young Man With a Horn\\", bought at the same time, and also by Discoforme, does the exact same thing...spits on the fine music by Max Steiner, and gives you ongoing CHATTER. Both are marked *50th ANNIVERSARY*. Do not buy either CD, and beware of the DISCOFORME trademark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Stupid me, I should have read the reviews. This is not what I would call a \\"soundtrack;\\" it is a recording of the sound portion of the movie, dialogue and all. And, not remastered or anything.

Of course, it will be tape, not a CD, but you won't play it a lot anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Soundtrack\\" title is correct, but misleading.","review":"The release of this CD was to be the fulfillment of my search for the original recordings of Anton Kara's brilliant musical background to The Third Man. It turned out to be nothing more than a recording of the \\"soundtrack\\" of the movie itself, or at least the portions of the movie that contained Karas' music. I could have done this myself!! Although I am partially pleased with getting the 'original' score by Karas, it is very distracting to hear the sounds of the actors' voices and other background noises of the film on top of that score. I have purchased other movie \\"soundtrack\\" CDs before, and none of them contained dialogue from the movie. In that regard, the use of the term \\"soundtrack\\" for this CD is very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talking throughout soundtrack - do not buy","review":"What a disappointment to buy this CD. The composer, Anton Karas, had written a very memorable soundtrack for this movie, one of the most charming and original pieces and arrangements of any soundtrack, up there for 1940s classic movie soundtracks with \\"Laura\\" by Raksin, Korngold's \\"The Sea Hawk\\" or Kosma's \\"Les Enfants du Paradis,\\" so what a shock to discover that all tracks have dialogue from the movie - that is right, ALL, even the main theme at the beginning (Track 2). Who can enjoy Karas' music beneath the spoken track - indeed, one can hear a most varied and interesting variation on his theme that would be very enjoyable to hear without the babble! Avoid this CD at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful CD","review":"When I ordered this CD, I thought it would be the wonderful music from the film.

Also, I would like more than the English word that is the \\"closest match\\"; I'd like the meaning of the Kurdish words. Finally, it is far from thorough. Many simple English words just aren't there. This book would be good to have if you were traveling through Kurdistan and could refer to the book for a word or two here and there.

While that was initially pretty, I realized it is impossible to write on the left-hand side of the journal, because those two inches or so are not supported! It's hard to explain this without a photograph, but when you open it up, the journal has a strong back behind the right hand side (plus a little flap that will wrap around to meet the other side in the front when you close it), but because of the way it opens, only the inner 2/3rds of the left hand pages have a backing.I'd stick with the other wrap journals if I were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you would think!","review":"I have to admit, this is a good album, really good.

Just like his previous album, The Saga Continues, he bites other rappers' styles (not to mention paying people to write his rhymes!), and he continues to commercialize and fake rap music. What was once a genre of music full of talent, ambition, feeling, and passion is now being corrupted by insincere losers who only care about making money so they can turn out even more of their poorly made music. Diddy's rhymes are even more corny on this album than those on his previous album, The Saga Continues.

I am extraordinarily loyal to MZB, and practically went to the ends of human boundaries with MoA; it was truly an experience from a different astral plane.While the Forest House was mystical and transcendent, I was rather frustrated by the prissiness of Vernemeton. However, I enjoyed it immensely, and found that MZB knit Roman and Celtic narratives seamlessly. I especially enjoyed the festivals such as Samhain and Beltane.In MZB sensory details I identified Vernemeton as the mystical hiking trail in Calfornia which transports one to another time. With this novel, it helps to have pictures in your mind of what MZB is talking about.Though Eilan's death didn't touch me as much as Viviane's did, it was still haunting. I would recommend Forest House both as a stepping-stone and a book unto itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Forest House","review":"I regard Marion Zimmer Bradley as probably the best author I have ever come across. I marvel at the research that she must put into her historical books and the depth of human emotions that she weaves in.

It's not quite up to snuff with her masterpiece THE MISTS OF AVALON (for which it is a prequel) but it is still a gorgeously written, feminist examination of the conflict between Druidic and Roman cultures in early Britain. I recommend reading it after you read THE MISTS OF AVALON, because you'll get more out of this book and also color what you learned in MISTS in sharper focus.I also recommend reading one of Zimmer Bradley's early novels, THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, which was recently put back into print by Baen Books. THE FOREST HOUSE alludes to Atlantean culture as an ancient source for Druidism, and if you've read THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, you'll pick up on some of that. It's cool to see how Zimmer Bradley's books fit together, even if they were written thirty years apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel, pure and commercial.","review":"M. Z. B. wrote a seminal book in The Mists Of Avalon. Well researched, well written, and utterly absorbing. The whole book hangs together as a complex tale covering three generations, don't read it once, read it three times. The Forest House is a prequel leading nowhere. A promising beginning, a middling middle,... and no ending, it just sorts of tails off... The last page is not a disappointment, it's a relief - and thank the Goddess that I read The Mists Of Avalon first. I can't help feeling that this book, and others she has written in the same vein, lack the passion, the vision, and are only written with one thing in mind, to milk the market after a truly brilliant novel. Read Mists Of Avalon first and avoid all her other offerings or risk disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forest House -excellent in its own right","review":"The Forest House was an excellent book that gives a uniqueperspective on the time period it was written. While it is a prequel of the Mists of Avalon, the story is very different and entertaining. While 'The Mists' swept you up into the realms of King Arthur from a new perspective, The Forest House took place long before Arthur. The Romans were the 'rulers' of the time,and the author vividly told the story of love and sacrifice. While both books are connected in a series, they cannot and should not be compared on their content, but on their quality. I think that Zimmer Bradley did another excellent job on a story well told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooof! Weak and Melodramatic","review":"Now I have read The Forest House three times to be certain I would give it a judicious review. In the end, I have to dismiss this book as a try on MZB's part to simulate a romance novel. Instead of subtlety I found moments of melodrama. The central romance was boring because Eilan and Gaius were boring (and wishy-washy and conceited and totally without a clue and...and...) I can't stand books in which the characters think themselves the center of the universe, and Forest House is full of these. On a smaller note, I found MZB's rendition of the Celtic Samhain into Samaine very amusing and indicative of the care with which this book was written. To top it off, this isn't even an original story--it's an interpretation of the opera Norma. Read if you must, but you might find having a grain of salt and good humor to be assets. For me personally The Forest House is too full of the ridiculous to affect me any more than with a sour stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"no problems","review":"no problems, everything arrived on time and in good condition, no errors or breakage contained in the order.

In this book, freed from any historical (or mythological) plot, Ms Bradley writes a feminist, revisionist story of Roman England. Here all the women are wistful long suffering philosophers or harridan revolutionaries and all of the men are boarish, ignorant louts whose sole purpose is to make the lives of the women miserable.The Mists of Avalon was a great book.

True, I could never expect to read a book again that evokes the same feelings as Mists, but TFH was even worse than \\"not as good as TMOH\\". Bradley's characters are dull and lifeless, and the plot was a barely strung together excuse to show off all of Bradley's research.

Marion Zimmer Bradley delivers all in spades. Focusing primarily on the females characters, she does a great job of arcing the main character, Eilan from care-free child to Warrior-Priestess. Zimmer Bradley gives us an interesting, extremely dense story that mixes action, magic and romance into a female-empowering tale. The characters are fairly sympathetic, especially when suffering frustrated love pangs, and thesub plots are just as intriguing as the main story line.Though the story sometimes strays too much into Female Empowerment Land (thanks to chapters devoted to menstrual blood rites and spell casting), Forest House presents lots of cliffhangers and surprises. MUCH better than its sequel, LADY OF AVALON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Again, too dull to finish. Perhaps it has something to do with it trying to connect to The Mists of Avalon, but being completely different, and just two characters that have been created to have a romance, a Roman, and one of the priestesses of the local religion.

I read this book within thirty-six hours. I found it utterly absorbing, and written so well that I found myself right there with the characters. Although nothing will ever be able to outdo Mists, this book isn't trying to. It exists separately, and works well by itself, almost as The Hobbit works with or without The Lord of the Rings. I was extrememly disappointed in the editing of the book, however. As an honours English student, I find it hard to read a book with missing quotation marks and ., all over the place. When I read a history book with bad editing errors, I refuse to finish it- if they've missed simple grammatical mistakes, what else might they have messed up on? It's lucky the content of the book is so good, or I would have put it down.

I'm especially grateful for the quotes attributed to Hossein Payghambary of Nomad carpet shop in Isfahan. I rarely read a book more than once BUT this has drawn me to do so because of the rich text and the author's compassion for his subject. This is MUST read for anyone with a heart for carpets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Underfoot","review":"Brian Murphy has given us a reverential yet factual account of his journey through the tradition, construction, and marketing of Oriental rugs. His descriptions of the Afgan countryside are heartbreaking, but the converstions with those in the business of dyeing, weaving, and selling rugs are as affecting as they are informative. An old Turkmen saying conveys the essence of their rug tradition: \\"Carpets are our soul.\\" Or, as a young woman says as she completes knotting a section of the rug she is working on, \\"It is like a small world all alone and separate: perfect and peaceful.\\" Murphy explores the debates on authenticity: spontaneous folk art versus commercial product; synthetic dyes versus the natural dyes of the book's title. He does not shrink from showing us the enormous contrasts between the harsh life of the area and the poetic beauty of their rugs. In the end it is clear that he is an unabashed lover of Oriental rugs....and that's not a bad thing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACABANDO CON EL KUKITO","review":"ES DIFICIL ESCOJER LOS MEJORES TEMAS DEL GRAN TONO ROSARIO..LA GOZADERA--OTRA COMO TU--DAME ..14 EXITOS EN ESTA COLLECION..ME HUBIERA GUSTADO QUE LOS TEMAS..ESTUPIDA Y QUIERO VOLVER A EMPEZAR ESTUBIERAN EN ESTE CD..RECOMIENDO TAMBIEN \\"SEGUIRE\\"Y \\"QUIERO VOLVER A EMPEZAR\\".."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie....","review":"I love this movie, it's cute and you got to love the respect between boss and employee,two best friends.

I have only had to change the black twice in over a year and I have printed off a lot of copies. You can even photocopy Photos and they come out nearly perfect.For the past 3 months I have had this machine hooked up to my Windows XP system and have been using it to print and copy everything and it is working like a charm with very good quality.The only downside I have found is the scan quality is not up to my standards, so I do no use that feature on this machine. Thus the reason for only 4 stars.All in all, this is a decent machine and an excellent product for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful for what you get","review":"I used this machina purely as a copy machine, the result is very bad experience. First, xerox told me if had to be used everyday and can't turn it off, just leave it for sleep mode, I don't know about you, but they sound weired. Ok, the problems is that the machine took forever to make a good copy under normal use. I used it occasionally, say a copy here and three days later. Then you have to wait for up to 7-8 of blank pages to come out, before the copier even produce some black ink on the paper. So, you have to clean the head and realign the ink tank. The reason, the prolonged inactivity may clog the print head. Well, I just don't have the need to make a needless copy everyday. My Hp never have this problem.There is design flaurs in this machine.

They no longer have a toll-free phone number for users of home products and email requests for help are returned. (Will only receive email from this domain: XEROX.com). My Workcentre is less than 6 months old and I purchased an extended warranty. After many problems and attempted fixes, my computer won't boot when it's connected. The utility and instructions sent by XEROX don't help. It made my computer settings go haywire, and they could only be restored by disconnecting the Workcentre entirely. I've now been w/o a printer for over a week and have spent much time on long distance phone calls. Since the tech support line has limited hours, I'll have to wait another day to try again. I've been misdirected 3 times and now have a NEW long distance number to try. As of now, problem still has not been resolved. Disappointing (and expensive) all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this machine and Xerox","review":"Less than one year ago I bought the Xerox M940. I had heard good reports about Xerox and it's service. The service is very poor, and so is the life of their print heads. Within 8 months the color print head showed signs of wear. Xerox offers a 12 month warrenty on this product. But, as I found out, it doesn't cover the [money] color print head, nor the [money] black print head.

This was a real inconvenience because all I used it for was a B&W copier, scanner, and B&W printer. This past week, it ran out of magenta ink, and now refuses to print, even in black and white. There must be a way to bypass the ink sensor and continue printing in black and white -- does anyone know how to fool it? Yesterday I found that nobody (local) carries those color ink cartridges anymore, so unless I can make it _think_ there's magenta ink, the machine is now USELESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense cd!!!","review":"Interesting works this legend of Cuban percussion musical as it was Mongo Santamaria.

What sorts of problems and awkwardness arise? How do you explain being poly to your grandfather who is skeptical?? The only mention of this subject is a passing reference when the Authors discuss the reasons people choose not to marry. One reason, they say is so-and-so might have more than one partner. The rest of the book consists of boring facts about common law marriage and so forth which can be found in any marriage guide. It appears Solot and Miller are trying to appeal to the mainstream.....

Contestants get read trivia questions and the first one to buzz in and answer the question correct gets points for their team!This product looks kind of like a toy but performs like the expensive buzzer sets the schools use. The young people and adults really like the buzzers. It seems very durable and I like the built in timer and the different options on how to use the buzzers. The little kids like the talking mode. The only thing I would say could be improved is the length of the cords to the buzzers. The teams have to sit close together facing each other. You can get extensions like one review mentioned earlier, just put a piece of electrical tape around the connections to the extensions to keep them from being pulled apart during the contest. Good product and I do think it is well worth the money!

There were too many twists and turns, some plausible, some not...In my opinion, not his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Talks \\"This Way?\\"","review":"... when facing an imminent prospect of death by the misguided indifferent? Instead of a solemn, contemplative, passionate or a heated exchange between the protagonists when discussing the weighty issue of organ theft, the dialog tends to the lowest common denominator with each character (including highly educated doctors!) seeking to make his or her respective point by being sarcastic with cringe-worthy comebacks.I would have appreciated a more even-handed approach in presenting both sides of the issue to provoke a true examination; instead, the ostensible \\"guardians\\" are given a short shrift."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VILE TRUTH ABOUT ILLEGAL TRANSPLANT-ORGANS","review":"Okay, so this is the year of novels about organ donation as big business and the horrors involved. Similar in some respects to Michael Crichton's Next, Palmer's latest explores the illegal transplant-organ trade. Three characters ( a brilliant Harvard Medical School student, a Chicago private investigator and a research doctor in Cameroon)each play a role in tracking down a powerful conspiracy network.This book is better than Crichtons, but they are both exploring the same territory, so if you have to make a choice, this is the book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear your schedule before you open this book","review":"This book is an excellent read. The characters are all very human, the story is eye-opening and believable. If you like medical thrillers, you will love this book.

The story keeps you in it's grip from page one, and it does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average read","review":"The Fifth Vial by Michael Palmer is a bit stiff in places but overall it delivers on suspense and an engaging story. That's what we're after right?The story revolves around three quite different characters, a Harvard Medical School student, a private eye, and a medical researcher, each located in a differnt part of the world. Their connection? A medical research group called the Guardians. With rapid fire story delivery, Palmer takes the reader into the world of organ transplants, science pushed too far too quickly and big money medical research.You should be able to read this one in a long day and you'll find yourself asking for more. If you do want more and have the time read Next, Crichton's latest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Finish","review":"I didn't even make it to 20% of The Fifth Vial before I decided to throw in the towel. For a thriller it starts out incredibly slow. Maybe, I have been spoiled by the few thrillers that I have read because they all just jumped right into the action.Palmer spends the first 50 pages (probably more but I didn't wait to find out) developing the characters and I did not care for the ones that I had met. They had interesting backstories and I thought that he did a nice job of create a history for them.Overall, the writing was just not engaging enough of me to continue. It was too easy for me to put this one down and forget about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Michael Palmer is truly a gifted man!

I especially enjoyed the character, Natalie, a medical student who is of Cape Verdean.

This is ridiculous!\\"The forced \\"romance\\" between two major characters near the end was out-of-place and riddled with stilted, silly dialogue. The constant references to Plato, as well, just got dull by the end.I can't believe I read the whole thing.This was the first Michael Palmer book I have ever read, and most likely will be the last. I was glad I checked it out from the library first, instead of purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsophisticated","review":"Simple, unsophisticated read, of the kind that tells you what will happen, then walks you through the happening, followed by an explanation of what had occurred.The story is unimaginative (human organ harvesting administered by an evil council of scientists).

I usually read highfalutin' type novels - those which are part of somebody's \\"Great American Novel\\" class. But this book is totally gripping - just the kind of thing you need if you want:a) a total change of pace from your hum-drum life activities,b) a thoroughly entertaining hiatus if you have some down time (vacation, hospital stay or recuperation)c) a candidate for a \\"Great American Novel\\" class.Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good listening","review":"First of all,these tapes are very well spoken.You have got contributions from Richard Stack,Stephen LaBerge Ph.D,Robert Monroe,and Raymond Moody M.D. The first tape consists of Rick Stack's first OBE's as well a techniqes on how to have your own OBE's.The second,Robert monroe explains Hemi-Sync and also tells his story about the OBE.In the third tape,Raymond moody explains life after death as(life after life).The forth tape is about controling your dreams.Stephen LaBerge goes in to detail on how to do this with ease.There is so much information in these tapes.If you are interested in any of these things whether you are expirienced or not,this is a good buy,and worth every penny.I liked the realness and the expirence of the authors/readers.Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people are such snobs!","review":"Get over yourselves.

It didn't help that when I saw them play at Satyricon in Portland, that they had no nuance what-so-ever. The drummer just played as loud as he could the whole time. He said absolutely nothin' by doin' so. I was impressed by the harmonica playing, but I was not sold by this band in the least. If it's guitar drums and vocals that you're after (no bass guitar), then get yourself ahold of Elmo Williams and Hezekiah Early's CD called Takes One To Know One. The Flat Duo Jets' first few LP's are also incredible and worth finding although they is outta print (self-titled and Go Go Harlem Baby). Their in-print stuff is pretty good too, though. The first single and LP by The Gossip are also really great, too. Don't forget about the two-guitar and drums attack of Hound Dog Taylor and his Houserockers.
