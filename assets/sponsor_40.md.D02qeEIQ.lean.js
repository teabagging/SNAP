The set is really cute & they enjoy pretending to cook. I agree with the other reviews that the sounds coming from the oven (a timer), the boiling water & the telephone are just a little bit too loud. This seems to be the case with all of the Loving Family dollhouse furniture sets that make noise. They either need a volume control or just to turn down the volume to begin with. The set is really cute, though, and I love the fact that it is very new-aged with the stainless steel appliances. The dishwasher is cute, but the rack is a little hard to get out & push back in. The double highchair is cute, but I agree with the other reviewer that it is a little hard to put the babies into- you have to work at it a little while. I would purchase this again, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for pre-schoolers","review":"This is perfect for pre-schoolers.

I had to remove the batteries because the sounds were loud, irritating, and startling, even for an adult. This is too bad, since we have enjoyed other Loving Family pieces with lights and sound and it was a major reason for my hunting down this set (and paying way too much for it, I might add). What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather loud and annoying to play with.","review":"I bought the Loving Family Dollhouse for my almost 4 year old twins for Christmas. This is one of the sets I bought them to go with it. After you press the oven button and it makes the bubbling noise, about 30 seconds after it is done making that noise, it makes the sound of a ringing phone. My kids were not really into all of the sounds, and I think that detered them from playing with it. The sounds are very loud, and you cannot distinguish between the stove sound, coffee brewing sound, etc.The oven does have a light that goes on when you open it up, but it too makes a loud beeping sound, like a timer going off.I think either some kids love it or hate it. Mine really didn't take to it, so I returned it for a kitchen that is wooden and makes no noise.I don't know why Fisher Price couldn't make this more muted, and maybe just one or 2 sounds. It could be overstimulating for some children."},{"rating":"2","title":"kitchen set","review":"This is a fun set to get because the fridge opens, the phone rings, the oven opens, there is food for the oven and fridge (I wish the fridge food was separated though, it is in one big clump).

Sure the final essay in the volume is not an easy read, but if you think Bakhtin is hard to read try Heidegger when he grooves along with his own lingo. Bakhtin's key idea of contextual language and the many voicedness of novels against the backdrop of an author's voice and that of his times is prehaps the sum total of what the novel as a genre is. In fact, the novel is not quite a genre but an ongoing process that escapes ossification as it changes with the times. Wonderfully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dialogic Imagination","review":"Excellent condition.Excellent translation of Bakhtin whose writing is a Russian take on phenomenology.

There are also many accessories out there for it like a car adapter so you can run it off your car battery, 8 and 16 megabyte storage disks, PC connector plug, mapping CD's for the computer to load higher detailed maps onto storage disks. The basemap is good enough for the US but if your going out of the country, the CD's are a must and you might want to look into the deluxe version. The Emap will not work under a roof; you will have to be outside for it to work. It will work in a car or bus but the signal is stronger in the open. All in all it fits my needs. It's the best if you're not looking for something fancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONFUSING USER MANUAL","review":"I regret to say that the instruction manual was so user unfriendly that I was unable understand how to make the unit perform simple functions such as entering route waypoints, etc. While not exactly a natural electronics whiz, I am also not technologically illiterate.

I have not ever had a single complaint with them, and I still use them heavily today. When my dad bought a 4.1 Creative setup for his computer, it still didn't compare. To this day, I have not heard a better PC speaker system with comparable specs at the same price. I only wish they were still widely available. I'd get my dad a set for his birthday.After 12 years, they show no signs of wear, which is good, because I'm not sure what I will do when they eventually die.If you can get your hands on a set of these nowadays, do it, because it'll be well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy","review":"I've had these speakers for FIVE years and have not had any problems whatsoever.

I checked and re-checked all of the hook-ups and outlets and power source, etc, and still no sound at all. Why would they just stop producing sound?Is it because they sat dormant for 4 years?

Although you may have heard some of these songs sung by other artists (\\"May It Be\\", \\"Now We Are Free\\", \\"Carrickfergus\\" come to mind), you will definitely want to listen to them again sung by Lisa.This is a great example of someone who has a lot of substance and talent, but not necessarily looking for excessive fame.

A waste of money.","review":"Thin book with lots of space between lines; expected the book to last for a two-hop flight; finished it on the first hop (only because there was nothing else to read). Thin plot to the point of transparency. Thinly and weakly developed characters. Thin and unsupported premises. Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!! Run while you still have the chance!!","review":"Reading \\"The Blessing\\" left me with a general feeling of ughness that lingers even as I am typing up this review. Unrealistic plot and characters that crashed straight through the ground and past into the Earth's core. Jason (with his lion's mane of gray hair) and Amy are burning from the high temperature!! Don't save them! I, as a devoted Jude Deveraux fan for all my young years, am thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Jude Devereaux please return?!?!?!?","review":"This story was so sappy it made my teeth hurt! I wish the author who excited and charmed in stories like \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" would return. Has she been kidnapped by aliens? This plot would lead one to believe so. Totally unbelievable. The usual gullible helplass girl meets rich man who saves her. She's really even too stupid to notice. Oh, and of course it's every day that your Wall Street wonder would just breeze in and start changing diapers and loving your son. That's totally believable! This was the worst story line I've read in quite some time. The only reason I finished the book was to get a laugh and groan out of the characters and their dialogue. Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a stinker!","review":"For anyone who is a Devereaux fan - avoid this book! The storyline is weak, the characters have no depth and for the most part aren't even likeable. This is by far the worst book I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted, warm, humorous, entertaining","review":"My first Jude Deveraux book. I picked it up because of the title and because I was intrigued by the picture on the cover, being a fairly new mom myself. It was pretty much exactly what I was looking for. Light but not \\"brain dead\\"! The dialogue was good, often funny, and it came naturally to picture everything because it reads and flows so easily. I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down. I will definitely look into reading another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it was okay","review":"But it definitely wasn't the reason I've been buying Jude Deveraux's books for the past 15 years. It's as if she expects us to identify with her type of heroine and hero so strongly that she doesn't actually have to develop the characters--but that just doesn't work. No one seems realistic or compelling. And here's my question about the plot--if David wanted his brother to take care of Amy's baby so that David could date Amy, how come he didn't seem to spend any time with her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful!","review":"I have to agree with Flo Nightengale: This might be the very worst romance that I have ever read. I finally gave up on it about halfway through, thinking, \\"This must be a satire/farce on Harlequin Romances!\\" It had all the cliche bits from those novels: rich guy, poor girl with no talents, overblown wealth, bratty kid. Ugh. I have enjoyed other romances by Jude Deveraux, and this one is certainly not up to her standard. Read something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"Characters lack strength or depth that Deveraux readers have grown accustomed to in the past. Weak story line as well. Totally disappointed for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I'm being generous with 2 stars, should be 1.5","review":"Here is a warning: Do not read this book, it's horrible. The entire time I was reading THE BLESSING, I was wanting it to be over. It was so bad that I don't even remember what it was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Unbelievable plot","review":"This book makes no sense. If a man was interested in someone would he really ask his rich handsome older brother to stay with the woman? I'd say he'd take the offer of his brother's secretary immediately and keep the brother way away from her. A three year old has the patience and strength and talent to paint an entire room as well as depicted in this book? Come on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable development of baby Max","review":"Good story line. However the writer doesn't know the development of a 6 month old. At that age they just start solids such as rice cereal, no way can they eat table food. Also Max , the baby, goes from 2 teeth to 4 teeth in 2 days. Its hard to believe a 3 year old can do a wall mural that was artistically good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are You Kidding Me?","review":"This is a great book. Don't let those reviews sway you. Light-hearted, simple rich man/poor girl story. Well worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...in a bad way","review":"I hate to add another review with only one star, but it has to be done. I was unpleasantly surprised by this book. The whole plot was totally unbelievable (millionaire agrees to babysit brother's love interest's kid?) and extremely weak. The style of writing also bothered me in that she had the characters reminiscing about what had just transpired instead of letting the reader feel that they were in on the story. Not to mention the huge time gaps, the underdevelopment of their romance, the unrealistic portrayal of a two year old, and the lies they kept telling each other after they had \\"matured\\" for two years. A wholly unsatisfying read that leaves me craving her classic work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just About the Worst Romance I've Read","review":"Seriously disappointed in one of my favorite authors. Completely flat - from character, to setting, to romance. Utterly and completely flat. The premise wasn't bad - but the whole story was rushed so much, the plot becomming more and more contrived, with no suspense and no empathy for the characters... I just can't tell you how disappointed I am in Jude Deveraux. Maybe she was just having a bad day or two (it couldn't have taken her longer than that to write.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete drivel, utter nonsense","review":"This is my third attempt to review this book. There were no profanities or other guideline infractions -- I just found this book absolutely silly and unbelieveable. Was it written as a farce? The very worst book I've read this year, and I read a lot. And, puzzled over the banning of my previous reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth one star!","review":"I have read most of Jude's work and generally love it. This story was so unbelievable: the characters were not very likeable, the gay angle was so stilted and contrived, and there was no real character development. Do not waste your time or money--unless anyone wants to buy my copy? Jude--go back to your medieval stories, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Departure from her usual style","review":"After reading it, i find it disappointing. First, the book wasn't in her usual length. It has a feel that many parts seemed underdeveloped.Most annoying of all was the various bramd names that keep popping up, not that i have somthing against them, but the frequency those names appear make the book sound a mite materialistic.(Hey! it is a romance novel!)In the end, the whole book sounded like an advertisement for the American Express Platinium Card. Well,lets hope that the next novel from the author wouldn't be this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of all books I've read not one of her best detailed.","review":"I collect all Jude Deveraux books and recently purchased The Blessing. I find the book does not compare to the others, I admit I am more in love with the historical books written by Jude Deveraux but, I also enjoy the more recent time book An ANGEL FOR EMILY. True the book had a little fantasy to it but it captured your heart and you actually wished you had your own angel. I will still keep The Blessing because other wise my collection will not be comlete. I know Jude Deveraux will continue to draw me in with her many wonderful romances she has yet to write, and though The Blessing wasn't a favorite of mine, I'm sure it was to someone else. Keep up the wonderful job Jude Deveraux! I look forward to the next book you write. Sincerely, Your biggest fan Nicole A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not heart-stopping enough","review":"This book is not one with her usual style of writing. There are not enough heart stopping moments and the male and female lead seem not to be the typical kind too. The female actually cries quite a lot and the guy is should i say rather blockhead and stiff though he seems to be handsome and rich. Not a bad book for a relaxing read but dont expect to get fired up and excited over the story much."},{"rating":"1","title":"An all-around disappointment","review":"\\"The Blessing\\" does not exhibit the eloquent storytelling, humor, drama, and excitement found in the many wonderful books she has written. The story is weak and undeveloped, without any depth. The characters are one dimensional and there is nothing that makes the reader truly care about what happens to the hero & heroine. I found it difficult to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Jude Deveraux work!","review":"I do not believe that this publisher thinks that a true Deveraux fan will think that this book was written by Jude Deveraux. Perhaps she wrote the first hundred pages, but beyond that, this is not her work. Where is the creativity? There is no scene discription. There is not the Deveraux style character analysis. These characters are not endearing. They have names and they exist on a page but every other Deveraux character from Gavin to Emily has jumped off the page and been \\"real\\". Do not read this book if you are a fan of Jude Deveraux. What you find in her books, you will not find in \\"The Blessing\\". I have read every book she has written at least twice. This is not her style. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a rating lower than 1 star","review":"I have read many Jude Deveraux and enjoyed every one. Many of the books were light romances that didn't have an award winning plot, but they were pleasant and lighthearted. Good reading at bedtime. This book was one of the top five worst books that I have ever read. I read approximately 4 books or more weekly. I have rarely disliked characters more. I doubt that I will ever read another book by this author. I buy my own books and frequently reread the good ones years later, like visiting an old friend. I forced myself to finish this book and will not be wasting shelf space for such stupidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"The Blessing was disappointing when compared to Ms. Devereaux previous works. I actually had to put it down halfway into it, I was so disappointed. A couple weeks later I finished it out of sheer obligation. It wasn't horrible, it was just not what I was expecting. I understand that there are always a couple of books that don't mesh well with a reader and that was mine. I will continue to read her books though because usually they are 5 stars. :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"This book is so unrealistic and unbelievable that I didn't even finish it. I read 40 pages and that was enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"When I read the synopsis of this story, I thought it sounded interesting, and the cover art looked good. Was I disappointed! The dialogue was simplistic, and the story ended up annoying me. Don't waste your money or your time on this book. (That saddens me as I usually love Ms. Deveraux's stories...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing!","review":"I love Ms. Deveraux writting, but in this one she must have been somewhere else in her mind when she was writting it. The story was very unrealistic and the characters were, well... BLAH! that the best way for me to describe them. There were some scenes that reminded me why some her other books did so well, but overall I did not like THIS book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a little better, but still not the Jude Deveraux I love","review":"I agree totally with \\"reader from Westborough, MA USA , November 20, 1998\\". Sweet Liar was sooo good. I really really miss her old books' style. It's a good light reading, but didn't make much impression on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the paperback","review":"I have been a Deveraux fan for a long time. This book is not one of her best. It is a light read and worth reading after you've finished those other books you've been anxiously waiting to read. Maybe Ms. Deveraux needs to take a break so she can revitalize her writing. Her last couple of books have been an unfortunate disappointment. I will not be purchasing another hardcover Deveraux for some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than her last few novels","review":"I bought this book expecting not to like it. I feel she hasn't written a a decent novel since Sweet Liar. The story, well, it isn't Jude's best. In a good Jude Deveraux novel, you know that she had as much fun writing it as we readers do reading it. The Blessing had a glimmer of the old Jude Deveraux fun. For that it is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't ask for a better guide!","review":"This video helped my game 40 pins right away!

There is NO reason for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Half Season Rip-Off for fans.","review":"I love the Cannon series and William Conrad, but hate these half season \\"volume\\" sets. Just another way for the studio to rip-off fans by hitting them twice in the wallet. I refuse to buy them new. I wait for re-sales of nice used sets in the secondary market. These CBS half season sets sell for the price of other studios full season releases of other TV series from the same era. Just no other way to see a reason for it except that the studio wants to hit your pocket twice.

Like the earlier reviewer mentioned, you get what you pay for. One dislike that I have is that the changing from disc to disc seems to take an extended amount of time. Also, there really is no way to tell which disc is in which slot...unless you fumble through all of them to find the movie, or audio disc that you are looking for.Good system for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"All I can say is I've never had a problem with the Sony DAV FX 10 DVD dream system.

I am glad I did on both counts. Its been to New Guinea with me and on a 6 day bushwalk in Tasmania. One set of NiMH batteries lasted five days of picture taking on the walk-then I popped in the second set and we were off again. Infinity focus (landscape) mode was really useful in taking pictures out of windows. Macro is superb-changes the way I look at of the world around me. I am constantly switching in and out of macro mode and value that macro button.Cons include minimal buffer memory, so slow image processing and poor low light capability. Its been a great introduction to digital photography and is leading me on to want more!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but needs improvement","review":"This works great and makes a nice clean panel line BUT it would be perfect if it had a thinner blade on the other end for smaller scale work.

When we received the product we were disappointed. The words were \\"girl punk, trouble maker, supafreak and rebel without a cause\\".

The service center cannot get the needed $3.00 replacement part. It is summer and I need the blower. Troy-Bilt must not be interested in repeat business. Buy another brand as the warranty is no good without the availability of replacement parts. **Update** I got my blower back on 05/29/07. It was down from 03/13/07 until 05/29/07.

Do yourself a favor and consider another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot of bang for the buck","review":"The blower was too easy to put together. After filling it with gas and following the start-up procedures, it started up with no problems. My son didn't have any problems starting it a few weeks later. He seems to like it too since it's lighter than most blowers and produces more than enough air volume to get most jobs done. Enough of the 'pro' stuff. Now for the 'con' stuff; The choke lever is made out of a flimsy piece of flexing plastic. I could see this piece giving me problems down the road. This piece definitely should NOT be made of plastic! You're moving it everytime the blower is started and is prone to breakage.Overall, It's a good buy for the price and with a little caution with the choke lever the blower should serve you well,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Troy-Bilt Gas Blower","review":"This is the best leaf blower I used.

Never thought I needed one, was I ever wrong. If you're looking to move a lot of leaves this is probably a little small. But for cleaning up the sidewalks and decks around your property this blower does a fine job. I find myself using it almost weekly. One of the biggest reasons I purchased this blower was my gutters needed cleaning and I was dreading that project. With this blower I was able to clean out every gutter on the house in about half an hour. I have oak trees hanging over the house and the gutters get full and this blower blew out wet and dry leaves with no problem at all.

Make no mistake, this action/RPG is the best one out there, ranking up by System Shock and others. You get upgrades, experience points to work out skills. It may seem tricky at first, but once you get used to it, it's awesome. The voices are great, and they lip-sync in for the ultimate realism. The plot is very well done, but there seems to be a problem with the visuals. See, if you don't have the 3D card the game works best on, you'll majorly have to tone down graphics like I did. Make no mistake, if you have a Voodoo, you're alright, but anything else, like for me a NVidia Riva 128, you need to turn detail down. Of course, this doesn't detract from the game, and after all, if you're only after the game for good graphics, you need to rethink your purchases. If you like sci-fi, conspiracies, System Shock or Thief, this is an imperative purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Great Gamplay, Great Game","review":"Deus Ex is a great story above all else. Lots of shooters promise a story, and deliver some silly tale about some scientist, \\"now go shoot things\\". But Deus Ex stands above that crowd and really delivers a great game. The pacing is just right, never revealing too much information with the action closely coupled. The story can really suck you in and encourages you to try out different things to accomplish a goal, another great feature of this game, you can solve most problems in way that suits your style. Additionally the online gameplay is just as exciting and offers some really unique twists (upgrades and skills). If you haven't played Deus Ex then you are missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Freaking Blast!","review":"An awesome blend of action and story. The graphics are well done, but I am playing on a 1000MHZ with a Geforce2. I liked it better than System Shock 2 and maybe even Half Life. Weapon selection is not that wide, but running and gunning is not such a large part that this was an issue for me. The individual map areas are not large, but it pays to explore every inch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game with some minor flaws...","review":"Deus Ex...one of those rare gems that help define a genre. Sure, the graphics are dated (even when the game first came out, it was already behind the times). But what the game didn't have in \\"gee-whiz\\" graphics, it more than made up for in the \\"I'm-going-to-stay-up-until-5am-in-the-morning-because-I-want-to-see-what-happens-next.\\" area. In other words, this game has a plot *so* thick, you could practically touch it.PLEASE NOTE: I've tried to push this game on a lot of people. Something I've noticed is that some people quit the game during the first/second mission because the game has a rather slow pace in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"This is the best first person shooter/rpg that I've played since Half-Life. I'm only half way through the first level and already I can tell I'm not going to be away from my computer very much. Forget Diablo II, order this game now. The longer you wait the more risk you take of having the plot line spoiled for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have got to get this game","review":"This is unlike any first person shooter I have ever seen. Not only do you get to use plasma rifles and full automatic shotguns in this game, but you get to use skills like hacking and lockpicking. It has a great storyline and an awesome hero. You also get to use things called augmentations which are upgrades so you can cloak, run and jump faster, see through walls, and all sorts of others things which you could never do in other games. You can even choose what you want to say to people. You should definetly get this game it is worth it. I cant wait for Deus ex 2 to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star, not that I got to play it......","review":"Now taking into account most people have a more sensible system than I do, I have to say that this is so far a very disappointing product. I have a new Sony with an AMD Athlon processor, 1 Ghz and 128 meg of ram. I may need to install a Voodoo card to play this game, and I just might do that. I have an SiS graphics card which does not handle the game well at all. On using software rendering, I get the best result: smooth and precise with no jerking and instant updating. However, after several seconds the game always locks up. This game also has the longest loading times of any game I have ever played. This is a shame because it looks very promising. Perhaps I will post an updated review if I ever get to play the sodding thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eidos, it's the 21st century!","review":"Well, I'd really like to play this game. But since Eidos is still developing games for last century's operating systems, I have been denied the pleasure. Games like Half Life and Diablo play quite nicely on NT and 2000 Professional (21st century operating systems). Check the date, Eidos, and get with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but horrible job.","review":"I was really excited when I first heard about it. But once I got it, that all changed. The control is difficult, the graphics are outdated, and the voices and music are horrible. Do yourself a favor and buy Unreal Tournament instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad game.","review":"The game has the worst graphics ever, and in my opinion, Super Mario on Super Nintendo is better then this game! Please take my advice, please don't waste your money on this game. I can see that Eidos Interactive didn't spend much time on thinking what other gamers want, a game with good graphics, good gameplay, realistic gameplay and being able to actually kill an enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, if your computer can handle it","review":"Deus Ex is an amazing game. It can't really be placed in any genre because it's just too innovative.You control J.C. Denton, a U.N. anti-terrorism soldier enhanced with the latest technology. You can customize your character with skills and augmentations, allowing you to choose if you want to approach situations as a super-strong monster with the power to take out a tank, or as a silent, invisible sniper who barely ever takes a shot.The plot is good, but not really anything new (government conspiricies, Area 51, etc), but it's told well, which makes it much more enjoyable.The only downside is that if you don't have plenty of memory and the latest graphic cards, you're at a disadvantage. If you only meet the games minimum requirements, get ready for choppy gameplay and loads of load time.In short, if your computer can handle it, Deus Ex is a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game ever !!!","review":"This is my favorite game. It is a first person shooter with an excellent story line. There are countless ways to accomplish each mission and I have never seen another game that lets you interact with the games environment to the extent that this game does. I've heard others complain that the graphics weren't stunning, but I thought the graphics were quite good. I couldn't believe they could pack that much game on one cd. I was pleasently surprized when the levels kept commig and comming. When I finally finished the game it was such a letdown. I wanted more. Unfortunately, I am now compairing every game I play to deus ex and I haven't found any that come close. Buy this game while it's still availible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If the demo is any indacation a must buy","review":"This game is ahead of its time (game play and requirements) I downloaded the demo after overcoming some miner problems I was addicted. You can be quite and sneak your way threw or you can run with guns blazing (not recommended). This game incorporates many nice features and graphics. In old games hacking a security system involved pressing the right button Not any more. I strongly suggest downloading the demo. It's 130 megs so get a program like Gozilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you haven't played this game...","review":"now's the time to. This is a very revolutionary game that allows you to play it how you wish. Many games have a very linear path to follow, not Deus Ex, you can play the game without killing anyone if you want, or you can outright kill everyone you come across. The game also has 3 endings depending on the choices you make. This is a classic and should be played by any gamer that has any interest in rpg's, first person shooters/sneakers, or just someone in the mood for a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever","review":"An immersive Sci-Fi roleplaying game from Eidos and Warren Spector, Deus Ex is one of my all-time favorites. Combining roleplaying elements with FPS action and a great story to follow, of which you can influence the outcome of, Deus Ex has few rivals to date.Political conspiracies, familiar turf, moral choices to make, gun battles to win, far away locales to visit...Deus Ex grabbed me and didn't let go until I finished it.The game now has a multiplayer mode as well now and may be of interest to some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"This is the most AWESOME game I have ever played! It's better than any other shooter because it has a storyline. Its better than most RPGs because of the immense stradegy involved. Its actually like you ARE him! It's so cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"First of all, let me say this game is good. So why do I only see 2 stars, you say? To begin, saving and loading times are insane. While if you're not playing on Glide, forget this game. You'll never run it and have fun. Also, the enemy is so stinkin' stupid. You can crawl in front of them, and they'll say something like,\\"I think I heard something. As long as you move behind something in a second or two, he'll think it was nothing and move along. You were right in front of him, for crying out loud! I don't want to give it away, but the storyline is great. That's about the only good thing this game has to offer. Voice acting is hideous. JC Denton, which is you, is just a monotone scratchy voice act. It stinks! So much cool stuff is being thrown at you and the voices that do it are so boring they're going to sound like your boss or teacher, no lies. Bottom Line: Get this if you like RPGs or FPS but don't mind slowdowns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful","review":"This game comes complete with 1) a really stupid background story, and 2) gameplay that equals \\"run around and kill things while waiting for the game to feed you another clue\\". The attempt at future noir is half-baked, the character models are drab, and the in-game cutscenes are horrible and embarrassing. Typical computer world populated by about 30 people."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works but---","review":"Frequent jams, batteries don't last very long, if you want accuracy you must dump the coins out of the plastic sleeve and count them before you put them in the paper sleeve.

I haven't had a single jam and I like that the drawer that holds the coins holds in tightly. I had another that would move slightly with the vibration of the machine giving the coins an opportunity to slip into inbetween spaces causing jamming problems. I live that there is a manual and motorized way to open the drawer. The coin holder on the top could be bigger. There is a light over the coin drawer so you can see it sorting, but I only find it useful if I don't have any coin wrappers in the slots so that I can see when each roll is filling up.I gave this 4 stars because I wish it had an AC adapter. It only runs on batteries. The last one I had, had an AC adapter, but I would prefer to buy the batteries for this machine since it works so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Target misses","review":"I ordered the Coin Vault for a Christmas gift ... in January my order was \\"CANCELLED\\".

A very strange video. One just can't believe Disney let this whale die. The Fredinand story was much better, although a bit slow. The final and best story of all three, Lambert, is fantastic. If only they were ALL this good. Buy this for Lambert and maybe Ferdinand. Willie the dead whale singing in heaven is just weird. It's unimaginable that the whale dies like this. There must be a [hidden] message to this story that I don't get or am refusing to entertain.

This lathers up nice and cleans your hair without leaving it stripped and dry. I also use the Shampure Conditioner with this too. The scent in this shampoo is heavenly! I have used this shampoo for years and will keep buying it. If you have not tried it you must, and can buy a sample size to try it out. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check it out in person first!","review":"I highly suggest you smell this shampoo in the store before purchasing. I usually take a risk when I read reviews about scent, but don't do it this time! This shampoo is strong! My husband equated it to a pack of menthol cigarettes, it is *NOT* for everyone. Also hopefully your mileage may vary, but the sales clerks in the Aveda store were pushy and rude - just something to be aware of!Still, I overlooked all of this because I am on the quest for a volumizing shampoo with natural ingredients. At first I was super impressed with this shampoo. My flat hair was much more lively after only a few uses! However, after a couple of weeks my hair started looking not only flat but stringy, and I had to use more and more product to get the original results. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so expensive! Needless to say the price combined with the smell put me off of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have looked at in store","review":"The shampoo works fine, but it has a very different smell that I was not expecting.

It runs for about $8.50 on the Aveda website and in their stores so I would suggest buying ti from there (plus you get free samples!). The smell is great too. Even though it seems like you're not getting a lot of product, you don't have to use as much and the quality is amazing. For everyone who has bought a bottle of crap shampoo or an expensive shampoo that turned out to be crap you would be wise to give Aveda products a shot.

I have fine hair and I need to wash it everyday otherwise it looks greasy. Usually my wash lasts a whole day but with this shampoo it would last a few hours! I washed my hair at night and by the time I got to work the next morning my hair looked like I hadn't washed it in days! I went to get my hair cut and my hairdresser noticed my hair was lifeless.

Mr. Hoefling as been able to merge the history of these people's migration to America, along with a personal look at wills, death records, marriage records, military rosters, and land deeds of these early pioneers. Anyone with Scots-Irish ancestry would find this book an invaluable addition to their collection, and may even find the name of one of their ancestors included in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This tells the story of the Scots-Irish coming to America and settling the wildest of areas. While there are several other books more in depth, the story includes some very informative sample lists of names. The story follows in depth the Huston/Houston family with side stories of some famous Scots-Irish, and their migration from Philadelphia, through Virginia, down to the Carolinas, Tennessee and back up through the Cumberland Gap to Kentucky. While this path was important, an equally important path, that was left out, was through western Pennsylvania, Ohio and points west in what would later become the free states.

The idea was neat, but the book itself is terribly boring. TERRIBLY. Boring. I imagine if I myself tried to write a ghost novel, it would turn out something like this - which is to say, poorly. The writing was unengaging & anything but subtle. The dialogue, character \\"development\\", and attempts at humor all made me either roll my eyes or fall asleep.

New York: Alfred Knopf, 1980.Alice Adams published dozens of stories and novels about women alone, but this one seems to have been dashed off without much thought. We follow the first person narrator, Daphne, from her twenty-something affair with a Frenchman, Jean-Paul, through many years of this and that, not amounting to much. She becomes an interior decorator in San Francisco and is enmeshed with a family in rapid disintegration. She is robbed, struck by a man, befriends gays, does some work, but her emotional state is neutral. The reader could care less. The climax comes when word of Jean-Paul's visit to the U.S. arrives and Daphne goes to pieces after having no contact for twenty years. Why? Pretty unconvincing, was my verdict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the others I tried","review":"The Hagarty dry shampoo was much more effective than the spray and powder system (Oreck) I used the last few times I cleaned my carpet.

I can understand why including some footage of exploitative media might serve to illustrate the problem, but 'MR' seems compelled to periodically fill the screen with over-long sequences of women doing the very things 'MR' decries. I got the feeling that the producers felt the need to 'keep things interesting' and inserted a bunch of provocative footage to keep the audience engaged. God forbid we just see people talking about the problem. Better yet, why not have most of the inserted footage showing positive women role models?I would skip this video, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Film","review":"Please do not miss out on this amazing film.

Sadly, there is no effort to show young women the importance of transcending media images and asserting one's independence. Also, even the treatment of the media suffers from the obvious use of a familiar ruse-- the half-truth. Anyone can cherry pick images and come up with any conclusion they desire about what the media is conveying to us. Sadly, there is a message here that is worth sending to young women, who we must not let fall victim to ridiculous pop culture expectations of what they should look like.

It doesn't close smoothly - the small racks inside does not move exactly with the cover, and falls on the bottom when you close and there is nothing that cushions the free fall so every time it just hits the grid, quite hard and makes annoying sound.If that doesn't sound too bad, opening it takes more effort. some metal parts got into each others' ways and you have to adjust it's positions carefully so they can pass each other nicely. it's supposed to make things easier to reach but when you need to grab something quick, this won't help you at all and overtime will frustrate you.the small iron pieces around the exterior look more like decorative than providing real support."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!","review":"I RECEIVED MY MAKEUP CASE TODAY, AND WAS VERY EXCITED AT FIRST UNTIL I OPENED THE PACKAGE!

The handles and latches were flimsy as I tried to get inside it. Once I did I realized why this makeup case was so inexpensive. The foam lining was already pealing off and the drawers that fold open were a mess to get open and close. I knew from the first moment I opened it I was going to return it. Please dont waste your time with this purchase unless you just won the lottery and you have money to burn.

Very cheaply made.Also, there is a huuuge gap between the top tray and the top of the case, so you can't jostle this thing at all or the makeup will get mixed up (but I've never had a cosmetic case before, so maybe this is normal?).Overall, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"This case is hard to open and close.

The dividers for the top sections are removable and very cheap. It is a small peice of wood covered in this foam like material, attached together by a cheap glue. When I opened it, all of the dividers were thrown all over the case and they had come unglued. I did not pay that amount of money for such cheap quality.

In \\"Dolente immagine di Fille mia\\" he sings \\"inestinGIUbile\\" instead of \\"inestinGUIbile.\\" This is unacceptable, especially in a recording that people are paying money for!!Cecilia Bartoli put out a CD (An Italian Songbook) that contains several of these Bellini songs.

Para hacerlo se basan en diversos instrumentos: sampler, teclados antiguos, guitarras distorsionadas, scratch, baterías programadas, y ocupan muchas veces voces rapeadas o vocoder para enuncar textos completamente absurdos. Por eso mismo, siempre da la impresión de que estuvieran realizando una parodia de la música que han escuchado toda su vida.

He and Shmuel Safrai have given much to the Christian community as friendly outsiders.Flusser demonstrates that Jesus taught as a Rabbi in the style of Midrash, among other things. One point he makes that is particularly relevant to those of us who are conservative evangelicals is that the Jewish culture of the first century understood the death of anyone martyred for God as helping to atone for sins. Thus, Flusser informs us, the idea that \\"Christ died for our sins\\" would not have sounded unusual to the first century Jewish ear.This is a brief read, but probably not intended for the typical layman who enjoys popular evangelical literature, but more for those into theology, ministry, or Jewish Roots at a higher than popular level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madness, mayhem, monsters, & the chance to change the world","review":"Harry Gainesborough's life is more depressing than acountry-western song.

The air gap underneath the laptop really does a lot of good to help cool the laptop and besides the drain on the battery to run the fans only adds to the heat generated. The Lapinator is comfortable on the lap, and the rubber bumpers that raise the laptop off of the stand help keep the laptop cooler. My main complaint is that the Lapinator is way too deep (front to back 12 inches) making it too large to fit in my laptop bag. 9 to 10 inches deep would be an adequate depth.

There is not a single verse telling Christians or churches to tithe, Paul never asked for tithes or salary, none of the apostles taught tithing. In Galatians Paul taught keeping an OT law (like tithing) brings the believer under the curse of the law. Bro. Burkett died from the effects of cancer, which is of the curse in Dt. 28.

This book takes the theories of knowledge management and gives practical, usable ideas for how to make them work on the ground with today's generation of workers. There are even actual dialogues showing effective and ineffective ways of dealing with situations that ring very true (sometimes uncomfortably so). The author clearly knows her field and has a breadth of real-world experience behind her...and a sense of humour to boot! (That's a breath of fresh air in my business book library.)

Maybe some other season are better but, at least, this one's not worth buying it. It's actually made for younger viewers, but it's way different than Hanna-Barbera cartoons. The animation is horrible, the episodes are too short, and the music's even worse. You can only stand watching 2 or 3 episodes per day and the sound or the voices are horrible, too. It's that kind of cartoon you see it's really childish and for kids about 3 years-old. I don't understand why people say it's like 007 because it's a real drag.The DVD itself is not so good, either, because there aren't a lot of options and languages.It really looks like it's a good series, but it's not the kind of DVD to buy it. I love old cartoons like Hanna-Barbera, Speed Racer, and Jonny Quest but this is not the same type.

I was thrilled that after 3 years of waiting, it was finally going to be released. I can't stand SONY any more, because of their refusal to release so many of the classic TV shows that they keep in their vault, so I was happy to hear that SHOUT was taking over production. Unfortunately, they did a terrible job of transferring the episodes to DVD. The movements of every scene are a little bit jerky and awkward, the picture is grainy and there are horizontal lines throughout the entire picture. Don't get me wrong, it's still a better quality than you can get by watching AITF on TVLAND, and it seems as if the episodes are unedited, but the quality is still extremely dissappointing. If you love All in the Family, then you are still going to want to buy this collection, but be forewarned that seasons 1-6 were of much better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!","review":"The company that made this dvd, is named \\"SHOUT\\". Amateur quality. As a viewer, I was FORCED to view every boxed dvd set this company sells. Shows that, this viewer, would enjoy.

Sony will never relinquish their rights to another DVD company and they don't seem willing to put them out themselves. I can't imagine how one of the most popular shows in television history has been so badly neglected. It's a shame. I've watched my DVDs of the first six seasons so many times that they have been worn down. I haven't even seen all the episodes in the last seasons because I was so young when my parents watched the repeats. A show like this will never be allowed to air again, because of the sensitivity of people today. Perhaps that is why they aren't releasing the rest of the show? If it's for money, couldn't they produce the DVDs on an order-to-order basis? Meaning, purchasing the DVDs directly from Sony?"},{"rating":"1","title":"concerning websites offering AITF Complete Series DVD","review":"I saw where a review mentioned a website that offers season 1-12 of All in the Family?

The excitement came to a quick end when I received my copy and started watching it. One question: What did they do to this series? They totally ruined it. Everyone is into remastering these days and making things look better. It doesn't always work. In this case, it ruins the mood of the show. While previous seasons of this show on dvd look the same as they did on tv and retained that 70's feel to it, this season looks to have some sorta \\"movement problem\\". The actors move around and it looks artificial. The picture is extremely bright and it detracts from the original feel of the show.

The printer is no good if you don't get a decent enough ink to have at least fair quality prints.

Got to my house quick and so far the cartridges have worked perfectly. Definitely will order again from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I have purchased this type of aftermarket ink cartridges before and been disappointed because not all would work (possibly because I stored them a couple of months) and the vendor didn't honor their guarantee. So, on this purchase I wasn't looking for the cheapest but a fair price with a reasonable assurance for quality. The price I paid for this product is very acceptable; it arrived on time and in good condition. Installation and operation in my printer is good and the quality of the ink seems to be a little better than other aftermarket cartridges that I've used; reasonably close to the quality of the printer's manufacturer. I don't know how well the remaining cartridges will fare after spending some time in the drawer; hence the four star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting. Some stories are better than others","review":"This is a interesting concept in general. I gave it a four star because a few stories in there seemed forced.Some of the stories have a few points/themes in common. Such as H.G.Wells, Alice in Wonderland, Watson being the real genius, and Holmes being a fake or even a villian. I wonder if it's intentional to have common themes or was it a coincidence.Two of the stories i especially liked. One, Second Fiddle by Kristine Kathryn Rusch. Second, The Adventure of the Second Scarf by Mark Aronson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Beginning","review":"This book is mostly for the novice. If you are looking for more advanced, inspirational, and creative illustrations; this book is not for you-look elsewhere. The author gave a broad coverage of basic Chinese brushwork, supplies, and techniques. The illustrations are very straight forward, colorful, and easy to follow. The supplies that come with the book are really good and the cost for the total package is a great price. If you are looking to get your feet wet in Chinese Brush art-this is an excellent start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"Don't listen to Alexander or W; they're idiots. Probably Alex didn't completely close the hidden ziplock. As for W, I have a Canon SD1000 and, based on his advice, I got the W300 instead of the 100. Big mistake! Now that I have the right one, it fits perfectly! No, the flash will NOT work, and so your pictures will probably be blurry except in clear water in sunshine, but for the price it's great. I wonder if someone makes a water-proof, radio-controlled flash..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"It works, and my canon sd1000 is small enough that it even floats.It makes me feel much better about taking my camera to the lake (though for the cost of the case I have to wonder if I wouldn't have been better off buying a cheap camera and putting it in a zip-lock bag).Sealing mechanism is a single zip-lock style zipper at the end of a flap. The flap gets rolled up and covered by a larger flap that closes with velcro. I would feel a little better about the case if the manufacturer had employed a double-zipper design, but the single-zipper design gets the job done.The water in most Oklahoma lakes is not clear enough to make taking underwater photos a possibility, though I think I would be comfortable taking my camera 5-10 feet under water in this waterproof case."},{"rating":"1","title":"DiCAPac WP-100 - Marine case","review":"I bought this couple week ago for my Canon SD1000. This DiCAPac WP-100 - Marine case can't be used for SD1000. Very hard to put the camera in or to take it out. I have not tried underwater yet. However, I went kayaking 2 weeks ago and took some pictures with the DiCAPac WP-100 case and knew that part of the camera flash was covered by the black plastic that cover the lense. Don't know what to do with this DiCAPac WP-100 now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic style, contemporary function","review":"This is a watch I'd been looking for for years. In appearance it's just like the cocktail watches of the art deco era--in function, it has the water resistance and sturdiness that I need to lead a normal life, not worrying about the watch. It's very small (as cocktail watches were), so great for a small wrist. Links can be removed from the clasp area of the band in order to make the band smaller. No bling--just classic modernist styling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"I found this a terrifically entertaining read and am franky mystified by some of the negative reviews here; however, reasonable minds may differ.The characterizations were wonderful, and while some people may object to the disinterest in the beginning of the father toward his young children, that is something that was not uncommon in the real Regency England. What makes the characters interesting is how they grow and evolve and realize mistakes they have made in the past. The secondary characters were even more fun than the primary ones; I especially liked the relationship between Eleanor and the duke.The ending is very satisfying, with all the characters assembled train wreck style for the dramatic conclusion. Above all, this book has wit and style, and I for one thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but love between characters not there...","review":"Yes, this book was hilarious; is there another author this funny?

He needed a mother for his two sons and she needed protection and security. That might sound like serious subjects for a romance novel. But in Barbara Metzger's hands it's a laugh-out-loud, cheer-out-loud, sigh-out-loud adventure. It may not be a sensual story but it is a lusty romp. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing \\"charming\\" about this book","review":"Adultery, not charming. Men who think all their kids are not really theirs, and therefore can't really love them, not charming. Women who can't stand up for themselves, not charming. Bad writing, not charming. This book was a travesty. I bought it because of all the raves, but now I know I was duped. I'll never waste my money or my time on this author again, and I HIGHLY recommend you don't either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...But Lacked Real Romance","review":"This story was captivating from word one, no lie, and the characters were simply wonderful, very realistic. But for all its thoroughness, the novel lacked romance. So much detail was given to all aspects of the story line, except for the romantic scenes. They could have been at least a little detailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Historian?","review":"It's hard to imagine this book having been written by a professional historian. If this author is going to write about other issues concerning the JFK assassination other than the Zapruder film, I think it would have been appropriate to include the historical background.Most people interested in the assassination are usually aware of the critical importance of the historical situation surrounding JFK's death. I'm referring specifically to the Cold War, the formation and rise to power of the CIA, the Cuban problem, etc.This author, for example, does not bother to inform his readership what it already knows, that is, that C. D. Jackson of Time/Life, apparently so \\"powerful\\" a man that the Warren Commission was not able to use its subpoena capabilities to retrieve the Zapruder film he so carefully pulled from public viewing, was a CIA asset. Any reader of the literature knows this, and knows exactly what this means. So what's wrong with Wrone? Is he one, too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of the cover up?","review":"The noted assassination researcher Harrison Livingstone has suggested in one of his later books that he thought the government of this country has co-opted the Kennedy assassination research community. In flipping through this total nonsense book, one can readily understand what he was referring to.Anyone who has any grasp of the essential facts in this case understands what Wrone has done using his slippery command of the language.I would suggest to the professor that he take his \\"evidential base\\" and publish a second book, even if it wouldn't fit on one whole sheet of toilet paper.What has happened to this country, when people like this have grown up in it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A CIA Asset?","review":"This book could have been written by a cia asset. Supposedly a friend and colleague of Harold Weisberg, the author waited until after Weisberg's death to publish this trash. Why? Because Weisberg wrote his first four books believing in a massive cover-up in the death of JFK. This author believes this government's first investigation was hampered by total sloppiness, and was not meant to be a true cover-up, but, in effect, that's what happened. This guy must think Americans must be a pack of morons.Anyone who has a good understanding of the major facts in the death of JFK will be appalled by this atrocious book. Utterly amazing, fantastic, bizarre, and deeply flawed. You won't be able to use this book to even wipe your ass, as it's already so full of sh*t.

My mother has cancer so I thought it would be appropriate to read and potentially buy for her. After reading the first few pages I knew I needed to read the rest of the book, and not just for her but for myself. I learned so much about the design of the body and how it all fits together as a whole. This book is not just for those with cancer, but for those who don't want to get cancer.

Like this author, not only did my sweet canine survive, she thrived. Eleven years later, she died peacefully in my arms, 1 week before her 19th birthday.In my opinion, this is an important read for anyone who is unfamiliar with tissue cleansing or a live food diet. Why wait until you have cancer to read it? Read it now and drastically decrease the chances of ever getting cancer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring","review":"I love this book! It is the best natural approach to cancer I have read. It gives the details you need to recover with diet, and she doesn't try to sell you anything, you can do it all with a juicer.

Johnny To is a great director and knows how to display a unique sense of style that is really fun to watch. Francis Ng is one of my favorite actors and his character is really hilarious to watch because he's so serious. Overall, this is a good movie and most of you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic feast","review":"I give this five star because I just personally love it. There is a certain overboard in the area of coolness; almost everyone is cool. But the general strong plot+strong photography+strong acting makes it a classic Hong Kong gun-slinging action film. Most memorable would be the scene when two sharp-shooters would keep shooting at one another and not move even though every incoming shot is dangerously close to home; dramatically they miss one another at the end of a volley of maybe twenty shots. And many aspects of the story are done without the eztra talk. If it's to be done, it's done. Certainly signature of a master.This film won \\"Best Film\\" and \\"Best Director\\" for 1999 in Hong Kong's Film Reviewers society. Johnnie To won best director in that \\"Hong Kong Oscar\\" thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, But Save Your Money","review":"Did you ever buy a book that absolutely exceeded your expectations? Well, you won't get that feeling from this book.Although the introductory material was quite interesting (i.e., how the dollhouse-crime scene technique is used in training forensic science students), the remainder of the book is slow-paced dribble with scant references to actual photos of the dollhouse crime scenes. I just expected so much more; the introductory page to each of the scenarios shows the actual dollhouse scene that accompanies the vignette, but they are too amateurish, and anyone who has ever watched a complete 60-minute episode of any prime-time cop and/or court show would be able to describe the scene and investigation, perhaps with even more vivid detail and creativity than the author of these drab tales. C+ at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strategic Planning Made Easy","review":"This book presents a comprehensive way to create a strategic planning system.

I returned the product and received a refund in a reasonable period of time, but based on my experience, I'd say avoid this product (but not the supplier - I've bought other things from them and it's been good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start learning about networkig.","review":"Is there someone in your office who wants to know how networks work?

You'll be able to show the novice what happens with ATM, firewalls, QoS and more.I found it easy to read and comprehend.

Yoder lays out with clarity and uncompromising seriousness how Biblical descriptions of the early church give us vital guidance for praxis today. There is no time for divergence into abstruse scholarship here - this slender volume gets straight to the point and makes the case in a way that is grippingly visionary without for a moment leaving the practical world behind. \\"Binding and Loosing\\", \\"Breaking Bread Together,\\" and \\"Baptism for a New Humanity\\" will leave you energized and wondering why you had not seen these things before. \\"The Fullness of Christ\\" concerning the meaning of spiritual gifts will forever change your understanding of the matter. \\"The Rule of Paul\\" is less clear cut and more thought-provoking, which is, in a way, its point.This is a landmark, and it would be wonderful to see more works like this. Meaningful to the clergy and accessible to the laity, it touches the heart without ever lingering over sentiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good item","review":"Cheap product, I paid $19.99 for it but I do not think this usb enclose worth $19.99.

Instead they go on about how motivational the book is. I agree. It is a very entertaining read and Susan Powter comes across as an engaging personality. However her basic premise , that you can consume virtually unlimited quantities of food so long as it is low in fat is errant nonsense. You CAN'T.It is perfectly possible to get tubby on brown rice if you pile your plate high. Compare with reviewers of books which shun the high carb/ low fat myth - Protein Power and suchlike. You will find most of the reviewers have tried the diets and actually lost weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's a fake and a hack.","review":"\\"Fat makes you fat, and that is that.\\" No, it's not Susan. This \\"plan\\" is foolish and a rip-off. Powter claims that if you only eat foods that contain less than 15% fat, you can eat ALL you want and expect to lose weight. She claims she and her children eat \\"bucketloads of popcorn\\" because it is low-fat. I find Powter to be a woman on a mission to piss off. The modern day version of her, is bitter, angry, and maladjusted to a world that has left her femi-nazi style far behind. I find the teachings of Geneen Roth to be much more helpful to women and men for that matter. Leave this book alone, and find a healthy, balanced, and SANE way to look at life and the place you take in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a book that makes sense","review":"I started reading this book a year ago. I thaught it made great sense. But I guess I wasn't ready to follow it just yet.. Then last August I started reading it again and it clicked..I guess by then I was ready. I started watching what I hate and counting the percentage of fat in everything. What a discovery to think that some of the food I thaught was low fat was loaded with it... Of course going to the supermarket with my calculator wasn't always a blast.. but I got used to it and now I'm doing fine. I've lost 30 pounds since August 17, feeling great and for the first time in my life eating great meals, 3 times a day... To anyone who wants to change the way they eat I suggest this book, and you should try her cookbook too. Oh and by the way I'm hooked on her exercises tapes. Who would of taught that I could look forward to doing step workout 5 days a week.... Bye and good luck to all of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop the insanity","review":"book was received , it was shipped to my daughter in law. guess it was OK, she made no comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you read ALL of what she is saying.","review":"Several people reviewing this book think that Susan says to eatanything and as much as you want. If you were really paying attention while you were reading, you will notice that she saysto eat when you are hungry and stop when you are full. She showsexamples of substitutes for high fat food, but I really don't think she intended for anyone to actually eat 800 grapes insteadof one chocolate chip cookie. Also, she does not condone eatingfood high in sugar or processed grains. She does advise to eatvegetables, whole grains, lean white meat, and fruits (organically grown even). Her advise is sound and does work, ifyou are willing to get off your couch and exercise and be sensible about what you eat."},{"rating":"2","title":"EAT, BREATHE, AND MOVE...","review":"susan powter has energy, and she loves to talk. what she says in 250+ pages, can be summarized in one sentence: IN ORDER TO BE LEAN, STRONG, AND HEALTHY, WE MUST EAT, BREATHE, AND MOVE. i am not sure if this book would be categorized as autobiography or health and nutrition. it is at times, almost a stream of her consciousness... but susan powter is a bright woman and for the sake of helping others, she definitely wants to share her story about how she finally succeeded at weightloss. i respect people who call it like they see it and so i enjoyed reading her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another CD","review":"Well just now what is our music turning into.

Vanessa, you should probably act more because singing doesn't seem to work.I can't see her having a long term career. She'll probably become yesterday's news as soon America's obsession with \\"High School Musical\\" fades away.

Her voice is mediocre at best and the material sounds just like something that was left off a Lindsay Lohan album. And if you are a parent who is buying this for your little girl I have two words for you: Please don't. Don't waste your money and don't expose your children to somebody who has to send skanky photos to her boyfriends just so they don't leave her for somebody better.

When I heard the first single, I thought, \\"well, this was the good track and the rest will be popish crap, filler\\". That couldn't be farther from the truth. With the pop to R&B to Rock feel in all of her songs it's a guaranteed success. I am happy to own this album and encourage everyone to get it if they haven't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Pop!","review":"After the mind boggling success of High School Musical you would assume one would stick with what they are good at, Pop!However this cannot be said for Miss Vanessa A Hudgens who appears to have tried to fit too many genres on the one CD. From romantic slow ballads she goes to RnB and then just throws in a few Pop songs although the genre would most likely be the genre most well recieved by her fan base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanessa Hudgens: V","review":"Most people would know Vanessa from the Disney Channel movie High School Musical. Well, now after singing in the movie, she has put out her debut album known as V.These, to me, are the best songs on the album:Come Back to MeLet GoAfraidWhatever will BeLose Your LoveBut, I do have some complaints. In Let Go, Vanessa cusses. It isn't the worse cuss word ever, but it's still cussing and I don't like how she uses it.I do not like Let's Dance. The song writing is horrible, and Vanessa's voice is computerized. Also, at the begining when she sings \\"Daaaance!\\" she sounds like a girl Tarzan.Psychic is very slow and dumb. \\"My friends tell me maybe I should seek a psychic, they tell be just beware I may or may not like it,\\" that line is so cheesey. I think the album can stand without this song.I'd give it four stars because of Psychic, Let's Dance, and the cuss word. Still, this is worth your money.

WT...?","review":"I have been wearing Doc's for the better part of 20 years. I love them, love the quality. Now, these seem made as well as any other docs. And I have been wanting a pair like this for a while, so I finally ordered a pair. My excitement of my new boots was VERY short lived, since I couldn't even get them on! I ordered the same size as every other pair of Docs I own. They sent me the right size, but I couldn't get my foot in. It was like they were a size too small. I tried, and pulled, and forced, and wedged... but couldn't get my foot in. With disappointment, I clicked the \\"Return or Replace Item\\" button on the order screen, and they are currently on their way back to Amazon. Maybe if I was in a shoe store, and could try on a size larger and see if THAT is the trick I would try it... but not gonna waste time ordering another pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is the most comfortable slip-on steel toed boot that I've ever tried. I was looking for a good safe motorcycle boot, and was hoping that it would be at least a little bit comfortable. Something that I could walk in for a few blocks if I had to. I wasn't expecting much! But these are as comfortable as some of the SHOES that I own, and for boots they are outstanding. And they don't even compare to the awful Xelement motorcycle boots that I bought here on Amazon... don't buy those unless you want to look tough.The side padding on these is what sold me... that may come in handy if I ever lay down my bike. Some of the other motorcycle boots have no padding at all.Dr. Martens doesn't seem to make a bad pair of shoes, and these are no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"A practical real world review","review":"Length:: 5:39 MinsLast month I helped a friend deliver his sailboat from Cabo to San Diego - a 5 day cruise. A well-worn dog-eared (and signed!) copy of this book was on board. I used the book to figure out knots, rig a hand-line, select and position the lure and properly kill, bleed and fillet a bonita tuna (actually two). Also used recipe suggestions in the book to prepare sashimi, ceviche, and seared tuna. Results are in the video. If you are cruising and fishing, you need this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Fishing while Cruising!","review":"After 30 years of living and fishing in Florida, and cruising on a sailboat all over the Bahamas, Caribbean, and Pacific, when a friend loaned me this book, we had to have our own copy.

Please.","review":"Scott's other books are really good (like \\"Elements of UML Style\\"), but it seems that he decided to take a vacation with this one.I had to use the previous version for class and hated it then for the hard-to-read text (incomplete, convoluted sentences, unclear examples, etc.), and it seems that not much has changed now.Sure, he's updated to include AM, but if you're looking for a clear, understanable text for the beginner, you might look elsewhere. If you already know the material, this is probably not a good reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Unagile","review":"I am really at a loss to find any kind of purpose and utility for this book. The writing style and presentation format are extremely boring, wordy , convoluted and formal while the diagrams and technical parts are loose, confused and presented with abundant hand waving. It' s the just the opposite of what an \\"agile book\\" should be: concise, fun, attention-catching presentation style and abundant, precise and clear cut technical detail. Reading this painful tome will just force you to digest a pretty heavy load of fluff while learning very little design or modeling skills of any value. It's really ironic how a book written on Agile Development can end up so boring, heavy, awkward, messy and randomly put together...to sum it up: extremely unagile. Good advice for the agile developer: start by throwing this useless waste of paper in the toilet where it belongs. You will feel much lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Fluff, Lack of Concreteness","review":"Have you ever read a book where halfway through it, your expectations begin dwindle because the author either did not cover the topic or promises to cover it in more detail in later chapters, but never does? If you ever feel this way about a book, then this is the perfect examples of those types of books.After reading the synopsis and browsing some of the crude methods that I can assimulate with when I was performing requirements modeling, I thought this book might come in handy. After close scrutiny, I was very disappointed by the authors lack of knowledge in UML. A lot of what was presented was very superficial, and the explanations were lacking in terms of it presentation of each of the models in UML. I should have stuck with the three authors (Jacobson, Booch, and Rumbaugh) who were the original designers of UML."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book to Give Your Friends Who \\"Don't Get It\\"","review":"The Object Primer is a great read. Scott walks you through the development lifecycle in clear and simple language. And all along the way, Scott points out the landmarks to the reader. Scott has a way of knowing just what a person needs.For example, on page 122, Scott provides a basic list of twelve pointers for interviewing. How often was there a problem in requirements because of misunderstanding. These pointers address techniques they did not teach us in CS-101. The primer is full of helpful lists like these pointers. And who, besides Scott, would like to include this?This new edition has been updated to reflect the emerging consensus of the Agile Modeling community.

She should wait until she has more songs of her own before making an album. Plus she just came with her special edition soundtrack-$10 more and only 1 more song and a couple pictures-not worth it! If your a fan, get it. But if not, stick with other singers, like Hilary Duff. But if your saving your money wait 'till her second one comes out-10 new songs by Hannah Montana including Nobody's Perfect, Make Some Noise, and 8 never before heard songs!

This is nothing but a pathetic attempt by Billy Ray Cyrus and the Disney corporation to make millions upon millions of dollars by selling this awful garbage to you. This is barely music in my book.

She can't sing and I don't even see what's so amusing about her. Her show is better than her music(not by a whole lot) Miley tries to hard to be funny throughout the whole show. To me the show is would be just fine if she wasn't in it, and her music is just as bad. If you listen to her music some of the lyrics are confusing and just don't make since.

Miley Cyrus is a hick herself, and when it comes to a teenybopper music, she knows how to sell her schmuck to the middle school students. She can't sing to save her life, regardless of whatever you are told. She's just a Hilary Duff offshoot, but with a redneck accent.And I can tell you, I actually listened to part of her song. It cursed me. It raped my ears. It made me lose all of my shreds of sanity. Plus, it's on the Disney Channel, which has basically become a channel of generic, derivative and lifeless teen-based shows that use the same kid actors over and over. It's pathetic.Unless you want to lose your sanity for eternity, destroy your eardrums and make Walt Disney spin in his grave a couple more times, by all means should you purchase this. Just be warned when you're using this to support your drinking glass in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pathetic Disney attempt","review":"This is just sad. To many teenyboppers Hannah Montana is \\"cool\\". Everyone wants to be a famous pop star just like her.

To me and everyone I know Hannah Montana is a just bad joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Levy's make great straps","review":"There might be room for improvement somewhere; maybe padding or something, but for me Levy's straps like this one are top of the line. The elongated leather tab that fits over the buttons makes for a very secure connection and that is number one priority for me. A close second is ease of use including adjustability and lots of length and Levy's has this in spades. The strap is fairly attractive, but the main thing is that it does a great job of being a dependable guitar strap. I own this one and several others. And, oh year, Amazon had a great price and delivered it fairly quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"guitar strap","review":"looks the same online as in person besides the color towards the back side of strap, they dont show you that on the picture. other than that the product is what I exspected.

My son & I both shoot English style 6 foot longbows, 30-35 pound pull. These arrows work just fine if used as intended; these are designed for low-power target bows. We've seen no splinters and no broken arrows. Keep in mind that these come with veins not feather fletching, so if you're using traditional bows (without a whisker biscuit) you may need to replace the veins with feathers. I'm not sure why no one seems to make fiberglass arrows with feathers.NOTE: This listing has changed. As of Sept. 2001 the reviews are for the fiberglass arrows that used to be sold on this page. The page now lists wood arrows.

The Mouser in particular has always been one of my favorite fictional characters.This book (a collection of three short stories and a novella) is an excellent addition to the series, and covers some of the Twain's later adventures while in their more settled life on Rime Isle. Leiber's writing style is beautiful, poetic and flows elegantly and smoothly. This is fantasy written for, and meant to be appreciated by adults, rather than for the teenage audience much of the more recent fantasy seems to be written for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, remember the last Indiana Jones Movie?","review":"It's been thirty years since I read the stories of Fahfrd and The Grey Mouser, but I recently rediscovered them and decided to enjoy it all over again. The first six books were as fun as I (vaguely) remembered them, real page turners. The 7th, however, (Knight and Knave, which wasn't part of the series in the early 1980s)was just unnecessary, if not garbage. I had to force myself to finish reading this book. The words Boring, Vulgar, Obscene, and waste of time come to mind. I feel the characters were seriously screwed over by seemingly careless writing in this book---and will consider the 6th book the last worth reading, and the only proper finale to an otherwise great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and reassuring","review":"An enjoyable read and what seems like good advice-- a rare combination.

How bias is that? Perhaps if this review came from Tee Royal the founder of RAWSISTAZ, or someone from her group, I would be more apt to believe it was worth five (5) stars.I am sure I'll get some non-helpful votes, but the review is unbaised.

In this case it playes only a standard DVD or VCD disc. So if you are into making your own personal DVD discs from your MPEG media files, VHS tapes etc then this is not the DVD player you want.Later I bought Philips DVP642 DivX-Certified Progressive-Scan DVD Player and ... woh ... it played all my DVD+R and media files like DivX, MPEG 1/2/4, VCD .dat, .avi files etc on my customized DVD+Rs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 6 months","review":"I bought the NS50 in June 2005 and it was a terrific player - for 6 months. On December 26th it refused to read any disc I put in. Discs it had played in the past, brand new ones out of the box, all the same message - 'Can't read disc'. No one else was near the player; it just decided to die on its own. I tried everything Sony recommended on their web sight except one; taking it in for service. It's cheaper to buy a new DVD player than to pay for a repair. I've heard of planned obsolescence, but this is ridiculous.I've owned many Sony products over the years and been very satisfied. This shakes my confidence in their brand. I've replaced it with a Panasonic and will see how that goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good pick for the money","review":"I bought this player based on reviews on amazon, eopinions and cnet...

This Sony player, which is rated highly by CR, started freeze-framing on rental disks just 30 days after I bought it. Sony won't replace it unless it freezes with all disks. We rent a lot, and have never had any of our past 6 DVD players freeze like this, so it must be more sensitive to media scratches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Experience with 2 Sony DVD Players","review":"I used to have a lot of respect for Sony.

However, over the past month we have bought 2 of these dvds players, one replacing the other, and the second again failing. The first dvd player's sound started at an extremely quiet level. Sitting right up next to the tv was the only way i could faintly hear the audio. Knowing that this was not normal, we replaced the dvd player with the same kind, and were completely satisfied, until now. After only one and a half movies, the sound slipped to barely hearable again. Now we are going to get a dvd player from a different company, which is disappointing since the first dvd player we own was from Sony, and its lasted us 8 years. It is a good dvd player, and by the looks of other reviews, they have not had this problem. However, I am merely placing out a warning that this player has faulted in the past. If you choose to buy it, good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll get two years out of it if you're lucky","review":"I thought it was just me!

It is a little big, so small dogs may have trouble wearing it even when folded over. I folded it over for my dog, so he is able to wear it all the time. I love that it uses regular batteries instead of the CR batteries (which die out frequently and are a pain to change). The light is bright and very visible even when it is folded on the collar. Overall, I would highly recommend this dog light."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY BRIGHT","review":"VERY BRIGHT LIGHT, EASY TO PUT ON HIM, GREAT FOR WALKING AT NIGHT WITH MY ALASKAN MALAMUTE, WE BOTH LOVE THS LIGHT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spot-light. Bulky.","review":"I have a 90lb 5yo black lab, Rufus. This light hangs off the collar is large and is relatively heavy. Rufus chases the tennis ball at great speeds, jumping and clowning around. This is not streamlined or designed to be part of the collar. It had a large thick hard plastic belt buckle and then the thick light hangs on a hinge and will bounce against their chest or jaw if they are nutty like Rufus.Also, this light doesn't glow, it is like a spot light or a car headlight that is really focused. It shines directly in front of Rufus.. When he comes up to me and I look at him I am blinded. It's like looking into the sun.I would recommend this light to large dogs who walk with their people and are more docile. I much prefer the lights that glow as opposed to the beam light. The glowing lights are more effective for me to see Rufus when he's far from me at night. I would not buy this again.It does have sturdy construction and is easy to turn on and off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sizing","review":"The plastic component that the collar is to be threaded through is too narrow.If you have a \\"click\\" collar you cannot scrunch the collar up to squeeze it into the slots.I have six various buckle collars which could be threaded through the plastic carrier piece - and not one of them fits. It is too narrow. I will be returning the two that I ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doglight","review":"The light is very effective if you have to walk your dog at night, but the design is poor. The light fell off the strap because the holes are not designed to withstand the strong shaking of any large dog. Although the light fell off while I was walking my dog in the dark, I was able to retrieve it the next day after retracing my steps, but it would have been shattered if a car had run over it. I have had to reinforce and reattach the light to the strap to make it more secure. My dog likes being able to see in the dark, so I'm going to keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puplight - Red","review":"LOVE this light! Great for walking our chocolate brown dauschune/blue heeler at night! Light is strong enough to light up the walking path several feet in front of us. No additional flashlight needed unless going into ultra dark areas. Great for cars and people to see us coming. Many people who have passed us while walking their dogs have commented on cool the light is and asked where they can get one themselves. Seems to be waterproof since we've been hit by several sprinklers during our walks and the light still works great. Also great for tracking your dog while off leash on your yard or else where. Our dog loves this light as well! He uses it to hunt insects in the grass. The stretchable collar doesn't bother him one bit and the light doesn't bounce around while running or playing. He even seems to be more comfortable walking at night with the light on. Wonderful product! Will purchase several more to give away to friends with dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"They say this is for dogs 8lbs and up, my dog is 25lbs and this is way to heavy for his neck t carry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, not really useful","review":"Not really useful, it lights up your dog so you know where s/he is, but it's not powerful enough to light up more than a foot (or less) in front of you. Not sure about all those reviews that it helps them see at night. Most (if not all) still have to carry a flash light. If your goal is to make people notice you (so cars are not zooming by you because they didn't know you are there), it's cheaper to buy one of those bicycle safety flashing strobe lights for about $7 from WalMart, probably a more effective and safer solution. Almost useless for the purposes of illuminating your path, overpriced if you are using it to get noticed at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good till it comes apart","review":"Loved it at first. Very bright, good size, AAA batteries. The switch was a little hard to work, but not that big of a deal. But it has a fatal flaw in design. Only the battery cover, which snaps onto the light, is attached to the collar. So if you leave it attached to the collar when not in use, you soon find that only the battery cover is still attached to the dog and the light itself is laying somewhere. Hope you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light the way","review":"The PupLight is a great product. I have a black dog and it makes him visible and also makes the paths he chooses visible."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for small dog","review":"I have a toy poodle. This item indicated that it could be used on a small dog. However when I tried the smaller collar that comes with it, it was entirely too small, more for the size of a very small chihuahua. And the bigger collar was too big no matter how small I would adjust it. So I just took the collar off and the attachment that the collar goes into. I put a string through the hole at the top of the light and tie it around my dogs neck. A big hassle but trying not to waste twenty bucks! Other than that the light is bright and very good, not to heavy for even my nine pound dog. I would not recommend it for a smaller dog than ten pounds, it\`s size would be to cumbersome.Update. The string broke on our walk and the light is now lost forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Evening Walks","review":"Given the time change, I now have to walk my labrador retriever puppy in the dark. I purchased this light (in addition to the flashlight I carry) so that she could see but more importantly everyone could see her. I haven't used the collar that was sent with the light but it fit perfectly around her clip collar. It takes several AAA batteries so it is a little heavy but she doesn't seem to mind. Will have to use the collar it came with if your collar is on the thicker side or if you use a slip leash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This product did not meet my expectations as my dog's fur covered most of the light and made it ineffective. When I tried to return this item with the seller (Antonline), they denied my request stating that since I already opened up the package - thus causing damage to the packaging, they would not be able to authorize a return nor re-sell this item. If you try to make a return, you are required to answer a very detailed questionnaire and certify that you are telling the truth. I would not recommend this light if you have a very large dog with lots of fur around their neck nor would I ever recommend this seller to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cool!","review":"I run with my 65 pound dogs, who like to roam all over the path. These lights have been great for our night jogs. They are super bright, and actually do a good job of lighting my way so I do not have to wear my own light. People see us, and I don't find myself running into people or bikes like before. The dogs (one of which is a little scared of new things) don't even realize they have the lights on. They take 3 AAA batteries each, which haven't burned out yet. I have been stopped many times and asked where I got them. I highly recommend them. The only thing I would have done differently is get a different color for each dog so I can tell them apart from long distances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuff you can find elsewhere for free","review":"Folks... this is the most basic of travel books.

When I found out about the \\"Y\\" cut nipples I thought, \\"this is it!\\"They opened just fine when I squeezed the nipple with my fingers. The little flaps flipped open and the formula with rice streamed out. But my baby could not manage this when sucking. She couldn't get anything at all out of the nipple.These nipple could work with other babies. So, I would say try them out and see. I hope they work for you!!! We went back to the medium flow, and I think she learned how to keep up with the faster flow.

My daughter doesn't just look at her toys, so this horse is flying all over the house, but it is frustrating when one of the wings pops out. I am considering super glue or maybe even exhanging to see if another would be better made.

It's something that's catchy and I'm able to listen to with the kids I nanny, and not have to worry about language or what they are talking about. It is also music that doesn't make me want to slam my head against a wall.I am also a fan of Drew Seeley. He is an amazing singer, who doesn't get enough recognition for his talent. This CD definitely helps put him in the lime-light a bit more.The girls I watch loved the DVD, but they love the CD just as much (especially the Drew parts, they think he's cute:)) The difference in how they sing it from the studio recording to LIVE is fun to hear, and you can hear the audiences reaction, so you feel like you are there.It was definitely a good investment.

The writers are academics who have spent many years investigating and writing about creativity.

Nevertheless, I found many inspirational ideas and resources from both a personal and business perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encyclopedia of Creativity","review":"This two volume set provides a comprehensive overview of creativity. The texts are easy to use, and thus far, have provided me with reliable information on various topics. However, the price is a little high for most students...I was quite fortunate to get a discount when I ordered. Also, an updated or paperback version would be nice--perhaps a one volume text--as one could take it to lecture with ease. In spite of these flaws, which are independent of the texts themselves, the encyclopedias are the best in the field to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice work","review":"Wonderful work.

Not light reading, but if you want to know what the experts say, this is the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"This is a highly disappointing encyclopedia on creativity. I had looked forward toward receiving it for a long time. In the end, it's nothing but a collection of articles written by academics, most of whom have no credibility or standing in the field. Why the editor did not consult with the leading practioners of creativity and creative thinking is beyond me. Don't waste your money, as I did. Read it in the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Academic book for other academics","review":"This is not worth anything close to the price that I, unfortuneately paid for it. Unless, of course, you love reading the kind of thing academics love to write to impress other academics and relatives. I cannot begin to tell you how so far off the mark everything in this book is. Suffice it say, it is not an encyclopedia of creativity. It is a collection of accademic papers which rehash the same old things. One has to wonder if any of the contributors have ever read any of the classic books on creativity that are out there. They, I think, could learn a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformed, innacurate, confusing","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed.

Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I have had this oven for just over 2 years. Already, the temperature dial is malfunctioning and the degree readings have come off with just general cleaning. I have to agree that the toaster takes forever. I thought it would be nice to be able to bake a 12\\" pizza on the countertop, and it has done this fairly well. Also, the pull-out tray for cleaning is a great feature. However, these positives do not outweigh the negatives. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this oven","review":"We received this oven as a gift to replace a smaller older B&D toaster oven. We wish we had never made the switch. This oven heats inconsistently-- sometimes it gets very hot and sometimes it doesn't seem to be hot at all. When it does get itself going, it cooks unevenly, burning everything placed in the rear. It cools down quickly, but puts out a good amount of heat on all sides while cooking, and sometimes it feels hotter outside than in. Last night I put a piece of apple pie in the oven in a piece of foil and it took 30 minutes at the 300 degree setting to get to lukewarm. Save your money and look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away....Far, Far Away!","review":"We've had this toast-r-oven for about 2.5 years. It worked fine for approximately 6 months until the oven feature conked out. Based on other reviews, this seems to be a common occurrence. The toaster function is still working fine, but at nearly 18 inches wide, this monstrosity is much to large (not to mention sloooow) to function solely as bread toaster. Plus it requires that the bread be flipped frequently for even browning. The timer makes a super loud and annoying ticking sound. (Though we don't have pets of our own, we can't use the toaster when dog-sitting because it drives the visiting canines bonkers.) The only reason I put up with it for so long is that I've been too poor and too lazy to purchase a replacement. We're currently searching for a new toast-r-oven and it likely won't be a Black & Decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn around and walk away. Do Not Purchase This","review":"We've had this for a couple of years now. Where do I begin. The handle gets hot, the numbers have worn off, the door slams down (needs better springs). On the plus size..you can heat a pizza and use this for other items instead of heating your regular oven. Black & Decker should be ashamed that they manufactured this. There are so many things that need to be improved upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek looking, weak cooking...","review":"I purchased this oven about a year ago and was somewhat satisfied with it in the beginning. The toasting feature is poor at best. It takes a very long time to toast and you have to move your bread around to ensure even browning. As for the baking feature, it worked great until it just completely stopped working. Not sure what the problem is, but given other black and decker toaster ovens I have had in the past, I would have expected more. I will be replacing this oven but not with a black and decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.....","review":"This product should be taken off the market. It started smelling like burnt rubber then set off the GFI outlet . It made a loud hissing noise and sparks came from outlet.I bought it for the size, design and color. After 6 months it set off the GFI I was going to take it back and decided to plug it in to make sure it was broken. It was working so I kept it, now several months later I need to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY for toasting","review":"I agree with most the posts here. I bought this in hopes of baking small items without needing to use my large kitchen oven but ALSO to toast bread daily. The toasting feature is absolutely horrible. The toast needs to cook for a VERY long time and you need to stop and rotate the bread or it will burn on one side and be untoasted on the other. Very disappointing product. I do not recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality toaster oven","review":"I purchased this toaster oven for its size and ability to cook a pizza. Within a month, the markings on the control had disappeared (I cleaned it with a washcloth and dish soap -- I don't use chemical cleansers). Within a year, the baking feature stopped working. This week, it won't even work on toasting setting. It is very slow to heat up. This baby gets hot on the outside, too.I do not recommend this product. It is very poor quality and very disappointing. I will not be purchasing a Black & Decker toaster oven again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't leave it alone!","review":"I purchased this oven for our new home. We had black appliances and we needed a new toaster oven to match. The first problem with this oven is that it takes forever to pre-heat. Our regular kitchen oven is faster than this. A toaster oven should not take this long to preheat. Also, it didn't take long to find out that you can't leave your food unattended. It cooks twice as hot as the dial says. If the directions say cook something at 400 degrees, you better set it at 200 or you will be scraping it off the grid. Stick with the cheaper models at $25 and don't waste $60 on this one unless you're in to carbon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This gets extremely HOT on the outside!!","review":"I love using toaster ovens and thought this would be a nice one. I cooked toast and the whole outside and even the handle was to hot to touch. When we cooked a pizza in it, it got even hotter to where my walls were very warm to the touch, and we gave it plenty of breathing room. We have little ones and feared them getting burned! Please don't buy this toaster/oven. This is the first review I've ever written. I had to say something to help others not purchase this product. By the way, the timer was very loud also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this toater oven like all the other reviewers, for the pizza capacity. It takes forever to toast and now the broil/top brown feature stopped working. This was a replacement for the first one that didn't work from the day I bought it.

It is amusing and really gives an interesting peek into the kitchens of any restaurant that you might visit. I'll never again take for granted the ability of a restaurant to make everything come out on time, hot, and wonderfully prepared! Contrary to other reviewers, I didn't mind that this book wandered all over the place. After all, it is not a biography of Alexander the Great! Two things I did object to. My copy had an unacceptable number of misprints in it. Whatever happened to proof-readers? (Like we don't know.) Also, I found the constant inclusion of crude and foul language to be, well, highly forced and almost adolescent. I mean - we get it! Enough already! Overall though, I liked this book. Read it with the Zagats restaurant guide close at hand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth in the kitchen","review":"I highly recommend Bourdain's book to anyone genuinely curious about what goes on in the kitchens of those restaurants you love. Be forewarned though - this is no culinary fairytale. Its the straight dope, albeit but one opinion, on how a dozen prepare nightly meals for 200 or more. But remember friend, true love is not a fairytale. Its believing that a thing, even while knowing all its faults, is worthy of our time and passion. And in the end, this is I believe what Bourdain shows us of professional cuisine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought I would like this from reading the sample, but found that Mr Bourdain went on and on about his and his coworkers' immature exploits in restaurant kitchens, involving drugs, alchohol, and a lot of bad behavior. I usually like memoirs because you understand what made someone grow and change. Not much of that here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Reservations","review":"For those who only watch him on his show \\"No Reservations,\\" be careful. While I enjoyed this book a lot, it travels a bit deeper into the culinary world - and those who don't have interest in the service/work side of food service will likely find it bland. Also - as always with Anthony Bourdain - not for those easily offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"just good storytelling","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's that simple. I just love the way that Anthony Bourdain boils down his life in kitchens into stories that not only have name-dropping, but also the self-deprecating moments in his life and the low points that you don't usually see in memoirs. There is an honesty to him and a flow to his writing. As someone that has spent a decent amount of time in kitchens, I can say that the atmosphere definitely holds true, at least to the lines I worked.In the end, it is more about the fact that it is a fun read about the life through the kitchen door more than any sort of expose for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Confidential","review":"I think if I wasn't familiar with Anthony Bourdain from television his style would turn me off. Since I've seen him outside of the context of this book, it seems more wry and less smarmy than it might otherwise. I'll read another one by him, for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out strong...ends with a whimper","review":"I am a big fan of Tony's No Reservations TV series and had noticed this book on several occasions while browsing the Kindle store. I finally decided to give it a whirl after reading some positive reviews. While the book does have its funny moments, they are far and few between. Tony spends most of the book telling you what an abject failure he was early on his life. After reading this book, its amazing to me that he was able to ever get himself together in order to hold down a job, let alone a emmy winning tv series! I ended up skimming through the second half of the book as it could barely hold my interest. Pass on this book if your a fan of Tony in his current form, on No Reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved every bit of it.","review":"This is not the type of book that I normally read. After watching Bourdain on his show, I really wanted to read some of his work. I was not disappointed. Even though I am in no way involved in the food industry, and have no intention ever to be, Bourdain made reading about all of the finer details of the industry very enjoyable to read. That on top of all the personal stories made this a really great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I knew little about anthony bourdaine before i saw now reservations and i loved it. This book pretty much tells you about how he climbed the ladder in the culinary business. he talks a lot about the behind the scenes of what goes into running a restaurant. from how drunk and high him and his co-workers were in the kitchen, to when and when not to buy fish in a restaurant. i liked this book because he is brutally honest and tells you anything you want to know about the culinary business. it also has some good tips you can use in the kitchen! i would recomend this books to anyone who likes bourdaine wether your a cook or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been there","review":"Having previously worked in the food industry, I (like most others Bourdain has spoke of since this book was published) see it as the cold hard truth, with a lot of his self-proclaimed snarkiness involved. It wasn't meant to be an expose, he wrote it for all of those who are/were a part of this lifestyle, and so many others who weren't still loved it anyways. I actually prefer his writing to his show \\"No Reservations\\" for the simple fact that he gets to say exactly what he thinks without any censoring."},{"rating":"2","title":"kitchen confidential","review":"i think this book give the reader a great insight tothe inner workings of anthony bourdain. i found the book very interesting i could hardly put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scruffy, Bawdy, Saucy, Memoir/Expose","review":"This entertaining tour through the life of a restaurant kitchen made me think twice the next time I ate out. I liked it on 2 levels: a warning for diners, and - even more interesting - as a sociological study, with the structure, interplay and hijinks of the cooking culture. I got tired of the author's \\"attitude\\" but he writes well. It's organized and neatly leads the reader to the most interesting chapters on \\"A Day in the Life\\" (a typical day in his kitchen) and the Life of Bryan (the chef's kitchen down the street). Told with memorable humor, this chef's confessional is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Ego; Small Accomplishments Spewed Out by a Foul Mouth","review":"As a former cook and restaurant worker, I thought it might be interesting to read about the experiences of someone who's still working in the field. I've moved on to journalism, government, and the law, but I look back fondly on the energy, friendships, and fun of restaurant work. Anthony Bourdain, however, gives a bad name to both writing and cooking. He is a boring story teller with a foul mouth. He is unrelentingly crude and hyperbolic. He's such a swaggering show-off that it feels as if you can't trust a word he says. Although I got all the way through the book, I felt as if I needed a shower after reading this guy's ego-driven \\"confidences\\". Do yourself a favor and don't even think about buying this book, written by a second-tier cook, a third-rate writer, and a fourth-rate mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchen Confidential","review":"A self aggrandizing celibration of dysfunctional personal and workplace behavior with little to say about kitchens or cooking and alot to say about the authors supposed coolness. This book is truly a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book but has some negative sides","review":"kitchen confidential was a great book about the life of anthony bourdain but most of it was not about the life of chefs. in my opinion it was funny but i think he put to many things that were negative about the culinary business. there are some references about him being addicted to drugs and doing them. and it also had some sexual refferences and sexual things that happened. yes there are some very funny parts in the book that are some funny ideas if you were ever to try them. anthony made a great book but he put to many negative things in it about his life in it that might reflect what people might think secondly about the culinary business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchen Confidential","review":"I really disliked this book. Redundant, distasteful and adolescent. In one paragragh the author is talking about a class on beef he attended at the Culinary Institute of America and says '...we were the culinary version of the Manson family. Fortunately, the mutilated reamins of our efforts were -as was all food at CIA - simply passed along to another class.Crude and boring sexual comments abound. The author's narcissism is tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unseasoned Mess","review":"Don't quit your day job, Mr. Bourdain. While this book starts out promisingly, it quickly disintigrates into a sloppy mish-mash of memoir, back-stabbing, and bland cooking tips (use heavy pans! get a good knife!). Mostly, though, it's just the tale of a hack chef staring with deep love and fascination into his own dirty navel. Most of the reputed \\"tell-alls\\" of nasty habits in the restaurant biz were reported decades ago--with a lot more wit and style--by George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London. If you want scandal, log on to the NYC Health Dept's restaurant reports. But unless you find Bourdain as fascinating as he finds himself,I'd skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess who's not coming to dinner ....","review":"I bought this book based on an interesting outline and a number of enthusiastic reviews, but it was a real struggle to finish. I kept waiting for something to happen, anything to happen,that was either interesting, amusing or instructive, but it never did. The book is little more than a meandering stream-of-consciousness rambling by a self-important, self-indulgent egocentric 70s flower child ...While these may be good atributes for a chef, ...they don't make for a good writer. For those interested in more factual books, try \\"The Making of a Chef\\" by Michael Ruhlmann."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgot how wordy it is read restaurant man much better","review":"I remembered reading this a long time ago and thought it was great. That was before I owned restaurants. Today I read an adjective self involved mans version of the restaurant business he drops names and adjectives not to descibe the location,or time to imagine yourself with him on the journey. He drops them like a puffed up parrot to show his use of the english language and dillusion of being a poet with a great team of public relations people that were in the right place as people wanted to know what goes on the kitchen. I couldn't get through this book this time, it was time consuming painful and wordy. I picked it up 4 times skipping chapters hoping it would get better and I was left disgusted with the book, myself for buying it, and wasting my time. I enjoy Bourdain on the travel channel so much more he's photogenic, tall, handsome, quirky, and more real. He must have better editors on tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks.","review":"I was so looking forward to this book. But what Bourdain serves is arrogance and self-aggrandizement. I was particularly disgusted as he described in raunchy terms what he offered to do to a produce supplier with whom he was displeased. Are we supposed to be impressed that he can intimidate those he considers beneath him? And sex in the bulk supplies closet? I would have thought a world class chef would be too busy for shenaniganism at work. Soul of a Chef is MUCH better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thing I wasn't eating while reading...","review":"...or I would've choked from laughing so much and so hard! I really enjoyed Bourdain's edgy and humorous look at what goes on behind the scenes in restaurants. Especially funny were his early days in this environment as he struggled to learn his craft and get a clue.Although Anthony Bourdain is vulgar and very much over-the-top [I loved every line, and even picked up some new and colorful expressions to use in my own kitchen!] in relating his experiences, I never felt like he was putting the reader on, especially since the book ends with a description of a VERY LONG day in the life of a chef."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accurate and entertaining view on professional cooking","review":"Speaking as a chef, this book ROCKS! I absolutely devoured (pun intended) it from cover to cover. I've worked in kitchens that are carbon copies to the ones Mr. Bourdain speaks of. If you are looking for an accurate, no holds barred account of life in the culinary industry, look no further. Besides, anyone who has the guts to call that ridiculous Emeril LaGasse \\"ewok-like\\" certainly has my vote!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book if your a cook","review":"This book was a wonderful tale about the culinary arts.

Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooks Rule","review":"Without question this is the first book that truly explains what degenerates that cooks truly are. As a 15 year veteran of many kitchens, I can honestly say that Bourdain has nailed what many of us always knew, cooks rule. As Bourdain described the cooks of the dreadnaught, where I worked by the way....not the dreadnaught, but a kitchen damn near the exact same....\\"They drank everything in sight, stole anything that wasn't nailed down [...]God help me, but that's us.Cooks rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Line cooks, waitrons, and bus-boys, oh my!","review":"Providing a somewhat disturbing look at life in the culinary world, Anthony Bourdain exposes the machinery of a commercial kitchen and the illegal aliens, addicts, and sociopaths that keep it well oiled.This is an engrossing read, one that it hard to put down once it is started. Unlike most other \\"food-literature\\" that I've read recently (\\"Comfort me with Apples\\" and \\"World of Pies\\") Bourdain does not provide recipes, or many anecdotes about food. He is much more concerned with the people who run the business: line cooks, chefs, waitrons, bus-boys, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Discount Sushi for Me, Thank You","review":"Anthony Boudrain's account of his life in a restraunt kitchen is not for the faint of heart. Squeamish diners may want to avoid this book and continue to dine in ignorant bliss. For the rest of us this hilarious book provides a candid look behind the kitchen door, warts, ...er...rats, and all.Sex, drugs, and profanity abound in Boudrain's world, but before taking offense the reader should remember the author's only promise was to tell the truth about about his experiences in the restaurant business. Anyone seeking a glorified account of life as a chef will be disappointed. This is not your Food Channel version; this is the real thing. I doubt that anyone who reads this book will be able to experience restaurant dining in quite the same way again.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthony...... need I say more?!?!?","review":"I could listen to Anthony read a 1st grade primer!!! This book is hilarious, if you are a fan of Mr. Bourdain's wicked and offbeat sense of humour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and informative","review":"The writing is nothing spectacular, but the content is entertaining and provides a look into the industry from an angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye New York! Hello East Orange!!","review":"I watch Bourdain's \\"No Reservations\\" television show on a regular basis. His narrations always interest me, they being sadistic, off-color, perverse, and need I add humorous. His love of classical music that originated at CBGB's in New York only added to my interest. But the real deal with this \\"cook\\" (read the book and you'll find the meaning of this word) is that he loves and appreciates food and those who prepare it. His book \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is an informative, amusing, and provocative look at the food industry. As I read this classic novel, I could hear his voice speaking the words as if I were having a conversation with the chef. It is an absolutely must-read for the Bourdain fan and anyone else who has found Monty Python's true meaning of life! A great read from a great gastronomist (Is this a real word?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome insight into the culinary world!!!","review":"This book is HILARIOUS and insightful. If you're looking for a fun book to read while at the same time educating yourself on the practical aspects of dining out and on the life of those who work in the culinary world, buy this book. And when you read this, you'll get a much better appreciation of Anthony and his shows on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Foodies and Others","review":"To all you three-star and below reviewers: LIGHTEN-UP! Yes, this is at times profane and a tad too honest, but those of us who have worked in the food industry know how accurate it is. His tone sets the proper rhythm for this dysfunctional line of work. This is truly a fun read. A must for your summer reading list. Remember, this chronicles his 25-years in the industry - drug and drink phases and all. I feel an clever, innovative movie in the making."},{"rating":"1","title":"I needed a shower after reading this book....","review":"Bourdain certainly knows his way with food, there is no question there. Additionally, he is very funny at times. However, as a human being he is not only filthy and foul, he takes great pride in it! With complete disregard for law, humanity, decency and anything but his own gratification he drags the reader through his world of crime, drugs, sex, more drugs, more crime, etc. Honestly, the person Bourdain reminds me of the most is Richard Kuklinksi, aka. The Ice Man (a Mafia serial killer). Strangely, I think Bourdain would approve of that analogy. Creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Dirt!","review":"I found this book to be an entertaining read, quick and a tad bit sleazy - the perfect book for a plane or the beach. As a devote foodie, I laughed, was disgusted by some scenes and salivated over others! Not literary genius but certainly fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining and informative","review":"A fun, entertaining read. I laughed out loud many times. I couldn't put this book down and thoroughly enjoyed it. This man is funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can't take the heat...","review":"I just love this book. The story is so honest and at times so raw that it just grabs you from the beginning. I find myself reading chapters to my wife and anyone else that will listen. His writing style grabs you and tells you \\"I am for real!\\". Tony justs lets it all hang out and doesn't really care who's offended. At the same time he seems like a great guy to have a few beers with. If you want a chance to hang out in the locker room of the cooking world with all its characters this is the book for you. Just don't loan out any bail money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good counterpart","review":"This was a good read. I enjoyed all of his stories, most I could relate to. Some I missed and still enjoyed. Having worked in few star restaurants things a bit different and yet surprisingly the same. Another good book is Clam Chowder: The Server's Field Manual. I think it can only be purchased through it's isbn or the webite: clamchowder.biz. A great read for waiters and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear & Lothing in the kitchen","review":"A great mix of Hunter Thompson, P.J. O'Rourke, and Michael Moore!A few handy hints about cooking, career paths, and drug use.This book is less about what happens at the local eatery, than why it happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wish on fundays","review":"The only weakness in this book is that it's really more a series of essays than a book -- it doesn't hold together all that well cover-to-cover. But you will have fun reading this book if you've ever worked in a restaurant, or even if you've ever just eaten in a restaurant (a decent one, that is -- not McDonlds or a chain place, but an actual decent restaurant), though it may disabuse you of any incipient wish you may have to become a chef. This book is one of the few I've read that really lives up to its reputation - it and Bourdain are justly acclaimed. Almost in spite of himself, Bourdain's love of food and life comes through in every chapter. This book is informative, funny, and honest -- what more could you possibly ask for in nonfiction?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The cure...","review":"If you have ever had the nagging feeling that you--a fine host or hostess who often makes people comfortable in your home and feeds them well--should open a restaurant, then this book will cure you of that delusion immediately. You will then be free to continue your life all the better because of it. 'Nuff said, since the other reviews give you a fair idea of what this book is about and extol its unique edgy, foodie charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, really.....","review":"Great read! Having found Anthony Bourdain through his travel show, I know feel I have a much better picture of where he came from as a Chef.His personality comes through loud and clear in his writing.I have a lot respect for the man since watching his episode in Mozambique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, smart, opinionated, and well worth reading","review":"Anthony Bourdain has risen from relative obscurity outside the New York restaurant scene to become practically a household name with more than one long-running and successful show on cable. The spark for that rise is this book, \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", which is both ribald memoir and dissertation on the state and nature of cooking for living.Readers who have worked in kitchens will find much with which they are familiar, and if they - like me - have moved on, they are likely to find it both nostalgic and funny. Likewise, stories from the author's past are humorous, cringe-inducing, or both, and his thoughts on cuisine, what it takes to be successful, and perhaps most importantly his honesty about his own failings, make for a well-written and entertaining (if profane) read."},{"rating":"2","title":"very insightful and well written","review":"i would refer this book to anyone who loves food and is curious as to how your food gets on your plate or anyone who finds tony interesting like i do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a wannabe chef.","review":"That was a fun read. I still want to open a restaurant of my own. Tony would laugh at me, I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourdain not Boring.","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest every bit as much as a good murder mystery. Bourdain is both candid and engaging. His insights into the food industry are sometimes shocking and always entertaining.At times I wondered how anyone could maintain this career and frantic lifestyle..then realized this fact was an underlying point of the book.Anyone who loves food,cooking, cooking shows and the unique personalities & characters associated with that world should enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, terrible kindle edition","review":"First, the content of the book wasn't very coherent. Didn't seem to be organized in any particular way, but the stories were interesting at least. I did find it a bit weird that he used fake names for all his former bosses. Don't you think that they'll recognize themselves in the book?The bad part is that Kindle edition has a typo in literally every other sentence. Clearly the result of a poorly OCR'd book without proper proof-reading. Nearly every foreign word was garbled. This made reading a book about cooking (lots of French terms) really annoying. The publisher should be ashamed to put out such a shoddy product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great Book! I hightly recommend! It was well written (easy-to-read, flowed well, great vocabulary, well balanced with humor and seriousness, painted a great picture of a 'life-in-the-life-of'). I especially enjoyed it having worked in the restaurant industry for a period of time, but anyone would enjoy it! Definitely shows the dark side a bit, but I believe it's a reality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourdain rocks!","review":"What can I say? If you love Anthony Bourdain, you will love this book! I always expect him to be funny, crude and blatantly honest, and he never disappoints in this book!

WHAT A STYLE - I LOVED IT!!!!!!IT'S ALL TRUE, I WAS A LINE COOK AND KITCHEN MANAGER MYSELF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily vulgar","review":"I bought this as an audio CD. First of all Anthony Bourdain reads the book. He reads entirely too fast and in a monotone. He claims to love his profession but his description of his career and the people he has known is primarily sarcastic. I really hated his vulgarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainly and simply put!","review":"A word of advice for potential readers..This is well and truly an 83 page book..Lots of input and insight, plus good down and dirty info about the places we pay to dine in...then it's just downhill and repetitious til the last overdone adjective. The points are made early...drugs, obscene language,etc. and any grownup reader will find himself yawning and wondering what happened to a great beginning...too bad..love the restaurant, tho.And, I wish that alot of the chef talk had been more clearly defined..I still don't know what a garde-manger is, nor in fact do I even begin to understand what the 'dupe' system is all about. Maybe next time around, Tony."},{"rating":"1","title":"macho, macho man","review":"OK, I get it, Anthony. You smoke like a stack, drink like a fish, curse like a truckdriver, shoot and snort and screw and blah, blah, blah. You're tough. Really, really tough. Enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, You're Such a Bad Boy...","review":"Anthony Bourdain is an ego-maniac who hails from a kitchen milieu that prides itself on \\"covers\\" - the number of orders that get sent out on any given night. That he's graduated to both covers and quality is to his favor, but he seems to be most concerned with shocking us with the mess and mayhem of production line cooks and cooking, and in being the bad boy of the culinary world. He rails against celebrity chefs, but has become what he dislikes. \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" is a quick read, somewhat entertaining, moderately informative, occasionally affecting, and completely self-aggrandizing. If you really want to read about how ugly a kitchen can be, take a look at \\"Down and Out in Paris and London.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourdain Is My Hero","review":"This is a great book. Highly recommend it. Watch his show too. The world would be a better place if there were more authentic individuals like Bourdain in our all too often homogeneous media."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best damn book","review":"I couldn't believe how intrigued I was just by the first sentances. I haven't had a book capture my interest like this since Catcher in the Rye (and that was highschool). I am in the industry and it is really nice to hear somone telling it how it really is, and how it is not just a \\"Martha Stewart / Emeril\\" world of culinary people - we have to work hard for everything that we do. I truly applaud Chef Bourdain it would be an honor just to work by him. Thank you for writing this book for me and everyone out there wearing the checks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality does bite-sometimes it bites hard","review":"As a working professional chef, and a CIA graduate, I thouroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. Yes, he dwells too much on his and others drug habits, but they are a very real part of the business, day in and day out. I howled out loud with laughter at some parts of the book, and nodded my head at others, knowing exactly what he was trying to say, even if it was directed only to those of us who have made the restaurant business our life. I sent this book to my mom and dad with a note stating that this is what my life has been like, only without the heroin and cocaine. The stress, the burns and cuts, the mentality of cooks digging in for the siege at Khe Sahn, they are all very real, and not just in New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, Better than Hype","review":"Arrogance tempered by painfully humbling moments seems to have delivered Mr. Bourdain to a place of confidence in what he feels he knows best."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Goodness!","review":"My Goodness! A great behind the scenes look into the goings on of the restaurants we all love. I'm a TV fan of Anthony Bourdain and this takes it even further....how he started, how and what he learned.....and not just the art of cooking. He delivers with the ease, humor and confidence that we've come to love. A fun and interesting read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Hurts","review":"I have to admit, I stayed away from restaurants for a few months after finishing this book. It's one thing to think chef's let food drop on the dirty floor, then pick it up and keep cooking. It's another thing to know it to be true. But that's what this book is all about, telling it like it is. Peeling back the trimmings and peering into the underbelly of kitchen life. From chefs having sex with bride's at their reception dinner to a standard day in the life of a top chef, it's all here in it's dirty glory. Looking around at modern restaurants though, I've been wondering if this book spawned the open kitchen movement where almost all restaurants in California now have taken down the solid wall between tables and chefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"calls 'em the way he sees 'em","review":"Bourdain gives it to us just the way he see it. An irreverent look at what goes on in the world of food service in honest language. No sugar coating here, nothing flowery or contrived; he just spits it out there the way he sees it. Fast read, highly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sexs, Drugs and Rock 'n Roll of the Cuisine Industry","review":"I rarely read non-fiction...how glad I am that I made an exception in this case! Kitchen Confidential is a must for anyone who likes to eat, and don't we all? It is riveting. After I read it I was in New York City and made it a point to eat at Les Halles (where Anthony Bourdain is the chef). It was wonderful! Also the bathroom was sparkling (read the book) and I peeked in to the kitchen and got a total thrill after having read the \\"scoop\\". So I highly recommend the book and I also recommend a trip to Les Halles when next you find yourself in the Big Apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading.....","review":"The title and dust jacket info lead you to believe that the book will be a behind-the-scenes look at restaurants. The book actually turns out to be a choppily written autobiography.Much of the story simply follows the author around from failed restaurant to failed restaurant. This gets tedious fairly quickly.There are a few passages that describe what a busy kitchen is actually like, and the grace and skill involved when someone is trying to cook 5 different meals simultaneously. For a few pages, everything comes together the way I wish the whole book had. These bits are few and far between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read, but the Kindle edition detracted with its typo errors","review":"A biographical story of Anthony Bourdain's culinary experiences. Funny, apalling and entirely captivating. I enjoyed every bit of it and wanted more. HOWEVER! I got the Kindle edition and the reading experience was marred by the transcriptional errors. For example I couldn't figure out what dish the repeated references to \\"pore mignon\\" meant. When they finally started intermittently refering to it as \\"pork mignon\\", I finally realized that it was a typographical/transcritional error. This type of error occured throughout the Kindle book and made guessing at the sentence sometimes necessary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen confidential","review":"I enjoyed the book. I recommend this book to whomever wants to know about the inside of an professional kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining read","review":"I thought the book was very entertaining. Light hearted look at what goes on in the kitchens. Just plain fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too real, too funny...","review":"After 25 years in the restaurant business myself, this laugh out loud tell-all brought both tears as well as lots of memories. Almost made me want to go back into the fire. Anthony Bourdain does not even remotely stretch the true, from what I've experienced.For anyone who was, is now or is just contemplating working in the madness that is the food service industry, PLEASE read this.My favorite chapter: \\"What I Know About Meat.\\"Keep 'em coming, Tony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read. Informative and motivating.","review":"While I don't agree with some of Chef Bourdain's philosphies (you never call in sick, thriving on chaos, etc.), this book is a great read. Informative, inspiring, excruciatingly honest, and downright funny in many places. He is a smart, decent, no-nonsense, and hard-working guy, who gives his all to his people and his cause. That is something to be appreciated. By all means buy the book and read it, for you will get hooked and enjoy it thoroughly. Also be prepared to spend money eating at expensive restaurants and get into a \\"chef mode,\\" buying saute pans, chef's aprons, and other such accoutrements that you suddenly realize you \\"need\\" for your kitchen. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books OF ALL TIME","review":"If Bourdain cooks even half as well as he writes, I'd sit at his table any day. This book and \\"Cook's Tour\\" were so delightful, I truly hated to finish them. He writes with wonderfully wry humor yet he's endearingly self-depracating. He tells compelling stories, isn't afraid to speak his mind (but is NEVER strident), and just writes the most entertaining tales you could ever want to read. This book could have been a nasty expose but instead, it is a rollicking good time. BRAVO ANTHONY BOURDAIN!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulp fiction for the amateur chef.","review":"Great and entertaining read for any amateur cooking enthusist who has ever fantasised about being a great chef or owner of an upscale little bistro (Bourdain made me come to my senses about THAT fantasy...read the section about sunday brunch) Lots of nifty little facts and hair raising stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Anthony BOURDAIN at his best!","review":"Found this book while perusing books to down load on my kindle. What an excellent read! Interesting, educational, funny, and way better than I thought it would be about becoming a Chef! Now I will have to read all the rest of books he has written! Talented, smart guy; who would have known!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I recommend this to anyone, whether you have worked in the restaurant business or not. If you dine out, good insight to the way restaurant owners, managers and chefs think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disdain for Bourdain","review":"Perhaps \\"disdain\\" a little strong, but it rhymes with Bourdain. After enough people suggested I read Kitchen Confidential because of my behind the scenes reporting (positive) in the restaurant industry, I broke down and bought the book. Was interesting in first 50 pages, but got tiresome and repetitive over the praising of drug heads in restaurant kitchens and slamming of \\"clueless\\" owners. Yawn. Struggled to finish. Too many good things to read than waste my time with this mea culpa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Komedy","review":"I read a lot about this book when it came out, but never actually read it until now. In spite of the familiarity of its often-quoted \\"Never eat fish on Mondays\\" and other gems that have become well-known, I enjoyed the freshness of the book and Bourdain's irreverent humor. Obviously, it's not great literature, but it's amusing, especially if you enjoy eating out and cooking.Jane Newhagenauthor of Sand Dollar ~ a tale of old Key West"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing truth about restaurant kitchens---and a great read.","review":"This is a classic \\"kitchen revelation\\" tale about the truth behind the scenes at your favorite upscale restaurant in NYC. Often shocking, frightening and hilarious, there is no cover-up here.I suspect that this scene is repeated all over in all level of restaurants---hopefully in a little milder version. The pressure,tension and frenetic pace of a kitchen staff to produce quality food for many diners is a challenge and best done when the staff choreographs their movements. Enjoy this read & hopefully you'll still want to go out for dinner after reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Digestible","review":"Opening and operating a restaurant is not as easy as people seem to think it is. You better know how to work with many different types of people. After reading this book, Ill remember not to order fish on Monday. This was a really good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foodie greatness","review":"Loved this book. After watching Bourdain for years it was a treat to read his story of his coming up in the ranks of the food world. Language was rough but typical of him. Looking forward to reading the rest of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fishy","review":"I was really looking forward to this book because I heard it would tell me everything I DIDN'T want to know about what was going on back in the kitchen of most restaurants. I was looking for the book to relate to ME and tell me about things I am interested in.Instead, I got a bunch of choppy stories that won't name names or places and seem to be hazy at best in their recollection. I'm not saying Tony is a bad writer; I think he's pretty darned good at writing. It's just that in order to protect the not-so-innocent, he has to blur our all the details.He seems to be fixated on fish, which I can't stand and most of the first part of the book only offers advice on what sort of fish you should stay away from in restaurants and when. I did like the chapter on Bigfoot, but everything else about the book was a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Taste","review":"Don't believe the hype--Anthony Bourdain isn't saying anything that George Orwell didn't already say (with a lot more flair) in Down and Out in Paris and London. Mostly, it's hard to love (or even care about) the ups and downs of a narcissistic hack like Bourdain, whose writing is clearly geared towards shock value rather than style or substance. Kitchen Confidential is a undercooked mish-mash of personal history, kitchen tell-all, and home-cooking tips. Don't give up your day job, Mr. Bourdain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling...needs editing","review":"Too many adjectives. No documented information. Becomes boring. Reads like journal of person in recovery. Rambles on about... problems. Interesting information on chief tools. I heard him on talk show and got book from library. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex, drugs and curse words","review":"This book is very boring. Every scandalous tidbit you are expecting is already in the promos, so you needn't bother with this. He actually has a page of curse words used in the kitchen - and their definitions. Yeah, with 40 pages left I decided not to waste any more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"It is hard to believe that this book has gained so much attention. It is centered much more on Bourdain's own personal biases, and his attempts to brag about his own encounters than on the industry. He attempts to write of his own progress when it sounds as though he has truly not come very far. It is poorly written, redundant, and it becomes boring after a very short time. His excessive us of profanity throughout the book makes it difficult to concentrate on what little content is included. Save both your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading for any foodie","review":"I absolutely loved reading this book and could not put it down. My only regret is that it wasn't longer. I hope that Tony's two novels come back into print as I would like to read those as well. I wish the book had a glossary for some of the terms, ingredients and dishes that are mentioned that I had never heard of before. I look forward to the sequel! (Please write one Tony...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh the Memories!","review":"I love how Anthony Bourdain can add sophistication to the grueling and raw life hidden behind the walls of our favorite resurtants.

I LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't eat the meat!","review":"Well written, entertaining, and amusing. However, by his own admission, he exaggerates and overgeneralizes much of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undercooked tripe (and not the edible kind)","review":"That this book ever even got published says more about the insular world of NYC inner circles than it does about the author's writing ability, which is negligible. A long and tedious account of self-aggrandizement, chest thumping, and dubious boasting, there is nothing of any substance to be gleaned here. Spend your money on a good dinner instead of enriching this blowhard."},{"rating":"2","title":"mise en place!","review":"This is how it really can be in the restaurant business. Perhaps the best book I have read in a long time. Though being a chef I have not had much time to read other than the quick reference of a few cookbooks. Hats off to Boudain who can not only cook but can write text interesting, funny and captivating. Anyone who has worked in restaurants can identify with this book. You Know who you are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One part Fear and Loathing and One part Joy of Cooking","review":"Reading this amazing book is like finally tasting an old wine that you knew existed, but didn't know how to find. I assume that most of the folks who are posting positive reviews relate to the author's ultra-real account of the restaurant industry. As well, the writing is raw and simple - the perfect way to tell a tale that is the same. It makes you want to go fill a nasty old thermos with some 12-year Scotch and get your hands in some good food. Yum."},{"rating":"2","title":"spicy page-turner","review":"A glimpse into a life I'll never probably lead, not being born to it, this is a fine autobiography. I feel anyone who loves cooking and food will enjoy it, perhaps anyone who loves gossip and intrigue will also. Not for the fainthearted, it does cast a bit of a shadow on the mystery of fine cuisine, you might not look at your order from the kitchen quite the same waya again. That may not be a bad thing. All in all an enjoyable, fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and an eye opener.","review":"Kitchen Confidential is enormously entertaining and an eye opener for those of us not in professional kitchens.

This is a great book and you won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm late to the party","review":"and I don't have chef experience, but as a writer, this memoir gave me the occasional twinge of unworthiness. Bourdain has a keen eye, a sharp ear, and an incredibly(although appealingly) dirty mouth. Of course, try as I might, I could never write *this* book, because it's a New York book written by a man who appears to have clarified butter in his veins--a function of time, place, and experience. Thanks for having \\"No Reservations\\" about being so honest, chef. I'm definitely reading more of your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This chef knows how to write! Very well-written and highly entertaining memoir by an egomaniacal, testosterone-ridden and ultimatel erudite chef. I'll never be able to ignore a restaurant kitchen again. Instead, I'll tell myself, \\"I know what's going on in there...!\\" Mr. Bourdain's several afterwards are almost as insightful as the rest of his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!","review":"Anthony Bourdain is an excellent writer. If you are easily offended by drug references, sex, drugs and rock-and-roll, too bad!

He is blunt, coarse, yet his honesty is refreshing. He gives the reader the often true impression that disturbed folks are attracted to the cooking industry. From drugs, mobsters, booze, etc this is not a dull read. His disdain for tv chefs like Emeril, Flay, & Rachael Ray may be overstated? But, he shows high reverence for the 3-4 star chefs who work hard & rarely get any attention or credit. This is the loudest part of the book.He is equally honest about his own faults, drugs & his distaste for authority. Two chapters shine through the most. \\"Bigfoot,\\" practical info for the reader on dining out, & \\"Cook like the pro's,\\" on the art of managing people. All in all a fascinating look into an industry that only a small percentage of people ever experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Confidential","review":"Sardonic. Irreverent humor.

I am a fan.Alex Cord"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lived up to the hype","review":"I'm a little late to read Kitchen Confidential. I became a fan of Anthony Bourdain from No Reservations. Reading this now after getting to know him through other projects was fun. Kinda like watching the second and third star wars(the originals) then seeing the first. Some of the surprises are spoiled but it's fun to yell at the screen \\"dude you kissed your sister and that's totally your dad\\" ,\\"dude get off the smack already and get your snarky mug beamed into my living room\\". For me it was a great prequel to what I know about the man. Obviously the book came before all the tv fame but for a lot of people, a little late to jump on the bourdain wagon, this will be an awesome prequel. A lot better than the three new star wars movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, but there are text problems","review":"I'm enjoying the book, but the Kindle edition is filled with text errors (spacing, hyphens, OCR errors). Not only does this make it difficult to read, but dramatically lessens the pleasure of reading the story. This needs another quality check and some more proofreading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Within 48 hours of receipt, I was done reading it!","review":"As a former cook in the process of moving back towards it, Bourdain's book was an absoulte delight to read.Though many of the absolute horror stories in his book, are certianly the things he's seen, as apposed to the absolute norm of fine dining, no doubt the things did happen in the late 70's and 80's as Bourdain was coming up and in certain nooks continue to this day.His stories about favorite sauce spoons, pans, side towels, knives, etc touched many fond memories for me, and it had me laughing out loud dozens of times.One of the funniest books I've ever read, though I think working in the business gives you a unique perspective.The book is part information, but mostly, an autobiography of Bourdain's food related life in a blunt, no holds barred way only he can deliver.It's certainly not the most well written book I've ever read, but it's damn enjoyable just like mama's meatloaf.But, if foul language offends you, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it while eating a seafood salad and a well done steak","review":"An enjoyable read which will make you an informed consumer when dining out. I worked very briefly as a dishwasher, potwasher (chief potwasher), and waiter (recommend and push the snapper), and even visited the Fulton St Fish Markets, and found this book entertaining. After reading the chapters about line cooks, weekend brunches, and the use of Thursday fish as Monday specials, I went out to eat on a Monday night, and guess what... all three dinner specials were fish and seafood dishes. You won't be grossed out after skimming this book, but you will definitely become an enlightened restaurant diner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter Thompson in the Kitchen","review":"Kitchen Confidential was recommended to me by my son, who has worked in kitchens and now manages a restaurant and bar. I work in a hotel that has a fine dining restaurant and a bar. I began laughing at the beginning and, with a few breaks when Mr. Bourdain's serious side showed, didn't stop till the end. The book is well written and, at the same time, totally nutsoid. I loved it. I highly recommend it. I have read one of Mr. Bourdain's novels and plan to seek out other things he's written. Bon Appetit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insider's guide","review":"This is a good read on the insider's guide to how a kitchen is run and how grueling being a chef can be. I enjoyed Tony's views and \\"punk\\" attitude to being a chef. I finished this book this summer and need to read the 2nd one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never laughed so hard while reading a book","review":"In a world of being politically correct, Anthony Bourdain is anything but. I've never laughed so hard while reading a book. His recalling of countless escapades with his questionably legal kitchen employees shine a light on a world few of us have ever seen. After reading this, I have a hard time entering a restaurant without laughing, remembering parts of this hilarious and truthful book. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vanity Book","review":"Some of the chapters actually provide what the book promises - a behind-the-scenes look at restaurant kitchens, but most of it is just the author desperately trying to convince his readers of what a rockstar he is. I read the chapters on the kitchens and skipped over all the other, even still I wouldn't really recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"accurate but oversold","review":"a good deal of my life was spent in kitchens very similar to those described by the author. i agree with his portrayals but feel the flow of this book is hampered by redundancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real life in the kitchen.","review":"I could not put this book down.Having worked in the restaurant business for many years, I was taken by the way Mr. Bourdain captured the down to earth grittiness and fun of behind the scenes.A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kitchen confidential","review":"Rairly have I read a book that I hate. This is it! Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room. Tony's fan base just lost one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I'd rate this as 0 if it were an option. Bourdain seems to be trying to live up to some kind of strange ideal, but he comes across as self-centered and self-absorbed. Not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy culinary arts, do not waste your time!","review":"This would not be the valedictorian's address, it is rather the bottom feeder's look on the \\"culinary industry\\". The book is full of poor taste gossip, unnecessary sex and pointless narrative. I do not consider it a culinary book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self glorifying portray of sensory decadence","review":"A star wants to be born, amidst the puddles of animal fat, screams and blood. A star who finds sensual pleasure in frying animal fat and who openly hates vegetarians, compassion and anyone who's not as twisted as he is. An individual who longs for the exquisite taste of monkey brains (were the monkey's craneum top is removed while still alive, to die only with the trust of the metal spoon). This person embodies the worst of the qualities that have made the French so famous: a decadent sensory obsession and experimentation where anything and everything goes (and has), coupled with the arrogance and disdain of a people who long for appreciation they've never gotten. My veredict: This book is just another brick of the wall that separates France from civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too distasteful for my tastes","review":"I WANTED to like this book. It was our book club selection... I was hosting the book club meeting...and I always read the monthly books. Somehow, this book put me in a bad mood, especially during the holidays, and its foul language and distasteful stories didn't fit with my family, holiday spirit. Instead, I stuck with \\"Good in Bed\\", \\"Clara\\", and \\"Master of the Senate\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, and","review":"I studied with Madelaine Kamman in Newton Centre, Ma. who had the only great restruant at that time, she and Enzo Danesi changed the way Boston wanted to eat when dining out, in the 70's, you could wait 3 months to get a reservation in her sparkling, clean,restruant. I marveled at her ability to give the customer very good food, no leftovers and most of it fresh that day. Pates',some desserts, normally carried to next day, like a cake or frozen sorbet. I was there over a period of three years and know how great a chef she was and is.

And he knows how bad he is. And will tell you over and over again because you are expected to be entralled by 300+ pages of this.He is so happy to remind you of the amount of drugs he has taken and his love of kitchen chaos, and this work comes to serve little actual purpose outside of a self-indulgent recount of his numbing adventures. Honestly, this piece could have easily been condensed to a chapter on his misadventures and a chapter for the rest.There are very few tips, even fewer stories worth recounting and the work is framed around an incoherant chronology.I do give Bourdain complete credit for his writing, which is actually wonderfully varied, intelligent and impressive. This is possibly the only positive to this dullish piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego trip by an overaged little boy...","review":"This book is a pure ego trip by an overaged, over-the-hill, drug addict and has-been chef. The look behind the scenes in the kitchen is interesting but I find his advice fairly insulting to my intelligence. The book \\"Heat\\" is far better and is minus all the four letter words which I do not need. However, the book can be entertaining if read it for what it is. Mr. Bourdain has been shamed by all the better chefs who actually have some Michelin stars to their credit and who actually give better advice and techniques. Even Anthony Bourdain's good chef buddy, Eric Ripert, is a whole lot more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TO MY TASTE","review":"For someone in a career that caters to the public, Chef Bourdain certainly seems to dislike a lot of people. He ridicules many of his customers, his employers and his fellow chefs.I got tired of his macho-strutting; his swearing; his constant references to drugs and sex.Yes, I learned some things about what goes on behind the scenes in some of the NY restaurants, but it wasn't worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly interesting!","review":"Very well written, gritty, honest account. I laughed and sometimes got thoroughly lost in the story. Definitely worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I love everything Anthony Bourdain does, and this is no exception. His candour, honesty and snarkiness make this an incredible read, even for someone who couldn't tell you anything about most of the dishes he mentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Spice or Garnish. Just your everyday fare.","review":"First let me say that there was a chapter toward the end of the book that was an interesting description of an average day for a chef. The question is, after that nightmare description, why would anyone want to become a chef or work anywhere near a resturant kitchen? This book was advertised as a \\"tell-all\\" story about resturants. Instead of giving us a luscious scoop of resturant deJour, what the reader receives is more than you ever wanted to know about the suthor's drug habit. The story is shallow, uneven, and disjointed. If you want a good story to sink your teeth into then I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Here is a great way to save some time and money - read this sentence: Restaurant kitchen staff drink alot and use alot of drugs, they also use alot of vulgar language. There you have it! The whole book! Kind of Hunter Thompson meets Julia Child. Quite repetitious and superficial. A bit of a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for anyone who's thought about cooking professionaly","review":"This book is great. It made me both want to take cooking classes and sure I never want to be a professional chef. You can't beat the having Anthony read it, either. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have stuck to cooking","review":"This book came to my attention as a review from Amazon, probably because I buy a lot of cook books.About 1/3 of the way through, and one typo to many I realised it needed an editor. 2/3 of the way through I realised it needed a writer too. Pages of patois curses and their meanings. Of what relevance is this to restaurants really? Dated anecdotes of trivial New York decadence. Ethnic stereotyping. Sexism. Some very odd anachronisms. A few good pages here and ther on food and cooking. Not enough to warrant the price or time spent reading it.Ersatz gonzo journalism is both obsolete and out of date. Shame Amazon! For a few dollars you lauded this woefully inadequate book and now I can't ever trust your reviews again.00000"},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"By all accounts, this guy isn't much of a chef. Despite his fervent desire to be \\"one of us\\", he ain't.He's not much of a writer either. His words are forced, his scenarios are false, and he relies on stereotypes to support his portrayal of being somebody he's not. I couldn't care less that he's stupid enough to put herion into his veins. He's just another loser who wants to justify his inability to excel by somehow \\"identifying\\" with the rest of the people who really do work hard to put out a decent meal.Skip this nonsense. Look toward successful chefs for insight, whose words are few and far between. Bourdain is a fake. He's just cashing in on the FoodTV craze while at the same time condemning it. Fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered, Hard to Follow, and .... boring","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book because I enjoy Chef Bourdain on the Travel Channel. However, the book is very hard to follow - I could not keep track of where he was in his career or what was really happening.I think an editor would be an excellent addition to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gonzo fun but marred by strange homophobic remarks","review":"Bourdain thinks he's a bad*ss because he did a lot of drugs and eventually succeeded as a chef. He's not. This Vassar-educated \\"rebel\\" comes off as a loudmouthed jerk a lot of the time--which makes for entertaining reading...except when he makes one of his numerous homophobic remarks. He claims to have no trouble with gays, even writes nicely about some gay owners he used to work for, but he also seems to have discomfort with \\"sensitive\\" types he has known and rips on a gay waiter who dared to sue him--making a disgusting remark about microbes related to what he assumes to be the waiter's personal practices.Doth the man protest too much?"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Irritating Attitude","review":"Either the writer is an arrogant, obnoxious, irritating, attitudinal jerk, or he wants us to think that he is an arrogant, obnoxious, irritating, attitudinal jerk.

Sorry I bought it and thereby increased the guy's income."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prefer Food Poisoning","review":"I wish I'd read the reviews prior to purchasing.

If you can get passed the cigs, sex, and old food sent out as the 'special of the day', there is some merit. If you can't stand watching his 'No Resevations\\" on TV this isn't a book you will enjoy.

The Kindle version is so horrendously and unforgivably riddled with grammatical errors and absent punctuation that all the mojo of the narrative is hopelessly drained from the experience.

I have had a tendency to think chefs were like the ones we see on TV shows, with this peak into the underbelly of the kitchen, I can see that a job is a job is a job! The same personality types are found in every workplace. The descriptions of the food and how it comes to the plate were great. I esp. liked the chapter where he took us from the time he woke up until his day was over.

I always knew he was full of himself and that was half the fun of watching him on the telly. But reading this left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). The book is disjointed and you can only read so many hijinx before they all start sounding the same. Oh yeah, they are all pretty much the same.Face it Tony, you go around eating everyone elses food and enjoying different cultures at the expense of cable TV but you're a has-been, wantta-be in this day and age of true \\"Top Chef Masters.\\" Maybe once he is asked to join those elite, he'd regain my respect.

I thought the individual stories were interesting, but Bourdain keeps jumping around from memory to memory, not keeping with the \\"timeline\\" feel he starts out with. It's confusing to know which job he is refering to and where that particular job fits in the timeline.He also has a tendency to be long winded. I found myself jumping ahead of some of his descriptions that were quite predictable and over done.All in all, I was very disappointed in the book. The story of the \\"underbelly\\" of cuisine is a fascinating one, but Bourdain didn't quite \\"cut the mustard\\" with his version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read even if you never worked in a kitchen in NY.","review":"I have done time as a low level cook in my mid teen years. Stared with myopic abandon while high on grass as I tackled a huge pile of trays at the dishwashing sink - no mechanical washers in my days, it was long and hard work!Even if you never cooked a pack of Ramen in your life, this is a good read if you enjoy Bourdains' semi-Hunter Thompsonesque existance in the entertainment world.I can admire a man that gets kicked of Food Network for essentually crusing around and getting blotto on camera in far away places.....heck, that's what I'd do if I had the chance!Now I need to read A Cooks Tour which I percieve as being better than Confidential.Tony - Good Luck on your up and coming show with Travel Channel.

This book is what some would call \\"a real page turner.\\"You get to hear a lot about the seedy back areas of restaurants.The bad:If you're not a cook in a fancy restaurant you probably won't understand at least a third of what he's talking about and you'll spend a lot of quality time with Wikipedia.He uses a lot of french words and phrases where english would have sufficed just as well.There are a lot of fairly blatant product placements.A lot of what the author says seems to be embellished for dramatic effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads just like his show","review":"This book is really great, and as a fan who was first introduced to Anthony Bourdain through his show, I enjoyed how the book had the same tone as his speech.

I thought the book was a fun read and was better than I expected. It was entertaining and gave you a better glipse of the man behind the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely compelling, yet ultimately not my cuppa tea","review":"The subtitle, Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly, is very apt.Bourdain makes frequent use of simile and metaphor in his writing. Like a junior high boy, however, all his comparisons refer to human excretory functions and sex acts.The book was strangely compelling, yet ultimately not my cuppa tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for any and all ex- and current restaurant and food lovers","review":"Mr. Bourdain has strung together, hidden in the form of a memoir, every story anyone who has ever worked in food service has told in some form or another, and done it well. The antics, the secrets, the drama and melodrama of the kitchen/pantry/freezer, the love/hate relationship between diners and restaurant staff--all of these things are anecdotally exposed in a straightforward and honest mode.The writing is crisp, although not clean, and extremely easy to read. You'll find yourself going from chapter to chapter with a promise to turn the light off after the next, and then read on instead. Entertaining, engrossing, Mr. Bourdain's life and recollections, however accurate or exaggerated, are worth reading for the entertainment value, the nostaglia it instills (in those of us who have worked in some capacity in a restaurant), and the appreciation it might help you have the next time you sit down to a nice meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whole Truth","review":"As a kitchen professional who has worked in many kitchens on both coasts, this is the first book that really tells it like it is. The rush of making through the night is almost as good as some of the drugs that AB used.The most interesting parts were his discussions of the types of kitchens that exist (serious vs. hyperactive) and his advise to those who want to enter the field. I've worked in both types of kitchens and have always enjoyed the hyperactive ones. AS for his advise, it's right on the money.A must read for those who really want to know what life in the kitchen is really about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short And To The Point","review":"Excellent read, by the same guy that brings you the TV show on the Travel Channel, Anthony Bourdain.

Bourdain writes the way he speaks: candidly, bluntly and with style. He is an intelligent and unpretentious writer. Of course it isn't going to be everyone's cup o'tea nor should this book be a textbook at Le Cordon Bleu. If you like Bourdain on \\"No Reservations\\" or even his guest spots on \\"Top Chef\\", this book is exactly how you might imagine a book by him. Read it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this raggedy gourmet","review":"I've been a fan of AB since watching No Reservations on Travel Channel. I had no idea what his background was and it's pretty fascinating. The drugs are incidental. The coming up through the ranks and the succession of messy jobs in kitchens all over Manhattan is what makes this such a great read. Not the mention the professional tips for making your own cooking experience at home more fun and skilled. Plus, I will take his advice and never order fish in a restaurant on a Monday night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast pace tempo that many New Yorkers know and love.","review":"I bought this book for a six-hour flight and chuckled the whole way. Before reading the book becoming a chef was always a distant fantasy. Not anymore! Anthony Bourdain does not hold back in regards to revealing trade secrets, his opinions of select celebrity chefs, common obscenities used in the work place and his generalization of which nationalities work best together in a kitchen. He tells great stories about his experiences in various NYC restaurants such as Supper Club and Les Halles. It has the same fast pace tempo that many New Yorkers are familiar with. Being a native New Yorker I felt right at home reading this book and finished wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mastering the Art of Self Absorption","review":"Bourdain's account of his life as a chef is too long by half. The best parts of the book--his amusing revelations about where restaurant leftovers end up and why NOT to order the special--appeared in The New Yorker. Save money by finding the back issue and reading him there.The rest of the book, Bourdain's autobiography, is an unsavory casserole of narcissism and some not terribly convincing self loathing, spiced with so many boring references to scoring drugs that, by the end, I found myself skimming rather than reading. There are a number of typos, and the book has a manic, disorganized quality that presumably reflects the author's personality but, more likely, suggests that it was rushed into print. Bourdain's prose resembles, well, a buffet table: a few decent things but an awful lot of chicken chow mein and seafood Newburg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and overdone","review":"So we know he is manaical. How many stories about his drinking and drugging do we have to endure. This book would have made a much better short story, very short. It is not anything like what I expected. So I know he won't eat mussels in someone elses kitchen. I was expecting an \\"expose\\" on behind the scenes action. Silly me, I wanted more dirt on whether uneaten bread and chips go back in the basket for the next customer, not page after page of the foul words used in his kitchen. The only thing I think I can say that's positive, is that I have a real appreciation for the orchestration of the meals for a twelve-top. Sorry, I waited for this book for two weeks, and am amazed that I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I am only a few chapters in. I really like the way the book is laid out. I got out my highlighter after the firtst few pages so that I may go back to the sweet spots more quickly. I am already debating if it is something my 10 year old nephew could read and enjoy. Lots of it is common sense...or clarification of such. I think it seems like something everyone should read. It aids you in empowering your self...not letting yourself \\"go\\" to a higher power. In the end we can be the only ones to control our actiOns. And I am using this book to harness that power.Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST TO SHARE WITH YOUR CHILDREN!","review":"Concise and exact!

Although the book is relatively short, it packs in a timeless message that can be helpful to all who are open to it.

It's interesting insight into birth of love through erotic. I'm glad that heroes were able to understand and to forgive. The bright colours of automn, the magic of ocean seemed so real that I could feel the leaves' rustling, the wind's breath. I was not only reader, but spectator.

Bland, trite and apparently attempting to appeal only to the very small fraction of consumers who purchase a substandard vehicle. Please note that most of the favorable reviews are obviously friends of the author who also lives in Wisconsin. Do yourself a favor and skip it. Keep a few more bucks out of the hands of one of America's \\"way too many\\" lawyers. (I read as much as I could stand in the bookstore over coffee. No sale here!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"just another lawyer on an ego trip","review":"This is just another book by a lawyer who thinks he is some kind of hero. What a joke. The author obviously is having a tough time making a living handling cases for clients with bad transmissions, so he decided to write a book to try to make a few bucks. If this is his first book, it should also be his last. Boring, self-serving and meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your time or money on this book","review":"The author tells a few war stories(obviously embellished), mixes in some attempts at humor (weak), and tries to convince us that there is some epidemic of bad cars and crooked auto dealers out there. The fact is that the types of problems set out in the book are VERY rare (if they happened at all). Anyone with a brain and a spine can handle a situation with a car dealer. 99% of the consuming public buys a car with no significant problems whatsoever, and they certainly do not need to hire an attorney to handle these minor disputes.If you must read about this topic, buy the book used, or wait until it is a $4.99 paperback. That's all it is worth. By the way, it looks like the author is getting his relatives to write good reviews for the book(see Chris Megna Sept 25). At least he has one fan !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Moore with a Law Degree","review":"When I read Bring on Goliath, I couldn't help thinking back to Roger and Me, Michael Moore's first film about General Motors. The auto industry will hate this book. It reveals an anti-consumer corporate attitude that is revolting. This is the type of book I would expect from Moore if he were a lawyer. Vince Megna uses the courts, instead of videotape, to take on the auto industry. Goliath is a very interesting anti-corporate read from a unique perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and ignorant piece of work","review":"This program entirely neglects Einstein's achievements in favor of his disorganized sex life. This is rather like berating Casanova for not being a mathematical genius. The treatment of Einstein's failures as a family man manages to be both sanctimonious and titillating at the same time. The script is barely literate, containing many grammatical 'howlers', and there is much use of inconsequential footage. You will learn precisely nothing about science from watching this video, and not much about the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RECOMMENDED","review":"This DVD repeats stories about Albert Einstein marriages and having a child out of wedlock three or four times for some unknown reason.

These are quite nice, they do what they are supposed to do. HOWEVER, compared to the ones I gave to a friend, her birthday gift is nicer than the ones I elected to keep. These are a good classic shape, but hers are prettier. They do indeed crush, but I would greatly prefer that the crushed bits were much smaller. And althugh its silly, her refills came in little glass bottle, while mine are plasic tubes. So, these are nice, and I would likely have been pleased with them if I hadn't have had the easy oppurtunity to compare them to the Martha Stewart ones.

My brother cracked his filling on it. I have had numerous other guests complain.

The salt is not ground fine enough to enjoy without worrying about your dental bill.

I bought the set to replace an older wooden set that wore out. I wish I had the old set back. The salt grinder only works when the humidity is desert like.

Loses Credibility","review":"There are some good psychological explanations of the necessary steps towards forgiveness. However, I found the book to have too much reference to God; thereby, losing all scholarly credibility.The authors hypothesize, that one of the reasons a person should forgive is because: \\"Lest you conclude that we endorse not forgiving, let us strongly state that we believe forgiveness is right because it is part of the godly life taught and lived by Christ.\\" page 14What if the reader (such as myself) is NOT a Christian. Then if one does not believe in God or Christ, this line of reasoning is worthless and not convincing to the reader.The book is filled with reference to God and Christ and the Bible; thereby, negating any objective clinical scholarly findings they may pose in this book.This book is a terrible disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Makes Me Hungry for More","review":"The first time I saw Off Broadway was at the Brat Stop in Kenosha, WI, shortly after the release of \\"On\\". Amazingly, Cliff and the boys have lost none of the energy that rocked us way back then. I've seen Ken play with James Young in the intervening years, and his precise rhythms are even tighter today than ever before. The absence of John Ivan changes the sound, to be sure, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Mimi Betinis is rock solid and plays with more emotion. My only disappointment with this record (by the way, great version of the Beatles \\"She Said...\\") is that it contained nothing from \\"Fallin' In\\". But a great representation of a great band that makes me ask all over again, WHERE IS QUICK TURNS?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same tired old stuff","review":"I've probably read most of the books written just by Norton plus quite a few of the collaborations. While I really liked her books when I was much younger they now seem so formulaic; this book is no exception. Beast master problems with telepathic links, the Xiks, cooperation in order to defeat the threat and new-found love between what seem like antogonists at the beginning of the tale. I am also annoyed at what seems like constant repackaging of her older works. I really think that this mine is just played out and that Miss Norton should hang it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Andre Norton book","review":"Anyone expecting to read a book in Ms Norton's Beast Master series, beware. This book is one of those \\"prop gramma up and if she drools, use it in the plot\\" collaborations so beloved of the publishing industry. How they get any self-respecting author to participate in this kind of scam is a mystery to me. Actually I guess they didn't because the collaborating (cough cough \\"ghost\\" cough) writer is so unskilled that its obvious she has no self respect.Like most of the later material billed as Norton's work, this is just fanfic with a major label's logo on the spine. If you like fanfic, you can find much better free stuff scattered across the Internet. I particularly like the one where Hermione Granger's cat and E'et engage in cross-universe hi-jinks. If you want actual Andre Norton fiction, you will just have to be satisfied with the wonderful works she has left us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Some of the continuations of Andre Norton's worlds have been gems, and some of them have been disappointments. Beast Master's Ark is the worst to date. The original Beast Master was one of my favorite books, with Norton's classic complexity of phrase, her textured and troubled main character, and her believable yet alien world. This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of. The story never generates tension, and there is no climax. McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough. There must be some story. To add insult to injury, there are multiple typos, and some editing mistakes like tense switching that add to the general sense of a book that is not well written. I am sorry that Andre Norton put her name to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you have a website or are getting one, BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"The Big Red Fez will take you about 20 minutes to go through. I learned why websites and work and why they don't. Seth's ideas and concepts are clear and easy to understand. You have a choice.

I give it out to all my family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need to read this book, then don't bother builing a website","review":"This book was a waste of the 30 minutes it took me to read. Seriously if you need to read this book you should not be building a website. Let someone else do it for you. This book should be given to foreign programmers as they have no clue. If you surf the web everyday you will have all of the knowledge that this book provides. Nothing new here, he just puts together ideas he thinks work. I only found one page of the book helpful. I run an e-commerce company for tall men's clothing and my friend told me to read this book. A waste of time if you ask me if you haven't already figured it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book or brochure?","review":"I find it difficult to believe so many people liked this book:The author starts off with 'bad' examples that admittedly have been made on many websites, but are really to obvious to put in a book of which the author is claimed to have 'inimitable wisdom' (back cover).Then, towards the end, more examples of 'good' design are given, and most of these did not impress me at all. At some point I even got the feeling this was some sort of brochure (given its size, you can hardly call it a book) written to advertise the websites of Godin's friends and clients.The enormous amount of research the author must have done is nicely summarized in this quote from page 105: 'Find the sites on the web that are working and copy their organization.'If you're looking for a good book on this subject, look up Steve Krug or Jakob Nielsen."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Seth's style","review":"As Seth Godin says - there's probably more detailed and less simplistic books around which cover the topic of web design and development - and I have read them too. But this one captures the essence of the REAL needs of a web customer in a simple easy to digest format. I would recommend the book for anyone building the first (or even 10th) website. And perhaps I'd even give it to my customers who frequently ask us to build crazy ideas into their websites.Steve Mathew - Managing Director, Fireworkx.com (designer and developer of websites and web systems)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look for the big banana","review":"The Big Red Fez is a quick read. This book covers the many does and don't of web site development from a user experience perspective. Even for the experienced web site designer, The Big Red Fez, back to the basic approach serves as a good reminder that the customer comes first.The loudest message from The Big Fed Fez is that the site should be about the customer not the developer, marketer or business manager. There is some good commentary on customer segmentation and how to address customer segmentation. Another useful idea is trying different approaches and measuring the results of each. There are plenty of products that make this approach feasible and the results make the effort worth while. One of the most important activities is measuring is establishing a baseline.The Big Red Fez is a quick read, but has many useful ideas and concepts. If you are an engineer, marketer or business owner manager this book provides useful insights into building a great customer experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better read Krug or Nielsen","review":"As someone suggested, you are better off reading Steve Krug or Jakob Nielsen.

Sure some ideas might be timeless but this book uses poor example after poor example to make its point. I read another web book called \\"Don't make me Think\\" just before this one.

I was forced to read this by a former employer (don't ask)...and it was waste of time that would have been much better spent reading something like Designing Web Usability by Jakob Nielsen.This book is filled with stuff that would only be a revelation to PHBs or dippy marketing people. Seth is such a snake-oil salesman that I don't even know where to begin. If you are someone who actually works on a website's usability, don't waste your time and money on this, spend it on people who have been in the software usability biz for years (Jakob Nielsen), not some johnny-come-lately huckster with no discernible credentials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money - Save Your Time","review":"I sure am glad that I only got this \\"book\\" from the library and didn't actually pay for it!

A collection of interviews of women who are speaking out and changing the world in areas historically reserved for men, this book reveals the heart-centered nature of the contributors. If you are a woman, this book is a must-read. I savored each and every story, and was truly sad when I got to the last biography. At the same time, I felt my hidden potential as a human being awaken, and came away with feelings of empowerment and a sense of personal duty to raise myself even higher than I previously thought possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item!","review":"We purchased this to go with our new faucet, countertops and sink.

Insinkerator was willing to replace my oil rubbed flange with another oil rubbed one or a stainless steel one.

Then about 4 months after living in our home I noticed what appeared to be something metallic looking on the rim. Unfortunately, it wasn't something metallic looking, it was the metal surface under the PAINTED ON ORB finish. By Christmas 2012 another couple of chunks had chipped off the paint and our new sink looks terrible. I'm going to purchase a sink strainer to hide the flange completely.

Calculations such as subtracting time A from time B and displaying time lapsed will not work and return error messages. Not worth the price. However if the company bothers to read all the horrible crash stories,they might think of tying the form to an open source embedded database(which should work without any stupid limitations on file size etc) .

A hardback commemorative edition was featured one month and upon checking it out I fell in love with it. There is something so brave and human about Mr. Pooter and his lifemate Carrie. His love of wife and home, his strivings to conform to the latest \\"art and Crafts\\" trends and his little bumps along the way are so endearing. One of the most humorous themes in the book is the flummoxing nature of Mr. Pooter's non-conformist son who inexplicably decides to rename himself Lupin. Written as a parody to mock the striving lower middle class, there is nontheless, a completely recognizable humanity in the estimable and honorable Mr. Pooter which elevates him worthy of at least a \\"fanfare for the Common Man.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE CHEAP PRINT-ON-DEMAND editions of this book!","review":"I ordered the version of this book by \\"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (April 24, 2012)\\" without paying attention to the publisher, and I regret it. This book is printed on full size 8.5 by 11 inch paper, all the way across the page, and looks to have been laid out in Microsoft Word. It is going to be hard to read because of the formatting -- those are long lines (there is a reason magazines use columns).Unfortunately, Amazon will probably put my review under every different edition of Diary of A Nobody, so please note this review is for a particular edition.I've got nothing wrong with well-done print-on-demand editions, but these companies need to at least apply minimum formatting standards to make their text readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bird Feeder","review":"Have not received it yet but the description seemed quite good.And the product is designed to fill my needs as there are a lot of squirrels in my yard area.I trust Amazon fully as I have never been disappointed when dealing with Amazon.Patricia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noritake Shenandoah china","review":"This 6 piece set of china arrived on time and in perfect shape.

I really like the BCT15 but it is somewhat complicated. So of course I needed to buy the director software that makes programming easier thru your computer. The uniden web site I felt was misleading because what I ended up buying was a registration key... not software for $29 dollars. You have to download the software then use the key. Well to this day I have not been able to download it. (Vista) I emailed uniden customer support (which takes them 3 days to respond) so that game went on for awhile. I then was on the phone for over a hour trying for a refund! Which they will not do because they are not sure whether you did download or not! When customer service finally put a guy named Josh on the phone and he told me he would burn me a disk and send it out right away I was happy. The disk never came and they claim they know no Josh. Nightmare.... say the least!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Warranty Service","review":"I bought the BCT 15 and after about 4 months intermittent use the backlight display would not turn on. I returned the unit for repair twice and it was returned with the same problem. I tried calling their repair line and waited at least 45 minutes on hold and when I finally reached someone he told me someone would call me back, which never happened.I am left with a defective unit, under warranty and no access to service. This is the poorest example of customer service I have ever experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the Kindle edition","review":"The book is really great, but in the Kindle edition I downloaded the photos are almost all so dark you can't see the image.

I was not as impressed as they were. Denise and the two backup workout people often become out of sync during the video - so you really need to pick one person and stick with them rather than watching anyone else or it throws you off. The cues are not timed very well so I had to watch the video more than once in order to keep up. The music did nothing for me. I agree that I ended up with a good workout. I was sweating at the end and I am sure I burned calories - but it is not going to be my favorite workout. I prefer the circuit workout Cathy Smith has out - much better coordinated and you get the same workout (in a little less time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I own several Denise Austin tapes but this one is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I never liked interval training workouts before but I forced myself to do them and boy do I feel and see results! The steps in this video are not hard and she works up different levels of intensity so that your heart rate definitely goes up, then breaks in with the weights. Then there's a thigh toner and the ab workout, which is painful but boy does it work! I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"total body workout","review":"If you really want to work your whole body, you need to get this tape. You'll burn calories and tone your body with this interval training workout. She combines aerobic exercise with weight training. At the end she has this really, really great workout for the abs, prepare to be soar the following day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tape for beginners","review":"I bought this tape in 1998 to get myself to exercise. I was a bit turned off after previewing it because of the mistakes they made. I tried to ignore the imperfections and figured out what needed to get done. 8 weeks later, tada: nice sculpted arms. It works! I'm now an advanced exerciser and still do this tape when I'm feeling lazy. I just increase the weights to keep it a bit challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I'm new to home workout videos and bought this as a 3-tape set at Target on a lark. I really like the whole set! Although some folks may find the constant encouragement by Denise bothersome, it is helpful to me to remind me of why I'm doing this. I alternate this with a Kathy Smith video and a Donna Richardson DVD and find that it gives me plenty of variety and I feel great after each workout session. This tape is not so easy that I'll grow out of it quickly, either, but easy enough that I, with 2 left feet, can get a real benefit from it right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought a different tape","review":"I bought this tape yesterday and I feel like I just wasted my money. Aside from the fact that Denise is more annoying than usual, I found this tape fast paced and hard to follow. I have exercised for a while now, and even then I found it complicated. I like the idea of cardio and weight training combined, but I didn't think this tape was challenging enough as far as the toning goes. You do use your legs a lot, but it does not do much for your upper body. The abs section at the end was ok, but as soon as you felt your abs 'burning' she would stop. If you really want to buy this tape look for it at the Salvation Army store where I'll be donating it tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"works for me","review":"I'm middle aged, overweight, asthmatic, etc., and I can do this video.

This video is so much fun and such a challange!! The interval training is great fun and the ab segment at the end is wonderful but tuff.

A definate thumbs up for Sizzler!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout","review":"Denise is VERY inspirational and easy to follow. 3 min of low-impact aerobics and 1.5 min of toning.

If you enjoyed this as a child, you really should get it and share it with your own children or dare I say grandchildren. Saturday mornings use to be so special. Now with cable and 24 hour cartoon channels, video games and such, it is nice to have something to remember our childhoods by. Those of us raised in the 70's were given a much more innocent view of the world, one that our young minds could grasp.

Being a non-Hindi speaker, I realized from my husband(Hindi speaker), that I was saying some of the words wrong. It is hard at times to make out what is being said.On the other side, I think it is a perfect dvd for children under 3. It is modeled after the \\"Baby Einstein\\" dvds. My baby is 11 months old and loves watching other children and babies. So, it is a perfect way to hold her attention as she listens to Hindi. She is starting to use some of the words and sounds. So, in that way, I think this DVD is very educational and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids, who are 7 and 4, love it","review":"My kids had been resisting learning their mother tounge from theirmother, so I got this DVD.

This video is not creative and has poor presentation. Badly done. Kids dont need that. I recommend some Barney or Elmo movie than this.

I do not like that the bread doesn't stick to the pickles or tomatoes very well. I guess because of the shape. They do really look real.The top of the tuna looks cute but it also looks dangerous. It looks like it will break off with a few pulls. Cute idea but this is why they say for three year olds.

Much better quality than I was expecting! I had expected the regular flimsy plastic food pieces, and was very surprised. The pieces are all hard plastic. You can't push them in, so they're not going to end up with chew marks in them right away if you have smaller kids around. The pop top to the tuna can is a bit flimsy, and the margerine tub are more flimsy, but it's not a big deal. The quality of the rest of the set makes up for it! It's the sandwich pieces that are the major toys, anyway. I recommend the play food sets by this company!

I thought that since it came from the History Channel that it might perhaps go through the various viewpoints that have developed for interpretation of Revelation in the Bible. Unfortunately, most of the film was spent on really strange scary interpretations that miss the message of the Book. Additionally it seemed very jumbled in its presentation of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Perspective","review":"I did not find this film helpful.

Because it's a relatively short program (50 minutes), this results in its being lean on content.On the positive side, I found the discussions with the various academic experts to be worthwhile, although they seemed to be uncomfortable in such an overly dramatic program.Several years ago, I read that the Island of Patmos, where John is supposed to have written this Book of the Bible, is home to a special hallucinogenic mushroom, to which some people attribute his spectacular visions. Unfortunately, the program makes no mention of this theory.UPDATE (03/28/12); The eminent religious historian, Elaine Pagels, has just written an excellent book on RevelationsRevelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation. Better to spend your money on it than this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading!","review":"I bought this thinking it would be a deep exploration of Revolations and its contents, it is moreless a brief overview of the concept and gives little else.

Reading this book made me sort of sit back, relax and appreciate some of the things that had been stressing me about me two year old.

There were so many varied games in this book that both groups had a great time. Instructions are easy to follow and the games are all instantly addictive. If you're looking for something beyond the typical board games you'll find at most parties, this is perfect for you. Most games require only players and their brains, a few others require pen and pencil. No matter what, everything we played from this book was a lot of fun.

I have one caveat, however. If you intend to hook up this player through an AV receiver, make sure you have an open coaxial digital input, as the player's digital sound output is coaxial, and not optical. My receiver, for example, has three optical inputs and only one coaxial input. I was using my coaxial input for my cable box (which also has no optical output).

If you do not like the field of GE under incomplete markets, fine. But then you would certainly not be in a position to comment on any book in the field, would you? Moreover, comparing apples and bananas has never been the brightest of ideas: this is not finance, this is GE under incomplete markets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Esoteric and Useless","review":"If you want to learn about finance, go read Cochrane's Asset Pricing.

Yield curve, Black and Scholes, Continuous time finance, Futures, Corporate Finance... don't think it's in their book. The authors have a perception of financial economics that is ivory tower like, not applicable, and esoteric. But then again, if you want to be theorist, this might be just the right book for you. If you want to be more than an \\"...\\", really, go read Cochrane, Hull (on contingent claims), and Merton's Continuous Time Finance (now that's a book (bible) worth spending some time on) and many other high quality textbooks.

Also the pretty plastic inserts in the wheels - we had to take them off after several times my son complained that bike is too heavy to pedal. It turned out the inserts were in a way - touched the spin needles and kept the bike from rolling smoothly. I will not buy a bike online again - it is better to test ride one before buying.

I ordered this new DVD player from Amazon and had it in less then a week. From first glance, the unit seemed of very sturdy construction and was surprisingly light for its size and features. Setup was very straight forward and easy to comprehend. Once completely setup, I popped in a DVD and although it took a couple seconds longer then other DVD players, playback was immediate and flawless. The unit can also be controlled by my SONY STR-DE598 remote with NO programming right out of the box!! So now I can control both with one remote, much to my wife's delight. All in all, this is an excellent unit for its price, especially being able to utilize 5 discs in the carousel and MP3 playback. I have not found one movie that has been backed up that will not play.

Until about 2/3 of the way through, Ellis did an excellent job of keeping his personal politics out of the mix and just telling the events in a compelling and interesting manner. One most gets an inkling of his inner leanings when it comes to the \\"battle\\" between the proletariat and the bourgeosie. It's easy enough to find accounts of what went on on the battlefields of the War, but I was thrilled when I finally found one that described what life was like at home!

God's Love Bank shows you have to be your best self, the self God created you to be, your New Self in tune with the Holy Spirit. You achieve this by studying the 15 core values of Jesus, (one per month plus 3 extra). By the end of the year I had made significant breakthroughs that were evident to everyone around me.

It's been out for a week, I can't figure out what the hold up was but I am so happy with it. It is noticably not as catchy as The Power Out, which, probably I will be the only person that misses that. I like catchy. Especially the way that one was catchy. With hooks so smart, if I were a fish I wouldn't mind losing my life to hooks like that. I would snap on. I would take the bait. They could reel me in.Axes is starker, and more Stockhausen, which is always popular with modern minds, not always mine. It's what John Cale's Paris 1919 should have sounded like, and was so disapointing and boring because it didn't. And it's a lot like that final, two-album leap that Talk Talk made when they transcended everything, when they abandoned pop for good and went free.

The results are an unqualified success. Recorded here are all of Schumann's works for orchestra, including the little heard first version of the 4th symphony and his earliest symphonic work the so-called \\"Zwickau\\" symphony.John Elliot Gardiner and his Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique play these works with passion and conviction. The playing is fabulous and the recording quality is superb. It was a great discovery for me to listen to these discs and fully appreciate Schumann's place in musical history. Prior to this, my interest in this composer was slight, so this set filled a gap. I can attest that the Rhenish symphony and the revised 4th, the most popular of Schumann's symphonies, sparkle under Gardiner's direction. My older recording of these works are rarely played now.

When my daughter was five months old the second pump went out. The lady on the phone was friendly and told me this pump was made to withstand more use than I was giving it. Once again they sent me a new motor. I asked about the previous reimbursement and was told she would look into it and get back with me. It has been over a month and I still haven't heard anything.

I have used the car charger on vacation, I take it to work and pump on my lunch (it comes with an ice pack and bottles) and have reccommeded this to all 5 of my techs that are expecting soon.

When my motor started making an unusual sound,I called customer service and they FedExed me a new motor in less than 24 hours!!The cups are extremely comfortable and the whole drop-in bottle system is a breeze. The pump is quiter than my PIS, which helps me relax when I am at work. The noise of the PIS had me concerned that I could be heard outside the room by co-workers and students(I am a teacher).I highly recommend this pump.

Plus, I absolutely love the Playtex Nurser bottles. They make storing and freezing so convenient. (I still can't figure out what the bottles that come with the pump ((that have the small tops)) are for) I definitely recommend this pump.

I was having to pump every two hours and my manual pump wasn't cutting it. The Embrace didn't cut it either. After 5 attempts to use this device, I noticed the raised silicon piping on the cup was causing my skin to blister and tear from the constant \\"massaging\\". I tried rotating the cup so the star shape wouldn't be in the same place every time, but it continued to cause blistering and brusing.Fortunately, I had purchased the buyer protection plan at BRU and was able to exchange it for the Medela Pump In Style. The hard plastic cups on the Medela may look less comfortable, but there is nothing added to cause irritation. I highly recommend the Medela over the Embrace, especially if you have irritated or sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable, efficient, good buy","review":"I ordered this pump so I could store milk and pump when I go back to work. The bag that it comes in is nice, and all of the parts and accessories come in separate bags which makes it very easy to stay organized. The pump has a lot of options for settings but I never use stronger or faster settings than 3/5 and it only takes me about 15 minutes to pump. The cups are soft and minimizes the discomfort of pumping. It does come with a cigarette lighter adapter so you can use while traveling as well.The downsides are that the pump is a little noisy, especially the higher the suction setting. Also it is not very convenient to disassemble and wash after each use, but I think this is similar with every pump. I am a little concerned about the durability of the parts, but I've been using it at least once a day for nearly a month and so far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PUMP!","review":"Do not buy this pump!

As well, we could get it to work for the longest time, there are way to many connectors/connections that can easly make your time very frusterating if your not pumping but trying to figure out where you went wrong in connecting something, and the manual is almost too simple that is does not help you much when you are troublshooting.

That's three pumps in a little less than six weeks, and I need one because I work full time. However, when I called playtex to get my money back, which I still haven't received they told me I would need a copy of the original receipt, which I no longer had, and that I would need to mail the pump back to them at my expense. I asked to speak to a suprvisor and left a contact phone number. I've yet to actually talk to a supervisor, and I've called several times.

I ended up having so much milk left in my breasts they got painfuly engorged & then resulted in getting Mastitis. I eventually had to rent a hospital grade breast pump that worked. Don't waste your money on this pump. It looks great but I can't say anything else positive about it. I gave it one star because that is the lowest you can give. I really give it zero stars.

Now I wish I would have listened and purchased the old tried and true.I have only been using it for a few weeks, and the motor is already going out on it. It takes 40 minutes just to express 1oz from both breast. I contacted Playtex and they will not refund my money, but did offer to overnight a new motor.

The quality was so cheap - two of the plastic handles were broken and jammed and the other two looked like they wouldn't last either.

The first DVD (concert) is good, although early in FNM's career and only covers a limited amount of music. The second DVD (video collection) is also a great chronology of the band.

It's a little expensive, but decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but........","review":"This DVD is great, just like everyone said. Great for any fan.

Really. It's unbelievable that McGraw Hill would let something like it out. It's not just the explanatory text, but the sample questions are full of errors, too. You have to pay close attention to what is going on in this book because you can get very confused reading it.Hopefully, the authors go back through it again and reissue it after they've cleaned up the errors.

Being a CLP myself in both SA and AD, and already possessing LotusScript skills, I was hoping the book would provide some insight into the actual test. Instead, it points out areas the test covers. Big deal--again, Lotus already provides that on their website. This book should have provided me with some greater depth on those subject areas, not just regurgitate the rules & regs.

Not only that, but it was positive and \\"highly recommended the workout DVD\\" without any cons. Also, look on this page. Look how similar the reviews about this DVD are, and note that the accounts only did one review and they are all from Los Angeles. Noticing all of this, was skeptical. Still, I ordered it.The DVD wasn't what I expected. The warmup was good and the exercises weren't difficult but efficient, although I have not seen noticeable results yet.

When I purchased these DVDs I felt stuck in a rut with my workout routine. I was bored and slacking off and noticing the effects on my body. These DVDs did add new workout moves to my routine. I have stopped using the DVDs but have continued to include aspects of the moves included on the DVD in my workout. The main reason I am rating this 4 stars is due to the fact that this is a set of 4 DVDs instead of just 1 or 2. Part of the reason I stopped using them is because it becomes quite a hassle to change the DVDs when wanting to work out a different body part, Specially when only having a enough time to complete a few of the 10 minute workouts on the DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Feeling great! Fast results!","review":"This is a fun and challenging workout. My girlfriends and I love it, and especially love doing it in a group. You work out every part of the body during all of the exercises. Arms, shoulders, and back are worked during abs, legs, and buns, because almost all the exercises are done holding a 5 lb weight. I have dropped 10 pounds in a month doing this, the Women's Health Wedding Workout, Crunch Boot Camp, and the New York City Ballet Workout (great for lengthening and strengthening my new sylvette).I am really feeling like an envy girl, and getting envious looks from other less motivated ladies. These workouts are pretty hard core, but fun, and though the girls in them are a little gaudy, their bods are not.Have fun! And good luck!

It was fun and challenging. Each DVD comes with the option for a quick five minute workout which is good if you don't have a lot of time. Some of the girls are working out in their bathing suites which was a little tacky, but they are in shape becuase its not an easy workout. The reason it lost a star is becuase each body part has a different dvd, which is not very convient!It is worth the money though."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"The only thing this dvd did for me was make me feel like crap about myself.

Bologna--they were trying to survive.Read the reports of General Sheridan and US Grant about Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn for the real story--Custer was impatient and looking for glory. He divided his already small force and the Indians defeated him because he was severely outnumbered. Blame Custer, not Reno, who just managed to survive, barely. Custer was warned by his scouts that he and his men would die if he attached the Sioux and they were right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical American Experience historical narrative.","review":"Some people watch American Experience for well written historical narratives.

Kubelik gives a joyful reading of Hindemith's Metamorphoses and an inspired interpretation of Schönberg's Five Pieces, op. 16, that really convinced me that dodecaphonic music could also be enjoyable.Antal Dorati's readings of Kodaly's Peacock Variations and Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin Suite are just marvelous, even if, in the Peacock Variations, a faint microphone buzz can be heard (nothing disturbing though).The mono sound of the 1950s is astonishing, no less, and the booklet is really fascinating.

Her struggle to survive and wrenching decision to keep the unborn child that resulted from that rape is a real page turner. The book made me realize how difficult it must have been for a single southern woman to live through the aftermath of the Civil War. It also contains many touching and funny moments which make this book a joy to read. It is well researched and brings avision of the reality that was of that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but...","review":"Are you sure, that he is a popular criminal in Hungary? As I live here, I just can't find any sings of him being beloved. As he is a bank robber. He was a great sportsman - before. But that doesn't mean much if it's about crime. Sorry, if this may sound a bit harsh, but really, he is no hero at all. At least not in our community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible To Put Down","review":"Grab a copy of The Ballad of the Whiskey Robber for your next flight and you won't even mind sitting in the middle seat in coach.If you relish a true story woven with elements of suspense, humor and romance, Mr. Rubinstein delivers these and more.Hard drinking Attila Ambrus just wants to BE somebody contrary to his father's prediction. Attila amazes the reader with the lengths he goes first to survive and ultimately to get the attention he so desperately craves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballad of the Whiskey Robber: A Must Read","review":"Follow Attila on a journey so outlandish, it couldn't be made up. From escaping Romania and ethnic prejudice by stowing away underneath a train to becoming one of the most hapless (but hardest working) goalies in a \\"professional\\" hockey league, Atilla Ambrus shows he has the determination to better himself. In Hungary in the early 90s that was through one way, and that way was money. His will for the finer things in life drags him through pelt smuggling and eventually to becoming a modern day Robin Hood. Chased by Keystone cops and dreams of grandeur, Attila is a sympathetic character haunted by a dark past, strong drink, and fast women. You'll find yourself rooting for him to survive his surroundings, and himself. This book is a phenomenal read, exciting from beginning to end. Julian Rubinstein's outstanding first book will put a smile on your face whenever recounting a truly amazing adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre writing","review":"Interesting story, but the writing is distractingly bad. Instead of being a gripping tale of comedy and chaos, this book reads like wannabe Hungarian noir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ballad of the Whiskey Robber","review":"I'm afraid I didn't get to the end of this tedious tale. It was so badly written that I lost interest very quickly. Repetitious, lacking credibility and sloppily structured, it also lacked credibility.It has got rave reviews and sounded promising. But having lived in post-communist Hungary, there is nothing romantic about bank robbers or any criminals.I was living half-way up a mountainside in rural Spain but even that didn't spur me on to finish.Good robbers don't necessarily make good writers and with his ill-gotten gains he would have been better to invest in a ghost writer.Sorry, it gets a thumbs down from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Excellent book! Great true crime story that is action packed, and very funny...plus a little bit of history!Highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boisterous Tale of a Budapest Bank Bandit","review":"Ballad of the Whiskey Robber is a madcap, belly-shaking tale of post-Communist Budapest's first and most famous hapless bank robber, Attila Ambrus and the equally incompetent efforts of the police to catch him.Cross a \\"wild and crazy guy\\" Festrunk Brother with \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" Frank Abagnale, Jr. and add a dash of Paul Neuman's movie Slap Shot and you'll only begin to get a sense of this zany but true tale of a lovable tough Hungarian hockey goalie with an indomitable spirit who, when the drab, corrupt, uncaring world was falling apart all around him, impetuously embarked on a new profession.Rubenstein's tale is well-researched and fully of witty turns of phrase such as \\"the sweet smell of a triple-cream torta hung in the air like a good idea.\\" Ballad of the Whiskey Robber is a true crime caper that's comical, poignant and great fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even with my anticipation it did not disappoint!","review":"I had been waiting to hear the full story surrounding the Whisky Robber since I heard a bit about him in the summer of 1997 while I was living in Hungary. I followed his crime spree, arrest, escape, and recapture even after returning home, since I found something compelling in this brazen thief. When I heard about this book, I had to have it. It definitely did not disappoint.Not only does Rubinstein write a compelling story in its \\"True Crime\\" aspects, he also paints an accurate picture of Hungary during the time of the crime spree. His book helped take me back to my time in Hungary from 1995-1997 and some of the absurdities that existed during that time and afterward.However, the story of Atilla Ambrus was even more compelling. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. Now that I have read it, I can't stop telling everybody around me about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instructions","review":"My so called kit came without bolts or instructions.

The Yakima fairing is a great addition to my rack and eliminated the noises associated with the wind going through the bars, bike, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with some sunroofs","review":"This product is well-made and easy to install. However, because of the way it juts forward from the Yakima rack, its feet set right on the sunroof of our '06 CRV. There is no way to adjust for this overlap. Once installed, the fairing obstructs some of the view through the sunroof, but more importantly we can no longer tip the sunroof up to let air in. This has made the fairing unusable for us, so we are returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy installation","review":"easy on, has worked very well, didn't run without it so I don't know if it reduces wind noise but it certainly doesn't add any.

It fits perfectly on my 2006 Hyundai Elantra GT using Yakima Q towers and crossbars. Installation couldn't have been simpler. Only complaint might be the price, but hey what's the alternative? One tip: if you don't want YAKIMA in huge letters to show, just flip the fairing around and install frontside-back. Decide this before installation, though, because it's tough to get the plastic push-through fasteners back out once they're in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with Yakima Roof Rack Fairing performance","review":"I'm very happy with the 38\\" fairing that I installed on the Yakima system that sits on top of my 2011 Ford Fusion. It definitely reduces the wind noise when driving at highway speeds. I was concerned that it might interfere with the moon roof but that turned out to not be a problem. Installation was easy, but be careful to follow the directions and look at the pictures carefully. I didn't have the end-pieces properly in place before pushing the locking plugs in. I had to cut them off. No harm to the fairing or bracket, but I needed replacement plugs. Yakima sent replacements after I explained the situation to them by phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and easy to install","review":"I purchased this fairing along with a complete set of Yakima landing pads, towers and bars for my 2009 Honda Element EX. The installation was easy and straightforward, with materials well selected - i.e. they are plastic, but of a grade that is rigid enough to fulfill their function, yet malleable enough to survive the swings in temperature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it should","review":"I have a 2010 Hyundai Elantra Touring (wagon) and recently put Yakima crossbars on it. The noise going down the interstate was deafening. The howling started at 45mph and just went up from there. Being that I do a lot of interstate driving, I had to fix this.The fairing works perfectly. Even tearing it up at 85mph, there is no appreciable noise.My only complaint is the price. The product is a piece of plastic, with 3 plastic clips holding it. Honestly, how much does production of that cost? Guess they've got the market in a choke-hold... Also the big \\"Yakima\\" written across the front could be a little less... big. Fortunately some stickers have taken care of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced, but works fairly well.","review":"Like other reviewers have said, this is an overpriced piece of plastic but I am not sure what other options you have. I tried to the smaller fairing from Yakima and that didn't really work. This cut down the noise considerably when our roof box is mounted - we had an annoying whistling sound before. It does not eliminate all noise, but makes a considerable difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mild and sweet","review":"This product is labeled at \\"medium\\" spice, though I would call it extra extra mild and sweet.

The case is made of good quality leather and fits the camera perfectly. It protects the camera and fits nicely in a pocket or purse. We ride a motorcycle so I LOVE the neck strap.

The metal neck strap will eventually scratch the camera if I use it since it is METAL! Plus I've never seen anyone hanging their camera in this size on their neck and have it bouncing on your chest when you walk.With the case, it doesn't fit my Canon SD870 in their. It is just way too tight. When I pull out the camera, either I have to pull the attached strap so hard that I'm afraid it will break, or if I grab the camera, my thumb will pull and break the battery compartment door.I would recommend either PSC-50 or PSC-90.

For just a few bucks more, I get a case and metal neck strap. The case was nice and comfortable on my belt and worked well for walking around town to snap some pics on vacation. I had no need for the neck strap. Its quite long and not too comfortable in the heat, so I left it at home.

The case not only \\"hugs\\" your camera enough to hold it by itself, there is a secure magnetic closure (I was sceptical about this but it doesnt affect your camera, and holds better than a snap and almost as well as velcro, but dont wear out like velcro) Reinforced Leather is stiff and sharp looking, and padded inside, protecting your camera, while still looking stylish.The battery is wise to purchase as well. Even though my Canon seems to last a while on one battery, it helps to have that extra for trips, or to use while the other is charging (which only takes a couple hours)Great addition to your compact Canon if you want to keep it protected and always have battery power!

This is truly a non-issue.Battery--I'm glad to have a spare battery, but to be honest, no matter how much I use my SD800, I've never run out of battery power, so I'm not sure a second battery is a must, the way it is with some other cameras.Given this, you might want to buy just the case instead of this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average","review":"Case: made in China case has stiff leather and mine had a strong chemical smell (aniline or a phenol derivative, neither are \\"nice chemicals\\").Neck Strap: downright silly, unless you are into wearing flashy metal chains.

There are lots of after market choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Camera Accessory Package vs Target","review":"I found the perfect camera case for my new 800IS at Target. The cost was $3.99 and it holds an extra card as well as an extra battery. I bought the extra battery online for $13.50. While I bought the camera itself from Amazon at what I considered a great price, the accessory package is just too overpriced.Eileen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy for SD950 IS","review":"After reading about this incompatibility, I went to BB with my 950IS and sure enough the camera has to be pushed with enough force you think it might scratch the camera. Very uncomfortable for a high priced (but worth it) camera. And then use extra force just to pull the flap down and engage the snap. The fit is so tight that the LCD screen protector I put on it started to peel off just because a tiny bit of it was on the edge of the screen.Probably great for the smaller SDs, just not recommended for the 950IS. We went with a LowePro at BB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pam's Canon Review","review":"This was a great purchase. Purchasing this kit saved me money versus having to purchase each item individually.

The necklace is made of cheap metal and if you have long hair it snags you from time to time. The case is made of faux leather and you cannot insert the extra battery. Its too bulky and you cannot put an extra sd card or battery. There's a lot of better products out there.

When my S400 died (which I was not happy about) I bought a Powershot SD 790 and the canon case that went along with it. Despite the fact that the SD 790 is smaller than the S400, this new case is actually a little larger than the old case. It is stiffer and appears to have more padding. It's kind of weird because my SD 790 fits a little loose in the old case but is snug in the new larger one. I prefer the look, feel, and smaller size of the old case.The neck strap I don't care about and probably won't use.

It also is a great looking case that is well built. The coordinated black leather strap that attaches to the camera is a nice touch.

I find the critical reviews that go in depth about the quality of the fake leather and the EXACT fit of the camera in the case humorous...it's just a simple case and battery accessory bundle at a great price (way below the big box stores).

It also added considerably to the bulk so that the ease of carrying around this elegant camera was cancelled out. I'm not a camera beltwearer, so that feature means nothing to me. I will explore the Target option suggested by another reviewer. If nothing else is available, I'll look for some kind of pouch. The main thing, as I see it, is protecting the screen, and a pouch might do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as expected","review":"I'm very happy with the accessory kit. The case is a nice leather and there is actually enough room to tuck a spare memory card in it. I now have more straps than I know what to do with.

And shame on Amazon and Canon for advertising that the two items work together.As for the long metal-with-plastic neckstrap - it looks like something out of vending machine at a bowling alley - you know, the ones with the mechanical arm that searches thru the junk pile to pick out your your 50 cent \\"prize\\" and dump it down the chute.At least the battery was the real deal and works fine. That's the only reason I'm not returning this kit; not worth the hassle since the battery goes for $41 and this 3-piece Combo Delight was $49.As for the case and the neckstrap...where did I put that can of lighter fluid?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap leather","review":"The leather material feels cheap and stiff. It makes the case bigger, which defeats the purpose of having a compact camera and case where you can carry in your pant's pocket. Guest this is ok for the ladies if they put it in their purse. The silver neck strap is too thin. It will probably hurt your neck if you wear for long period of time.I would have returned this product to Adorama Camera, if it wasn't for the trouble of having to pay shipping back.Basically, I did not use the casing and the strap at all.

The battery is a needed backup for me in case I need it when I am away from home.Overall, I'd say buying these products as a kit did save me a little money vs. the alternative of buying the three products separately, but the neckstrap somewhat diminishes the bargain I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannon accessory kit","review":"I was not disappointed with this accessory kit. The case is very snug fitting and protects the camera without taking up much additional space. Still fits into a purse or pocket even with the case. If you want to be able to carry the additional battery (which is a good idea for extended outings)there is no room in the case for that and you might want to consider a slightly larger one.

It's very much a utilitarian table though... not in the least bit stylish. It suits my purposes perfectly though. I use it one day a week as a computer desk when my husband works from home and needs the study to himself.

This meets all those needs quite well. The legs are designed so that you can sit at one side with your knees underneath as at a desk. The glitch is that when folding or unfolding the table legs, they tend to pop out of the table top. They normally snap into place but the fit is not tight enough. This does not seem to be a problem at all when the table is in use, only when collapsing or raising it. One other thing, there are only two settings for table height, so if you need something with more variability in height, this won't work.

Then, I did a search for arthritic insoles. These came up #1 in that search too. I couldn't believe the reasonable price! So, I ordered them.

I used it for all the classes I taught 3 times a year since I teach 3 different classes each weekend. This year, when October came around, I couldn't find it, so I purchased another one. I love it THAT much! This video is a great way to teach students about Mary's appearance at Lourdes as well as about the little saint, Bernadette! Of course, right after the product shipped, I found my old one. Well, I love it so much, I don't mind having two copies of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, can't read discs playable in a $50 cheap unit","review":"I bought this unit to replace one of Sony's first DVD players, old enough to have a DIVX phone jack. I wanted to consolidate the VCR space and get something that would load discs faster; one out of two ain't bad. This thing loads discs slower than a 5-6-year-old Sony DVD player, slower than a 'cheaper' brand competitor, and can't play many discs that other units & computers can. I still love my Bravia LCD, but the next media player that gets plugged into it sure isn't gonna be a Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"I recently removed the cable from the back of my Sony SLVD360P DVD/VCR Combo. Instead of the cable coming off, THE STUB CAME OUT. Sony reduced their manufacturing cost by $.01 and didn't secure the stub with a nut on the inner side of the unit. They depended upon the thin wire to provide enough resistance to enable the user to unscrew the cable. Mind you all such cables have a nut fitting to use a wrench to secure and remove said cable. I should have read the reviews before I purchased the unit but instead went on their reputation. Too bad, Sony used to make some good products. Save you money and reduce your time and aggravation, buy a product made by someone reliable like Panasonic or Samsung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD/VCR combo","review":"This is a great unit.

It's ok, but the VCR is pretty sad: it has a hard time with some older tapes that play just fine in a $40 no-name VCR. The DVD player does a decent enough job, but it's nothing special.One really stupid thing, mentioned in another review, is that the VCR and DVD sections don't share the S-Video output, so I have to run two separate connections to the TV. Dumb. Isn't that why you buy a combo deck in the first place? To eliminate extra wires?Given the chance to do it over, I would buy separate components."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Player","review":"We just purchased a new sony DVD/VCR Combo to replace our old Sonic Blue model which sereved us pretty well for for about five years. There was nothing wrong with it, but it lacked some of the more modern features sutch as starting from the same place when you stop. I was impressed by the size, it fit our small cabinet nicely. The remote works for our Sony TV too which was cool so we don't have to juggle remotes. as far as the VCR is concerned the play quality is very good, but when fast forwarding or rewinding the response time is very slow and I often go past whatever it is I'm aiming for. The DVD player is the sameway, excellent play quality but using the remote takes way too long. Also the door on the DVD player takes forever to open. I have NEVER noticed ANY damage of any kind to any of my tapes or DVDs so just for that factor I would probably get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money....","review":"Like others here I fell for the Sony name brand.

IMHO, this is the best book of the series...I can think of at least 3 ways this book has changed my work habits. It is clear, logical and well laid out. The only way I wouldn't recommend it is to try to use it with older versions of AE...there really isn't much backward compatibility here.

I bought this because it was in the gluten free section (as a glitch I suppose since the noodles are made from wheat) and made one packet. I thankfully read the ingredient list before I tried it but everyone else dumped it down the sink after one bite. Even the dogs wouldn't eat the broth.

Even when you add all that water to the mix, I hope you're on a starvation diet, because the serving size on the box is 2 tablespoons!!!! TWO TABLESPOONS! What are you supposed to do with 4 cups of chicken soup (with a stray micro-noodle floating by now and then) when your alloted portion is two tablespoons?

There seems to be no clear direction or emphasis. The video shows a bunch of seemingly random scenes and words. The video could almost be mistaken as a PR stunt for the kids in the video.There is no stepping stone approach, as is expected from an effective learning tool. For example, one of the words taught in the first 5 minutes of the video is the telugu word for Butterfly.

Maybe this book can be considered practice for the latter, because it simply didn't work here. I welcome experimental writing, but in this case the wash of minute detail combined with nonlinearity produced confusion rather than clarity. I'm afraid for me the insights are Greil's alone rather than universal.

True there are a lot of interesting musical relationships brought out in the author's discussion, but the details of the Basement Tapes are just not there. Marcus' approach is that of an ethno-musicologist, and one who is too close to his subject. Personally, the bias from the start of the book and the torturous prose were very hard to stomach.

Marcus even admits that he had written the liner notes to several dylan albums, proving that this book is simply a poorly executed attempt at academic marketing. This book is a waste of paper and it saddens me that so many people have been drawn in by its asinine conclusions and statements. It appears, from this book, that had Marcus been the main character in Equus, we might have had actors on stage with Dylan masks rather than Horse heads.

However, the story was not in line with what I feel Kenshin to be all about. The movie is ridiculously sad and lacks the charm, wit, and humour of the series and the characters are so far-removed from their original selves, I found it hard to believe that these events could really happen, that Kaoru and Kenshin would really react that way. Their decisions negate the realizations they made in the original story. I realize the OVA represents one view of what could happen, but honestly, I cannot even accept it as a possible choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was OK at best.","review":"I've seen the import version of this and after i saw it I wondered why i watched it in the first place. This ova made it a point to change things that happned in the series and make it seem that Kenshin didn't undergo the character changes in the Kyoto arc. Plus the first DVD is a recap of the series and they changed many of the scenes to make Kenshin seem more sad. Also unlike the manga this is mos certainly NOT a happy ending. I loved kenshin and liked how it was light hearted and this is not a suitable ending, why change the ending from what it was in the manga when the series pretty much follows it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relfection- Resolution","review":"(ps, i'm not really under 13, i just didn't want to have my email up, because i don't want any people to bother me with emails in the line of work) Truthfully, this is a great movie. Why? Well, I must say I do enjoy watching Trust/Betrayal much more, and it is also more interesting. In this movie, there is not a lot of action. Yet, there are quite a few flahsbacks which are artfully put into the movie. Yet, the reason why this movie was so great was becasue it resolved everyone's conflict. Yahiko gets stronger (\\"i just want to be stronger!!!\\"), Kaoru gets Kenshin, Kenshin finally repents (also some great symbolism in this), Sano isn't thought of as \\"second\\" and more importantly can finally lend help to Kenshin. But, in the end all character conflict is resolved. Plus, for those who say was weak becasue of death, i completely disagree. Not only was it romantic becasue of death, but it also was the perfect resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesnt add up...","review":"Okay, now, any Rurouni Kenshin fan should have a very hard time accepting this ending. I have a lot of reasons and here are a few:1)Nobuhiro Watsuki, the creator of Rurouni kenshin, didnt write or appear to have any say in this, it seems as though Sony decided to inflict cruel fates on his characters.2)Anyone who is a fan of either the tv series or the manga knows how Kenshin evolved as character throughout the series, facing his inner demons and repeatedly emphasizing the will to live, in \\"Reflection\\", Kenshin is presented as though he never lived through any of the experiences in the series, just so they can make him wander again in angst and have a tragic end.3)Everyone in Reflections was out of character by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Boring...","review":"I'm a huge Kenshin fan, but this movie was boring and sad. I felt depressed after watching it. It shows Kenshin as a sick elderly man. The only parts I enjoyed were the brief flashbacks to when he was young. Also, as a warning, the artwork is very different from Samuri X and the television series, not bad, but just a different style. I think die-hard fans will enjoy the movie so I won't discourage anyone from watching it, but just know what to expect before hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rurouni Kenshin; A truly paramount series","review":"I must say, this movie made me cry to a point that I started to weep for Kenshin as if he were an actual person i had lost. Terribly sad and joyous simultaneously, this movie is a must see for anyone who wants to know what real anime is. The characters are so well developed, that you feel you are connected to them and their adventures throughout the rurouni kenshin series. The music will take your breath away. The musical score is unlike anything I've heard before. This series is truly paramount, a must see for anyone. The beautiful swordfights throughout this series are the best fights ever to grace a TV screen. There are no words to describe how beautiful and life-like everything seems in this series, it's as if Nobuhiro Watsuki had transported us back to the blood-soaked times of the Bakumatsu Revolution. This series throws all other anime to the curb. There is not one word to sum up this entire series, you just have to see it to believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did it have to end?","review":"This, the animated ending of Rurouni Kenshin, affected me for days. It is beautiful and extremely tragic. The animation is done not in the style of the series, but of the first OAVs, which seemed fitting to me because of the serious tone of the storyline. I could really feel all of Kenshin and Kaoru's emotions in this DVD, not to mention Kenji's anger. It does a nice job of summarizing the Jinchuu Arc, which was *VERY UNFORTUNATELY* never animated outside of the manga. That is my only complaint. It would have been so wonderful to have that story animated fully instead of being squeezed into this DVD. It is too short. Overall, however, if you love Rurouni Kenshin it is only fitting to watch it through to the end. If you love a tear-jerker, I strongly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing but wonderful","review":"The artwork was very different, but that doesn't take away from the story at all. In Reflection you get more of a flesh & blood sense of the characters, and Kaoru's point of veiw as far as her loyalty to Kenshin and the others. My only complaint was that the flash-backs were a bit different from how the manga and anime went. Hardly something to complain about. I'd suggest watching Trust & Betrayal first, due to the flash-back of the fight againt Enishi.(which seemed to be one of the main events stressed) As a loyal Kenshin fan it was painful to watch the real ending, him dying sick and tired and still guilty. This is one of the rare anime's that doesn't have a completely happy ending. One the other hand, we get to see Kenji for the first time, and Yahiko and Tsubame as adults. One thing to look forward to. All and all this was an enjoyable but very depressing OVA of RK, it's worth watching and I highly reccomend for the RK and period movie fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and VERY VERY SAD","review":"I hadn't seen any of the TV animes, so a lot of the flashback sequences were a big question mark for me, but I was with someone who had seen a lot of those episodes and they were able to fill me in. I had seen and loved the first 2 OVAs so this was perfectly familiar and fitting in tone. I am now totally in love with the Kenshin character and will probably watch all the TV anime episodes now because I want to learn more. I'm not a fan of the typical cutesy anime style, but since I love this character so much I want to see everything!A lot of diehard Kenshin fans were disturbed by how this ended, but it didn't bother me as much, maybe because I didn't have a preconceived notion of how it was \\"supposed\\" to end. I thought the whole thing was very beautifully done and now it's made me a Kenshin fan, and I think anyone who sees this who's unfamiliar w/RK will become a fan too.

The motion picture was quite a bit boring, but it's ok. But the stuff after the Kyoto Arc in the series, sheesh!! They're awful!! Things don't connect. It's like a whole new story. A crappy one! I even taped the DVDs of the episodes after the Kyoto Arc to the casing and wrote \\"Do not view.\\" Now this? Kenshin dying of some stupid disease? He deserves more than that. Watsuki should've taken care of that part and left us an open ending. Please think of this Watsuki, are you there?!?!? If at all possible, pull the stuff after the Kyoto Arc and the Reflection movie out of the market and remake them. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"through out this whole movie i thought it was good but when i bought it and came home and watch it, it wasnt that good of all the whole movie was like a sop opera all it talks about is how karou is wait for kenshin to come back but the whole story is from karou past and like what happen and so on i thought that this was goin to be like Samurai X trust and betrayel but its totally differnt"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworthy attempt to emulate the success of the first OVAS","review":"There's too many problems with this OVA, if you are not a Rurouni Kenshin fan I recommend you only rent this. To clearly understand the story you must have seen at least up to the end of the Kyoto Arc in the TV series and also the first OVAS(\\"Trust\\",and also \\"Betrayal\\"). Its is also strongly recommended you read the entire last arc from the manga the Revenge Arc(2000 pages). You'll see many incredible events that were not told in this OVA which foolishly tried to condense the Arc in 15 minutes. As for the new stuff not based on the manga, yahiko's and kenji's relationship seems acceptable but not the fact kenji is training with Hiko. As for ending it is a pathetic attempt to copy the sorrow of the first OVAs, the director took too many liberties with the story. He should have tried to explain the events of the beautiful Revenge Arc instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this trainwreck of an OVA. Everyone is out of character in it. Kenshin, leaving his wife and small child behind to wander and \\"save the world\\"? Kaoru, allowing Kenshin to leave her and Kenji behind, moping around the dojo for seven years and then allowing Kenshin to infect her with a communicable disease? Where are the real Kenshin and Kaoru?! Who are these imposters?As a Kenshin fan who knows the story insideout and backwards and who is now reading the manga's Jinchuu Arc, I can tell you that Reflections is innaccurate. I won't post spoilers for those who haven't read the manga, but I can tell you it does NOT end the way it does in Reflections.Reflections is merely a glorified filler episode, no better than the third season of the Rurouni Kenshin anime series, which many fans despise. All I can say is, as a loyal RuroKen purist, this is one DVD that will not be going in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samurai X Reflection","review":"The DVD was sad and you could fell the love and emotions that Kaoru and Kenshin shared. The fight senes were great. I would recomed this to any Kenshin fan out there. I'v read the manga verson and have some of the cartoon's ones and I have trust and betray on dvd. I cried at the end. The ending semed right. Kenshin died in the arms of the one he loved and he was finaly happy. If you love Kenshin then you must rent of buy this and you will see for yourself how Kenshin and Karou loved each other and how Karou wanted to share his pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A depressing thing...","review":"this movie was pretty sad and pretty cool. I think that most of you real great kenshin fan's should have a tissue box ready in the last half and be ready to cry for a while. After you watch this movie you feel empty and sad but it is amazing to watch it.MAJOR SPOILER: DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN SOMETHING SMALL.Kenshin dies at the end. That's really it. I think it should have ended with the etire kenshin gumi and hiko and everybody waving and a scene with grassy hills and a bright sun, but reflection is just different... If you aren't strict to having kenshin always being da best, then watch it. I just cried for a long time.SPOILER OVERIf this movie didn't have the great fight with Enishi, i'd givie it negative stars for depressing and disturbingly touching. I also think that Kenji is a little too picky and should give his dad some credit. I like Evil Bottosai-mode kenshin better, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Sure What To Think","review":"I enjoyed the Kenshin series, so naturally I picked this one up. Like Trust and Betrayal, the series has a darker mood. I didnt mind the OAV character designs or the music, both were actually nicely done.I do feel this should have been a longer OAV, focusing more on original content and the background of the characters. I don't the flashbacks supply enough about the respevtive character's development. While I felt the ending was well done and liked it, I'm hoping more it figurative then literal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember me, please! - Kaoru","review":"As the title would foreshadow, this is a story about what Kaoru remebers since she first met Kenshin. There are a few future references and a couple of characters which don't look to be in their best shape. Strongheaded Kenji makes and appearence and the dialogue follows more closely to the japanese version (not the censored american version).I would reccomend this mainly to people who have seen the whole series (I hadn't) because it might be a bit confusing if you hadn't. As usual, if you want Battousai check out Trust & Betrayal. Kenshin is just a wanderer now. And up until the day he dies he will never forgive himself, even if everyone else does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe Disappointment","review":"Let me start by saying I love the Rurouni Kenshin series. Without a doubt my favorite anime series. So let me start with the good bits. I liked the bits with Kenshin's son. He seems to refuse to listen to everyone else and, without intervention, seems poised to repeat his father's mistakes. Also, the animation, while much different than anything related to it, is quite good, once you get used to the switch.Now, the bad. The voices for the characters seemed particularly poorly chosen, and the dubbing at times went from bad to awful. Worst of all, though, is that this movie is, by my estimation, 70% flashback and 30% new story. When I rented this movie, it wasn't to watch cherished scenes from my favorite series made into an embarrassing mockery."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's horrible","review":"I am a big fan of the first 3 Samurai X DVD's and was completely disappointed at this one. I don't even want to watch the series anymore because of this. The plot was horrible and boring and the ending is just not satisfying to true fans of Kenshin. He wound up all weak and stupid. Totally disappointing and I do not recommend buying it as it'll ruin the entire series for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible end to the Kenshin OVA","review":"This DVD could have been great if not for the absolutly piontless and stupid ending... Please if you are a die hard fan DO NOT buy this the ending makes absloutly NO sense what so ever it left me feeling empty and angry. The betrayal of Kaoru was pathetic and weak, and Kenshin seemed almost senile, as if his family friends and son we no existant or didn't matter. Megumi, Sanosuke, and Yahiko were the only \\"normal characters\\" meaning only they stuck to their real nature. The best thing this has to offer is all the episodes leading up to the end so if you really must see the movie then please PLEASE skip the ending! All this movie really is is the reflection of what happend to Tomoe, kenshin fighting with her brother, and then the screwed over ending where kenshin and kaoru end up together."},{"rating":"1","title":"The death of my hero (Archangel)","review":"How could they have shown his death so patetic.

They find a huge diamond the size of a mountain on europa!I read the last few pages of this book on a bus and when I was done I just threw the damn book out of the window for the next sucker.

I recommend going back and reading Clarke's earlier work and skipping 2061, and 3001 for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was a good sequi","review":"I was partially disappointed at this book. The first two odysseys where far better than this. The good side of it was you get to meet Dave again or whatever he has become. This is an intriging book. The only thing that disapointed me was the ending, But now with the release of 3001 I think it will be a lot better and it will close the ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"2061 -- not a timeless masterpiece","review":"This third book of the series is fairly bad. The characters were two dimensional--if they got in trouble, I didn't even care whether they would survive. The way Clarke returned some of the characters from 2001/2010 is contrived at best.The biggest disappoint with 2061 is that Clarke chose to project political intrigue going on when he wrote it some 75 years into the future, as had been done on a shorter timeframe with 2010. The trouble is that he chose something that was a transient issue. Having done this, the plot builds (with no excitement) to an absolutely silly and preposterous ending.I suggest skipping it altogether. Just say to yourself, \\"What with one thing and another, the oblisk arranged for some of the old characters to be around for the next book\\" -- and then jump to 3001.

My book had LOTS of typos and grammer problems in it, and absoutely no description of anything important. I didn't learn a single thing about the space baby in this one. I feel like i could have read the last 5 pages of the book and understood the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"I found several problems with this book. First, what was the whole point of the comet sequence in the beginning? It passed itself as information, rather than actually lending itself to the story. Second, nothing really ever happens, they get to the planet's moon and find a new life form, and...that's it! Finally, one of the most important and entertaining characters of the series, HAL, where is he? Oh, he makes a cameo appearance in the last three pages. Now I have heard that 3001 is out. Please Clarke, make it stop"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Climax Wanting","review":"This entire story is a waste of time. Fortunately for a novel it is short, so you don't waste too much time one it. The story has minor (but somewhat predictable) plot twists that culminate in two paths merging. The real downfall for this book, however, is that Clarke sets you up for a climatic rescue attempt that is scarcely mentioned once you get there. Literally, what should have been the climax of the story is dealt with within 3 sentences. Before I knew it, all the characters were safe and on their way home without any disasters/ narrow misses/ or complications that would have made for a REAL story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read, but buy 3001 as well . . .","review":"I bought this book because I was interested in following the saga of David Bowman, Heywood Floys and HAL beyond what was available in the movies.It is 50 years after Jupiter has imploded and people live in a highly technological world where the Chinese space program sets the standard. A mishap in space, followed by starnge events leads us on an unforgettable adventure where we begin to learn what the monolith's peurpose is.The reason I state that you should also buy 3001, is that this book, while important to the story, does not provide the answers to the monolith's mission, but serves as pre-text to the final story where everything is revealed. While I am not an enormous sci-fi fan, I truly enjoyed Clarke's description of the future.If you are looking for closure, read the last two books, it is a wild ride, very informative and in the end everything will beceom a whole lot clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last chapter is all you need to read","review":"The story plods along. There is only a flimsy, artificial suspense throughout the whole book. The characters are wooden and flat. And when you get done with the book, you realize that any talented author would have cut out all the chapters leading up to the last one, condensed them down into one or two intro chapters, then started the story rolling with the events which took place in the last chapter. Boy did this book stink."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definition of Sci-Fi","review":"I read this book without reading the others in the series but didn't have a hard time grasping what was going on. The book doesn't have a definitive ending since it is left open to the next in the series but it was enjoyable. It is complete science fiction in seemingly every way. Space ships, the fact that a person can extend their life by living on a planet other than earth, a computer that has taken on a consciousness, and extraterrestrials, although these creatures aren't ever seen.

I thought this book was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"300-Page Segue","review":"That's about all 2061 is: a nearly 300-page segue into the next book in the series and not enough to make a novel on its own. 2001 is a classic and a pretty good read. 2010 was a very good read--enjoyable, well-paced, engaging with interesting and surprising characters, etc.2061 is a big disappointment. It's almost completely devoid of plot or point, centering on an implausible twist with no bearing on anything else going on in the series--and that one simple twist is all that's here. What there is of suspense and adventure is flimsy and doesn't support a whole novel.This is just scientific (and pseudo-scientific) exposition about Europa, Jupiter (nee Lucifer), Earth and the rest of the Solar System and it's pretty boring exposition at that. Not at all up to its predecessors. Presumably it leads up to something in 3001; this whole novel should have been maybe two chapters at the start of that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! What a lousy book!","review":"This book is pretty bad. Halfway through, all I could think about is hurrying up and getting the torture over with so I could start 3001. In retrospect, this one book isn't even essential to the overall storyline - it's barely related. The book is basically a thought experiment for \\"I wonder how mankind could land on a comet someday? Hmm, I think it would go like this....\\" Clarke has an insufferable tendency to create a conflict in his stories and solve the issue immediately. All the corny dialogue doesn't help either. Honestly, I have read better stereo manuals. I recommend reading 2001 and 2010."},{"rating":"2","title":"2061 is the best of the Space Odyssey series","review":"Fifty-one years after mankinds last encounter with the little known alien civilization with monoliths, space exploration has become a booming industry.

They're mission is cut short when another ship crash lands on forbiden Europa, and the ship Floyd is on is the only one that can save those stranded.

A good book.","review":"Most of the entire book is slow to develope, but on the whole 2061 is a thoughtful, more introspective look at an aged Heywood Floyd and the journey he embarks on to a comet, which quickly turns into a crashlanding in forbidden territory.

Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"compared to his other writing, this is a thin gruel","review":"While I thought that the book version of the 2001 film was ok and 2010 one of Clarke's best novels, I was extremely disappointed by this add-on. Clarke is running out of ideas, yet must have been enticed to write this extension with a good contract. He really has very little to add here, so he recycles the characters of Bowman (transmogrified by his absorption into the obelisk) and Hayword, who was a plot device in 2001. Thus, the drama of what is going on is pretty forgettable, which is exactly what I have done. Clearly, Clarke was losing his unique powers when he wrote this. I just wish he had had the sense to stop, because this is a mere shadow of what he accomplished in better novels.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZ","review":"This book left me thinking I was in a class room.

Further, some relatively common buttons like Page Up and Page Down are absent altogether.It's very pretty, at least when the LCD backlight is off.

This new CD pissed me off because it lacked the integrity of their first brilliant production (Alanis has such the jagged edge). It lacked the re-work and production ear needed to bring a quality focus to the music. Is the band hypnotized by success? Do they believe that we, the buying, admiring public will groove on anything.

I've heard better recordings from an album. Whether this was intentional or not, I don't know. But the radio version has the same clicks, pops, and gaps in the music as my CD, so I have to assume. I don't know what Alanis is trying to say with this release, but it pales in comparison to Jagged Little Pill. That CD is one you can listen to and enjoy every song.

They either release one too soon and the CD sounds exactly like the first. Or they take too long and lose their edge and/ or their lyrical-musical fluidity. Unfortunately, Alanis waited too long. She still has her cutting edge, but with the exception of \\"Thank U,\\" \\"The Couch,\\" and \\"So Pure,\\" the music and lyrics seem to lack any cohesion. Sometimes it's as if she simply took a transcript of sessions with her shrink and layered them over music and didn't bother to make the two match. I was really disappointed. I really don't think this CD will fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money and time. Sound:Mid-East Bong Babble","review":"I was a huge fan of Alanis until this CD. This CD is a waste of money and time. Evidently, Alanis earned enough money from the Jagged Little Pill that she can afford to record utter and complete babbling crap.Every track on the CD with the exception of Thank U sounds exactly the same. Morose, shrieking, drug induced, psychotic, and sometimes comatose lyrical nightmares.I cannot fully express how much I hated this CD, but perhaps the military can find a use for it in the psychological warfare tactical department."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all fake","review":"Morissette is nothing but a pseudo-enlightened rock-star who came back from India feeling a false sense of self-realization. I urge anyone to go there and see the terrible poverty, the lack of morals, and above all the wide spread ignorance among the people. Modern day India has nothing to offer in the way of enlightenment, or anything else. Much of the population is brainwashed and cloned, starting from a very young age, and have no opportunity to become individuals. It is as blind or even blinder than the rest of the world. I Alanis's so-called inspiration is nothing but a load of trash. Don't buy this CD, and if you do, don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trip to India was a waste of money","review":"However, that's not what I'm here to discuss. I am here to confront a song I heard on WSHE 100.3 in Orlando, and this was around Sept./Oct. 1998. I know it was from this album, and it was the ending of the song, and she sang about \\"Arse\\", and then does a harmonica solo. I've narrowed it down to 2 songs, and they are: \\"That I Would Be Good\\", and \\"UR\\". I use the word \\"Arse\\" because if I used the real word she sings this review will never be posted. Anyway the rest of this album is all over the place. It starts off with a pretty good song called \\"Front Row\\" which is a rather strong dance tune, but then it gel into hard rock sludge with \\"Baba\\", and from there it just seems to run the gauntlet. It was just alot of spitting in the wind as far as I'm concerned, and to me there has to be a better reason to visit India."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst album ever made!!! Do not waste your money","review":"I hate this album!!!!! Alanis, get a life, and write some music that at least has a good tune!

I would not pay a dollar for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Do That On CD","review":"terrible. does anybody realize that Jagged Little Pill was NOT her debut. She used to be a Debbie Gibson sound alike, until she figured out she could hit it big by sounding tormented ex. \\"Oh my god, I relate Sooo much to Alannis. She feels tortured just like me!\\" Pathetic. If you have a brain, you will stop supporting artists like this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This CD doesn't even get 1 star. Maybe a fourth of a star for \\"Thank U\\" but that's about it. I was a huge fan of Jagged Little Pill, but this album seems like a waste of my money. Some people say change is good, but Alanis changed a bit too much for the worse. She went from strongly worded songs with great beats to soft, off-beat tunes. I must say I am highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"India is know for producing sleepiness","review":"One word here . . . \\"Sleep.\\" This collection of overwrought psychological meanderings and slick willy production lacks depth and doesn't strike much of a chord.

HELLO? People, Alanis sucked then and she sucks now, for lack of more subtle expressions for her condition. I find it appropriate that Madonna, the woman who has nearly single-handedly destroyed pop music forever, signed this harpy. Her total lack of any musical or lyrical talent is so obvious to me, I just don't understand how 20 million people got duped. Not all of them could have been 12-year old girls...or could they? The dumbing down of America continues unabated as this stuff passes for substantial music full of 'personal expression'...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly awful.","review":"This is with out doubt one of the most disappointing CD's this decade.

The only single to make the charts,\\"thank u\\",peaked at a paltry #17,and alternative radio dropped this mess faster than you can say, Vanilla Ice. Proof,that her debut album's success,was INDEED,a fluke! Most recently,Alanis relased an MTV unplugged special,and cd..The special aired on MTV to poor ratings,and the companion cd bombed,peaking at at #60...

The music is dull and sparse, containing no memorable hooks, and the lyrics just ramble on and on, with no real rhyme. How could this same woman have written Jagged Little Pill only...oh, yeah, and why did she wait so long to release a follow-up? By this point, the world just did not care anymore. And what's with the cover art?The only songs I like are \\"Unsent\\" and \\"One,\\" but even those don't affect me like any of the tracks on Jagged Little Pill. I kind of wish she'd left out some of these songs and put in \\"Uninvited\\" and \\"No Pressure Over Cappuccino.\\" But oh well...hopefully, some of these tunes will come into their own when Alanis performs them in concert. She's awesome to see live, go check her out if you get the chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth","review":"Alanis lost her way. What happened to that music wisdom? Her lyrics still bear the distorted human soul, and they are even stronger in this new cd, but the melodies just dont fit. Well, \\" Thank U\\" and \\" Joining You\\" are masterpieces, but the rest of the songs are drowning in the sea of frailty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmore Follow-Up Falls Short","review":"If you loved Jagged Little Pill you won't like this one. Hard-edged tracks mixed with softer ballads are not what I expected. Where are the fun-loving pop sounds Alanis is famous for? Not reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"SFIJ almost unlistenable","review":"Taking poetic license to an extreme, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" is almost painful to listen to straight through. Most of the album is blank verse, with syllables in words and words in sentences mis-emphasized in order to preserve the meter. When it happens once, that's a songwriter admitting that there's no way to make a statement euphonic. Since Ms. Morissette does it over and over, she is either experimenting or didn't take the time to polish. I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, but I imagine I'll be tossing \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" in the CD player any time I want to hear her voice..."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's done it again!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is Alanis at her spiritual best.

Sometimes it's hard to understand what she's saying, but who cares with a voice and music like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"But is it Good?","review":"Alanis fans and fans of music played ad nauseum on commercial radio will like this.

Obviously she did have one good album in her and like so many others substituted poorly arranged and executed ramblings for a follow-up. Well, the second album usually predicts staying power. I work at a record store and these stopped moving fast after day one and already CDs are coming in for the used bin on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i feel that alanis could of done a whole lot better on this cd and i feel that it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back to India","review":"I don't understand why people make such a big deal out of this garbage. She's so talented and introverted she needs Glen BAllard to Co-Write the songs with her. If she's so talented WHY can't she write on her own? Perhaps, she's not as genius as her inflated ego would make you believe. She's not worthy of her fame. ALANIS GO BACK TO INDIA!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it more everytime I hear it.","review":"I loved this CD the first time I heard it, and each time I listen to it something new strikes me.

Except for \\"Joining You\\" and a couple of others, this album put me to sleep!!! I don't even like the new single \\"Unsent\\". It looks like Alanis will imitate Hootie's chart record...."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitions","review":"i must say i don't understand why it was considered uncool by so many people to like Alanis's music... to label her as unoriginal or even a puppet is an ignorant statement by anyone who is aware of the fact that she ACTUALLY writes her music! which is more than we can say for the other pop divas who have been classified as unoriginal packed material. her lyrics are awesome, and though she can whine with the best of them i think her vocal skills are also under-rated. from what i've heard of this album it's really slaps everyone in the face that has tried to pin her in the 'angry girl' catagory, it's worth a good listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing second effort, lacks the honesty and style","review":"A disappointing second effort, lacks the honesty and style of Jagged Little Pill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing.","review":"After hearing the Thank You music video for the nth time on MTV I finally bought the cd ... in particular I wanted to find out what the lyrics were (the way she sang garbled some of the words, so the message of the song was unclear) after the lyrics, I STILL have not the faintest clue what the song is about. I really enjoyed Jagged Little Pill, but this CD has thus far been filled with utterly forgettable songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good cd from a talented musician","review":"i really like alanis' songs. on this album her style is different from that on jagged little pill but good nevertheless. my favorite songs are joining you, that i would be good, one and unsent. sympathetic character is also good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I don't claim to fully understand everything that Alanis is trying to say, but every song sounds great. It is entirely different from Jagged Little Pill, as it should be(don't get me wrong, I loved JLP). She has gotten a lot of her rage out and her message is much more mature now. I find that this is the only CD I've ever bought that I can't get tired of listening to. The one thing I will say (that most people probably don't like) is that a lot of the songs will depress you, but who wants to be upbeat all the time. We need to experience a full range of emotions to live life fully, and Alanis really gives you the darker side like no one else can. Thank U, Can't Not, Would Not Come, and Joining You are my favorites. I can't wait for the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonder by Alanis!!","review":"Even though, it isn't a \\"...Little Pill\\", it's still a profound work by one of Rock's true stars. The way Alanis mixes all of her talents into one. \\"Front Row\\" , \\"That I would Be Good\\" , \\"Unsent\\", \\"So Pure\\", and \\"Joining You\\" are the Gems of the CD. Some of the songs bring back feelings from her oldest CD. \\"Your Congradulations\\" (a desperate plea for love) brings back memories of \\"Perfect\\" from \\"Jagged...\\". Even though it's not as \\"Perfect\\" as \\"...Pill\\", Alanis still deserves \\"Your Congradulations\\" on a CD well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Thing gets it right the second time, too!","review":"From the first riff to the last fade out, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, is the best yet. Now, don't get me wrong, there are still some singles from Jagged Little Pill that are unforgettable, but the newest music is always original when it comes from Alanis. I am an avid Alanis Fanatic and love her music, and if oyu enjoy listening to artists like Sheryl Crow and Natalie Merchant, there is no doubt that you would like this album. Connecting with her earlier release, Alanis still manifests her innermost feeling and intimate occaisions. This not only gives a personal touch to the music but also gives the listener the ability to relate to the artist. In a way, Alanis does release more than normal, but this just adds to the feel of her music. This album along with the Star Profile release, is a MUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and yet still the same!","review":"She is one of the few artists that do not have just one style. From \\"Thank U\\" to \\"Joining You\\", every song tells its own tale. I think it is her best work. While her first album told stories of bad boyfriends and revenge, this is more a sweet musing of her mind. To the people who thought it sucked because it was nothing like her old album: she has moved on to bigger and better things. If you don't like it, listen to her old one instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album is about lyrics not music. There are some rather embarrasingly mediocre songs like \\"I Was Hoping\\" and \\"One\\" which make me cringe. I bought this two months after its release and it's now collecting dust. Sorry Alanis, I've joined the Tori Amos crowd--she deserves more respect than you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis' Lyrics Are The Best","review":"I bought Junkie before I got Jagged Little Pill, and I love both of them. Even though Jagged Little Pill has some really mean and nasty songs (which I love) and this has nicer, calmer songs, there are some songs here with edge. Joining You and Front Row are probably the most like the original CD.Alanis' lyrics, as I have always thought, are completely mind-boggling. She seems to have put a great deal of thought into this CD and it shows. Especially in Sympathetic Character, the song is very interesting. The rhythm of the lyrics and the way she sings them make it haunting.This CD is wonderful, and I think that if you really listen to the music you will experience it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sophmore album succeeds the First","review":"This album could never have satisfied the wide audience that the first album opened up. Luckily Alanis doesn't try to satisfy everyone. She writes intensely personal songs that succeed despite the lack of wide market appeal. For an example just listen to the song \\"I was Hoping\\". It's just as angry as anything on her first album but a more settled anger than before. The only complaint I can think of is that the words are sometimes rattled off so fast you don't catch them the first time, but then that gives you a chance to listen to the album again doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How about something different Alanis? Same old same old...","review":"Maybe the songs are different, but the vocal inflection & whining is still there. She slurs her words so bad it's painful & she insists on sticking w/ mechanical instruments for that hollow sound that worked so well in Jagged Little Pill. As far as I'm concerned, she may have grown up a little, but she has yet to blossom in creativity - she's under the old \\"if it worked once, don't try anything different\\" thinking. PLEASE GET RID OF THE SCREECHING & WHINING & start showing us what else you can do w/that gorgeous voice you've got, Alanis! Pay attention to your label owner's career - Madonna's grown w/ every album she's made since 1983 by taking chances & doing new things, be it vocally or instrumentally - you might want to try the same thing. I admire Alanis's GREAT talent & obvious gifts, but this album is too commercial to distinguish it from anything else out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"the new album has an intellectual & spiritual message","review":"I bought the album on the day of it's release and the second I listened to it I knew I was going to enjoy it. Alanis has improved since JLP, obviously her trip to India did something. Towards the end the album seems to calm down and fade out, however the energetic rhythem and impresive lyrics of most of the songs awakens you to an entirely new aura of Alanis. My favorite songs include So Pure, Can't Not, Baba and Front Row. If you liked JLP you'll love Junkie, so add it to your collection today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginality at its best","review":"Alanis must of run out of Ideas for songs on this roast beef hash of an album. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it has 5 good songs (out of 17 songs). This album is 71 minutes of Jagged Little Pill rehash. The lack of \\"uninvited\\" on this album only helps to make this album worse. Alanis is a highly overrated musician. Anybody can release one good album and one good single."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Against the will of my roommate, I bought the CD. Jagged Little Pill contained music that I detested at first, then grew on me so much that I loved the album. It was original, insightful, and a little out of control. I was hoping to find something as original as the first with this CD, but was sorely disappointed. Drum tracks that we heard before; simgle line, minor piano lead-ins to tunes (aka City of Angels); even steeping as low as titling music \\"Thank U\\" and \\"U R\\"... I mean, what a sad attempt at being alternative. Maybe I'll be disappointed and after a year I'll love this album, but I'd suggest waiting until then to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jagged little could carry both if it needed to.","review":"Look i don't need to buy the cd to give it a review. Alanis is talented and her first cd could carry both. Unlike most artist she has enough brains to write her own lyrics. 5 stars, enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Melodies are slow and boring as are the words","review":"Disappointing, she has gone from a sexy angry white woman, to a pop act. ( Yawn )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad follow-up","review":"Geez, after JLP Alanis seemed to slack or something. There are 1 or 2 good songs, but the rest seemed so... ugly. I think she'll make a better album once she is out of the spot-light. I must say, Alanis won't survive long at his rate ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fire is gone","review":"Much of the emotionally charged fire from her previous cd is gone in this new release. While I play Jagged little pill repeatedly, I doubt I will listen to this more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"did Alanis burn out?","review":"After listening to Alanis's new album, I had to ask....did Alanis burn out? I mean this album is disappointing. Maybe her trip to India taught her to let go the anger that made her Jagged Little Pill successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick With It People!","review":"Alright I've seen some bad reviews here, and should I have gotten online after I myself bought this cd, I would have posted one myself. There were choice songs on here that are obviously good, including Front Row, That I Would Be Good, and Unsent. At first I thought \\"What is this GARBAGE between these good songs!\\"BUT, after a few listens, and reading the lyrics, they really grow on you!! Alanis is NOT the greatest songwriter.. Using phrases like \\"Thank U\\" over and over.. and \\"That I would be good\\" over and over.. It just isnt original. But a song like \\"I Was Hoping\\" is incredibly fast paced in which she recounts a story. No repetition.. Very unlike anything Ive heard!If you're an Alanis fan, buy this cd and give it a few listens through!If you're new to Alanis, buy Jagged Little Pill first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing close to Jagged Little Pill","review":"I loved Jagged Little Pill, but I absolutely hate this CD. I would give it 0 stars if possible. I guess it's better that I wasted hours downloading the MP3s of the CD instead of spening money on it though, so I'm thankful for that. I hope she does better on her next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Judging by what i've heard on the radio....","review":"ICK! what happened to Alanis' lyrics that people could actually understand. Now, i'm not the most psychological gal in the universe, but i can generally figure out what song lyrics mean. With Alanis, I sit there in a daze just wondering what the heck she's trying to say now! Just say it, like the good ol' alanis days. I can figure out what \\"rain on your wedding day\\" must be like."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to mature with it, but now...","review":"When I first purchased this CD,I was dissapointed. It was so hard to listnd to. But now,almost a full yr later, i have fallen for it. Tunes like \\"baba\\" and \\"front row\\" and \\"so pure\\" are catchy and well crafted. I thinlk it is a big leap from jagged little pill, but wonderful nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"I don't care what these people say about Alanis not being deep or insightful or whatever. I think she sounds great. Jagged Little Pill was not my favorite cd of all time, but I enjoyed listening to it. I believe her new cd is the same. Sometimes I like music because it sounds good. If you don't like the sound of her voice, don't listen to her music. It doesn't have to be deep to be good. Just ask a Hanson fan! They have millions of fans, and their music is a FAR CRY from deep or insightful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad music","review":"She is still Alanys Morrisette. Her voice is STILL scratchy, and her songs STILL don't have good melodies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis is back and it's about time!","review":"For all of you out there like me who have anxiosly awaited the arrival of Alanis's next brainchild, here it is! It was released unto the awaiting arms of the world on November 3, and I bought it immediately. She has again given us a set of songs we can relate to, understand, and ultimately love. It was a long three years, but they were well spent! It includes the single, Thank You, in which she expresses her gratitude to her trip to India. I personally like the song Unsent, in which she pays a short tribute to old flames. Alanis's tactic of writing for herself is sure to pay off once again!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GOOD SONGS ALL SOUND THE SAME","review":"The best songs on this CD sound the same: piano intro, bass line, and a good feel. But they don't carry the CD. The lyrics are interesting, the music skillful, but there is a sense the CD was rushed. Perhaps a dissappointment to Alanis' stalwhart fans, it is a fair CD to those indifferent to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Diary","review":"At first when I heard the CD, I put it away thinking, this sucks, she sucks now. But a few tracks had me intrigued. I listened to it again, and again, everytime a different song standing out. I have heard the album countless times, practically knowing all the lyrics. I came to know each track like a friend, who came by for tea and a conversation. This is really a musical diary, but the music is so amazing, that you will need multiple listens, each time focusing in on some of the other perfect aspects of the album. At first some tracks may seem bad (Your Congratulations, The Couch), but after a while, they seem musical too. The album is amazing, better than the first and has made me a real Alanis Morissette Junkie. But it now, for a truly great experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"I may be a masochist, but I won't subject myself to this..","review":"I've heard this more times than I ever wanted to, due to some co-workers with horrible taste in music. The first time I heard Alanis's voice I thought someone was strangling some cats. I prefer fingernails on a blackboard. Dressed up within the so-called 'mature' subject matter is simply trash that could have been written by a 12-year-old. Don't waste your money or your sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"embarassing","review":"If \\"Jagged little Pill\\" suceeded as a pop album, despite it being obvious that the emperess had no clothes, this is downright embarassing for artist and listener alike. Come to think of it I have a hard time referring to her as an artist. I only wish it were possible to give this zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cd is awful","review":"I can't find anything redeeming about this CD. The lyrics read like a 5-year-old's diary, the vocals are hideous, like a mangy screeching cat gargling broken glass, and you'd think with a million-dollar producation job, it wouldn't sound like it was recorded in a n outhouse. I couldn't tell where one \\"song\\" ended and the next one began, it just goes on and on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good album !","review":"On the back of the excellent Jagged Little Pill album, I was expecting a lot from Alanis. I didn't get it.We all know the \\"hidden\\" lyrics in the first (third) album, and Alanis always seems like she has a few axes to grind. JLP is an album I play when I'm feeling melancholy. It gives me a good release. It also has some every good songs on there.The new album seems to have propelled Alanis from a few pints of beer at lunch to a full bottle of vodka on the back of losing your job. It's depressing stuff. It does have a few saving graces, e.g. \\"thank u\\", a great song, but what IS she trying to say ?All in all, she's in danger of losing her public who like her \\"attitude\\" but without the dose of the Samaritans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tunes aren't as good as Pill, but the Lyrics are","review":"Clearly, Jagged Little Pill was great for the radio. Almost all the songs had a catchy tune, and even though some of the lyrics needed work, I still loved the CD because I could sing along and dance. With Junkie, I had to listen to the CD several times with the lyrics to really understand what she was saying. I think she really pours herself into her music, and she isn't pretentious (she doesn't chant in foreign languages on her album like Madonna). Thank U is not the best song. \\"One,\\" \\"Front Row,\\" and \\"So Pure,\\" are all great songs. And \\"Unsent\\" is my personal favorite, because there is something so sad and poignant about all these things she wants to tell people, but she never got the chance. Give Junkie a chance--don't judge too harshly. I think if you liked Pill you'll realize this one is much more original and personal: not just about her bashing all the guys who have dumped her."},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply disappointed","review":"Jagged Little Pill, I now mention it along the same lines of Slippery When Wet, Back in Black, 1984, Nevermind, and Whitney Houston - landmark albums. Then her sophmore album came out. I almost took her off the afore mentioned list. Where is he growth in this alnum? All I hear in these songs are boring rehashed melodies and the same (once refreshing) use of mindless catch phrases that simply annoy you. She has so much to say that at times I feel she's trying too hard to git her emotions and belies into a dsong. The result is mixture of confusion and perplexity. Perhaps that is what she is aiming for. Only time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis Morissette is a goddess","review":"I bought Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie 4 weeks ago and it hasn't been taken out of my stereo since. I must admit the first time I listened to it I didn't think much of it. But once you listen to it a few times and really listen to what she is singing it starts to blow you away. Oh and she is absolutely brilliant in concert if you ever have the chance to see her live. She totally blows you away. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supposed Former Infatuation Jukie is....different.....","review":"I was knocked over by Jagged Little Pill when I first heard it, so when I bought Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, I was expecting the same. I must admit, I was sort of let down, but after listening to it...the album grows on you. It is completely different from JLP...not worse...just different. I have grown to LOVE this album, and I know Alanis' other fans will too, if they just give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mild, less-angry, and less melodic effort from Alanis","review":"In fairness, a more versatile set than Jagged Little Pill, but lacks the real punch of the debut. There's a lot of music on this disc, 17 tracks, making it worth the price of admission. Still I would have hoped more of the tracks would have impressed me initially, only 3 did, and 1 of the 3 has already been on radio for the last month. Also disappointing is the absence of the \\"Uninvited\\" track from \\"City of Angels\\".Still it may be the type of collection that grows on you, but initially I personally expected more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as her critics say, not as good as her fans say.","review":"Perhaps back in the beginning days of rock and roll a group, duo or solo artist could rely solely on one gimmick or a single bend in style... however, today, Alanis relies too heavily on her barfing, stacatto interruptions to her songs... she does this on \\"Thank U\\" to excess (along with almost all of her songs)as she did on her first non-Tiffany-like album. I must admit that both Jagged Little Pill and this offering elude to possible greatness in the future but alas, no greatness here. Without Ballard, Alanis remains yet another tiresome poser. I'd like to see her do some classic rock and roll rebellion songs in an unplugged fashion (just to see what happens, and without that stacatto barfing crap, I bet it would be real cool)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Alanis is an extremely untalented artist who does not deserve any of the respect she gets. This CD was even more dreadful than her last. I think she was actually better when she was a little known Canadian pop icon in the early 90's and that doesn't say much. All you fans need to grow up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"Outside of \\"Thank you\\" the lyrics to this album sound like they were written AND sang as the music played in the background. What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposed Former Infatuation Junk....","review":"What an incredible disappointment! While I can be happy for the incredibly talented Ms. Morissette's gaining spiritual enlightenment in India, it's effect on her music has been entirely negative. Among a personal group of musician friends, I rated her first album as best of the year when it was released. This second album, full of attempts to get her message down people's throats through sheer force of volume and her already proved (on JLP) raw power, was the biggest mistake in LP purchases I've EVER made -- oh that I would have listened to it first instead of pre-ordering it on the strengths of Jagged Little Pill alone...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I absolutely loved her JLP Cd. But this new one of her's was SO BORING. I have no desire to ever listen to it again and feel it was a sad waste of money. It was plodding, monotonous and in desperate need of a creative melody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT be fooled by the total 4 star rating!","review":"Alanis Morissette used to be my favorite artist... So when this atrocious excuse for an album came out, I bought it immediately and ever since then I can't stand Alanis... As a matter of fact, I often find that I can't even listen to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" anymore! On this album, Alanis' voice is annoying, the songs have absolutely no spirit and even all the cool pop hooks from \\"Pill\\" are completely gone! I don't know why \\"Uninvited\\" isn't on this album, by the way, maybe it could have saved it... somewhat. Don't even THINK about wasting your money on this! If you're new to Alanis' sound, get \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" first. If you already have it, get a \\"Thank U' CD single or something, and do not bother with this atrociousness! With this album, Alanis did something more than just put out a \\"sophomore slump\\"; she has alienated 95% of her loyal fans, myself included."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never been mad","review":"The infatuation comes from the semi-melodies located here, and within this album. Nothing is supposed, perhaps a single junk, or junkie as Alanis would have it. This pill is not only jagged, it is bitter and has far more serious side effects. It is like the proverbial apple, tempting and alluring. Go ahead, bite it, when you awake in a deathly grave you're happier for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"supposed former \\"singer\\" - junky","review":"alanis is stinky. she screeches like cat claws running down a chalkboard. and although she doesn't screech as much, the pretentiousness and poor overall song quality don't earn her any points this time around, either. lots of females kick her booty musically every day. former alanis junkies, i invite you to discover fiona apple, jewel, sarah mclachlan, joni mitchell, ani difranco, paula cole, lauryn hill, courtney love, carole king, erykah badu, or luscious jackson, for starters. don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"First album was alot better","review":"I did not like this Cd at all.All it sounded like was a drunk person holloring!Her first Cd was the best because I liked every song on it.The only song I liked on this was Thank u.I hated this so much I took it to the warehouse music and got some money for it.Do yourself a big monney-saving-favor and don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an Alternative Poseur!!!!!!! What Happened to Alanis?","review":"Alanis has fallen way down in this sad, sad, musical effort! The worst track is that lame \\"Dear John\\" song-- what a poor excuse for song writing and how far must she continue to take this pseudo-alternative divahood; to me, it seems like so much maudlin theatrical posturing and little musical substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"big dissapointment","review":"When Jagged Little Pill came out i listened to it constantly and loved almost every song on it! When i heard she was coming out with a follow-up i was very excited. when i first heard (and saw the video) Thank U i was a little discouraged but thought it might just be a weak point in her CD. Despite my doubts i went out and got the CD the day it came out. And couldn't even listen to the whole thing. I was expecting something similar to JLP-something with which i could get my frustration out and i got, in my opinion a CD with all the same boring songs. If your into that stuff than i advise it but if not, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only song worth listening to is \\"Thank U.\\" The rest is a whining, grating complaint about everything. I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Hell was I thinking when I bought this!","review":"I should have checked the reviews here on Amazon first before buying Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. What a load of self centered self righteous crap. The music is horrible and her voice is painful to listen to for much of the album. A dying animal screeches better than this. What happened Alanis??? I loved Jagged Little Pill.Every song on this album is I this and I that. They all sound the same musically and lyrically.Well Thank U for stealing my money. I can't return the cd because I opened and played it(once). I'm going to have to find another use for it.....maybe a coaster.Alanis...wake up and smell the coffee...this cd sucked. You will not be getting anymore of my money until you put out a quality piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, avoid this at all costs.","review":"Once the CD starts spinning, the crackling of Alanis' horse like screeching voice begins to permeate the air as agent orange did in the Vietnam war. Her empty and try-so-hard to be deep lyrics do nothing for the music world but allow mediocre musicians to sound like geniuses when compared to this true mockery of the music world. If you want to spend 13 bucks on something, do yourself a huge favor and buy 30000 thumb tacks instead, because spending 13 dollars on this CD is just like spending 13 dollars for a coffee table coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody please help me!","review":"A co-worker has been playing this thing at work. Who is this Alanis Morisette, and why is she making all that racket? She sounds like a a trapped animal, gnawing its own foot off to escape a steel trap. As good a reason as any to wage war against Canada."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst 12 bucks I ever spent","review":"I really loved Jagged Little Pill so I anxiously awaited the release of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Was I disappointed! It did not live up to my expectaions. There are only two decent songs of the 17 tracks and even those are mediocre at best. Don't waste your money. The horrible lyrics don't even flow well with the horrible music. You'd never guess this is the same woman who produced Jagged Little Pill. You have really let us down Alanis."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Winces*","review":"This Cd is simply terrible music.... How disappointing after Jagged Little Pill which I consider a brilliant classic work for the ages. This so often happens after a big hit; the \\"artist\\" feels she is justified to offer up pretentious drivel as if initial CD success was a sign of selling out. Please bring back the passion and fire that made your warblings so memorable Alanis and forget you ever visited India and smoked up too much of the decidedly non-medicinal herbage..... A career ending work quite possibly....."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I bought this CD back when \\"thank u\\" was released....thank u still is a great track...the rest of the album is horrible. She recorded it in one day and it shows. reading the lyrics, it looks like there was some good stuff in there...but the album, musically, is just C-R-A-P."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rock?","review":"Alanis Morrissette had a great US debut with Jagged Little Pill, an album with a great variety of songs. Sadly, she joins the likes of Bush and Live as another artist who went away from a winning formula on a monster album. Like Live and Bush, Alanis gets all weepy and mellow on us while trying to sound very wise in the ways of the world. The new formula doesn't work. The only good songs are Joining You and So Pure, songs with a good driving beat. The rest are a bunch of meaningless, wispy, mushy, quasi-intelligent gook that Alanis picked up while 'discovering herself?' in the depths of India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordmonger needs to get back to basics","review":"Jagged Little Pill was great, but since then Alanis has just churned out three albums with nothing new to offer, little inspiration, and lyrics that aren't particularly poetic or interesting and overwhelm her music with their sheer bulk. This album is one of those three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alanis lost her spunk","review":"I loved Jagged Little Pill because it left me feeling charged - the music was energetic and powerful, and it left a listener feeling on top of the world. I could only get myself to listen to Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie all the way through once because it had much more of a \\"why me, woe is me\\" feel to it that left me wondering, \\"wow, what happened to her?\\" I bought this album a month after it came out; I haven't listened to it since. It is an artistic album, but not what I would have expected from the person who created Jagged Little Pill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowly and calmly drop the CD","review":"I was a huge fan of Alanis, listening to Jagged Little Pill religiously. I was both happy and excited to have secured a copy of this CD when it came out and a hurried home to play it.I was hugely dissapointed.When I listened to this CD I was reminded of a chorus of yowling cats with a finale of barking dogs. Apart from 'Thank U' this has to be one of the biggest piles of crap I've ever listened to, and if you are even THINKING of buying it I suggest you get therapy because you obviously have a serious problem. At least I had the excuse of never hearing any of the tracks on this CD when I bought it, as I still was in the happy place of imagining that this would be as good as 'Jagged Little Pill'.Ignorance is bliss."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTE TO ALANIS:","review":"Baby,all you're diary entries can't be songs!Alanis is surely one of the most pretenious,boring,annoying,andself-absored women in pop.No substance and no sense of humor.Howin the world does this woman sell records? Does Madonna and the folks at Maverick persaude Madonna's huge fanbase to buy it or something? I'm not trying to down all of Alanis' fans because like another pretenious,dull singer/songwriter I dislike Tori Amos a lot of people have healed to her music.This isn't a diss to Alanis' fans but to Alanis herself.Hey,since she's so self-important maybe she'll take a trip to India(which inspriredthis album's first single \\"Thank U\\") again and she'll become so\\"inspired\\" that she'll quite singing and I don't know...write a book.Yeah do that Alanis,anything to stop you from making records!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"she lost the edge from the first album.there's nothing on this disc that matches you outta know.and for my money i still would take anni defranco over here.because anni did this style way before alanis even thought of it.in fact alanis was closer in style to paula abdul? with another album like this one she will be in the used bend next to paula."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"Alanis Morrisette, aside from being ugly, wierd, and naked, can't sing for pork chops.

I have no idea what Alanis is trying to do,,, but if it's sing???? She need some serious help with it. I have never heard or seen such a OVER RATED wanna-be singer in my life. Thank U India??? She really needs to check India out a little better. All the poverty, suffering and death due to starvation in that country. I can think of better places to thank. Standing in the middle of the street naked singing babbled words that sound as though a 6 year old wrote....just isn't my idea of misic.. Her first album did have 1 song on it that I liked but I don't buy cd's for just 1 song. Oh! Take some harmonica lessons Alanis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fingernails on a blackboard, slowly","review":"No doubt many of her fans will rave about the stupendous music here. Fame tends to cause fame. But I found that listening to this album was nearly impossible. The lyrics are irritating and the music is just plain ordinary. There's a big difference between singing about pain, as in the blues, and singing in a way that causes pain, as in this album. Sure, \\"Thank You\\" is a pleasant song. That makes 1 out of 17. One star is generous. I think I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a refund?","review":"I waited with great anticipation for Alanis Morissette's next CD. Her music is unlike anything else I've heard before. I was not prepared for this collection of bland drivel. I had hoped to be able to hear a sample of some other songs besides the single, \\"Thank U\\", but none were available on RealAudio. I think I know why."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, uncreative, mediocre at best - a huge disappointment","review":"How is it possible that Alanis could, after such success with J.L.P., cough up such crap? I'm all for artistic impressionistic interpretation, but it seems as though she was really trying to outdo herself, and in the process forgot the most task before her, which is to entertain us. It wasn't broke, so why did she try to fix it. Enjoy \\"Thank U\\" while it's played on the radio, and leave it at that. Spend your money on the new Jewel album instead!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I think \\"psycho bong babble\\" sume this up the best. I loved Jagged Little Pill...it's still a must have on any drive over 20 minutes. I think I'll donate the new one to charity. Except for Thank U, I didn't even make it thru an entire song.

What an unsettling experience. I love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like some cheese with that WHINE?","review":"Alanis Morisette is a pretentious teeny-bopper whose music is contrived, insencere, and devoid of any musical merit whatsoever. In addition to her lack of technical skill, Morisette's lyrics are dishonest and full of cliche teen angst vocabulary words. My suggestion to Morissette is that she stop pretending to be angry and start writing songs about the true Alanis, the irritating Canadian teenager with teased hair and an affinity for dating \\"Full House\\" cast members."},{"rating":"2","title":"OKAYZI, in a strange kind of WAY!","review":"Well, as all of you reviewers out there, I devoured JLP. This one is more bland, more philosophical, I bought it in good faith to JLP.

I get new \\"continental\\" Alanis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have eagerly awaited this album and am severly disappointed from it. Yes, it is witty, intellectual and thought-provoking. But no, it has none of Alanis' former playfulness, none of the melodic extraordinaries. It turned out too dark and too nineties. \\"Thank You\\" is probably the best track already. Sorry, but this is a waste of money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Interesting","review":"Ok, so with the arrival of Alanis' second album, we discover that she is, in fact, very odd.Her lyrics are more like sentances on this album. She has lost most of her anger, and explored many religious and expressive forms on this album. This album is also very dark comparatively. It's like Alanis moved to Mars, or something.Some of the tracks are truly stunning, like \\"Thank U\\", \\"Can't Not\\", and \\"So Pure\\". She gets downright weird (equals transgendered) on \\"Couch\\".It's a worthwhile CD, and the change of pace is refreshing and welcomed. Not everyone can be angry all of the time. This CD is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SFIJ is of extremely high quality","review":"Alanis Morissette has proved with her second major release that she can do what not many other singers are able to do,....the uniqueness of her music proves that fact that she deserves to be on the top of the charts everyhere...

I am sure that you shall do the same..its a great buy as all the song are really good. my personal favourites are So Pure and thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having loved JLP, I was hanging out for Alanis's second album. However, given the time and attention to detail she supposedly lavished on SFIJ, it is musically repetitive and sloppily written. What happened to the incisiveness of the first album? She need not have recreated JLP, but I think she went too far in the other direction trying to avoid doing so..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Beautiful","review":"The progression Alanis shows with this album is amazing.

This record is not so accesible as JLP, but it's very edgy and there is a lot of darker material present here. It took a long time before I could appreciate it. Although it's a bit to long (17 songs) there are some very good ones here. Thank U, Unsent, Are You Still Mad and Front Row are among my favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the beautiful heart of Alanis","review":"This is a great cd made up from the heart. I'm very glad Alanis thinks that there are are more important things to life then money or fame . I think Alanis has some what matured in this album. I think that it's good to try different types of music to find you're own personal style. This is what Alanis did. She started with disco then pop then to rock.

I've already sold it back to my local record store. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if Alanis could just manage to hit an actual note. For a while, I couldn't figure out if I was listening to a human female or a male donkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album is haunting with several highs and lows.","review":"The album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is amazing. There are haunting melodies that shape the feeling for the songs. It is much more artisic in its value than Jagged Little Pill. However, near the conclusion of the cd, it slacks off to a less dramatic feel to a storybook, dreamy feel. All in all, the album is great for a serious, dark, audience yet it ends with a forward looking happy conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great additon to the music industry!","review":"Alanis was able to improve and grow with this second CD. Not only does she sing with the same depth of emotion, but her music has evolved into something that reflects the woman she is today.

Alanis here uses all of her talent to create 17 songs full of heart and power. Only two songs didn't make it Heart of the house,and your congratulations. Both quite plain and insipid.

I can see why her self-absorbed, self-pitying, pseudo-profound, formulaic lyrics might appeal to teenagers (especially girls) who have in their lives to date heard only a small volume of angst-filled, pretentious, \\"I'm so sensitive and why doesn't the world understan' me\\") pop music.

When I read reviews of so many people calling it great, i tended to have a second look at it.. and i find it quite amazing.. one reason was that this time i listened it after listening to unplugged which is great. I didnt like it earlier because i didnt like either of the videos (thank you, so pure and unsent). Now i find thank yu an amazing song.My favourites would go like:1. Joining You.2. Thank You(she has excellent voice here when she says disillusionment and silence).3. Unsent.4. One.5. I was hoping.(much better in Unplugged)6. Heart of the House.7. The Couch.8. Baba9.

Great work, a must buy.- Sam"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near her first CD","review":"I've spent all day listening to her CD over and over again at work, and can't seem to find the connection with her music as I easily did to her first CD. Her second CD is heavily dependent on repetition; however, the repetition is not catchy nor listenable. \\"Thank U\\" was definately engineered to be the \\"radio hit\\" to bring in buyers. Her quest to show us she has not sold out has dissuaded me - her poppy music backing up her angst-filled lyrics are what drew me to her in the first place. This follow-up is very reminiscent of Dave Matthew's recent CD, Before These Crowded Streets - another dark, unlistenable, experimental work suitable only for the hardcore fan, determined to love the band regardless of the material they put forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"The first time I heard \\"Thank U,\\" I thought it was a very good song. Then, the modern rock station in Minneapolis (where I live--duh!) decided to play another song, \\"Joining You.\\" I thought to myself, \\"That's the kind of Alanis I've been hearing for the past 3 years.\\" So, I bought the CD. And I have to admit... even though she isn't her old self, the album is truly amazing. Almost every song has great lyrics, great music, and great... well--just great. The best song (according to me) on this CD is \\"So Pure.\\" I like how on that song, she lets go of all of her feelings and just sings a very loose song. Cheers to Alanis Morissette... even though she's changed--she's done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Supposed former infacuation junkie is great. I listened to it once, and it is worth a lot more listenings. I like the way Alanis changes her songs, she doesn't keep the same beat in every single one.

But with incoheremt babble and cheesy cliches like hers, it would speak more highly of her intelligence if she let someone else write for her. Problem is she has a terrible voice so they'd STILL need somebody else to sing the lyrics and by that point, she'd be out of the picture. Hmmm...I could live with that"},{"rating":"1","title":"From Psuedo-Angst to Psuedo-Spirituality","review":"I wasn't convinced then, and I'm not convinced now. For someone who tries so hard not to be pretentious, Alanis is as fake as they come. I saw nothing empowering about her first album. But now Alanis is trying to make amends due to the backlash about her whining about men, and the result is the painfully contrived single, Thank You. Her music and lyrics are uninspired, and so unworthy to comparisons with Madonna's Ray of Light. And that voice *shudders*"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ponderous Disappointment","review":"Not much to say here but this album seems to have sophomore jinx written all over it. Jagged Little Pill, and then Alanis' albums after SFIJ are truly remarkable and stand up so well to repeated listenings.However this, with the exceptions of Thank U, So Pure and Joining You, is almost like a repititious drone, unremarkable melodies to say the least, making it hard for me to reach for this CD when I want to enjoy Alanis.Completists will naturally want this and there are a handful of good tracks as I mentioned, but for all others, there is far better Morissette fare out there from which to choose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another CD bound for the kitchen garbage can","review":"Forget Alanis,she tries to be too intellectual for her young,inexperienced years.She\`s a tiring artist to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment!","review":"I think \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is one of the top pop albums of the last decade. So I was very eager to hear AM's newest.Unfortunately, she and her collaborator have kept what didn't work in the first album and thrown out what did work. Gone are the immensely catchy tunes, gone is the refreshing attention to lyric craft. Instead this sounds like a rambling journal of a self-obsessed 24-year-old. The CD is almost entirely devoid of rhyme, or a memorable tune, opting instead for tuneless, self-indulgent stream of consciousness yakking with the same heavy beat behind. \\"Thank U\\", the hit single, is the only exception. Ballard (her collaborator) is a veteran rock song composer, and ought to have known better than get swept into this ill-conceived, utterly non-musical waste of time. I just hope they can get back on the right track for her next outing.Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and emotionless","review":"I found this album dull and unmoving. It completely lacks the emotion she demonstrated in her first release, and I found myself unable to pay attention long enough to finish listening to a single track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Drivel","review":"I got this one for free from a promotion, which is the only reason I bothered listening to it at all. Alanis has never been a terribly good singer. Some people can pull it off, like Bob Dylan, but at least Bob could write. Alanis can't even do that, as evidenced by the mindless juvenile anger and faux \\"maturity\\" on Jagged Little Pill. If she's mature on that album, then Puff Daddy must be a master of originality. She showed some potential musically on the last album, if not lyrically, but even that is long gone here. Please Alanis, if this is your best, give it up now. At least the CD makes a good drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fond of it, thank you.","review":"I must honestly say that i'm not a big alanis morisette fan.

I bought it and sold it in three days. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy Alanis Without Guilt","review":"We ALL know that Jagged Little Pill was the product of AT LEAST three record company songwriters - no matter what the album credits say. I'm not saying that the songs on SFIJ are bad songs - on the contrary, with so many corporate dollars behind it, they are probably the best songs money can buy. Our enjoyment of Alanis should not in any way be tainted by the fact that she is a product, an invention of the recording industry designed to create more revenue. Even though her entire image - her entire persona, in fact - is utterly manufactured, we should still be able to find some meaning behind the words she sings. While some of us may hear REAL rage from, say, Diamanda Galas, it is somewhat comforting to know that commodified emotions, in the form of Alanis, Inc., can still elicit such strong empathy from a numbed listening public."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING LIKE HER FIRST CD AT ALL","review":"A friend bought this cd because of all the Alanis Morisette hype on MTV and VH1.. We listened to it one time and I'm affraid that once will be all we'll ever listen to it ! Her first cd had 1 good song and 2 songs that were at least worth listening to but this cd doesn't even come close to her first ... I didn't like a single song on the whole cd. And what's up with the no clothes thing anyway? I suppose she needs to try anything to make something that's no good sell...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"What exactly is everyone so excited about? Her voice is bland, her music is monotonous, and her lyrics are repetitive at best (non-sensical at worst).

How 'bout making some sense?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Appalling cover, beautiful album","review":"Definitely a more mature album than the excellent, 30 million selling Jagged Little Pill, but I have one complaint... Who on Earth decided on that ghastly Frank Zappa Uncle Meat style cover? Even if it was Alanis, it was a mistake.Whether AM likes it or not, her physical beauty is part of the package and several people (female and male) I know felt cheated by this hideous travesty of a cover, which I believe could have cost millions in potential sales.Thankfully the new album, Under Rug Swept, has a cover which evokes the same feel as JLP. If they re-issued Junkie with a decent new cover AND with the track Uninvited, I would buy it again. Hint hint."},{"rating":"1","title":"derivative","review":"pseudo-spirtual self-indulgence on the grand scale that only those with a record contract can have.

The rage is what made \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" so much fun, and now the edge is gone. Alanis, you've abandoned us! It's like she's apologizing to everyone she shredded in JLP, and explaining why she did it--if she's not beating herself up in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think different, buy different - and forget this cd","review":"I was wondering why they chose a slow ballad for the first single of this new album.After I heard the other songs I knew the reason: This album is BAD! Background sounds, weird dull sounds, instruments sounding as if played by seven-year-old grunge fans - I was glad I hadn't bought it right from the rack.If you like or love the first album \\"Jagged little pill\\" keep it and cherish it. And forget the new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use it as a coaster - that's all it's good for.","review":"Most expensive coaster I've ever purchased.Extremely disappointed. Jagged Little Pill was wonderful - expressive, passionate, and moving. This CD, however, is mind-numbing, irritating, and worst of all boring. One track Thank U held my attention, the others were just \\"noise\\". Has she been to India lately? If that's what she was trying to immitate, perhaps she should have written lyrics for a talented Indian artist and saved herself some embarressment. Thank goodness she sold enough copies of Jagged Little Pill to have a comfortable existance -- this could only sell to those who are truly \\"Infatuation Junkies\\" of Alanis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another enjoyable CD from Alanis","review":"I prefer Jagged Little Pill over this one. I bet many fans were hoping for another Jagged. This one sounds completely different from it. It is still a good CD. I did enjoy this album. Some of the songs that stand out are Front Row,Baba, and Would Not Come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"Those interested in JLP, i would say you are in for something new. SFIJ shows how much ALanis has matured, especially in her songwriting. Lyrics like \\"Verbal Daggers.....you think i'm withdrawing the guilt tripping you\\" were done beautifully. \\"verbal daggers\\"- one of the many great metaphors nicely done by alanis. the second lyric i mentioned could be broken up. \\"you think i'm withdrawing the guilt + the guilt tripping you\\". absolutly brilliant!! only she could think of that!! An absolute great lyricist. That alone is worth getting. The music adds nice flavor and background. A new step for her, but works great. Alanis' voice has definitely improved. JLP was a little screechy at times but alanis definitely cleaned that up without losing her angst nature. Awesome album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Morissette aims to please fans, critics and self","review":"At first I was disappointed with the album; it was so quite different from 'Jagged Little Pill.' It took nearly half a year for me to appreciate what Alanis has done with this album. Sticking her neck out, Alanis created an album build upon conversation, evident in tracks like \\"UR\\" and \\"Front Row.\\" She sticks her neck out considerably with her singles \\"Thank U\\" and \\"Unsent\\" (especially \\"Unsent\\" with the almost too-precious idea of reading unsent letters to her exes with music). Alanis Morissette aims to please both her critics, her fans and herself, ambitiously abandoning the bite of \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" for the Zen-like clarity of \\"Infatuation.\\" It's challenging, impressive and not as immediate as her first. It's the first step out of the confessional booth, armed with a mixed sense of forgiveness and the inevitableness of further sin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Jagged Little Pill, but I still love her...","review":"Alanis Morissette created a masterpiece with release of Jagged Little Pill. I listened to the album 24/7 for months, in anticipation of her follow-up. When I first began listening to her latest, I must admit that I was a little disappointed, but then I remembered that her words are like that a teenager would write. For a follow-up album, this one wasn't too bad. I still love this woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!","review":"I thought that is was the best music that I have ever heard, since Jagged Little Pill. I would have said that Jagged Little Pill was better than Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, but it was still very good. The best song on the album would have to be, either, Joining You or Can't Not."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"I heard this cd at a friend's house, and I loved it!

Fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Alanis, for this album.","review":"When I listened to Alanis album \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", I figured she couldn't do better, not because she's not talented, but because it is almost impossible to create a better work.. When I listened to \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", I knew I was wrong. This is her best work yet. I was touched... thanx Alanis"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I picked up this album from the shop and was a bit skeptical of it. I had her previous CD, and although I wouldn't rave about it, I often found myself humming the words to the songs. Besides, being an \\"ex Canadian\\" and seeing it here in New Zealand forced the purchase. I figured I'd give it a go and was immediately drawn to it.The songs were such a change from her previous work. Although they still had the angst-ridden lyrics, it was musically different. I think Alanis spread her talent on both the music, and her lyrics on this album as opposed to just the lyrics on JLP.I managed to see her here on a tour to promote the CD in Auckland and it rocked. I think Alanis has done a great job of capturing her feelings in her music and her performances. I look forward to the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting series of frustrating relationships","review":"Seems she must have dated me and some of my friends. Now I feel guilty. Thanks a lot !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go see a shrink Alanis.","review":"I was disappointed. Like just about every other female on earth, JLP became my \\"anthem CD\\"--and memorized every song on it. What made Alanis so much fun was the rage that we all need to let loose once in a while. Even \\"Univited\\" was along those lines...and I was a bit curious as to why that track was not to be included on \\"Junkie\\".But now we know...that track belonged on JLP. On the new CD, its like she's apologizing for everything she said on JLP, kind of like \\"It wasn't you, it was me.\\" WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR THAT!

Only one hit on this album...a let down after the biggie one before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junkie Needs No Rehab, But Pill Is Tough to Swallow","review":"Morissette's new sophomore offering (actually her fourth full-length recording) flirts with spiritualism while retaining the unbridled passion of Jagged Little Pill. The album as a whole is an impressive agglomeration, but don't expect five huge radio releases. Most reminiscent of Pill songs are \\"Thank U,\\"\\"UR,\\" and \\"The Front Row,\\" all of which will likely be played to death. Darker tunes like \\"The Couch\\" are truly noteworthy, but the second half of the album is generally inferior to the first. Album sales may top out at around five or six million, but not until those nervous execs at Maverick shove this one down your throat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to hate her","review":"I would love to hate alanis morrisette, but I have to admit that shes an EXCELLENT song writer, good, strong album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIT CD","review":"Go Alanis!

Anyone who has ever been scorned by a man or anyone, will love Alanis, especially Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Lyric Junkie","review":"Somewhere between Jagged Little Pill and Infatuation Junkie, Alanis forgot how to write a song without making a list or starting each phrase with the same few words (e.g.I was hoping, Thank U, Are you still mad). I could go on about my sadness. I could go on mourning her former song writing skills (you oughta know, comes to mind). I could go on making my point, but going on this way would be boring, like most of her new material. Granted Ironic and a couple others on Pill had the same repetition structures, but not to the annoying level as the songs on Junkie. Ironically, I like her new live album, though. She is a great live performer. . .no Tori Amos, but great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here.","review":"Alanis hasn't changed one bit since Jagged Little Pill. She still can't sing and her music has absolutely no purpose. I supposed being ticked off is a rwason to put out music. At least the folk artists knew how to write songs that meant something. These songs tackle no issues of importance. Please Alanis, stop releasing music and take the money and run."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did you expect?","review":"Alanis is overrated. The whole world will find this out on Tuesday. (I already have- being a radio DJ is great, ain't it?) She cannot sing, she cannot play an instrument- all she can do is scream (and give us big headaches). Sorry, but you'll see what I mean. She's just another Top 40 act who means nothing to music in the long run. I would give her 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"They won't let me give \\"0\\" stars","review":"I just listened to an advance tape of this cd, and it is every bit as dull and lame and whiny as the first! Just as the only ironic thing in \\"Ironic\\" was that NONE of the things in the song actually WERE ironic, the only thing to be thankful for in \\"Thank You\\" is that it eventually ends!! the only problem with that is that there are more songs afterwards, so it's a bit of a mixed blessing. I'm sure tis record will sell millions and millions, but all of you people who think that Alanis is SO deep and SO insightful and SO witty, why don't you go check out something by Christine Lavin, Nanci Griffith, Leonard Cohen, or Chuck Prophet? For that matter, even Weird Al is deeper than Alanis!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I am a pretty big fan of Alanis. I own four albums in addition to this one, and have to say that this is definitely my least favorite.

The originality of the first album is simply rehashed in this album and it is poison to the ears. Alanis is very talented but many of the songs such as 'are you still mad?' are nothing but shrieky lines of nothingness. Is it any surprise that her album was only number one for three weeks and then dropped off the top ten chart? NO it is not. Some advice Alanis- don't try to wow me. We don't want to hear you scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"self indulgent","review":"come on, it is plain arrogant to put out noise like this and expect the public to buy it. I'm all for progression as an artist, but she's mixed up pretentious with progressive. The last release was believable as an \\"angry young woman\\" shed her bubblegum past and howled...but now she's an Indian music expert after two weeks there? A little influence is good, not wholesale changes. I didn't want \\"Jagged part 2\\" but I expect a artist believes enough in what they produce to stay in the same ballpark at least. Hope you can sell it at the used CD store, mine had 5 already and wouldn't buy anymore...."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY MOTHER SOUNDS BETTER","review":"I bought my friend this for her birthday.

That was my problem.I couldn't believe that an artist could have created an album so amazing (JLP) and be a one hit wonder. So, I let the album play in its entirety a few times, as I hung out in my room. I let it become incidental, and then magically each song began to grow a life of its own and the structure and flow of the album became a lovely journey which I now take very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a FAN","review":"For one thing, I am an Alanis Morissette fan, or at least an older one (from 1995-1998). Her first cd was brash, insightful and in-your-face. Ms. Morissette's second cd tries to be that, but falls short. Lyrically Alanis uses no structure like she did on JLP. On her first album she told stories; here they are just incomplete thoughts. Alanis has a wonderful voice which is refreshing to hear, but her lyrical attempt on this one is stale and the repetition is an eye sore. Try again Alanis."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait for her next CD!","review":"In Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie, Alanis gives her all to make one great CD.

I was drawn to this CD by listening to Thank U, and it is still definitely the best song on the whole CD. Some other really great songs are UR, which has a really rhythmical beat and sound to it, and Unsent, which has a really understanding mood to it. All the songs on the CD explore emotions and feelings, and they are insightful. Overall, it's a great CD, I would rate it as a A- or B+."},{"rating":"2","title":"will withstand the test of time","review":"I think Alanis' first album was overrated. It's not bad, but her voice was very grating, and a lot of the songs got old fast. Junkie is another story altogether. It's one of my favorite albums, and I can't see myself getting sick of it any time soon. Front Row, Baba, and Sympathetic Character are among my favorite songs, and every time I hear them I'm still stunned by how great they are. Considering how much better her music has gotten since the first album, I can't wait to hear what she comes up with next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audacious","review":"Following a multi-million selling album was always going to be tough, but the way in which Alanis Morissette followed Jagged Little Pill is shockingly audacious. On first play, SFIJ is almost unlistenable, certainly hard to take from start to finish. It's real stream-of-consciousness stuff, Front Row, Baba, Sympathetic Character are all pretty heavy-going at first. But it is thankfully tempered by the likes of That I Would Be Good, a simple but strangely endearing ballad, Thank U and UR.Not everyone's cuppa, this will disappoint the vast majority of Morissette fans picked up with Jagged Little Pill, but for those of us who like our female singer-songwriters a bit more cutting-edge, this is a surprisingly satisfying piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"People like her singing?","review":"There must be great hunger out there for something new and different because I find her vocal style absolutely grating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!

When I first listened to it, I never thought I would get through it! 17 songs is quite a bit for an album in my opinion. It was hard to take ownership in the songs at first for me, to really catch the fever, if you will\`. But after a few listens, Junkie caught fire for me. Alanis pretty much rocks and will continue to for me. But it would take a masterpiece and miracle for any album to outdo Jagged Little Pill"},{"rating":"2","title":"I told you, luv!","review":"She said she couldn't wait for Morissette's next album. I told her that the Jagged Little Pill was too good -- JLP was an excellent album and it's hard for wonderous Alanis to match it, let alone surpass it. My girlfriend got disappointed when she first listened to it. That same thing happened when she listened to JLP. But we liked at (loved it) after that. The same applies for this one. You won't like it at first, but you will later on (surely!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious","review":"I just pulled out this album after putting away Alanis for a long time. Infectious, thoughtful, and underrated are words that come to mind. Gone are the whiny accusations of Jagged Little Pill, replaced by melodic introspection.

Her second major album is no exception. On this CD, her songwriting is a little more melancholy as she talks about suicide and marital problems. However, the songs carry positive messages and just like Jagged Little Pill,convey her emotions without the use of cliches and recycled melodies. While not as stunning as JLP, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is still an amazing CD. My personal favorites were: \\"Baba\\" (an interesting tongue-in-cheek song which talks about \\"religious priests\\" taking money from people to \\"save\\" them), \\"Would Not Come\\", \\"So Pure\\", \\"Joining You\\" and \\"UR\\". It's definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly underrated!","review":"This album left me breathless! Alanis has done it again and personally i think this is better than her first, it never leaves my radio!

I am a HUGE Alanis fan and I'm only saying these horrible things about her CD because I think she (and you)_ outa' know. If your expecting her angry love songs expect something else. She dosen't scream about angry love or anything but about spirituality. And (no offense Alanis) spirituality isn't your thing. Her songs are terrible. There are maybe three good songs on the entire CD. I was really dissapointed. It was a major letdown.

The production by Glen Ballard is amazing and, imo, superior to the work he did on JLP. The Eastern sounds - especially the guitars are hypnotic and work so well with Alanis's lyrics.Hopefully SFIJ will be re-released and re-mastered one day (for it's 10th anniversary perhaps?) as it is the essential CD if you are an Alanis fan...start with JLP if you are a newcomer then come to this.

To those who have a problem with her and her music, too bad. (And to the doorknob D.J. guy - get over yourself.) Music means different things to different people and the depth of a certain musician can only be determined by the listener. For example, Bob Dylan is considered deep. Great. I can't listen to him, he grates on my nerves. But that doesn't give the right to bash his music to me or to anyone. It's a matter of taste. Alanis is cool. Her music speaks to me and I'm looking forward to the new release. You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the music is very powerful, and just as deep as the last cd.","review":"this cd is the best!! i saw her live at hammerstein ballroom, and she played a lot of this album, the music just got better and better, the first single, thank u is great and it just keeps going up the charts, this will not be on the shelves long when it comes out. there is not one repetitive note on the entire cd. grab it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as Jagged Little Pill.","review":"The first thing that I thought of when I heard this CD was Madonna. It seems that on some of the tracks Alanis is being heavily influenced by her boss. Then on others she seems to sound like Pheobe from Friends with some of the lyrics. The music is good but I just don't get some of these lyrics. All in all, I do like this CD. After all, I gave it 4 stars BUT I am an Alanis fan so maybe that's why. I would bye anything that she puts out even if it isn't the greatest thing. Jagged Little Pill is on tough act to follow but for her sophomore effort, it's pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis is finally coming into her own with SFIJ","review":"I really enjoyed Jagged Little Pill, and so did most of the general public. It was labelled 'different' and 'deep', with an edge that caused it to be a great mid-90's success. Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie will probably not be such a great public favourite. It is so much more personal than Pill, exposing facets of Morissette that were only hinted at in the first album. The style of music has also changed, leaning more to ominous, swirling Eastern melodies with extremely strong instrumental support. Lyrics are pure passionate poetry, and songs like \\"Can't Not\\" and \\"Joining You\\" will leave you emotionally uplifted. Listen to this CD as much as possible, think about the lyrics and it will grow on you like no other. My favourite album of the year, if not the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book","review":"This is a story about a slave girl named Amari who was torn from her family and her homeland and forced to become a slave in america. there she meets a girl named polly who is an indentured servant, they eventually break free and make a run for the spanish colony hoping for freedom but constantly being hunted.I have to admit I was bored during the 1st chapter, but as I kept reading I got more and more intruiged untill I just couldn't put the book down.

The plot and characters had depth and feeling difficult to find in today's young adult literature. Descriptions were well drawn. This book transported the reader to another time and place.Because of the themes and intensity of certain scenes I would not recommend this book for anyone much younger than 16.Issues of violence were generally handled well, but there were some sections of intensity that were very disturbing and descriptive. (Hence the 4-star rating.) Murder, infanticide, suicide, rape, and general brokenness are all present within the story.Despite the misery of the setting this tale is one of hope and endurance.

The screen motor is very quiet and I'm more than satisfied the picture quality, I watched Avatar to break it in. Both the wall mounted and remote control devices function flawlessly. Overall, a great value for the money spent. I would have given it 5 stars, but was very disappointed when getting ready to redeem the \\"free\\" projector screen mount rebate and saw that shipping and handling were $22.00.

It took less than 5 min on Amazon's website to request that the screen be picked up for return the next day. Problem was that Amazon had no more in stock, and they promptly refunded my money the next week. Very painless return experience! I ended up ordering the screen from another internet source & it arrived in good shape. Once up, I was very suprised at how nice this screen is for the money. It extends and retracts very smoothly (a bit slow) and looks great with my ceiling mount DLP proj.

Be warned! -to send it back, UPS wants to charge you half of what the screen costs. If I had to do it over again, I would run from these guys. There's a reason it's so cheap.

When I returned and opened the box I found that one mounting bracket on the end was bent, and the body of the projector had a fairly large dent that would prevent the screen from unrolling. Thats the problem with having such a large item shipped. At this point I figured it was too late to send it back. I bent the bracket back and pushed the dent out as best I could.

I just fool with older full size trucks from the 70's and 80's, so you can always count on the seat being badly worn especially on the driver side. These blanket type covers are always aggrevating to install with all the little strings or straps to route and tie off, so I expected some problems even before ordering this item. I knew I was screwed when the cover came out of the box in two pieces and there were precious few attached straps for attachment. The material is CHEAP, THIN, and like SANDPAPER.

Not only did the cover for the seat back not cover the back, it did not cover the front completely either. At least 4 inches of the seat back still shows below the cover on my 77 GMC. There are not enough ties in the box to put the cover securely on the seat or the seat back. The ones that are attached gave the feel the one should not pull them to tightly for fear of ripping the fabric. One of the most dissapointing products I have ever bought on Amazon.

It should have been a great book. The two main characters did have a lot of thought and feeling to them but it took over half the book to get them together. The first half she was trying for tension, but they only had a few conversations and not very long at that. When they did get together it was over done. They were instantly in love , as though they had been for quite a while. And the way they then spoke to one another. Darling this dearest that. It just didn't feel right. Mostly because there wasn't much interaction between them before they got together. I think the story itself was interesting in the fact there was a little mystery.

Morris Berman's The Twilight of American Culture hit me hard and I'm grateful for it. His vision of the immediate future is a downward spiral for the U.S. and for the \\"Americanisation\\" of the rest of the world. Yet he offers a perverse reassurance to those who quietly go about maintaining the values of the Enlightenment in their everyday lives and work. A thought provoking and stimulating read with a wealth of references."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twilight of American Culture","review":"This is book by Berman gives an interesting look into the declining American culture. Berman is essentially stating in this book that American culture is on its last leg and that we may soon (relatively) see a collapse in the current system we know. Berman compares the U.S to the Roman Empire in its final days. The similarities between the two great civilizations are interesting and give the reader something to think about.Interesting read, not too difficult, worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the time but.....","review":"I enjoyed Berman's book, but I did not find his conclusions to be particularly original or insightful.

He evidently takes pride in being pompous, looking down with a scowl on those he finds inferior, i.e. the populace at large. He derides multiculturalism because it infringes on the legacy of his favorite white male writers. I'm not someone to attack writers as pretentious, but Berman would wear the term with pride on a merit badge. I won't say that I didn't get anything out of this book, and altogether I agree with him on a number of things, much of this book is just the author spitting on people, with a few vague rants against corporations and the American political system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the exaggeration","review":"It is not doomsday. Are things really so different? 100 years ago america was mostly farmers. Does the author really believe that those people were educated and politically active? Probably most people couldn't read and would have loved to watch wrestling, drink frappucinos, and buy the enquirer if they were available in those days. The book is entertaining and I can agree with the author on many points, but I don't think that it is as bleak as he makes it seem. The difference between now and 100 yrs. ago is that the media gives us a lot more insight into the lives of the lower classes and this can create a distorted view of how america really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of claptrap","review":"okay Mr. Berman...we get the point that you had to memorize Browning in high school...This book is full of embarrassing, childlike rants (many of which counter each other) which do nothing to remedy the situation.

He does not demonstrate that he is a reliable source on the subject of thinking for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, but some caveat lectors.","review":"This is a thoughtful and literate book. The author is off in his understanding of Christianity (e.g. p. 81), he seems to make a religion out of literature, and may overstate economic concerns, though there is definitely injustice with the latter and the author is correct to address it. Still, there is much to benefit from in Berman's trenchant critique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodwill Twilight","review":"The book was exactly as described by seller.

In his essays, Gutierrez offers an unflinching and always engrossing view into the mind of a struggling artist who is constantly battling his own self-doubt and left-handed compliments from peers while clinging to those all-important words of encouragement from his mentors and family members. His short fiction gives us unvarnished glimpses into the lives of Chicanos who suffer from the same type of struggles except this time in their day-to-day attempts - often futile - to draw some meaning from life or even death. This is an essential book for Latinos who have taken that crazy, unreasonable step to become writers.

I guess if you read Connelly, you have to read his books in order.If you're interested in Michael Connelly, I highly recommend \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" and \\"The Poet,\\" which can be read without regard to his earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Plot that Plays With Your Psyche","review":"The MarginFrom the very begining you 'think' you know what is going to happen, but you will be wrong. Connelly tells his story, then he adds a twist then a turn. Complications occur at every turn, some anticipated, some not.Bosch is one of my favorite detectives (retired or not), he goes all the way, never leaves a stone unturned even when he KNOWS what's under it. Even when he knows it could be the last stone he'd turn. Along with the mystery, the wonderful characters and scenes is Bosch's signature personality trait that I find captivating; he's forever disturbed by the crimes people commit and that has left an indelible emotional scar right across his soul. He knows this about himself, but keeps on keeping on.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Poet is back with a vengeance","review":"Harry Bosch, now working as a private detective, is asked by the wife of his friend Terry McCaleb to look into Terry's death, which appears to be unnatural. The trail that Harry finds when going through Terry's files leads him into the desert of Nevada and into the hands of the FBI, who are unearthing a mass burial site of The Poet, the serial killer that featured in the book that made Michael Connelly world famous. Together with fallen-from-grace FBI agent Rachel Walling Bosch follows the trail of The Poet to a small brothel-town and from there to Los Angeles, all the time running into gruesome killings that are the hallmark of The Poet. The apotheosis of the book happens in the pouring rain. Another authentic Michael Connelly with all the features of a good detective book, but not as nail-bitingly exciting as some of his previous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's back!","review":"Great book! After reading \\"The Poet\\" (again), I wasn't expecting Harry Bosch in \\"The Narrows\\". He is my absolute favorite character in Connelly's books. I'm sorry to hear about another character (can't tell who until you read the book)that won't be coming back. This was very suspenseful...I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for Harry's next case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"The Narrows was an exquisitely crafted piece of work which kept me attached to my Kindle when ever possible over the last few days"},{"rating":"2","title":"In pursuit of a serial killer","review":"This thriller includes several whodunnits because of a number of murder victims. All are connected to the Poet, a serial killer. The intensity is there though the protagonists don't come too close to danger except for one particular point. There are touching moments Bosch has with his daughter. A good thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written but Rushed and Full of Dead Ends","review":"I read The Poet and was entralled by Connelly's plot, character development, and writing style. The Narrows, however, has none of the magic of The Poet. This novel seems rushed, and the \\"twist\\" or psuedo-captivating plot devices are second rate. I really like Connelly's writing style, and this novel captivates in that area. What happend to Jill? Why the flat, meaningless ending to the Terry McNabe case? What happened to the multi-faceted hypnotist angle for Bacchus? This novel has too many dead ends, and it smacks of being rushed to meet a publisher's quota."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Poet","review":"The Narrows is a satisfying sequel to The Poet that for me was better than the first book. It also introduced me to Harry Bosch, the defining character of Michael Connelly novels. The novel moves fairly straight-forward to its conclusion, which is satisfying, if not a little brisk. Eight years after the Poet disappears, a GPS is sent to FBI agent Rachel Walling. On the GPS, she finds coordinates to the location of many, many bodies, and so begins the final quest to stop the Poet once and for all.The Narrows just seemed to flow better, and it was easier to make sense of than the first novel. I found Walling to be a much more interesting character this time, and thought Bosch was more likable/sympathetic than Jack McAvoy of the first novel. However, it was insinuated that Jack might reappear in this novel, but it never happens.This is another good book from Michael Connelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connelly does it again","review":"As always, Michael Connelly delivers. Since the first two books I read by Connelly, I decided to read them in order of copyright date, thereby enhancing the continuity of Harry Bosch's life. This book is getting close to the end of Mr. Bosch's career.My favorite thing about all of the Harry Bosch novels is his three-dimensionality. We are allowed inside his head. There were times when I felt like shouting, \\"No, Harry! Dammit, control yourself and don't do that!\\" But as always, he gets himself into hot water, and manages to get out.For readers not familiar with this author, I respectfully submit that Michael Connelly delivers as much meaningful content in 200 pages as Clancy does in 450. There is not a single word of filler. I have also never read a book where the speaker moves from the third person to the first person back and forth from chapter to chapter.A totally enjoyable page turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent end","review":"While you read about the investigation of the Poet crimes written by McCaleb you won't be able to put the book down, but at the end of the book, when you will know how McCaleb died you will not believe it and of course will let many things into your imagination. Bosch's investigation is very good and it explains everything in the book, except why McCaleb went to the dessert alone, maybe we will know the answer in his next book.I give MC SIX stars for this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is good","review":"Great article in the May 9, 2004 NYT magazine about Michael Connelly. Glad he is finally getting his due. His attention to the details about the police officers is what makes the difference. The story is not so much about the crime and it being solved, but Harry Bosch, and how his job changes him and brings out more color on who he is and what makes him tick. Congratulations to MC, he is a great story teller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Connelly has been on a downhill slide since \\"Chasing the Dime\\". What was once interesting writing is now simply banal. Maybe the movie has gone to his head. I did not need to be constantly reminded of it in this book. Sort of like an actor breaking the fourth wall- a professional no no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and derivative","review":"Having been a longtime fan of most of Connelly's work, it is with some sadness to report that this novel does not add to his often stellar oeuvre. The Poet, an earlier serial killer marked by his menacing ingenuity, returns as a cut-out villain lacking smarts and a great degree of threat in this tired thriller. In what amounts to a reunion of sorts for prior Connelly characters, Harry Bosch seems too human and well-drawn to be occupying this world of caricatures and plot cliches. Connelly namechecks two other crime authors, George Pelecanos and Ian Rankin, who are both writing at a superior level at present. Check them out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not again","review":"This novel didn't really work for me. I just think it's like a dozen other novels that I've read. It brings nothing new to the table. Novels about serial killers have become a dime a dozen. You would think we have hundreds of serial killers based on the proliferation of them in crime novels. The other thing that strikes me as trite is that the serial killer is a former FBI agent. I have seen this done so many times that it makes me yawn, not to mention that it's horribly unrealistic. To my knowledge I am not familiar with any real like police officers who were also serial killers yet thriller novelists treat this as a normal occurence. The plot was trite and dull. I would advise to skip this one.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Poet's Back","review":"Robert Backus, former FBI agent turned serial killer who calls himself the Poet, is back, targeting FBI agent Rachel Walling. Harry Bosch gets into the action when he is asked to investigate the possible homicide of his friend, Terry McCaleb. Bosch begins going through McCaleb's files and finds information that leads him to the Poet. Together, Walling and Bosch join forces, against the FBI's wishes, and do their own investigating.Conelly's switch from first to third person throughout the book was a little distracting at first, but once I got used to it, I grew to like the style. Bosch seems like an old friend, and Connelly manages to keep the character interesting and fresh. Loved the connection Bosch has to his small daughter and the feelings he expresses about her.Another great book by Connelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Narrows","review":"Michael Connelly never fails to entertain.

The book was a thriller and it kept my interest, didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary potato chips","review":"These books, as mentioned in the title of this comment, is like literary potato chips. You don't get much out of the darker than the normal Connelly passages that this novel takes you through, but then again, you keep on reaching for that next page, much as you do another potato chip. And when you are done with the book and and realize that you also have an empty chip bag, there is that sensation of ennui."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another crappy installment from Connelly","review":"Please save your money and do not buy this book. Connelly's early books were researched, thought-out and well-written stories. His past 5-6 titles have been pure garbage. This one is a pathetic attempt to get back to those original titles by bringing back his best villain. The book sounds like it was written by a much weaker writer and is full of holes. I thought I would give him one last chance to see if he could recapture the strong elements of his early works but I am now giving up on this \\"author\\".

Or perhaps I was just in a bad mood. Let's call it the latter. In my case I felt uncomfortable in the setting of the novel Usually I'm comfortable anywhere he wants to take me (tunnels in Viet Nam, courtrooms, slums, dangerous situations), though I've never been there. The writing, as usual, is crisp and there is always some implied, vague threat in the air. Not my favorite, nor the most believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I've always looked forward to Connelly's latest, unfortunately, this one could have stayed on the shelf. He's starting to use cliches and plot devices in lieu of strong, believable characters and well thought-out plots. As he likes to point out in nearly every chapter, one of his books was made into a movie. A nice accomplishment, but this wasn't the place for self-promotion.As for the plot of 'The Narrows,' balancing a previously unknown, cute-as-a-button daughter with the hunt for an out-for-glory serial killer, and interest in a female FBI agent who is little more than a dumb-blond, only leads to BIG plot holes that don't create much energy for the story or a believable ending. Disapointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. I'm not an experienced reader of the Mystery genre and yet this book still felt like it was churned from a formula. The characters felt more like clichés than interesting people that I cared about. I'll stay away from any more books by Connelly and leave them for others to enjoy. Folks who had the same reaction as me may enjoy a great mystery by Michael Chabon titled: The Yiddish Policeman's Union."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more enjoyable than The Poet","review":"In Harry's second outing as a private eye, he's settled into the life a little more, the constant yearning for the badge tempered by his involvement with his young daughter. This goes by the wayside when he's asked to look into the death of a friend and goes toe to toe against a serial killing ex-FBI agent.This match against the Poet is more likable in that Harry and Rachel are more likable than Jack McEvoy is. Also, Harry seemed recharged by the prospect of going back to the LAPD. Good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Narrows","review":"Michael Connolly's books are always great. The Narrows was another of his success's. He introduces his characters in a way that you feel you've known them for awhile. I recommend his books to all my friends.

I was disappointed. Only When You're Lonely wasn't terrible... It was just a bit far-fetched and didn't grab me. Carter was a self-confident player in the beginning simply concerned about the $ signs and nothing else. He does a 180 and becomes smitten for Sam in a love-at-first sight episode that I couldn't connect with. Sure the feelings they had for one another were confessed...but it didn't seem real. Maybe because the story wasn't long enough? Who knows? Even the way Carter got caught up seemed fake. After this disappointing read, I barely gave the other two stories a chance before losing interest in the book. I wasn't a fan of Jihad's writing style and Roy Glenn's story was just filler.Dwayne, get with it again. I couldn't even believe you wrote this tiredness.

Not a big issue, but is very noticable when setting up or looking past a mic and down the boom.note: I tested the fittings with various equipment, and am positive that the female 5/8 thread on this (and the MY320 mic clip) is bad.

I like how I can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use, but then I can easily position for use with a generous 16 inch reach. Definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk, but a clamping mount works very well. The locking clutch is excellent, with a large nob and secure teeth. The smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient.

With the h's incredulous shyness and the assumptive and tiresome H I became very bored with this book and almost quit reading. This is my first book by C. Hern and it will be my last. Neither the H or the h had any traits to recommend them and the ending seemed rushed and to convenient. In all this book was boring and tiresome. The entire book was an internal struggle of the h overcoming her shyness to tell the H what she really wanted and the internal struggle of the H to, first physically desire the h and then to take it slow with her as to not scare her. This book made me what to scream at the characters to 'just open your mouth and say it da**it'. If you decide to pick up this book, i severely recommend you think twice. However if you do I hope you can get over the h and H's unlikeable characteristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"wimpy heroine, deus ex machina ending","review":"By and large I like Candace Hern's books, although occasionally she writes a clunker.In this book the characters are well-developed, but the heroine is a wimp. Why do all these women feel that being compromised even when they haven't done anything means they have to get married? How about telling society to take a flying leap instead. Then she continues being a wimp after she's married.The hero, although he supposedly believes in rights for women, is unable to treat his wife as an equal. This leads to a conflict at the end of the book. Is the conflict resolved by examination of his actions and principles? No, a solution falls from the sky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't do it for me.","review":"This was my first by Candice Hern, and regretably I was disappointed. I have read all of Nicole Jordan, Lisa Kleypas, Gaelen Foley, Sabrina Jeffries, and many more. This book didn't have any sexual tension to speak of. The hero was a sweet idiot and the heroine was a plain dowd. Not enough chemistry for me and quite frankly, not enough romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Terrible","review":"If you are in the mood for a book that's utterly terrible, this is the one for you. The hero is, for want of better description, a moron. The heroine is a ditzy dowd who has nothing better to do than act pathetic and moon over a man who doesn't notice her. The entire novel elicits nothing more than a yawn. This is one of the worst romances I've read in quite some time--the characters weren't even likeable and the entire plot was a blend of boring and pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dull","review":"I saw the pretty good reviews of this book and expected a lot, consequently I kept reading expecting it to pick up, but it just didn't. Nick was basically a jerk; he (and this is a bad thing) seemed like an unnecessary character. He didn't have much depth and was annoying as was Pru whose shyness didn't disolve until about page 330. I couldn't take anymore blushing or stamering. The entire novel lacked quality dialogue/conversations. Finally, there seemed to be no basis for Pru's love for Nick and when he started to love her I just didn't understand how they could love each other and didn't believe it was possible in the way the novel was written. Basically this book was torturous to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Book","review":"This is my first book from this author..... And it wont be my last.

Took me over a week to read it, unlike my 5 star books, that make me not cook, not eat, not clean the house, till the book is done. It was not that kind of book. But it was good enough that I will check into her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one from Hern","review":"Candice Hern write such great books! You always take the characters seriously, even as you laugh and sympathize with them.

In this case, it was written before the US Trust acquisition and before he gave up the co-CEO role. It was also written at the beginning of the long, painful downturn following the crash of the NASDAQ that has hurt Schwab as much as anyone.I can't wait to read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"Business writer John Kador describes the evolution of Charles Schwab & Company, a former discount brokerage blessed with the ability to transform itself through four different incarnations. Kador emphasizes Schwab's commitment to integrity and customer service, a code that enabled it to prevail despite upheavals and threats. While the book focuses on the company, the running portrait of Chuck Schwab gives it a personal core. Kador highlights Schwab's concern with exercising his values and leading a highly principled business amid an often shady industry he saw as corrupted by greed. Kador's engaging narrative style is designed to inform and entertain general investors, executives and managers. At times, the discussion of Chuck Schwab and his company sounds almost too laudatory, as if the book is an in-house publicity piece. We from getAbstract recommend that readers should take all that sugar with a grain of salt, given this otherwise compelling dish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corporate Thriller","review":"This is an excellent business book&#65533;part personality profile, part corporate history and part industry analysis. It&#65533;s the story of the rise of the discount brokerage industry as created by Charles Schwab and the mavericks who worked for his eponymous company. It&#65533;s a fascinating story filled with interesting characters and more twists and turns than the latest Patterson thriller. Along the way, it delivers some worthwhile commentary about management and leadership and how companies rise and fall. Kador bases his narrative on pre-published sources, then livens it up with quotes and anecdotes from a large number of sources. The result is an easy-to-read (and occasionally humorous) book that just about succeeds in providing a &#65533;fly on the wall&#65533; record of the inside politics and personalities of the firm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"I chose this rating because this story has action, romance and chivalry.

This movie provides us with a look at a relationship when lack of trust gets in the way. We see in this movie a Kent (Jason Weaver) who is not surrounded by temptation but is sent temptation (Mandy played by Caryn Ward) . The movie did a good job of showing us that not all of us are the same. I like how the movie let Kent's friend (played by Carl Payne) be the friend who always keeps it real with his homeboy. The movie kept it real and showed that Kent came very close to loosing to temptation. Kent's girlfriend (Gabrielle Dennis) must work on getting her man back. The movie reminds us that we all make mistakes but without forgiving relationships don't work.

The third member, Bill Lyall, succumbed to complications from AIDS several years back. Leaving a whole new lineup that does not even sound remotely like the original one, not musically or in content.

Again, Livesey has proven that she is one of the cleverest authors of this time. The disturbing and haunting images that she concocts through her writing stimulate the reader's mind long after having finished the novel. I recommend all of Livesey's books most highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 10 year old who is too calculating","review":"Homework is an interesting novel thanks to Livesey's skills as a writer. She gets deeply into her narrator, but her narrator is not, intrinsically, a particularly interesting person. The novel had less resonance for me than it might have, because I had difficulty believing the 10 year old character could be so coldly calculating, so in control of her emotions in playing the loving step daughter while plotting to get rid of the interloper. The narrator's friends are quick to see thru her fickle first boyfriend, but cannot accept that her step daughter could be such a major problem; I wish this point had been made without making the step daughter as fiendish as she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good but could have been much better","review":"An excellent reference for the studio photographer. However I feel that the info on each lighting lacks crucial information, such as light ratios. If you have five different light sources it's crucial to know which is the main one and what its intensity is in relation to the others. Since these books are about the lighting and nothing but the lighting, I feel that such details should be in there. It would also be nice to know something more about the darkroom and/or the digital post production of the shots, because the effects in the shots are only partially created by the lighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD BUT NO CIGAR","review":"This was a good book if you already know alot about lighting. The problem is this that it doesn\`t talk about lighting it just shows you examples. Doesn\`t say why you put this light here and what effect it has on the film. I do say though it is worth it to add it to your libary if the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have come up with something better","review":"This best is great if you want to see other photographers photographs and how they lit there pictures (but not in detial). It does not talk about lighting. It just gives examples. You can learn more doing tests yourself. This is a good book for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful introduction to the music and poetry of Spain","review":"On my last trip to Spain, a friend gave me this CD as a present. I could not imagine how much I was going to treasure it! The singer, Clara Montes, has a beautiful voice; the music is varied and beautiful, from salsa to Sevillanas and slower, mellower rhythms. But the lyrics constitute the most precious jewel in this CD. They were written by the Spanish poet Antonio Gala and they're truly exquisite.

However, since this is one of the greatest bands ever, I did it. Now, I have to admit, that I do like \\"Beware of the Dog\\" better. Beware of the Dog is much more rock'n'roll and honky tonk. This album is definitely more country alternative. However, the brilliant lyrics just make it so beyond your standard alternative country fare. If you want a good \\"sippin'\\" album, this is it. If you want a good \\"chuggin'\\" album, seek \\"Beware of the Dog.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"If you want to purchase a good video with alot of parrot species in it, grab Parrots, Look Who's Talking.

I could drop them off the 2nd story building with no damage. AMAZING.However, a loss of one star because when I went to open the case the first time, the zipper pull loop broke, haha. So one of my cases has the wrist strap as a zipper pull and the other does not. Still a fantastic item.Stuff that wasn't considered:Threw out the screen protectors because I didn't need them (already had some) and the stylus just sits in my electronics area so when I'm too lazy to take the stylus out of the 3ds I just reach for the one that came with this bundle."},{"rating":"1","title":"NintendoDS 3 In 1 Bundle, Pink","review":"Nintendo DS 3 In 1 Bundle - PinkWorks okay - color was good, casing will keep DS safe from harm.

Case is so small that it requires effort and maneuvering from adults to close the case once DS Lite is inside the case forget about young kids. I am sure if I had allowed my 6 year child to use this case then he would have dropped his game before he would have closed the case. You want to buy a case to protect your game system and not to put at risk. Don't know how much would be hit on margin if the company would have made this case only 1/2 inch bigger than what it is right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Win Craft sports keg grill","review":"This grill is constructed poorly and the directions are lousy. The handles are made of Bakelite and are an integral part of the grill. The legs snap into the handles and fold up to hold the lid on. When we tried to fold the legs up for carrying the handle broke in three pieces.I made a temporary repair so we could use it that day for a game. The propnae tank I bought that they recommended did not work with the regulator they supplied, however, I did use another cylinder I had and that worked. When you fold the handles down to use the grill there is a good chamnce you will not get them in the slots completely and the grill will colapse while using it. I contacted [...] who was selling the grill on Amazon.com asking them for a new handle. They wanted me to pack up the broken handle and ship it to them. I don't have time for that. Their customer service is lousy like the grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY SHOULD BE GIANTS","review":"I can understand why these guys have not found mass success. They're far too good to go up that road. But I'm baffled why Ward Dotson & Company have not garnered any more ink in alternative circles.On the Liquor Giants' first (now OOP) album seven years ago, they were the missing link between Alex Chilton and The Replacements. They have since evolved into a group that has displayed originality even as it wears its 60's influences on its sleeve. Having since covered songs by mid-period Kinks, the Bobby Fuller 4, Del Shannon and Dusty Springfield among others, the Giants on their latest create layered songs that conjure up Brian Wilson, The Move, UK flowerpop and even T. Rex without sounding the least bit derivative. Treat yourself to some original beautifully-crafted three minute poptunes.And for God's sake, someone release this in the United States!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner!","review":"I received this radio at a bargain price about 3 weeks ago and I love it.

He sounds like he's whining! His songs are all boring, too! He's only famous because girls all over America think he's \\"hot.\\" That doesn't matter at all when the CD is playing and you can't actually look at him.

Unfortunately, this movie does not seem to care much about the viewer's patience: to watch the experiences of a young guy in the world of pottery for two hours seems to be too much. The story goes about a young canadian fellow who - after his father's death which affected him to the point of attempted suicide - goes to Japan to visit an uncle with the hope to recover from his depression. There, he starts working with his japanese uncle in pottering. And that's about it. From then on, the movie drags eternally. Probably, there's a great deal of profound ideas in the movie, but I did not get any since I was so bored that - to be honest - I almost fell asleep. Two stars for the photography, the locations and Tatsuya Fuji(the uncle), the same actor from EMPIRE OF THE SENSES and IN THE REALM OF PASSION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good kiln shots","review":"Kamataki has a \\"Karate Kid does pottery\\" feel to it.

The pronounciation was laid out in the beginning of the book, but I kept having to refer back which was annoying.

Karen, a fledgling investigative reporter is one of the most charming and plucky heroines I've come across in a long time -- her family reminds me of Janet Evanowich's Stephanie Plum's. Bottom line: Lawrence Light has accomplished what every thriller reader wants: a can't-put-it-down pace; memorable characters; a twisty plot; and what only experts in one's field can pull off, in this case a behind the scenes look at the world of financial intriegue and enormous wealth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I work for the struggle, i don't work for dough","review":"One of the most engaging, well written albums I've come across in quite some time.

This book however, did not make me think differently or in new and enlightend ways. The book is a mock religious text written from the point of view of Ready Freddy and in all his drunken stupor he fills his diciples with philosophy. The author had a really good concept and a great character in Ready Freddy but he let his own religious angst get in the way of what could have been a finally tuned concept. The book also contains 50 pages of binary coding which looks cool but it is frustrating to the reader. This book is very much written in the same style as Elitist was so if experimental writing is your thing, dive in, if not, try Dan Brown:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Purdy, you'll love this!","review":"Bill Hartston is not only a strong chess player, he's also a smart and erudite writer. This book is a gem, and is perfect for the kinds of players who admire the writings of C.J.S.Purdy for their practical wisdom. This book has that wisdom, and its format makes it easy, and a delight, to use. Hartston positively encourages the reader to dip into it in any order, although it's also designed to be worked through as a course; it's a goldmine of ideas and advice that's also fun browsing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book Gets old","review":"I couldn't put the book down in the beggining of the book.

Barrett has admitted that he and his wife Anne hatched the scheme out of a genuine need for money. Of course Shirley Harrison, who provided the narrative, and the publishers agent deny Barrett's claims, and appear to be without guilt. There is a web site (do a Ripper search and you'll stumble upon it) that has an open letter by Mike Barrett detailing the whole sordid affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Boss, Don't buy this if you want to know who I am.

By looking at the basic evidence in the JtR case it is obvious that this is a fake. Factor in that the guy who \\"discovered\\" it admitted it was a hoax, and hopefully no one else will waste their money on this. From the beginning of this read to the end, it smelled suspiciously of doo-doo. For a weekend armchair quarterback Jack the Ripper fan, it's a below-average read."},{"rating":"2","title":"KidKraft Train Table","review":"I bought the train table for a library. On Amazon, the table came with a train set. However, when it arrived there was no train set. I called the third party vendor and they would not honor adding the train set. I have had to spend additional money to get a train. The other issue is that the table does not have enough support to withstand young children who may climb on it. We are having to add additional support ourselves for the level of use it will receive in a public space. It would probably be fine in a home with supervision without additional support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut My Baby's Face","review":"My husband and I purchased two of these carriers for a backpacking excursion we were taking with our 7 month old twins.

First of all I got blue instead of bleach which I would have known if I had read more reviews or the description more closely. Second the blue doesn't work at all. I never had red rings with the clorox tablets, but the blue flush n sparkle does NOTHING for it. I still have to clean the toilet weekly to get rid of the ring...just as if I had nothing in the toilet.I bought 4 of these and 1 wouldn't work with 1 of the toilets (which is, ironically, also fluidmaster) so I continue to use Clorox in that one.I like the fact that this isn't mucking up the stuff in the toilet basin, but it isn't keeping the bowl clean either."},{"rating":"2","title":"herbal solutions for health issues","review":"Excellent book from a very qualified writer.

His mistakes begin at the tone: he places the cartoon heroes into a hyper-realistic setting, and it suffocates them. Stripped of its fantasy, the film tries to tell the most story with the least possible activity, and the result is forced, hurried, and often difficult to swallow (the newscasters always drop major plot points at the perfect moments). The cast is lost without Hugh Jackman: he's wound tight enough to snap, yet his eyes convey a sensitivity he tries to repress. The rest of the cast is mostly scenery, particularly the curiously silent villains, and Halle Berry's Storm is a testament to bad casting. The film has the feel (and look) of a TV pilot, telling the first chapter and nothing else, and marred greatly by poor effects and a letdown ending. If nothing else, we leave the film feeling the filmmakers were only half-trying. Features Anna Paquin, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, and a miles-away Famke Janssen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damm good movie","review":"Another well made remake of classic comic books.

But this DVD release of 1.5 was a total waste of time and money. I expected to see many things that they didn't have time for in the original film, but the deleted scenes were a complete joke. Some were just a 10 second addition, others a different angle (of the same scene), and some were essentially the same garbage as from before.The only positive for this DVD is the behind the scenes shots of when they were making the movie. But these were all previously released on home television on the Entertainment Channel's \\"Behind the Scenes\\" show when the film hit the theaters.Bottem line: If you like the film, buy the original and save yourself at least five bucks.

But the movie is great and the quality is excellent. Some reviewers have said this was just a publicity stunt and what not...I believe it somewhat is for its price since most of the special features featured clearly show why it was not in the original X-Men DVD - its quality lacks in expectations.Since I am a hardcore fan, I will give it 4 stars, since it did not met my expecations. The high 4 stars is for the movie. If you are a hardcore fan like me, get it.

You CAN use an Alkaline battery, but only if you are very careful. The battery compartment is not well-built and not made for changing batteries. It was designed for rechargeables.

Its veracity is undeniable. The cases cited are convincingly presented, and the author gives a fair picture when presenting those situations. Although this work primarily revolves around African aid, other examples are presented to demonstrate the pervasiveness of his premise. If Michael Maren is wrong, why isn't Africa out-producing the world's top food producers? After all, we've been \\"saving\\" Africa for decades now. I would think they should be totally self-sufficient at this point. Unless of course, Maren's premise is correct: refugees and starving children are big business. So big, in fact, that we may need standing armies to help rescuers inflict their aid upon the needy! This work is a bit tedious in places and does more than prove its point. Other than that, I recommend it to those who can handle the hard and disturbing truth about aid programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"How trustworthy","review":"I got through the first chapter of this book and then realized there are no sources or citations for the information in this book.

The Road to Hell and Graham Hancock's Lords of Poverty are unfortunately too morally indignant and sensationalist to be of practical value. I was witness to much of what Maren wrote about in Somalia. Yes, it was a mess, but his gonzo style and cavalier tone does not begin to give a revealing picture of what was happening, the options available and the subtexts. When I tried to contact Maren by email to clarify certain points on which he wrote erroneously he never responded. It's too bad. International assistance is an extremely important issue, one that many of those involved are constantly seeking ways in which to improve their performance and the value of their efforts. I don't think there are many who are involved in the field would say that they are happy. Still, Maren is just too flippant to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inciteful and Informative","review":"I really liked this book. It gives alot of first hand accounts of the problems with international aid. It is a fast read, and isn't \\"academic\\" like so many of the other books you see on the subject of international development.

Maren takes on that most sacred of cows: famine relief.

Like the other reviewer I followed the directions meticulously while putting it together and found no extra parts. If I did it wrong, the directions are bad. Tightening temporarily fixes it but it soon loosens up again. The tow hook does not unroll very easily either and my son often needed help. In spite of the problems it did get a lot of use.

These two film scores feature Steiner's musical strong points: blaring intensity when the action calls for it, occasional sentimentality, and a few lighthearted, jaunty melodic lines. The films are wonderful (Treasure is an undying classic), and the scores hold together remarkably well as performance pieces.

After all that, we put our DVD player, VCR, Cable box and xbox on the shelves (DVD and cable box were centered between the 2 shelves). In the middle of the night, we heard a loud bang. Both of them had fallen down. Nothing was damaged, except a tiny ding on the wall that was eaisly fixed. My husband got some industrial strength velcro and put it on the tiny legs that rest on the back of the TV. It's been over a month now and we haven't had any problems since.

Continuing to write in the same continuity but about different characters (and on his way to fleshing out a compelling, living universe), Chasm City is really cool. It's about a settled planet where the civilization's extensive use of medical and mechanical nanotechnology goes bad when a virus called the Melding Plague corrupts both building and through the medical nanos, people. A lot of umm political/class inequality stuff in here, a lot of cool scientific considerations handled quite well, and a good read. If you like hard SciFi (ie Benford, Brin, Egan) you'll like this. I'm not sure if I like it as much as Revelation Space, but they're books with different intent. I hope he keeps at it, and am waiting for free time to start reading the sequel to Revelation Space, Redemption Ark. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Chasm City. Reynolds wove quite an interesting tapestry, balanced between three storylines. Reynolds has a gift, which I witnessed first in Revelation Space and again in Chasm City, for making multiple seemingly unrelated storylines merge seamlessly to create a believable and enthralling plot.My only complaint would perhaps be that the novel ends with a sort of forced cleanliness. Everything seems to fall into place a little too easily, with nearly everything explained. A little mystery at the end of a novel never hurts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Revelation Space","review":"I liked this book much better than I liked Revelation Space: the story is tighter, less convoluted, and less cluttered with subplots.Here we follow one person, Tanner, and one plotline, even though fhis lashbacks and hallucinations give us hints of events in the past. I think that Mr Reynolds pulls that off pretty well, albeit barely. It could be a very cumbersome story, but it flows quite well. Only the cause of the machine plague does not ring believable, and could be better incorporated into the story: for example as a failed weapon against the grub-eaters. The story did hold my full attention to the end. Reynolds tries to emulate Ian Banks in this story, but does not quite make it. However, even a near success is a success when you compare with Banks Culture stories.The degenerate society of Chasm City upper levels and the calculated evil of Hausmann are, in my opinion, very well developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Places to Visit","review":"A great trip to exotic places.

It's fairly well written; you'll feel the unshakeable low-grade despair of the characters in your gut. And there's a set piece involving a space elevator that--I must admit--is pretty darn cool.But ultimately there was nothing here to hold my interest. The plot is nothing special: I've seen essentially the same plot in more entertaining works. The setting felt a little flat, or maybe contrived. I found the characters unsympathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SF of the Year","review":"If you love intelligent science fiction and space operas,this book is for you.

Good work Mr.Reynolds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat ideas, absurd characters","review":"Chasm City embodies the stereotypes most people have about space opera to an almost embarrassing degree. There are Big Sweeping Vistas and Millenia-Old MacGuffins; there's also an entire cast of characters crafted from the finest cardboard. Every one of them, including the main character, behaves like a James Bond villain. This makes it really rather difficult to give a damn what happens to them, so in the end this was a chore to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epically Mediocre","review":"This HUGE book has some decent moments, but eventually collapses under its own weight in the end.The main character ends up with at least 3 personalities running around in his head... and that's just the beginning of the confusion - by the final scene, it gets to be just too much, and becomes ludicrous, to the point of basically ruining this long book (~700 paperback pages).It is too bad really, because the book stands up well technically - it just tries to do too much in terms of plot twists.CHASM CITY (2001) provides more in-depth background for the REVELATION SPACE series(it was the 2nd book written, but takes place in time before the first book from the series); but, to be honest with you, I'd recommend you skip this one, and move straight on to the first book in the series, REVELATION SPACE (2000) as there is plenty enough explanation of Chasm City there."},{"rating":"1","title":"His other books are great, this one is terrible","review":"I loved House of Suns, and Revelation Space (the previous book in this series) wasn't bad.

Then, there is the inconsistency of Tanner, the hard guy, being beaten up by a couple of monks, and a few pages later he is kicking the ... out of a professional thug with \\"a neck like my thigh\\".

For all the talk of a plague, we only come face to face with a real victim only once! Furthermore, the \\"centuries-old atrocity that history would rather forget\\" is a real disappointment.The meat of this book is about the main character trying to recover his identity. With its introverted focus, everything going on around the character is mere sideshow. It is puzzling that with such a promising concept Reynolds chose to write a drama of the mind and little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"could do with out atleast a hundred pages of this book","review":"Chasm City turns out to be an okay book in the last quarter if you are patient enough to reach there; I almost gave up after 100 pages or so b/c the plot is so ordinary and unengaging.

The writing in this book is very childish and seemed like something of child living out his fantasies. The main character is portrayed to be something of a cross between Rambo and Macgyver with the supposed charm and character of James Bond. Corny lines and a plot which seemed very contrived and padded out there was literally only smalls sections of this book which kept me interested but it still seemed more interesting then watching the scenery pass by on the train although I am not so sure now.

I tend to give anything that so much effort has been put into the benefit of the doubt. It desperately needs that doubt in order for me to see even a flicker of imagination in its careful categorization of The Spirit of Evil, Master Crooks, Minor Crooks, Murderers...In each case, the book maintains a shocked, Victorian distance from the subject matter, and lingers on each text only long enough to persuade the reader that indeed, the subject is very naughty and deserves jail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"Bought these - but they were too short.

The upload speed is about that of serial cable and there are no features at all. The worst thing (ok, I knew about this one) is that it doesn't take 128MB SM cards.

There were a lot of things I enjoyed about it and a few that more or less left me frowning and shaking my head.

This is a book on the cosmogenic ( pertaining to the branch of astronomy dealing with the origin and history and structure and dynamics of the universe) beliefs of the Druids. The author uses the Gundestrap cauldron and Coligny Calendar as his archaeological template for his theory and this seemed a fascinating enough premise when I picked up the book. However learned the author is, though, some of the arguments are so interrelated, going from point A to B to C, etc., that I was often lost at the connections. It was with great reluctance I abandoned this book 2/3 of the way through. I wanted to like this book, I really did. There is something romantic about the notion that I could look at constellations just a little like the Druids might have, but the read was too thick to churn through to find the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printing mistake destroys readability","review":"Would love to read this book but the font is like 5 point font!

AT&T; tech support, after several calls and several technicians, all say that 3Com is giving me misinformation. Several people, in fact all that i spoke with at AT&T;, said that the 3Com modems are junk and strongly (yet unofficially) advise ANY other brand of cable modem. Some also added that 3Com's other network gear is no longer a qulity purchase.All told, I spent (money) on the modem, ... dollars calling tech support at 3Com, and (money) on a service visit from AT&T; to tell me that my 3Com modem doesnt work.

Initially the status light was a steady red, indicating that it could not sync to the cable, and I was unable to register it through sas.r2.attbi.com (which I also tried to do over a separate dial-up modem). ATT scheduled a technician to come next week. I decided to try inserting an attenuator in the line, and voila! everything now works.

Finally one of the tech supporters knew what to do: Simply register the cable modem at their online site...Make sure you register your computer with your current modem, then register your 3com modem. If you don't reg your 3com modem at that site, you'll get slow speeds (~100k instead of 1.5M). Like I said, the only trouble I had getting this modem set up was with attbi's tech support.

Even checked my bandwidth with a 2-wire check and it came back at 141k.

I contact 3COM who tells me this is a pretty old modem and suggests that the ISP download the latest firmware 3.2.20, Hey I understand that, one problem, The ISP cannot communicate with the modem and 3com tells me only the ISP can down load the firmware, I can't even send it to 3com to be downloaded, they don't know how.Lesson learned, Price does matter, spend a few bucks more and stay within the tech curve.

However, when I connected the modem and computer through the USB ports as instructed, there was no Internet (Windows XP didn't recognize the device). Strangely, when I connected my computer and the device via an ethernet adapter, it worked great.

Eventually I demanded to speak to a Tier2 tech and explained that this is a 3Com CMX modem and that it *IS* on their approved list. Finally, they realized it needed a firmware upgrade. Once this was done, the modem synced up within 30 seconds and got its IP address. Everything works great. Getting approx 1500/500 on DSLReports speedtest and over 350k/s to some sites.

One of the premises of the book is that Christians can become demon possessed. I have never found any biblical basis for this train of thought. To believe what is said in this book you would have to believe that Christians can be possessed. This book uses fear to pressure people into thinking there is some kind of 'formula' to gain a 'higher level' of freedom. The bible teaches a simple message of grace which is commit your life to Christ(Romans 10:9&10)and freedom in Christ is a gift of God.

Anderson cuts through the psycho-babble and strikes at the roots.John 10:10 tells us that the thief comes to kill, to steal and destroy. Anderson shows us how to see his nefarious plan for what it is, and to deal with it by the power of Jesus Christ.I enjoyed very much the love and tenderness for people with which Anderson speaks. It undergirds the entire book. Love is a powerful weapon that we weild against the forces of darkness. Serving God's people seems to be Anderson's motivating force.At the same time, his no-holds barred, take no prisoners approach to the darkness and bondage leave no room for doubt.This book is powerful.

I admit that there is much good in this bok, but it is tangled up with so much questionable stuff. Overall, it goes downhill, confusing many issues such as demon oppression/possesion of the Christian/non- Christian. There is a lot of poor exegesis here as he proof-texts his way into showing that Christ has given us all of his authority over Satan (Amoung many other things, most are wrong!). Also, the whole idea of having to pray an individual prayer for freedom from individual sins sounds a too much like a magical spell book! ... should be read after Powlison's excellent book, Power Encounters."},{"rating":"1","title":"at times unbiblical and troubling, Neil needs a bible review","review":"This book may help some people, but mislead and hurt others.

This is not to suggest that it can NEVER be a spiritual problem, but rather that it is not the problem as frequently as he suggests. He gives anecdotal evidence based upon his counseling sessions which appears to be more hypnotic suggestion than examples of spiritual warfare.The two killers for me with this book were the Scripture wrested from its original context, and the chapter-by-chapter advertisements for his other books to those readers who wanted to go deeper.It is also perhaps very telling that no one who is anyone endorsed this book or offered to write the preface for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh","review":"I bought it bu dont recall reading it, so I guess it was a dud,I cannot recall any of it so it went right into goodwill bin,,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary book","review":"I have been through a year and a half of pastoral counseling for a mental disorder as well as secular psychotherapy.

In his chapter on how to treat your disorder he has the reader recite prayers that deal with evil spirits and demonic possessions. He also believes that relaxation practices such as yoga are evil. I am a very spiritual person and get my strength from God, but not in this way. I do not believe that I am possessed by demons or under the influence of demons and I certainly do not want to think of my mental disorder as being that way.

However, this book was a big disappointment. I do believe that demons do exist, however, the author seems to believe that you are possessed by demons galore and any and all of your problems come from them. The cure for any malady is apparently to exorcise the demon responsible. However there is little, if any mention of self-responsibility here.

It gives very specific information on the different \\"styles\\" of homeschooling, loads of resources, and best of all you get to read about real homeschooling families, how they do things and why.

But boy, was I pleasantly surprised! This is a true little gem. I have thru hiked the Muir Trail from north to south and found this book is very informative and containing some very useful information. The maps are adorable and hand-drawn, but highly accurate. The book is not marketed as being geared towards novices, but there's no doubt it would benefit a beginner and be less beneficial to a seasoned backpacker. But even old pros with be delighted with the format and presentation here.There are route descriptions of each facet of the trail, such as explaining the drop off points, elevation gains and topography of Thousand Island Lake in Mammoth to Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite. You could do a thru hike without this guide, but if you're the least bit apprehensive, then this would ease your worries.

I bought a gallon of the Nature's Miracle Orange Oxy because the original NM always worked pretty well and I hoped the \\"orange\\" part would help discourage future visits by disgruntled cats.The Orange Oxy doesn't seem to kill the odor nearly as well as the original NM, and it leaves the surfaces with sort of a sticky/slippery residue that's really unpleasant.

This book doesn't need to be read in order. Start with his intro, and then read them in the order that makes sense to you. He even has a suggestion for deciding on how to go through the book.

He was at practically all the major scenes of the European WWII theatre. Von Luck tells his tale well and, despite the subject, with some humour. He has good philosophical thoughts. There were however a few things which annoyed and puzzled me a bit. Hans von Luck stays clear of more detailed descriptions of the fighting actions. He describes them in the same fashion as he describes his visits to his friends in Paris.A bit casual and cool, as if fighting in sub sub sub zero temperasture in Russia is not worth much more description than the casual remark about the purchase of wine. He keeps his distance and stays cool. As he is always an officer and a gentleman he gets more and more a one-dimensional, fictional, person. In the end I wondered whether it were memoires or a bad screenplay. Albeit this, the book is highly recommendable for an insight in the German army."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written, extremely informative","review":"This book provides a rare glimpse at the war from the german soldier's viewpoint. It covers the beginning of the war, Russia, North Africa, D-Day, and the fall of the Riech. It also provides an interesting account of the life of a captured german soldier in the years following the end of the war. You can definitely see why Colonel von Luck is quoted and referenced in many works on WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine book by a fine soldier","review":"I have just about finished reading this book, but I feel that it is one of the best books on war memoirs that I have ever read (although admittedly I haven't read that many). Hans von Luck takes us through his experiences with the calm detachment of one who is at peace with himself and has come to terms with the many harsh circumstances in which he found himself. There isn't any gory detail or horrifying imagery to this work, so blood-and-death fans would probably be bored with it, but I find that it's a fascinating account form the 'other' side. It would be hard to find another soldier who had the breadth of experiences that Hans von Luck had, or had met the number of important people, for example Rommel, vom Manteufel, Jodl, Kesselring etc. as he did. I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in stories of WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most excellent","review":"The absolute best WW2 book I have ever read, excellent for anyone interested in armor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panzer Commander a fine book from Amazon","review":"A well written interesting account of WW2 German tank opperations as seen thru the eyes of a disciplined couragous man with high moral standards and a keen sence of fairness to all.

A realist account at all times explaining why they lost even though they had the best weapons and training."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB BOOK","review":"I was dissapointed to see the negative reviews of this book and felt compelled to defend it. Panzer Commander is indeed a splendid book. It is very interesting and full of insight. Yes, the book is not crammed full of horrorific imagines like Forgotten Soldier. I suspect most of these critics are couch-potatoe, civilians looking for pulp-gore to quell thier bloodlust. I would highly recommend this work to anyone interested in an axis perspective of WWII by a German Officer of obvious honesty and integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panzer Commander reviewed","review":"Colonel van Luck comes across as a very professional soldier who experiences both war and relative peace in every major German theatre of World War II. Yet he also comes across as a very human person who can empathize with his enemies and in the Russian campaign even have his troops share food with Russian women and children. His later experiences as a Russian prisoner of war are very enlightening and even give some insight to the current corruption problems the Russians are having in coming to grips with a free enterprise economy. I give this book at least 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The human side of war","review":"I found this book to be similar to stories told to me long ago by a member of the panzerwaffe whose fate was almost identical. The book itself is more of a human perspective and greatly omits the horrors surrounding a mechanized war fought in the blazing deserts of Africa and the snow blasted plains of Russia. The book underscores how one can get caught up in duty and have their whole life changed. It was interesting, enjoyable, humorous and shows that sometimes the only way through a terrible ordeal is with dedication to duty and a good sense of humor. I salute Heer Von Luck for many hours of enjoyment. It brought me back to a time when I was a child sitting listening to war stories told by one of his commrades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the car survive?","review":"Here is a book from the German viewpoint by a professionalsoldier without the usual apologies. However, I was sorelydisappointed in this book. It is bland and completely devoid of any details regarding tactics, battles, relationships with his men, his fiance, etc. I do not dispute the Col. Luck was an exceptional soldier but his memoirs are very unexceptional. The prose is awkward and does not make for easy reading (may be lost in the translation). After while, I became more concerned with whether his Mercedes would withstand the travel from Germany to Poland to France to Russia to Germany again. I would pass this book by.

Either it's \\"too apologetic\\" for some people or people will think their are hiding the atrosities of the war. Without having a preconcieved notion of what he should or should not of written, I found this book to be a brilliant read that keeps the human side of the war and avoids the politics. From the snows of the Russian front to the dessert of north Africa, Luck gives you a feel for what it was like and the relationships he had with his men and fellow officers. I wish the book was longer and spent more detail on the actual combat and a considerable portion of the book deals with his postwar captivity. For avid military buffs who enjoy reading about tactical maneuvers with numbers and strategy this book is not for you.

A sure sign that little but dates and names would be learned. Against my better judgement I bought this book because there are so few memoirs of the war from the German side. This entire book amounted to little more than a travel memoir. The war actually sounded like a hell of a good camping trip. Mr. von Luck managed to reveal nothing of himself. Did he even see anyone die? Is there not one iota of anger in his skull? Is this guy human? Come on Hans, why did you hold back? History wants to know. If you want the antidote to this book, read Paul Fussell's \\"Wartime\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"historical memoir at its worst","review":"Don't be misled by the high ranking reviews.

If you want to listen to the master at his best, get his recording of the Beethoven and Mendelssohn violin concertos with Furtwangler and the BPO. If you want to hear the best recording available of the Bach concertos, listen to the Salvatore Accardo version with The Chamber Orchestra of Europe. But I digress...the sound quality on this CD is poor, with a muffled sound quality, the players have no sense of balance, and the tempo is too slow on every concerto.

Her character development and storylines engage the reader and capture you from the start. The tale she wove with Toni, John and Devon was so vivid it was as if we were there for every joyous and heartwrenching event. At times I had to fight the urge to read ahead and see what happened.

The group also felt that the author probably knew too much information about the surgery, which might have been a clue to the author's past. The group also debated the appropriateness of Toni revealing her previous gender to the men she chose to date. The group agreed that Toni has a responsibility of telling the men she anticipates having a committed relationship with and everyone else does not need to know.

Very rarely do I start a book and not finish it so I felt inclined to read it through to the end.It was scattered and a little disoriented in parts. Too many first person narratives, although most of it was Toni talking. It even jumped to third person a time or two.There were typos all over the place.

The American Horrible Histories, while nowhere near as funny as Terry Deary's British ones, are still great for kids to learn history. They're just not silly, gross-out books (qualities which are characteristic of Deary's more enjoyable volumes), which means they're not as much fun for adults. But I'd say they could be incredibly useful for fifth graders.

The ideal book would include propositional as well as predicate calculus. This book does both. The other features of this marvelous little book are equally satisfying.

What was glaringly left out was how those markets were manipulated and left wide open to corruption and greed in the first place. There is little to no mention of Freddie/Fanny/Countrywide et al and the MASSIVE amount of taxpayer dollars that have gone into buying subprime mortgages in the secondary market. Government sowed the seeds of corruption by agreeing to buy overvalued mortgages, and the banks were quick to sweep in and take advantage. Without taxpayers backing the loans there would have been no subprime mortgages made in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Somewhat one-sided view of the mortgage crisis","review":"The film is worth watching and covered many aspects of the mortgage crisis. It was mostly accurate in what it covered, but was not balanced in explaining the greed working on both sides of the lending process.The predominant theme was to blame the rich, blame the banks and mortgage brokers.Rarely was any blame assigned to personal greed of the borrowers, some of whom actually profited from their financial deals (by living rent free for many months after they stopped making payments).At one point it was stated that the fees and points charged by the lenders for refinancing loans in urban neighborhoods were the main cause of home equity decreasing in those neighborhoods (and not the cash being pulled out). Very misleading.The \\"Flaw\\" in loose mortgage policy is that home prices can fall (not the propagandist themes that this film portrays)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Limited Story","review":"This is \\"a love story\\" written by a psychiatrist about the death of his wife from a cruel disease. It is well written and heart-felt but incomplete. The character of the wife, not as a patient or subject of illness, is left undeveloped. Instead, the story revolves around the husband/psychiatrist. He recounts his heated courtship with his wife; his dwindling love life by middle age; his attempts (constant and ill-fated) to escape his \\"ethnic\\" (Jewish) past; and the limits of science and medicine in the face of a relentless disease. There is something funny about the author's coping strategies that almost rescues the book. But the serious subject-matter called for more than a release of words. For in the end, one gets the sense, that through all the suffering the author has not really moved -- and has not found his true self (whatever that may be). That is sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"A must read for anyone who has lost a loved one to an illness.

I wish this kit included a new lever and cam since mine was frozen together with rust. Had to beat it apart with a screwdriver and then get it of there, straighten it and then wire wheel the rust off. Then I anti-seized the 2 together and hopefully they move independent of each other for quite some time. Anyway the other components that I didn't mention all looked satisfactory.

Who know's, maybe 30 yr.'s from now, one of those unopened trinket season box's could go for $100k like the unboxed bobbafett from 1976? that sold for $19k.I think the music from the Inuyasha series is the best I have listened to even if my copy was a knock-off.

There are a lot of fights scenes, but not all the fight scenes were needed. Only some fights scenes did helped the movie farther the story while others just slowed down the movie.The ending wasn't that great and tried too hard to push for a sequel.

I got it today, grabbed my jewelry and went onto cleaning.Really, all you need is to dip it in for a few seconds - it sounds like its not enough, but it IS. I had some nice sterling silver hoops that were dingy, dipped them in, less than 5 seconds later they were SHINING!

Not sure what is going on here, but I'm glad I didn't pay a lot and I hope that a second cleaning in something else will reverse the staining that got worse when I used this stuff.

If taken internally, call...\\" you get the point. Being the nerd that I am, I went and searched the internet about this chemical. Well, turns out, shouldn't have touched it. Whoops.

I like most of the songs on this album, but I have one complaint - the album cover!! The album cover is so fake looking, that it almost looks computer generated. It is so unnatural looking. I would have preferred to see a photo that was not so airbrushed and redone.

Lovely voice and enough variety to make the album interesting. Good job!

Her rendition of \`Blue' showcased her a vocal powerhouse. But, other than the odd country ballad and a few wishy-washy hits, LeAnn doesn't have a lot to fill this collection. \`How Do I Live' is, of course, on the release and her other smash \`Can't Fight The Moonlight,' from the Coyote Ugly soundtrack is also present. Rimes visits classic balladry on \`You Light up My Life.'\`I Need You' and \`Life Goes On' are booth pop endeavors that show the direction Rimes is really aiming at after her feud with her record company and her own dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegance at the piano","review":"I grew up listening to Moura Lympany's playing, especially Litolff's Scherzo. Never could understand how a person could play with absolute control at high speed. In this recording, most (though not all - the Etude in C# minor an obvious exception)of the music is more laid back, and played with great grace and with the controlled touch of a pianist at the peak of her career.The ambience of the recording is a wide open one, giving us the full clear sound that makes listening to a grand piano to enjoyable.If you enjoy listening to good piano music, this is a recording that you will enjoy a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well programmed and selected set","review":"These days many music fans with grounding in good ol' rock and roll have bent their ears to light, melodic jazz standards. Here's a challenge: pick up this low-priced CD, take note of the famous names and that each track averages about 3 minutes in length - that's what us rockers have been raised on.A little crass, but....check this one out. I can't imagine any heavy metal fan turning away from the exquisite, haunting \\"Waltz No. 15 in A-flat, Op.39\\" by Brahms, or \\"La fille aux cheveux de lin...\\" by DeBussy; factor in *5* compositions by Chopin, and you've got a keeper. Maybe just beneath Zep on the carousel (but it's all in the proverbial family).Note that Chopin is next sectioned off, as one might expect in a Classical compilation. So the flow of the music is regenerative to the senses, as well.Dame Moura Lympany plays with breathtaking sensitivity and delivers one for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day of Disaster","review":"The advent of Ronna's first pop album after four unsuccessful attempts at country radio is nothing but a disaster. This is not because it's a pop album but it's a very bad pop album. Most of the songs lack melodies and you can listen to this album a hundred times, and you still can't hum to any of the tunes. The production is crowded siphoning out Ronna's beautiful vocals. Most of the songs (which comes from Ronna's pen) lack diversity. This album is just 11 tracks of mess and to add to the disaster, the album is produced by Peter Cetera. One star is awarded for the ballad \\"New York Rain\\" an okayish if not mundane song. If you like Ronna for her country efforts under \\"Ronna Reeves\\" be warn, this album is an embarrassment to an artist who can accomplish more than this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for beginners","review":"I haven't done palm reading before and this was actually the first book I have read on the subject. I - as I guess all beginners just grabbing a book like this - applied the guidelines on my own palms. Most of them were right, some were not.I'm sure that all professional \\"palm readers\\" read and study a lot before they are able to do readings for others and they must go through a lot of different experiences until they can perform reliable readings. But \\"The Art of Hand Analysis\\" seems to be a good start for those willing to get involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent translation","review":"This is one of the best translations of the great Roman epic I have ever come across.

The consensus in the reviews is that Fitzgerald has written a fine epic. It just is not the same one written by Virgil. If you want to read Fitzgerald, this is the book for you. If you want to read Virgil you need the Mandelbaum translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vergil writes poor English verse","review":"What kind of poetry is this? The words don't even rhyme! I guess in Vergil's day there weren't so many rhyming words in English. It takes real a poet, like Maya Angelo or Jewel, to rhyme words properly. \\"My hands are small, I know/ But they're not yours, they are my own.\\" Now THAT'S poetry.But turning to the plot of this \\"poem,\\" I don't understand what this Juno has against this Aeneas guy. He seems like a straight fellow, but she's always trying to drown him and stuff. And what's the big deal about Rome? It seemed so stupid that Aeneas had to go off and found this city and couldn't stay with that chick who killed herself. I've been to Rome. It's not all that great, and they don't even speak English. Aeneas is not a good role model for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Version","review":"I wasn't sent the correct version I purchased. Instead I was sent the \\"Penguin Classics\\" version, translated by W.F. Jackson Knight. Since I needed the specific translation for a class, it was definitely an issue and I wasn't pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Poor Translation","review":"As another earlier reviewer appropriately stated, this book is not for a Classics Scholar. Having read a large number of different translations of the Aeneid and having translated about 80% of the text from the original Latin myself, Fitzgerald's translation here is lacking in many aspects. He does not keep with the same lines as the original text, he takes great liberties in the use of various words, and sometimes his grammatical poetics is overly drammatic for the section of translation. While the Aeneid is a poem, one must consider that an Epic poem is not a Haiku.If you're looking for an English translation to use in conjunction with a Aeneid translation course, seek another book. I prefered David West's translation when I was taking a few courses in college.The Aeneid is a wonderful story, just don't read Fitzgerald's translation of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aeneas' Great Adventure to the Promise Land!","review":"Aeneis by Virgil is a classic of its time. I am required to read this book by my English teacher, but I would not put it down if he told me I didn't have to. This book gives a mythological account of the trials of Aeneas and the Trojan refugees after exiled from their homeland by the Greeks. Jupiter (the king of the gods) would have Aeneis found a colony that would eventually become an empire in Italy, while Juno (the queen of the gods) tries to delay Aenies' fate for as long as posible. Aeneis goes through many trials in this epic and if you enjoy history with a twist of fantasy and mythology then you will be hooked the moment you start into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor translation of a great work","review":"Robert Fitzgerald's translation of The Aeneid, while highly acclaimed, is a very low fidelity translation. Fitzgerald shows throughout the translation that he is an excellent writter, poet, etc. However, as a translator, his work is much below what I would have hoped. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald seems to have decided that Vergil was not as great a writer as himself in any way, because he blatantly ignores the Latin in his translation. While one would expect all translators to interpret The Aeneid in a different way, one should NOT expect them to completely paraphrase, cut out words, and add many extra ones to a quality translation, like Fitzgerald has. If you are not using this translation and comparing it to the original Latin, than this is a great read. However, if you are looking for a translation that holds high regard for the words of Vergil, look elsewhere, because Fitzgerald seeks not to translate the Aeneid, but to rewrite it as his own work."},{"rating":"2","title":"FITZGERALD vs. MANDELBAUM","review":"I've read both translations, many many times. From an educational perspective, especially for the classics student, I would recommend the Mandelbaum translation, as the language more closely matches the visually breathtaking Latin of the original. However, for someone just picking it up to read it, with perhaps little side-knowledge, the Fitzgerald version is far more captivating. It is an easier read, more like modern prose (relatively speaking, of course), and the images are far clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Classics scholar","review":"I've read several English translations of The Aeneid, and have translated the majority of it. Unfortunately, this is not a terribly good translation. While it flows nicely, and keeps a poetic form, Fitzgerald takes far too many liberties with the Latin language for my tastes. It is difficult to follow along with the actual Latin text, as he does not keep the same lines as Virgil. My recommendation is Mandelbaum's translation; he sticks closely to the Latin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable epic poetry","review":"This version of The Aeneid is very accessible and exciting. I enjoyed reading the Aeneid more than I did the Iliad. Maybe that's because Aeneas is a more centralized, likeable character than Achilles. This is a very good book and it is a pity there are not more epics written like this today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Translation, Poor Recitation","review":"Although the translation is fine, the reading of this classic is marred by the voices of the actors.

Since I just received it yesterday I haven't had an opportunity to make sure it is water tight but from what I can see the cover fits tight around all the rails and tailgate. Installation was a snap and took less than 30 minutes.I previously owned a Ram 1500 with a hard shell cover and even though it looked good and was very water tight it was a real pain. It was almost impossible to carry anything tall so this time I decided to go with a tri-fold so it could be removed easily and this one does exactly that. It is very easy to release the 2 rear clamps and fold it up and leave it on the truck or release all 4 clamps and remove it entirely and it is small enough to fit in the back seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful recording at a fantastic price!","review":"Marvelous musicianship exhibited in this double CD set.

Fast and aggressive, with relatively little sentimentality, they have remained the standard for many listeners until the present day. The sound quality, as befits the manner, is bright even a little dry and if you like a more romantic style you will not like it. Personally today I do find this approach just a little too severe. Boult, for example, allows few if any grace notes.

Also, I thought the \\"Introducing Postmodernism\\" was good. But this one on Foucault is a great dissapointment. The captions that narrate Foucault's development are mostly confusing: the explanation of the ideas just aren't clear enough, and the biographical anecdotes are mostly irrelevant.

Not only did it give a clear and concise overview of Foucault, but it referred to at least a dozen other thinkers and artists, and explained how they had influenced and been influenced by Foucault.As a side note, I also particularly appreciated the way it didn't dither around or hide from questionable material.

She considered all the ways God could answer her prayer and deliver that banana. Through the guard? No... The night watchman? No... As she began to doubt that God could grant her that request, she was delivered an armload of bananas - 92 of them! - from the most unlikely source.I cried when I read how God worked in Darlene's life. She suffered greatly, but He was always close.

I have bought others to add to the fold and now only use the K-clamps when I've run out of these.Edit as of Dec 2012: I've changed the rating from 5 to 2. The reason isn't that I don't find them handy, but rather that I'm noticing that they seem to have a shelf life of sorts. What I mean is that I've always used them for light clamping tasks (boxes, etc), but have thrown three away lately because they don't engage anymore.

The beginning was fun with Richard and Isabel matching wits with one another, trying to out-do each other with their thievery. But then by the middle it started to slow down and I wasn't so involved any more. I found the love scenes to be one dimensional and too simple. I felt no heat whatsoever. The story just dragged on and on, I could even jump three paragraphs or a whole page ahead and not miss anything. I lost all interest in all of the characters. Not a keeper, IMO. For a great read, try her series starting with 'Once a Dreamer'."},{"rating":"2","title":"robust","review":"It is indeed a comprehensive book.

These were no exception. They worked great for the first month, then the inevitable streaking set in. By the end of the season, maybe 5 months, the protective cover/boot to keep the ice out of the frame was starting to disintigrate. Within a couple weeks of the first crack in the casing the rest of the rubber was flapping in the wind, coming off in chunks and being a general distraction and annoyance. Obviously out of warranty.

Where to begin? The puzzle ratings (from beginner to diabolical) often seem to have been applied at random. The instructions on the Hitori puzzles are woefully inadequate for beginners, several have non-unique solutions and the printed answers to many others are flat-out wrong. (If you're unlucky enough to own this book, just put a big red X through the Hitori section and save yourself the aggravation.) Several of the Nurikabes also have non-unique solutions, and most are duplicated - presumably the publishers thought we wouldn't notice. No matter how low the price drops on this book, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Several of the puzzles in the book have non-unique solutions, the Hitori are especially atrocious, with several ways to fill in numbers and no real solution. The Masyu were pretty good, but still had a few errors in them. I really don't know how a puzzle book could get published in this state, is it that hard to make sure all of your puzzles are uniquely solvable? I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a hitori fan, I was very disappointed in this book. The reason I chose this particular book was for the hitori puzzles and they are all flawed. For those of you familiar with hitori, there are blacked out numbers with no reason for black out, and also circled numbers with no reason to circle. Leaves the puzzles unsolvable."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a mess","review":"I bought this primarily for the Nurikabe puzzles. After a while, I started getting a feeling of déjà vu. Turns out that the same few puzzles are used over and over. A real ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly edited - shamefully bad","review":"I am a beginner at Hitori and was stunned to realize that most of the Hitori solutions in the book are invalid. Mepham or his editors seem unaware of the basic rules of the puzzle. Other reviewers have noted similar problems and even said that the publisher has acknowledged the errors. The puzzles lose all of their relaxing, mind absorbing qualities when the book is so poorly created. Shamefully bad material carrying the name of a (supposedly) great puzzle creator. One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duplicate Puzzles","review":"As an avid Kakuro solver I found the kakuro puzzles some of the toughest I've seen. I also enjoyed the variety of other puzzles in the book. Even some Sudoku are quite difficult. And I'm a guy who tends to start with the toughest first.I am disappointed in several things though. The solutions to the Hitori are inaccurate and there is much repetition in the puzzles. I have not actually looked for duplicates but have found a half dozen or more *exactly* duplicated puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but the puzzles have problems","review":"Really the only good thing I can say about this book is that it introduced me to a variety of puzzles beyond Sudoku. Being a fan of Sudoku, I was excited to learn about some other Japanese puzzles. I flipped through this book in a bookstore and it seemed like a good purchase, but after having spent quite a few hours with this book I discovered the same problems other reviewers have, e.g. wrong solutions, multiple solutions, repeat puzzles, ambiguous difficulty, etc. It's been an annoying journey with this book.If you are interested in Masyu, Nurikabe, Kakuro, or Hitori, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Having a small library of car books, it's refreshing to get a book that has new facts and info not repeated from other texts.

The arm section had some unusual moves with high reps and very Pilates inspired, I could feel the effects for a few days.The best is the Barre section. A nice mix of dance, Pilates, a little kick boxing side kicks plus cardio mixed in. My legs were screaming but somehow Tracey is so motivating that you just want to keep on going. The music was so energizing the girls were all different sizes and shapes which I appreciated.Abs section was short but effective with once again creative moves as Tracey is famous for. This is by far her best workout and one of most favorite workouts of all time...very addicting!!Looking forward to my new Booty."},{"rating":"1","title":"More for the ballet dancer than not","review":"I'm a total Physique 57 fan and have been religiously doing the DVDs every day of the week, but I just wanted to add a little something different to my routine. You get a good workout with this video, BUT if you're not flexible it is very difficult. Tracey moves very fast and all of the exercisers in her video are very flexible. I found this very discouraging because I can't stretch my legs out that far and when she gets going fast it's difficult to keep up. Also, there are no video shots from the side, so it's hard to tell what angle they are actually kicking their legs. More instruction in this video would have been very helpful along with someone not a dancer showing abbreviated moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Home workout","review":"I just completed the The Booty Barre - Total New Body for the first time. I consider myself in pretty good shape since I go to the gym regularly, but this workout kicked my booty (not in a bad way). There is a lot of work on your legs and glutes.

The tough part is really just the workout -- your muscles will be trembling, if you push yourself.I liked that there is not a long intro at the beginning of the DVD (no wasting time with additional ads!). The arms, booty, and abs workout can be done altogether for a killer workout. Or, you can split them up to alternate muscle groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Even for a non-dancer like me :)","review":"My friend told me to try this DVD and having never taken a ballet or dance class before I was a little scared to try, but now I'm hooked and LOVE Booty Barre! I'm hoping to find a Booty Barre studio near my house but this is great in the meantime. Like I said, never have taken ballet before and wish I could turn back time to try but this DVD makes me feel strong, lean, and graceful.. like a ballerina! I love the combination of strength, toning, and cardio! What other workout combines all of that in one?! Tracey's cueing is great and the moves are great even for a non-dancer like myself. I have fun with this workout and that's the most important thing. That's what keeps my coming back to do it over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD does not work on computer","review":"I was excited to try this DVD as I have done Xtend Barre at a studio for awhile. I bought quite a few barre/fusion/pilated DVDs with this order. I purchased two Tracey Mallette DVDs and neither one would work on my new Macbook Pro. The other DVD's worked so I know it is something with the formatting of this series that will not work on Mac's DVD player. Just thought I would give a heads up to anyone who plans to follow this workout from their Mac or computer. BUMMER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really annoying","review":"I should have known that this workout wouldn't be to my taste from the beginning - I mean booty barre?? I was looking for a more straighforward ballet workout - and of course that naturally works your butt. But I found Tracey to be way too cutesy. As in, lots of \\"shake that booty!\\" I expect that in a cardio DVD, but it seemed out of place in a ballet-based workout. You can definitely get a good workout with this DVD: this has probably the best arm workout of any of my ballet DVDs. It's tough and I really like this section. But my overall judgment is the same, I just found her to be so grating.The Element Ballet Conditioning with Elise Gulan is more my speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Expected Something Different.","review":"I bought this DVD based on the reviews, but quickly found this DVD was not for me. I will compare \\"The Booty Barre Total New Body\\" to an exercise video from the 80's: the bubbly instructor chirping away during the exercises and the no pain no gain style of exercises.

(nor does the laptop slide around) thanks to the small rubber feet on these. Whenever I pull this out at a meeting, people ask- Where did you get that? I often have the computer on my lap and I've never noticed any heat buildup, so I know it's ventilating well.These are very lightweight and store easily in my laptop backpack, between straps & backpack makes a great support. My backpack went flying out of a jeep when I got picked up from the airport on a tight turn, (back passenger door open) backpack skidded from car to ground at 25-30mph.. but it landed on the strap side.. lapdesk helped protect the laptop, because it fired up just find after the landing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Right model but wrong style","review":"I order the Targus PA243U Portable lapdesk which is the gray solid.

The heat from the laptop also travels between the open slot so if you have this on your lap you could feel the heat on your legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was shown.","review":"I wasn't expecting much, but what I got is NOT what is shown at all. It is full gray, with only a few small rubber pads. I wanted a light, cheap, wide laptop tray so I could place my laptop across my knees when sitting cross-legged, but the entire thing began to break within weeks of purchase. The very sides started first, cracking where I'd pick it up and where the closures are. A few months later, the entire middle just snapped except for one small part of the hinge.

I really wanted to like this product and the price was right. Unfortunately the lapdesk turned out to be a bit of disappointment. The laptop desk turned out to be un-sturdy and rather flimsy. Worst, the unit actually became hot when using my laptop over prolonged periods of time. During usage the unit also did not dissipate heat very well from the laptop. This may be more from my own laptop's odd size (16 inch) but the unit definitely did not help with cooling. Plus, for those that like to use a regular mouse with their laptop, the unit is really awkward to use on its own.

This mistake and the fact that the lapdesk doesn't cool the laptop led to the little hook melting and the lapdesk collapsing.
