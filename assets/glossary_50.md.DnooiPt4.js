A great addition to movies like Finding Nemo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a ...","review":"I bought this title after the suggestion by Amazon when I purchased another title and after I read the glowing reviews. But when I watched it with my three year old I was completely disppointed. Granted some of the images are colorful, the video is filled with too much talk and some of the talk bordered on preaching. Some images, talk talk talk. Some more brief images, talk talk talk. It could not hold my three year old's attention at all. ... Instead, the Island of the Sharks DVD I bought is much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"At 32 minutes long and too much introduction, I found this DVD overpriced. Though the underwater photography is fine, it's also short on the good footage and there is way too much chatter. I was looking for a high-quality production that would engage my three-year old who is fascinated by the \\"Walking with Dinosaurs\\" BBC production. He liked the jumping dolphins but otherwise this DVD is WAY THIN. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice special features","review":"I'd recommended this DVD for children ages 7 and up.

The main feature is filled with information - and the other special features on the DVD like \\"Fish School\\" and \\"Relax with Fish and Other Animals\\" make it a pretty good package.I would recommend it to children between 6 and 12 who enjoyed \\"Finding Nemo\\"- I think some adults will find it entertaining as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning video!","review":"If you're looking to learn about what goes on under the sea, buy this DVD!

I bought this due to the favorable reviews but I actually own an original Nerf Turbo and the Poof is definitely a lower grade knock off. The original turbo is quite a bit heavier than this ball and throws a much better spiral. To get this Poof to throw a tight spiral you have to use your wrist instead of your arm. It also \\"quacks\\" if you try and throw it long distances. It is a decent attempt at replicating the classic Nerf Turbo but ultimately falls short in several areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to Nerf Turbo, but not quite.","review":"I bought this item in place of the classic Nerf Turbo (which does not exist anymore apparently).

Bottom line is I'm out of luck!Fortunately I also bought a Romertopf #117 works great and no cracks, I recommend them highly, I have several of theirs I have used them for years without any problems.I'm very unhappy with the way unbeatable sales handled this problem.

The reason I am rating it at 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has a slightly looser fit between the top and bottom. Also it has the shorter \\"lip\\" on the bottom half which is important when you take it in and out of the oven. I am a bit nervous about losing hold on it every time I am taking it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooker cracked in two in the oven, halfway through cooking!","review":"Was horrified to discover the pot split in half 2 hours into the 3.5 hours needed for cooking my New Year's eve cassoulet. This was a total disaster, dumping liquid into the bottom of the stove (where the gas burners are), which dripped through into holes in the back of the kitchen island. It took me hours to clean this up.....not to mention the ruining of a New Year's eve feast. Don't risk cooking in one of these if you value your oven!

The image is crisp and clear. There were a few blemishes on the intensifier tube, but nothing you would notice without looking for them. Easy recognition beyond 100yrds in minimal ambient light. When I say minimal, I mean a cloudy night, with no moonlight. In these conditions, without IR, the image is dim, but easily recognizable. I could make out the woodwork on my barn 50yrds out. Activate the IR and it looks like someone turned on a spotlight. The IR is ineffective beyond 80 to 100 yrds except for the eyes of animals. They reflect the IR beyond 200 yrds. Being the unit is 4X, focusing is required, but not a whole lot is required at distance, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 in\\" lens rotation for every 25yrds. N0T A CLOSE QUARTERS UNIT!!!!

It's probably going to be hard to find a better deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really 0 Star","review":"What a disapointment. They would not focus and the quality is terrible.

Expected a very grainy image with splotches but the image is pretty sharp and no splotches. Able to see objects with ambient light at night (stars or moonlight). For dark or shadowed areas the IR illuminator lights it up like a floodlight (only out to about 50 yards though). It has a protection circuit for inadvertent exposure to bright light but you'll know it. Even the moon is way to bright to view with this scope. It has a tiny hole in the lense cover for use or testing in normal light situations but I wouldn't even dare turn it on in direct sun light outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yukon NVMT 4x50","review":"Item arrived looking good - for a birthday several days later. This allowed me to get a battery for it before the Bday.On Bday, it functionned pretty well - especially for first generation, but it did not want to \\"cut off\\". Tried holding the off button, lightly touching, double pressing, etc. Finally went off. By next day would not turn off at all - had to remove the battery - a little difficult because I think it is supposed to be water proof or resistant. Now comes on whenever battery is installed. I am wary of items that start out defective and have (with a fair amount of difficulty I might add) returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"This is a poorly constructed piece of equipment.

Their thinness is an advantage if you are flagging many places in a book or document set as many can be placed without the book or pile of papers becoming bulky. Post-It makes another flag, which it calls their \\"Durable\\" flag and is heavier if you are looking for something to use as a tab.With most pens and and even with a pencil, they can be written on, which is nice. And of course, they are transparent. I have found the Post-it brand to be consistent in its quality, as opposed to other manufacturers who sometimes don't make the flag sticky enough.

It is the prize of scholarship sought and sometimes won by education, all unabashedly depicted in original, colorful and somewhat funky, creative lines. Very British, the story examines education and coming of age in the world of intellectual and academic pursuit.Whereas, short of Dead Poet's Society, the Hollywood examination of school life is shallow and crass; this film, without neglecting the efficacy of humor, pierces silly bantering and successfully reveals the conflict and eventual realization that sometimes comes with change or graduation.I'll watch this again, and I highly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes one think of Dead Poet's Society","review":"A literate drama with generous doses of wisdom and amusement. There are lines of dialogue to be savoured, quoted, and discussed. There are moments of exquisite sensitivity and drama as the underdog students attempt to earn their admission amongst the academic elites. This is not a film for those who take their movies in shopping centre theatres. The film considers the conflict between substance and style, education versus knowledge, and appreciation against exam preparation. In these days when too many movies seem to be the product of focus group marketing History Boys is a rarity - a film made for an educated and literate audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teachers and Student Unite","review":"Well written, well structured, well directed and well acted.

The movie was a study in character (and motives), and the relationship between teacher and student. I get that. Please don't high hand me with your intellectual reprovals. The movie was littered with references to high brow literature and poetry to the point that it came off sounding like an intellectual version of name dropping.

This thin story has no other reason to be told other than it's a gay man's fantasy brought to life. A school where a group of adolescent boys are all jokingly okay about the old overweight male teacher who gropes them (quite the opposite of reality where young males who are struggling to assert their sexual identity and find social acceptance would be much more likely to ambush such a teacher in the parking lot for a beating).The only other adult male in this movie, also their teacher, reveals himself to ALSO be gay, and the group of students all end up turning out to be gay, even the class womanizer. Again...it's the gay man's fantasy of every male is secretly gay, (and thus available to them).

This film is also very draining, which I found very unique for a horror movie. After you watch this, the images of it stick in your mind. You basically feel like your mind was raped. This film is DEFINATELY NOT for the weak at heart. I have a very strong stomach when it comes to horror movies, and this even made me squirm. From animal cruelty, to rape, to forced abortion, this film's every aspect will have a great effect on your mind. Forget what you ever thought about films.

I watched the Substance dvd again and realized that this truly was an impressive film. It really is hard to watch, it really is brutal, it really is unflinching and disturbing. I almost felt bad for sitting through it.I was thrilled to receive the Grindhouse 2-disc edition in the mail.

Initially I didn't keep much expectations from it, but as the film went further my eyes widened and got glued to the screen and I was holding my breath every second. Robert Kerman is brilliant as the protagonist and everything from the atmosphere to the characters will keep you engaged. Not even for once you feel you are watching a film, it is more like witnessing a raw and explicit documentary on cannibalism.

The killing of animals for entertainment purposes is beyond the pale and the brutality of the characters could have easily been portrayed using props. My first reaction after seeing this garbage is that I wanted to tear out some of the director's limbs to see how he liked it.If Ruggero Deodato had any true talent, he could have made this movie without hurting or torturing a living thing.

This film isn't scary in the least, and the bulk of gore is animals being killed.If you want to see animals slaughtered look up a meat-factory video.This show sucked. It was retarded, the only halfway beneficial quality it possessed was that the music was pretty top notch.

I sure don't watch expecting the next Citizen Kane (although Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street ARE classics).For 'its type', this is a good movie. It is gory and exploitative (with even nudity never wasted if male or female actors had the hotbod).Pluses are the shlocky 'banquets' and even the soundtrack. Some scenes are gratuitiously cruel, inserted to appeal to baser interests but, again, this is no Clint Eastwood vehicle.

But still, it is basically a very low budget, amateurish gore-fest, with little redeeming quality. The closing scenes are pretty vivid and the impaled girl is fairly horrendous. But, in the end, Cannibal Holocaust is pretty weak. The final detractor is the fact that several animals were actually killed during its filming. So not only was it amateurish, it was unnecessarily barbaric. In the end, there are many more legitimate films which are far more scary, disturbing and creative.

The limit is this: While the human deaths in the film are (clearly) fake, the gruesome killings of various animals are absolutely, unequivocally real. Were these animals killed for the sake of food, to control overpopulation, or for some other potentially legitimate reason? No. THEY WERE KILLED ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF FILMING THE KILLINGS. In terms of humans, snuff films are basically nothing more than urban legends; in terms of animals, however, \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\" is an actual snuff film.

I was told all horror fans must see this movie, and I really do not know why.

After all the hype about this film, it is as LAME as Blair Witch and just as pointless. Also, in parallel with Blair Witch, the characters are the kind of idiotic dipsticks one finds oneself hoping will be killed quickly and gruesomely. Worse still, when it does finally happen (keep the fast-forward button handy), it is totally pointless and the special effects are infantile and cheap, at best. Worse still, the film takes itself very seriously while having no sense of humor. This film is pointless and DOES NOT deliver the goods.

That is why I wanted to watch it myself. I just wish I had known that I would be watching cruel tourture of innocent animals. I had to turn away and actually covered my ears so that I couldn't hear the poor animals dying. I only wish the actors torture scenes were real, they deserved it for allowing themselves to be involved in such a vile production. A special place in Hell is reserved for everyone who had a hand in making this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errr....","review":"There's something seriously wrong with you if you liked this movie. I'm not referring to the \\"horrible\\" human violence - none of it is real and therefore can be entertaining. What I'm referring to is the torture and killing of animals, which is apparently all real. I feel like a lousy person merely for glimpsing what I have (that's GLIMPSING, yes... The moment that poor turtle got dragged out of the lake I turned the wretched thing off). Let me repeat this again, and I'm not going to apologize for saying it, there's something seriously wrong with anyone who considers the killing of animals even remotely \\"entertaining\\". I'm not shocked that cr@p like this gets made, I'm shocked that people are actually giving it five stars. This isn't just a bad movie, it's a crime. And if you love it, you're a sick ^&%*. So is the director of this \\"film\\", who should be in jail for animal cruelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Snuff Film","review":"I thought I had seen this master piece at the drive in theater way back in the early eighties but I had it confused with the other cannibal gym \\"Make Them Die Slowly\\" (AKA Cannibal Ferox ). I have been hearing for years about how they killed a bunch of animals on film in this movie and must admit this go's way to far to shock the viewer and is really just animal snuff. I have seen enough animals die in real life and have no need to see it on film. The sad thing is the regular effects are not bad for a early 80's cheapo and I for one thought they were pretty creepy. If you are a gore hound you will like this film but all others should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting great things...but denied.","review":"Having heard so much about this, I decided to watch it. I even had a bucket ready for puking (hoping this movie could do the impossible). Guess what? I just wasted 90 minutes of my life on this piece of crap. A few scenes were kind of gruesome (for the 80's anyway), but other than that, it was disappointing at best. The animal scenes were real, though, and being a lover of animals my stomach did a small flip at the turtle scene. But as for the human mutilations, there were only 2, the second one obscured heavily by rampaging \\"cannibals\\". The first mutilation was fair, but as a whole it could have been SO MUCH MORE. And it was SO DAMN SLOW. The 2 mutilations of the group happened at the tail 10 minutes of the film. The beginning scenes of the professor trecking through the forest were a little more entertaining, but just a VERY little more. It was aiming for an 11, I give it a 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride!","review":"When i 1st found this movie, it was many years ago and it was out of print and difficult to find. me and a friend found a bootlegged copy on VHS and paid $40 for it. We watched it and were not disappointed. But we were astounded as to how well the movie was made. This is not a \\"horror\\" film. Sure, it is gory and repulsive and shocking, but that is where the traditional horror element ends. The social commentary still holds true today and packs a punch. The \\"civilized\\" journalists are far more cruel and sadistic than the cannibals, and as a result they deserve everything that came to them. The commentary on news media's credability as well as the savage nature of man are all explored here. Would i watch this movie over and over again? Not at this age, but when I was 16 I may have watched it over and over for the sheer shock value. This is an important movie which should be watched for more than it's gore content.... and then you can watch it again just for the gore if you're a sicko."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it!!","review":"And then throw it away, because you will most likley never want to watch it again. I will admit this is one disturbing and sick film and very worthy of its reputation. But should you purchase a movie that you will probably only watch once or twice? Yes. CH has some of the most disgusting and disturbing images you will ever see. If you are looking for cinema that pushes the boundries that is what you get with Cannibal Holocaust. This is by no means a good film, the animal killings (real or not) were redundant, and all the other brutality was over the top. Basically the film is garbage, the only true artists were the composer, and cinematographer. So I recommend you watch Cannibal Holocaust but if you can rent it do so, if not purchase it watch it and place it in your trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bamboozled by hype","review":"I was very disappointed in this film: the acting is distractingly amateurish, and there is no plausibility to the behaviors of the characters (viz., film crew). I did not feel invested in the characters or story. The musical score is a higgledy-piggledy mess and does not make the contribution that a well-fitting score should. I am also sorely disappointed in myself for succumbing to the marketing hype for this film. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually a \\"0\\" Rating","review":"The film is lifeless (the first hour crawls) and not very scary. You want the main characters to die because they are one-dimensional, cruel and downright annoying. The natives had every right to be restless - and bloodthirsty.

I cannot believe anyone would rate this above a 1. The acting and direction is the worst in Hollywood history.

The john i was watching the movie with groaned.And by the way tormenting animals is how people who end up tormenting humans get their first introduction.These 5 and 4 star reviews don't indicate the real numbers of people who like this film,let alone the majority of people who support an ethical treatment towards animals.So i suggest the rave reviews are there because of the sick manics out there who have to prove their o.t.ness to be something special.Real people just groan and avoid the sensationalism of even bothering to post any review.The music throughout is really cheesy for the genre and kept reminding me of the silly dialogue at the start of a cheap porn movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped, Cruel BORING","review":"Even if you cut the sadistic and immoral animal kill/torture scenes from this turkey, this video would be unwatchable for several reasons. The premise is weak, actors subpar, the soundtrack sounds more 1950's than 1970's.Worse, there is very lttle suspense, it's basic filler material of a group traveling through the rain forest and the \\"meat\\" in this malnourishing stew are a few scenes of gore, some with real and live animals.I love my prime rib rare. I don't care about how Mr.Chicken makes his way into my frying pan. However I don't appreciate cowards killing helpless creatures as a substitute for good gore FX or suspenseful filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"Somehow a lot of people find this movie worthwhile, and even consider it a \\"classic\\". Trust me, it is not. The basic plot of the movie isn't terrible, but the execution is. The acting is awful and the movie relies on extreme gratuitous violence that exists solely for the shock value. It is not scary, and it does not have any redeeming qualities. It is not a condemnation of modern society, in fact the actors and director commit the same atrocities that they are supposedly \\"condemning\\". The animal killing scenes are real and disgusting(couldn't even watch), and it is truly horrible that those creatures lost their life for this movie. Deodato is obviously a disturbed egomaniac, and I honestly wouldn't mind if he gets violently murdered. I know people will keep watching this out of morbid curiousity like I did, but download it and don't waste your money, especially by giving it to truly sick people."},{"rating":"1","title":"the reviews were right","review":"I read the reviews that said the magnets don't stay on.

My friend who is a fellow fan of Stockhausen thinks of Stimmung as \\"his silly piece.\\" It's so accessible that it's very fun too -- unusual for him. Stimmung was inspired by time Stockhausen spent in Mexico where he would sit on a rock for hours staring at ruins, noticing how they were slightly out pf phase.... He also experienced being different indigenous peoples or a Spaniard & relived their religious ceremonies, which could be quite cruel, but (as he wrote) \\"religious cruelty isn't in Stimmung, only sounds.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"smile","review":"I actually can't believe the other reviewers gave this 5 stars.

If it weren't for my OCD about finishing books that I start, I would've read the first couple of chapters and then given up.It seems like a wannabe-suspense, but it's not. It seems like there might be a love story in it, but there's not. It feels like there might be a creepy angle in it, but there is not. What I can gather about this book is that the author thinks she's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy. She tries to make a connection, but falls WAY short. Read Vinegar Hill - that one was worth it. Pass Midnight Champagne by."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, bittersweet story of midwestern love","review":"A.Manette Ansay has a gift for character development and description. She provides just the right amount of both to keep the reader engaged and involved but not overburdened. Like RIVER ANGEL, MIDNIGHT CHAMPAGNE deals with slightly quirky, yet believeable Midwesterners from a small town. April is an individualist with an altruistic bent. Caleb is just sweet and loveable in a goofy sort of way. Their families and friends are basically simple folk just trying to deal with everyday life and love.The message of love flows throughout the book--it's not always beautiful and glossy. It can be cruel, murderous and frightening at times. It can kill but it can heal, too. As with RIVER ANGEL, there is a wistful, bittersweet quality to this book. I was hooked after the first page and really didn't want it to end.Another winner for A.Manette Ansay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ansay Has Redeemed Herself","review":"After forcing myself to finish that vile book, Vinegar Hill, I vowed I would never read another of A. Manette Ansay's books. But she has redeemed herself with Midnight Champagne. Never have I seen as many complex topics as spousal abuse, divorce, and adolescent strife, handled so masterfully in such a short story. How clever a setting--the wedding of April and Caleb. One night that brings together family and strangers in the midst of a Wisconsin blizzard. As the plot reveals itself, Ansay's writing reveals her to be a worthy author. And while I threw my copy of Vinegar Hill in the trash (not wanting to spread more bile upon the earth) I will be recommending Midnight Champagne to all my friends. I look forward to reading her other books, including Angel Falls."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will not be able to speak spanish in 10 days","review":"I believe the Pimsleur method is a good way to learn a language However the material present in this product is too insufficient to give anyone any sort of command or comfort in speaking or listening to Spanish.

The underground scene vividly comes to life, is driven by a solid plot, peopled with excellent characters (especially Harry himself), and given great period touches...and it even includes a guest appearance by Judy Garland.

I sat with him for 15 minutes discussing the approach, his determination and his strength. I realized that he was no different than any of us. Only he was executing on his ideas, paying the price to do so and reaping the benefits.While miracles don't happen overnight, I can happily say that adhering to the program does produce excellent results. Watching the calories and exercising is beneficial, no matter what!

To be fair, it has a couple great plot twists, but all in all 5 pages of surprise aren't worth 500 pages of filler. It's a fence sitter book, that is, it sits on the fence between satire and serious and doesn't manage to do either well. The story is filled with \\"funny\\" place and character names (like Sultan Tummyfat and the harbours of Gulp and Guzzle) that make the writing whimsical without any kind of humour. In between this \\"hilarity\\" the book preaches a half baked stance of eugenics and environmentalism without any rational justification or explanation. Any kind of credibility Tepper gains with the latter is instantly torn down by the former. She has some interesting things to say about animal rights, but ultimately her Nazi-esque ideas about solving human over-population prevent me from taking her at all seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever, It has war, peace, love and action","review":"The True Game draws you into a wonderful alternative world, or is it a future world.

Even knowing what is around the corner in the plot doesnt take away any of the pleasure of reading the book. It starts following the life of one character then weaves so many characters in that you will need to read the books written for them as well. It is a tale of the endless quest between good and evil.

It marks a long-awaited (for me, anyway) return to the more plot-oriented type of book that Tepper used to put out, as opposed to the thinly-vieled morality tales that she has produced from \\"The Gate to Women's Country\\" onward. Not that there isn't a lot of thought-provoking, controversial stuff in here...it's just a lot more integral to the story.And what a story! Marvelous characters, beatifully realized worlds and realities, perfect dialog.

The surprise identity of the characters from the future was a unique and wonderful twist (thus earning the book a second star), but the concluding merciless debasement of humanity was overbearing and left me sick.Never before have mass murderers (who nearly wipe us into extinction in hopes of lessening our evil interference with grass, trees and the like) been held in such regard as heroes of a novel. At least I hope not..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising, intriguing and gripping","review":"This was the first Tepper book I had read, and I found it intensely gripping and interesting. Couldn't put it down till I finished it, and then I read it again, just to get a full perspective. I thought it was fabulous, with the convergence of the timelines feeding into the rich ideas and the slowly revealed secrets, even if I don't necessarily agree with her politics.However, I followed it up by reading Plague of Angels, and reading those two one after another made me feel that Tepper was only exploring the same ideas over and over, which made Plague of Angels much easier to predict.(Stop reading here if you don't want to know about the ideas in the book, especially if you haven't read this novel yet). I also found some of the political leanings expressed through the novels confusing. I noted that she seems to believe that much of technology is born out of humanity's bad side, but somehow seems to think it's a good idea for humans to toy with genetics of animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story, passionate social-political message","review":"Another great story from Tepper, also woven beautifully from her favorite sociopolitical tinker-toys: feminism, social darwinism, environmentalism, human conduct. While slow in parts, the story is strong, the characters are engaging, the examination of social problems interesting and robust, the rollercoaster ride exhilerating. I highly recommend this book, and all of Tepper's works, to readers who enjoy storytelling with real meat to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, witty, astonishing","review":"A few days ago, early in the morning, I sat down with Tepper's latest and a cup of coffee, thinking I would read a few chapters and then get started on the day. When I finally paused and looked at my watch, it was 2 p.m. This book is totally enthralling, filled with witty word-play, linguistic puns, a thrilling quest story, and compelling characters. It also has two quite amazing surprises that will astonish you. In some ways this book reminds me of \\"Grass\\", in the sense that you think you know what is going on, or even what a creature or person looks like; however, surprises keep coming. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this to anyone who wants a good, literate story, and it should not be considered a book only for science fiction fans (I am not)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only moisturizer I can use.","review":"I have extremely dry skin, especially on my face, so I need a good moisturizer that would not clog pores, or make skin oily, but would also last all day and I am very happy with Aveeno's product, I use it every morning and never have to worry about my skin drying out throughout the day. Also it's not crazy expensive and the size and shape of the container is convenient for packing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all around lotion","review":"Normally I don't feel strongly enough about a lotion to write a review, but I came online to sign of for the subscribe-and-save and figured I'd leave a review. My husband and I both use this lotion. It isn't greasy, but also isn't watery. I use this as a body lotion (I'm still using oil of olay on my face) but my husband uses it on his face. He has eczema and this was recommended by the dermatologist (apparently some of the sunblock in other face lotions can cause eczema flairups). It's strong enough that I can also use it on my dry feet and hands in the winter (without getting all greased up). I also put this lotion on my long curly hair! It avoids the crunchy gel feeling, has little scent, and isn't greasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best upgrade dollar for dollar","review":"I have one of these for my M&P 15 and one for my M&P 15-22, and it fits well.

Bought the Magpul one first and didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there..","review":"I purchased this grip to replace a Magpul MOE on my S&W 15-22. I didn't like the Magpul because it felt like hard plastic. This grip has a great feel and seems to fit my average sized hands nicely. I'd have given 5 stars if it had a larger thumb swell and a cover for the bottom so it could be used to store small items.

If you are buying this for an AR-15 22lr check your factory grip before purchasing. My colt ar .22 has 2 holes in the grip, one for the mounting screw and one for a small metal protrusion in the top of the grip.

It feels like a glove and although I haven't shot with it yet I can anticipate it will give me better weapon control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what you'd expect from a Hogue product","review":"This thing is solid, and the grip feels great. Not too sticky, but won't let you slip. I got this as I don't really use combat gloves when shooting my AR, so a more comfy grip than the stock one was in order.This is the second Hogue grip I own, and third one I've used.

With all the options out there these days for grips, I still haven't strayed from this Rubber grip. 5 years is a long time for almost anything and it still feels and seriously looks almost like it did out of the package! Its crazy! BUT im a firm believer in it and it has never failed yet! Great job Hogue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best FIRST upgrade for an AR.","review":"This is an awesome upgrade for your AR. It actually seems as if it absorbs some recoil too. On 100 degree days where sweaty palms are a given, there is never an issue with slippage or loosing my grip and having to readjust. Installs in literally about 3min. Feels as if it were made for my large hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality, Reliability, and price!","review":"I bought this Hogue grip over the popular MOE Magpul grip because of the finger groves and soft material it's made of. It's not too cheap feeling and holds up well in many conditions and sweaty hands! It's a bit difficult to get the bolt tightened enough on the inside when installing but make sure it's tight and it'll never come loose during handling of the weapon!

I love it and you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome grip","review":"I really do love this grip. I have two other grips that are similar in style (rubber overmold, finger grooves) made by other companies, and this one is my favorite. I do however think that my hand may be a little small for it. (Same with other two grips)Or, I am just used to holding pistols. It feels like the grip wants to spread my fingers apart more than I am used to, but I am getting used to it. Like I said, it may just be the size of my hand. Other than that, the grip is perfect. I have Hogue grips on a couple of other guns that I have and I am very pleased with them as well.

The grip fits perfect, and feels great on my S&W M&P15. It gives the rifle the right \\"feel\\" when your holding it with one hand.

Perfect fit on S&W M&P 15-22 rifle.","review":"I installed this grip on the Smith and Wesson M&P; 15-22 .22 LR rifle (AR-15 platform) and the grip went on without any hitches. It's the perfect grip for this rifle and makes shooting a lot more comfortable. S&W; should have this grip installed from the factory like they do on many of their other firearms.A note to M&P; and possibly other AR15 rifles: When your removing your stock grip place the rifle upside down and be careful not to loose the 2 springs and 2 pins that are in there (one set is for the safety/fire mechanism and the other set is for the takedown pin). I will attach a youtube video that I found on the grip removal (If for some reason it doesn't post then just search - \\"Smith&Wesson; M&P15-22; Instructional Series: Grip Removal\\" on youtube and that should get you there.[...]This is the best and cheapest mod you can do to your rifle."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"Hogue grips are superb in terms of ergonomics!

You can't go wrong with their products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable AR grip","review":"Feels great in your hand.

I was looking for a rubber grip with finger grooves and I searched and found many good reviews for this product.

A major improvement, but do keep your old hard plastic 1960's factory grip if you want your AR to be competition legal.

The grip was far better feel than the standard grip and my trigger pull felt more comfortable and better positioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best AR-15 Grip Upgrade!","review":"The feel of this grip compared to the stock grip on my S&W M&P 15 Sport is night and day. The wider area combined with the rubber molded construction and finger grooves make this upgrade a must have for any AR-15 rifle. The installation took all of 5 minutes requiring only a star headed socket wrench with extension (you can also use a 3/16 hex head extended reach Allen Wrench). Be mindful of the safety switch spring that seats into the upper housing of the stock grip when removing. You will need to reinstall this with the replacement grip and verify that the safety works once installation is complete. If you're on the fence about this grip, do not hesitate! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you follow the instructions correctly, you miss!","review":"The packet says \\"Contains Two Servings\\".

Add 1 tsp to get a good flavor. And by the way, the instructions say \\"Watch it magically trun purple\\" It turns an unhealthy shade of pale blue grey. Really pretty lame stuff, & the seller hasn't bothered to respond, which makes them lamer than this crap. BTW, I just hoticed that my review of this seller has \\"been removed\\". I didn't remove it. They are truly lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can barely stand it!","review":"In general, I find the book mostly readable. The topic is interesting and the presentation is enjoyable - when the author sticks to the facts. But having read roughly 3/4 of it so far, I find myself contantly fighting the urge to just dump it in the trash in response to the sniveling diatribes that crop up every other page. According to the author, we humans should spend our lives feeling totally guilty simply because we exist and have spent that existence screwing up the planet in political power struggles, profit mongering, and general poor behavior. It's a wonder we even bother to take time out from our well-deserved self-flagellations to attempt to educate ourselves with a book about the world around us. Even when expounding on world efforts to bring CFC emmisions under control, the author whines, \\"We are just left to wonder if it is too little, too late\\".I cringe at what might await in his book about the Bible!

I was expecting maps and diagrams that show geological features and explain them. There are a few maps in this book, but certainly not enough, and the ones he uses are really not that instructive or informative. His typical format of stating questions and answer the questions just does not work real well in this instance.

The title is very eye-catching since I'm very interested about the sciences, and Geography is one fascinating subject. The book is written in simple terms and easy to understand. What I didn't like about the book is that it's explicitly very biased against the creation theory. On the earlier pages, the author clearly stated that science is dynamic which I or presumably anyone will understand that when it comes to the sciences nothing is certain. Yet the author appears to be preaching the THEORY of evolution as a fact. I thought books like this calls for unbiased and unpartial content. So I scanned the back pages looking for his credentials. And I found my evidence, \\"don't know much about Davis\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and boring","review":"I thought this book might be interesting for my class (I'm a Geography High school teacher). Now, I've read many a dull tome on Geography in my many years. At least they were informative, mistake free and educational. Unfortunately, I cannot say say the same for this drivel. Not only is it dumbed down but, it is still dry and boring. I was drifting off while reading it (and I love geography - can't get enough of it!). There are mistakes a plenty. Not only the ones mentioned before, but I found 'facts' cotradicting themselves in the same chapter. In short; dry, boring, mistake ridden and dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authour does not know much about geography","review":"Superficial, trendy, politically correct, and shallow.Presents many theories and personal opinions as fact.

Don't let the title fool you - more than just \\"geography\\" is covered here. You'll learn history, ecology, astronomy, and more. The only caveat, and it's not a huge one, is that he occasionally gets a bit preachy, especially about the environment and his liberal attitude comes through loud and clear. Overall, a good read and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"It can be embarrassing...","review":"I must admit that it can be bit embarrassing how little I knew about geography. Davis pulls everything together with facts of old and new. This book forced me to pull out the some maps a few times, which expanded my understanding.

I found the process very user friendly.the fact the upload was free wasa bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second book to be read for the new Christian","review":"The first book to be read is Andrew Murray's AN EXCITING NEW LIFE. This book first points out the difference between the CARNAL, those whom are saved but still indulge to the FLESH and the SPIRITUAL, whom DENY THE FLESH. Then the book focuses on the SELF as something to also be DENIED. Then the book focuses on DENYING THE WORLD as a means to entering peace. The worldly things are to be replaced by THE KINGDOM OF GOD, or being like Christ by faith in the power of the Holy Spirit. Then the book explains our NEW LIFE IN CHRIST by dependence on God in every aspect of our lives and by our DEATH TO SELF accomplished by faith in Christ. HUMILITY, DEATH, and SURRENDER are the marks of a Christian CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST. Then JOY, and FAITH grow in a growing Christian. Mr. Murray ends with the point that GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL. By this he means that gradually CHRIST MUST INCREASE WHILE I MUST DECREASE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Walk with the Lord","review":"I have read all of Andrew Murray's books and I find this one to be the best because there is nothing but meat in this book.

Although I am not in the defense of current pop psychology, there is research to the fact that there is much more psychological damage on totally restraining normal sexual impulses in healthy adults. But even more than that, the writers' view is what has forced many christians into totally unfruitful marriages, so they would not commit the \\"sin\\" of masturbation. When the Apostle Paul was referring to being burn, he was talking about men having relationships with prostitutes, not masturbation.

If you want hot, and convenient, pile this stuff on whatever you are eating and enjoy. My favorite is a bowl of plain brown rice (from the big container in the freezer) with a dash of soy sauce, a small handful of unsalted peanuts, and tons and tons of crushed red pepper. Wet dishes/soups tend to activate it even more, or make your own paste with just water. Mmmm, life is good :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"I like my food really spicy and I was sick of always using up the little red pepper containers I got from the grocery store (and how expensive is that??) so I bought this. It's not super spicy if used right out of the canister and cold, but I almost always run it through a spice grinder because I've found that releases the oils better (in not just this brand but in all red pepper). Also, if you put it on/in something you're cooking, the heat will bring the oils out better and spice it up as well. I wouldn't recommend this product if you're not going to use it fairly fast - I think it'll probably start to lose its flavor and potency after about 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spicy","review":"A very nice and spicy pepper.

You've gotta be kidding me.","review":"I think Lou Reed is (or at least was) a terrific songwriter. I even think he is a pretty good lyricist. But honestly, when will people realize that rock lyrics only very rarely qualify as poetic? This stuff is absolutely horrid on the printed page! What made the Velvets great was the menace of their sound, not Reed's pretentious dreck. Yeah, so he studied under Schwartz, therefore he's a poet. The power of rock music lies in the raw power of the music, not its lyrics. As Nietzsche would see it, it's the Dionysian vigor of music that makes it great, not stupid lyrics saying how great speed is. Lou Reed's a great rock star, but a lousy poet.Read this to your children? Are you kidding me?

Cooper goes beyond the normal self-help cheerleading, the kind that suggests that all we need to do is \\"tap in\\" to our infinite cerebral potential. He helps us to understand that primitive tendencies, many of which have been evolutionarily adaptive, are now obstacles to achievement. The brain is in some ways so happy to have arrived at Point A that it is too comfortable to risk the journey to Point B.

Cooper's book, Get Out of Your Own Way: The 5 Keys to Surpassing Everyone's Expectations.Being a avid fan of Arthur C. Clarke, the first quotation in the first chapter sold me on this book. Clarke said: The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.Habits can be a good thing or a bad thing. A good habit Cooper contends is investing 15 minutes a day thinking about where you wish to go (big picture), what you doing to get there (actions) and where you can do better (making course corrections).This book contains many gems and Ah Ha's.

She reminds me of Dolly Parton, and her voice sounds a bit like hers also. I don't think she has a great vocal range, but with the right song, that can be OK. Her voice is certainly passable and there are many people with very successful careers who did not have the greatest voices. One thing I have noticed about Kelly is that she always cries during live versions of \\"I Wonder\\" I have noticed that she tends to break down towards the end of the song; the piece that requires the greatest vocal range. My belief is that this is a ploy to avoid her having to possibly fail to reach those notes during a live performance. A few tears and no one will notice that those notes aren't hit.

She is a clone of Carrie Underwood, but without the vocal chops and personality. Watching the show, she had a good voice, but not great. On this album, her weaknesses are displayed for all to see. The lyrics are pretty bad throughout the record. Some try to make fun of her act (you know, the dumb country girl. I mean come on, you did not buy that act did you?). Some are so cliche that you shake your head.The production value is high as expected. They clean up her voice well. But she just is not that great of a singer. And this is just an average record.

But this is one of the better CD's to come from one of the contestants.

I have given it four out of five stars as it succeeds in what it sets out to do, which is not to be a musically brilliant, innovative and deep album, but instead to be frivolous and totally enjoyable chick-pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kellie is adorable","review":"I picked her to win American Idol the very first time I heard her. Not only can this gal sing, but she is adorable and so full of personality. It is no wonder they are signing her up for her own comedy show on TV and no wonder that they had her record a CD. She has a really pretty voice, lyrics are very nice and she carries the whole CD off very nicely. Nice change in country music!I'm probably one of her biggest fans and I hope to see more music from her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise for someone who never Picked Pickler","review":"This album is far better than I expected. I'm an American Idol enthusiast and while I admired Pickler's drive, I was not impressed with her singing. I never voted for her and was rather pleased to see her voted off. But this album takes her back to her element -- country, but fun country. (I also wouldn't consider myself a country fan.) So she is back where she belongs and is clearly comfortable.Some songs are cliche, definitely. But some are surprisingly sweet and meaningful, particularly My Angel and I Wonder, which are about her grandmother and mother, respectively.I'm glad I gave Pickler a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock Fusion Instrumental Guitarist","review":"Great Rock Fusion Instrumental Guitarist shows off his chops, tastefullness and versatility in this blend of rock, fusion, blues, metal and bluegrass.

Our care for nature should start with our look (loving) and continue with our touch. She convincingly argues for a change from a subject/object to a subject/subjects mindset. This is not an apocalyptic doomsayer oracle but a hands-on advice on how we should love nature. There is hope for the future but it will take work. This is an excellent book, worthy of your time but be warned - you will want to go out and dirty your hands with the earth's soil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Laptop Case","review":"When I bought this case, I was concerned about my laptop fitting. I have a HP Tablet, and the case is a little small, but my laptp fits in and the top closes. The first time I tried to put my laptop in, it would not fit all the way, but after about 3 tries, it streched and my laptop fit in. The case is very durable, and keeps my laptop very well proteted. There is padding on all sides, including the top. The only thing I don't like about the case is that its uses velcro to close. The velcro gets caught on my things, and is loud to open, but that is the only thing I don't like. The case also fits in my backpack, and all of my friend's backpacks. It is small enough to put in a backpack or carry out in your hands. Overall, I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stiff stiff stiff","review":"These sheets are super cute, but so stiff and not soft at all. My 3 year old son told me he didn't want to sleep on them anymore because they were \\"too noisy and hard\\". I washed them a few times and it got minimally better.

I have gotten other sheets from olive kids that were great, maybe this was a bad batch or something but it was too stiff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a space theme...","review":"We received this set as a gift for our one year old son and immediately loved it. He doesn't know it yet, but he loves it.Anyway, there are some issues that I feel should be addressed as a forewarning for others interested in this set.We had a little trouble fitting the fitted sheet around his crib mattress, which is of normal thickness, and the comforter is very light-weight. In the colder months, I don't trust it to keep our son warm, so I wrap him in a second blanket.I think this set is really only good for a themed room and is unfortunately not the quality I would have expected from the cost of this item since I've purchased a bed-in-a-bag for a king-sized bed for about the same price with better results and quality.Overall, my recommendation stands to buy this only if you've got an \\"Out of This World\\" themed room and don't mind using a second blanket in the cold months for your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"basem","review":"Would have been better to tell the buyers that product for baby No kids Or inform at least the age specified for the use of , I bought 2 product to my children and They are over the age of 6 years.Unfortunately I'm very upset"},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung Software","review":"This is just about impossable to get it to link with phone, and you cant get any answers from Samsung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Editing of the original concert.","review":"What a piece of crap this is compared to the original concert.

Like alcoholism or drug abuse, migratory sexuality is a true compulsive disorder and Daniell describes what a life of compulsive sexuality is really like. Rosemary drank too much, tried drugs and engaged in a lot of zipless sex as well as changing husbands. She had 3 husbands and 3 children and a live in lover with whom she became pregnant and had an abortion. The book is hard to describe. I seems to be a collection of previously published articles and not a consistent voice. Sometimes it captures the voice of people's speech patterns, other times it seems to brag about her ability to have sex easily obtained and often that would make the reader envious. Her ability to pick up men was the thrill of victory that became the agony of defeat after a while. She claims to have been a cheer leader in high school and the one with the most dates in the history of the school. Really that popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirting Ring Deluxe","review":"I ordered this ring for my Dad who loves to play jokes on people.

Although the marriage of The Royaltones to the Ramrods was odd, it was a treat to hear some unsung heros of teen instrumental music. The title song was not the biggest hit by the Royaltones, \\"Poor Boy\\" was their biggest seller. There is a bit of latin flavor through a lot of the songs, and a real sense of humor comes through. As the eldest child of the lead sax player, Ken Anderson, my opinion might be a bit biased. He passed away in 1972 and there is a wealth of material here that I didn't even know existed. I loved every minute of it. And the Ramrods were pretty good, too, if just a bit gloomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Shame.","review":"I've always had good luck with Verbatim, and hopefully this is just a fluke, but it appears that Verbatim has gone the way of the overwhelming number of companies that don't care what kind of garbage they foist off on their customers.

The product states that all of the discs are stable rewriting performance for up to 1000 times. To clear that up that means that it can be wrote on and then erased for over 1000 times and it will still perform and no data lost. If you are storing some pretty important data you need this item. It has what Verbatin calls SERL. What this is is a special laying on the disc which only this unit type has and it is the best i have ever used in my life of copying data and pics to a CD.

Even more protections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four discs so far = Four coasters :-(","review":"My experience with Verbatim goes back to 5.25\\" floppy disks. I've always had a high regard for their products. That opinion has changed, though.These DVD+RW discs, the first I have used from Verbatim, exhibit a much higher number of write errors than any DVD+RW disc I have used. My DVD software then times out on the write, the OS notes a write error, and I get a warning that the disc is unreadable/unwriteable. Cannot be reformatted or used in any way. The first three discs off the spindle blew up after a few writes. The fourth disc lasted about a month before it developed read errors.Verbatim claims a warranty on their dics, but I doubt that many people take them up on that, as it's an enormous hassle. Better that the discs just work in the first place. These discs obviously don't.Since storage media must be reliable, I won't be purchasing Verbatim DVD+RWs in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable DVD RW","review":"DVD-RW disks are hard to find in the stores.

We were able to improvise and use a camcorder shoulder strap though.It does work really well. It just hooks over your suitcase, through the handle, and you clip the top tether and LATCH hooks to it. It's nice because you can then set bags or other lighter objects inside the car seat while pulling the suitcase, to help free up hands.Like I said though. For what it is, it is WAY overpriced.

I was planning on traveling from Virginia to Oregon (with a layover in ATL) with a 15 month old and a 2 1/2 year old - by myself. I thought I would be able to strap the carseat to the carry on. I did not plan on having my son in the carseat while strapped to the suitcase. Once I received the strap thing I realized that there was NO way it would work on a carry on. The suitcase would have to be at a huge angle in order for the carseat to not drag on the floor. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"The simplicity in the design of this product makes it shine. It's small and easy to carry/store (will fit in a pocket), and it is made with quality materials. Very easy & quick to use. I used it only to attach our car seat to my roll-aboard suitcase, but did not have my 11 month old ride in the seat. We had a stroller for our virgin journey. However, I do plan to use it again in a few months when we travel across the country, and will be putting my son in it during that trip. After watching other parents struggle to carry their car seats through the airport and security checkpoints, I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penny wise, pound foolish","review":"Sounds like a great idea, until you look at the Safety Warning: \\"-We are not liable for damage to your suitcase or car seat caused by use of this product.\\"You're going to strap 40-50 lbs of kid and seat to a carryon with little dinky wheels and a simple tube handle? That's just asking for the handle to get bent, or the wheels to break off the bottom while your kid is riding on it. Look at the wheels on any stroller, or for that matter the Gogo Kidz Travelmate, and then look at the wheels on your carryon. They are *not* built to take that kind of weight. So you might be saving the $60 by not getting something like the Travelmate, but give it a little time and you'll probably be spending more replacing your suitcase.Bottom line: Could be real useful for carrying an empty carseat, if the suitcase isn't packed with much weight. Put a kid in it, and it'd be a good way to destroy a suitcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for us","review":"The concept is great-simple and easy. But the strap did not wrap around our suitcase-it just did not fit our Britax carseat So, we invented our own with a booster seat strap and clipped it in place-no problem. Amazon as always was great in providing a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for toddlers","review":"I bought this for my grandson. He is only two but this item did not work for him. His mother tried to use it to help her get through the air port. Unfortunately, she was unable to move the suitcase with the car seat attached and ended up having to carry the car seat in her hand while holding her toddler's hand and also toting a 7 mth old in a sling. They need to put in their ad that their is a weight limit so someone else does not waste their money as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked perfectly, reasonable price...","review":"After reading several reviews, primarily the negative ones to see what issues people had, I ordered the straps anyway...figuring what's $15 if they don't work that well?They worked very well and were absolutely worth the money! You do need a strong suitcase to handle the extra weight and torque and packing it full is a necessity, but that's easy enough to accomplish. We primarily used the straps once we were through security and during our three hour layover in Denver, so no complaints on the length of time to hook everything up. But I can understand how it would be a nuisance if you try to use it the entire time; unhooking everything before and after security, etc.Our daughter loved riding in the car seat and thought she was pretty cool! Plenty of curious looks from other passengers and a few comments on how neat these were.I definitely recommend them, just keep your expectations realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"We got this for a trip including changing planes. It worked well and we were glad to have it. Only complaint is that it is a bit of a pain to stop and attach it every time you get off the plane, through security, etc... We will use it again, it is useful and nice to have. Did not use it as a stroller, only attached it to the luggage to carry it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"Our car seat and rolling suitcase were within the product's specs but the car seat frequently scraped the floor. We followed the instructions to the letter and we tightened the LATCH straps as far as they would go, but the seat was still quite wobbly. I wouldn't dream of using it as a stroller. On the return trip, we simply gave up and hand-carried the car seat through the airport, which was no picnic when we already had two young children and other carry-ons to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but...","review":"I'm giving this product two stars just for the concept alone. I read previous reviews here and thought this would be the solution to traveling with a toddler in an airport/airplane. Wrong! It was such a hassle having to un-strap the carseat at security, strap it back on, and then having to un-strap it again at the gate! I guess this product would be \\"great\\" if you're not traveling alone with your child. This contraption was such a pain to deal with. I recommend getting a sturdy carseat bag and putting the carseat in that, and using an umbrella stroller to get around the airport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job!","review":"Was very nice to use this on the trip with my son.

We had to use bungee cords instead to attach the car seat, but my son couldnt sit in it. Probably better to attach the car seat to a stroller and then gate check the stroller. The Childress stroller bag was easy to use, so that's probably what we will do next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I chose to buy this product for a recent trip with my daughter. We wanted to gate-check her car seat but I didn't want to carry a 20+ pound Britax Boulevard through the airport.When my order arrived I was a bit disappointed. I didn't think there was any way the strap would work--it looked so small! However, it turned out to be perfect. It was very simple to use and I had no problem attaching my daughter's huge car seat to a 16\\" wheeled suitcase. It was so easy to use that I had no problems detaching the seat to get through security and quickly reattaching the seat after we passed through.I think this is a great product for a casual traveler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing EVER!","review":"I flew standby from ATL to MEM with a 18 month old and a 6 week old by myself. (Yeah, I'm crazy). This carseat travel accessory save my sanity. It basically turned my suitcase into a stroller. I was able to have my toddler in the newly created \\"stroller\\" and carry my baby in a baby bjorn and remain hands free which is priceless. Plus, I didn't have to check any baggage which is a lifesaver when traveling standby.I highly recommend this product. It is the best carseat travel accessory and the cheapest in price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work well","review":"The thing about this strap is that it uses the latch system on the car seat. So you have to adjust for the suitcase. Then adjust for the car. Then adjust for the suitcase again. I am travelling alone with my son. There is no way one person can work this. So unless your going to be traveling with someone I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for us!","review":"This strap really did work well for us. We just made sure we had a rolling carry on with wheels that were in good shape. You simply attach the car seat to your luggage with this handy strap using the latch straps already on your car seat. It really is a genius idea. It made catching connecting flights a lot easier with our 19 month old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best little product!","review":"This attachment made our trip to the airport so much easier! Everyone thought it was super clever and useful. It was easy to use and made carrying our 2yr. old and her stuff a breeze! I would suggest that you place all of your \\"must haves\\" in the luggage itself in the event there is lost luggage. We also put my daughter's DVD player and toys in as well. Having her safely secured in her car seat on the plane was perfect for my active child who would have most certainly squirmed out of the seat belt and created havoc on the plane.One other tip is to have your toddler on a child safety leash/backpack (we have the one that looks like a stuffed monkey from Wal Mart) throughout the airport to burn off that energy, then by the time you need to have them secured in the seat, he/she is ready for a nap.Going thru security took a little more coordination but because we didn't have to carry that much, it wasn't that hard. Good luck, this is a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Sit N Stroll","review":"We bought two Sit-N-Strolls as well as these straps (to attach to Britax Marathon seats), and compared them both prior to our flights. We are REALLY happy we chose to go with the straps. It eliminated the need for two more hands to carry either car seats or the additional luggage, and saved us a bunch of money compared to the Sit-N-Strolls.When passing through the metal detector, we simply kept the top ring attached to the car seat. No Problem.One note: I have an older (I don't even think they make them any more) carry-on that has a solid extension handle, which didn't have a place for the top strap to pass through. We had to use a case with a more common handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could make something better myself.","review":"Great idea but needs altering. I would just use a click-locking tiedown strap instead. It would go tighter than this device I actually bought. The carseat would just barely drag on the ground when connected to the carry on. I had the anchors and latch as tight as they would go but it still wasn't tight enough from keeping the carseat from touching the ground unless you had the bag tilted so much that your back was breaking from your hand almost touching the ground. My husband just ended up carrying the carseat by hand the whole time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect solution","review":"This was the perfect solution for toting the carseat. We attached it to a carry-on size suitcase (just as shown in the picture) and my daughter rode it everywhere. It is very easy to use and of course easy to carry and store when not in use. I have recommended it many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This is truly a great product. I followed one of the reviewer's advice and got the cheapest (this) car seat accessory for my trip to Taiwan. My one year old daughter loves it in the airport when she pulled around. She loved it when we arrived and fall sleep in to as well. Thanks foe inventing this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be better","review":"I have a newer car seat and it is heavier because it is a all in one car seat. When you attached the car seat to the carry on bag it was too heavy to pull without my child in it so I ended up having to lug the car seat on the carry on bag and push a stroller in front of me. All by myself for this last trip. And my carry on bag was not strong enough for the car seat because my handles are bent from just the car seat. My suggestion is definitely pack your bag then attach the car seat at home before you leave to see if it will actually be worth the hassle. Also if you go on a small charter plane you have to detach the car seat and carry all of your stuff including your child to the seat. Not always easy or fun to do by yourself. But I do love the idea I wish it was thought out a little bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful contraption, but $14 seems a bit steep for a nylon strap with D-rings LOL","review":"I decided to purchase this since my 2.5 year old daughter is a SPRINTER! It was her first time flying, and I didn't want to have to chase her all over the airport, so I strapped her in her carseat and attached this strap to my carryon. It was pretty easy to maneuver it --my carryon weighed about 20-25lbs. and she weighs approx. 35lbs. I just can't believe it costs $14 for a nylon \\"T\\" strap! They are makin' a profit on this little thing! I only ended up using it once, and then just carried her carseat since she wanted to walk and roll the carryon. But, it DID work like it said it was supposed to, so I was happy with it! It was definitely a lifesaver (when the little escape artist was actually strapped in her carseat)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier than dragging a carseat through the airport!","review":"Though we haven't been brave enough to try putting our child in it while hooked to our carry-on rollerboard, we use it to have one less thing to pull through the airport. Works as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"very clever product","review":"These straps worked out well for carrying the carseat through the airport, but I wouldn't let my toddler ride in the seat for two reasons:#1- The seat was not that stable- it moved from side to side#2- Our carry-on does not push well and I wouldn't want to drag my kid through the airport.But if you're planning on bringing a stoller anyway, this worked out great for us and saved us a lot of money.Another thing...you have to take the car seat off before boarding the plane because the car seat is too wide to pull through the ailse (we have a Britax marathon). We found this out the hard way on our departing flight, but coming home I just asked the airline staff to put it on the plane before boarding so we didn't have that extra thing to carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"We've traveled twice with this product and feel it was worth every penny. Like one of the other reveiwers I was a little suprized when I received the package and there wasn't much to it, but I wish I would have invented this thing.Our son loves traveling with his car seat and this was a great way to keep him in his seat in the airport as well. It made transfering planes much easier than what we had experienced in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Britax Advocate","review":"This does not work with the Britax Advocate. The straps are too long and it doesn't tighten enough. It would work if it was an actual suitcase but not a carryon type suitcase. You can save yourself the money and just buy a metal ring. We used that to attach the latch and tether strap. I used a ring off an old purse. Save your money and buy a metal ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This was a lifesaver in the airport! Our son was comfortable in his carseat and rode through the airport comfortable and without complaining. It was easy to attach and detach once you got the hang of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for airports","review":"This product is made specifically for car seats, and I highly recommend it for air travel. It is very easy to use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this","review":"With all the rave reviews, I figured this was the product for us. Boy was I mistaken. I read most reviews and tried all the tricks, suit case was full and it never was tight enough. I have a Britax Roundabout 55 and was using a 20\\" carry on bag. After several attempts, it still was not working. We ended up not bringing any car seats, rented them from the car place and worked like a charm. I do not think it would have been wise trying to push this through the airport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This product does what it says it will do. Maybe it was the suitcase that we used or the size and height of our car seat (Britax Boulevard) but sometimes the bottom of the car seat would hit/drag on the ground. Also, depending on how long the handles are on your carry on, you may have to really angle the suitcase so that the car seat is not hitting the ground. Otherwise the straps were very easy to get on and our toddler didn't mind be carted around the airport attached to a suitcase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, not very applicable","review":"Unless you have a very sturdy carry-on (and I mean VERY sturdy), this item will ruin your luggage.The idea is good, but car seats with kids on them tend to be quite heavy, and our 80$ samsonite carry-on was almost ruined after using this for a couple of hours. The wheels buckled outwards because of the weight added, and even after unstrapping them, it wouldn't run as smooth anymore. I guess luggage are designed to withstand a certain load in them, and adding that much unbalanced weight can make them fail, which is what ended up happening.It is also expensive for what it is. You can mimic the same behaviour by just getting a ring, and strapping the car seat hooks on it (2 sides, and top hooks used to lock the car seat in position in the car).I give it 2 stars for the idea. It might work to just move your car seat around and not have to carry it, but definitely not with a toddler in it (my daughter was only 1 when we tried this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best traveling investment to date!","review":"I purchased this in preparation for my first solo trip across country with my 14-month-old son. And wow, am I ever glad that I did! It worked perfectly with my 22-inch rolling bag and (rather heavy) Diono Radian car seat. My son enjoyed riding in it, and I received many comments/complements from flight attendants, pilots, and fellow passengers about how cool and smart it was. I practiced with it a couple of times at home before we left, and by the time we we're at the airport, it was a breeze to undo and reattach at security.One caveat, though. I did have to use a different roller bag than I'd planned on, because I found that the weight of the carseat when attached kind of threw off the allignment of the bag with multidirectional spinner wheelsi. Howver, it worked perfectly with the fixed-wheeled bag.Honestly, if you travel like I do, with multiple carry-ons and a big, squirmy toddler, this will be the best 15 bucks you ever spend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY ON, EASY OFF","review":"THIS WAS GREAT ON OUR TRIP.

I would recommend this to anyone carrying around a car seat at the airport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This was such a great idea! Easy to use, very secure, and my little guy had a GREAT time rolling around with it.

I'm currently ordering a second one after losing our first one mid-trip, which made the trip home much harder without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a strap","review":"This is just a strap that wraps around the piece of luggage and the carseat. I don't know any pieces of luggage that will withstand the weight of a carseat with a child in it, along with the weight of whatever is in the luggage. Not to mention the level of trust that you would have to have in this little strap in order to use it to carry your children around. This thing is just about useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just a strap, not a car seat roller","review":"I was careless when I looked at the picture of this item on the website in that I thought it was a full roller that carried the car seat. It is not; it is merely a strapping mechanism to attach to a rolling piece of carry-on luggage, which I don't think is necessarily practical depending upon the type of carry-on luggage. Instead we got a Go-Go Baby roller device, which is like a luggage roller, which is more expensive, but works very well. I am returning the Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!

I had to call Happy Mothers, and then they had to manually adjust my order so that I would get the correct item. Now, it will take 6-7 days just for them to ship the correct item. Hopefully, I'll get the correct one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"make traveling easier","review":"I wouldn't have made it without this. Worked like a charm.

So first off- when you receive this item, in the tiny little box, you won't believe that it will do ANYTHING, let alone what it can do...especially when you see what it looks like when you take it out. Just a strap, with a few attachments. But REALLY. This works! Our son is in a Britax Marathon seat, and he weighs 37 pounds. I easily figured out how to attach his seat, and adjust the height to keep it off the ground, to our rolling carry on. It only took me about 5 minutes, and I am so pleased with this product, I truly wish that I had invented it myself! Genius!

It is a lifesaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I thought this was a great idea and was glad to find an alternative to a 200 dollar car seat stroller device. However, this was quite a disappointment. It was pretty unstable even though I tightened it as far as it would go. It also broke my suitcase. It wasn't a cheap suitcase either but it broke the wheels off anyway. I ended up having to drag my daughter and suitcase around the airport on the last leg of our 16 hour trip. I was traveling alone so it sucked big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVED the idea -- but you DON'T need it!!!!","review":"I showed my husband the picture of this item because I thought it looked pretty darn smart. Well, two minutes later he had the carseat attached to the rolling carry on WITHOUT an added purchased strap. You still use the seat hooks from your car seat - both side clips and the top clip. Put the top car seat hook under the top handle of your luggage & the side ones simply around the sides of the luggage. Buy a $0.50 metal ring from a hardware store & clip the car seat hooks to it & tighten all straps. Voila! We tested it with our kiddo in it & she giggled as we wheeled her around the house. Perfect. Now I can easily transport my kid, carry on luggage & the car seat while I travel with her solo. Super easy to detach and reattach while my child is sitting in the seat buckled in (not running around the airport ;) Luggage must be full (duh) and helps if your carry on has larger wheels & a longer handle, mine doesn't but still super easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, lousy physics","review":"We got this as well as a car seat bag with wheels. I was not going to pay $200 for a car seat/stroller combo, so we picked 2 alternatives. I was hoping that the Traveling Toddler would be great, but I found that it too much torque and stress on the suitcase. To add the weight of my car seat (a Britax) and my 22 pound 1 year old was just too much weight for the handle of the suitcase. It felt awkward and unstable. The physics of it just did not work. So, we put the seat in a bag with wheels and dragged it behind us. The bag was also better for our trip because we fly stand-by and wait and see what seats are left. There was no more window seats available on one of our flights, so we gate checked the seat and I was happy to know that it was protected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally not worth it...","review":"This item was simple enough to use, but the effectiveness was anything but worthwhile.

The strap strikes me as a bit expensive for what it is, essentially a T luggage strap with hooks on the end, but it worked perfectly.Our daughter enjoyed riding around the airport and I enjoyed pulling her quickly instead of putting her in a carrier on my back and limiting how much can be carried over my arm.The straps are sturdy and the directions are very clear.

I haven't written a review before but I had to because I loved this thing. I traveled with 2 boys (3yrs & 1yr) and managed to fly across the country with no problems. Yes, you have to take it off at security, but you have to take your child out of any carrier, and the straps should go back on easily. (You will have to tighten a little again, but you can do that with your child strapped back in.) And nothing is going to make your Britax Marathon fit down an aisle but the flight attendants were very helpful. SO much easier than the go go baby travel mate with the screws!

I shared it with ten of our holiday party guests to invite their feedback before giving it to my children in case I was somehow missing something indeed worthy of praise. All agreed that this was a disturbing book for children that serves more to add to their existing ideas of what's scary, has no advice on dealing with these fears and offers nothing to promote their self-confidence.

The connector to the spray wand broke off during my first use session.(I have replaced the thin-walled plastic part with a brass part. I have replaced the cheap plastic hose clamps with real clamps to stop the leaks. The pickpup hose is curled so that the pickup screen would not stay near the bottom of the tank.

Without regurgitating all the details, I needed at least 1 gallon per minute to achieve the dilution recommended - even if I were able to go 1 mile per hour on my tractor - and I was simply unable to achieve this.If something is advertised I expect result at least close to specifications.

When full or near full the liquid solution comes out of the top where the hoses enter the tank spilling in areas not intended for the spray.

When the switch is turned off after spraying, solution continues to drain from the boom at a fairly substantial rate. I have to turn the valve off to stop the flow.3. There is no way that this unit will put out the maximum amount of solution that is advertised.I also own another spray rig from Northern Supply that does not have the above problems. I chose to buy this rig since I needed a bigger tank and it has its own wheels.

Many people ask where are the men who want to marry young, though? This is a weakness of the book, maybe the author doesn't have the answer (she found a millionaire, lucky for her). What do the rest of us do? A point she makes is that marriage isn't as good a deal for men as it used to be. This seems to me to be true. Why should they want to support and protect us anymore? The feminists and their allies (who included many, many men) mocked women who wanted to marry and have kids, mocked the male supporter role, in fact any distinct role for men, so like now, we even have women boxers, women soldiers, etc. Who is surprised that so many men want to bail?

Not all women want the knight in shining armor, white picket fence and 2.5 children.The women's movement allowed women to explore all of their options. Unfortunately, as the book points out, juggling career, house and family is impossible. Women who try to do it all are selfish, and because of their selfishness, something has to give.But it still overlooks those of us who have explored our options and decided family life is not for us.

If she wrote a book and edits a paper she is working full time. I also thought the way she rips apart women throughout her book is appauling. She consistently bashes the movement (the work of those old women in the park) that provided her the opportunities she now has as a writer. The feminist movement happened so women could choose what they needed to do as individuals and be valued for it. I choose to mother full time and the author obviously does not. Without the feminist movement I would be the only one feeling fulfilled in her occupation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloom and Doom","review":"What a depressing book! I wasn't unhappy before I read this book, but I sure am now! This was not a helpful book in the slightest for anyone wrestling with the stay at home, go to work issue. It is mostly an accusatory guilt trip for modern women! Her solution to this is to troll for a husband and crank out those kids early, and then you can go on to have a satisfying career while tose kids are safe in school. What utter nonsense! While I feel her premise that there is no substitute for a parent's care, there are alternatives to completely giving up one's career. For a really good perspective, read Cokie Robert's book about a modern woman balancing career and family. It can be done, and done well. The happy spin that this author put on the 1950's parent is a view a lot of overworked moms are now clinging to.

Crittenden assumes that all women would benefit from marrying young and forgoing careers to have babies in their twenties. It MIGHT work - if the woman is lucky enough to get a first-rate education and find a man who is wealthy enough to support her and moral enough not to divorce her. The rest of us (and that's about 95%) will just have to tough it out and invest in our careers. The reality is that most people who marry young wind up divorced, and that with no-fault divorce there is NO guarantee of life-long marriage anymore. Crittenden also condescendingly imagines that no woman in her 30's can possibly attract a decent men - her \\"shelf life\\" has expired.

I don't mean to sound cruel, it's just that I don't see what is inspiring in this book. Many, many, many people have lost lovers to tragedy, have been severely injured and experienced heartache, have had a tough childhood. That does not necessarily make an inspiring book. The center of this book contains about 50 full color modeling photos of Petra. A couple of them would have been enough.

The Ryobi that I gave away last year had only one speed and claimed to have the same rpm. It was, in fact, weaker. Perhaps it has an inferior motor. I don't know but this one left wax even though I flipped the terry cloth pad and followed up with a lambs wool (not included) pad. My dad has a variable speed Ryobi that he says is good. Neither Home Depot or Osh sold anything worth getting.

This being said it was HORRIBLE doing that size of RV, but could not have gotten the job done without the power tool.For a big job, be sure to have LOTS of terry cloth bonnets.

The way a chinchillas hands and feet are built, it is extremely easy for their claws to get stick in the mesh pattern of this wheel. If this happens and the injury is not caught in time, it could lead to serious issues, such as amputation of the leg that was damage. Furthermore, the wheel has side spokes (The bars that go across the middle on either side.) Chinchillas like to run, then jump out of the wheel, and because of this behavior it is very dangerous to use a wheel with side spokes, as their tails could get caught in it.If you're getting this product for a rat or mouse, it's safer, but I still wouldn't fully trust it. I advise finding a wheel that's solid, and has no spokes on the side.

The administrators of most plans come either from the world of finance or human resources, which in either case provides only a portion of the skills necessary to administer a plan. This book provides an excellent summary of the responisibilites and liabilites of a plan administrator. It makes you fully aware of the extremely high standard imposed by federal law.

As to their first album (made all in a rush after they won the show), I didn't buy it but, well, it could have been much worse. So when their second release Retiens-moi came out, I gave it a try. And I was REALLY disappointed. The music is so bad, I can't even describe it. I am not even sure I would call it music, actually. It's all beats and nothing more. Their voices are most irritating and do not fit with the musical surrounding at all. I listened to the songs a few times and cannot even remember any of them.

The songs vary from exciting invocations of Hindu spiritual beings to gentler, sleepier, more haunting almost \\"lament-style\\" songs influenced by other parts of the world. The sound quality is strong and professional.This is definitely \\"experiencial music\\" - music that makes you feel transported to a dessert with the hot winds whipping through your hair, and ancient temples crumbling in the sand.

This book traces the story of Henry VIII's sister, Mary who first wed the elderly King of France. Upon his swift demise, Mary pursued and won the man she wanted, Charles Brandon. For a while she was banned from court for daring to marry for love, instead of dynastic reasons. From this marriage, her offspring and their descendants would be tightly controlled by the subsequent Tudor monarchs, Edward V, Mary I and Elizabeth I.While focusing on primarily Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Mary Tudor, all other descendants (primarily female) are also discussed. The complication succession to the throne made a minefield which ruined many lives.The book is very well written and quotes extensively from original sources. I would recommend it and any other Plowden books to anyone interested in Tudor England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high quality popular history","review":"Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, was not only the brother-in-law of Henry VIII but also his best friend; after the king's own children, Brandon's descendants were named heirs to the crown. The duke's granddaughter, Jane Grey, died for her legacy at the age of sixteen, a Protestant intellectual challenging the accession of the Catholic Mary Tudor. Jane's sister Catherine subsequently ruined her chances to become heir-presumptive to Elizabeth I by her unauthorized marriage to the earl of Hertford -- and then by presuming to give birth to a healthy son (seven of whose close relatives lay buried headless under the chapel in the Tower where he was christened).

I did like the ending, but if I could do it over, I wouldn't have wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this show for really?","review":"Most people who tune in to watch a TV show entitled Robin Hood probably fall into three groups. The first two are closely related: people who like Robin Hood and medieval junkies (like myself). The third group are people who just want a fun show to watch and who don't care about period accuracy or the legends at all. This show is aimed at the latter group, which doesn't much real sense.Season 3 of this new incarnation looks much better than 1 and 2, but there are still daft choices which might be OK if the show was set in a fantasy land. A female sheriff of Nottingham (??), a black Friar Tuck (???!) and the odd ninja weapon (?????!!!!). All this makes it very hard to take seriously.For me, this show will always be squarely in the shadow of the old 1980s Robin of Sherwood TV show, imperfect as it was. One thing both versions have in common are the arbitrary decisions to write out Maid Marion in unsatisfactory ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"chuck it and start over","review":"Season one was pretty entertaining and season two was pretty good too. A bit too politically correct at time and a few episodes were poor in taste and quality but, in general, quite an entertaining show and most were good. Season 3 is a waste of time and effort. The writers should (must) be replaced (was there a writers strike in the U.K.? Must have been). Still, I hope the failure of season 3 doesn't mean the end of the show but that they will go back to the beginning and miraculously bring back some key characters they've killed off (find a new Marian, Allan, etc.) and start over and kind of pretend season 3 never happened. Hopefully, they'll go back to fun and somewhat realistic escapes and rescues and develop the characters they have and the comradery between them. Season three is a waste but we'll see what the result will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Columbo: Mystery Movie Collection 1990","review":"I thought I had all of Columbo's DVD and was pleasantly surprised to find this one.Have enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Columbo movies 1990","review":"These were great, typical \\"Columbo\\" movies.

Having said that, I agree with a previous review that stated that Columbo belonged in the 70's and should have stayed there. Sure, I guess substandard Columbo is better than none at all, but these later episodes (anything following season 7) pale in comparison to seasons 1 through 7. Weak loose scripts, D list guests stars, MAJOR continuity errors, poor acting and terrible use of music all fly in the face of what the original seasons brought to the table.

Also, unlike the the series, the movies have a lot of sexual situations which are not intriguing in any way and just look ridiculous. Plus, the 90s style was so tacky--the clothes, hairstyles, interior design... Everyone is trying to look cool but look silly instead.

His only desire is to be reunited with his lost love, Ermizhad, but instead he is pulled into the dimension of the Six Realms, where he meets Ulrich Von Bek who has escaped from the Nazis on Earth into this realm. The Six Realms are an area where six different worlds inhabited by very different cultures and races come together through a number of interdimensional gates. Daker soon learns of a plot by the forces of Chaos to conquer all the realms and knows that it is his mission as the Eternal Champion to stop that from happening.This is one of the better examples of Moorcock's fantasy adventure style. The different realms have creative, if fairly limited, cultures, and the depiction of Hell is interesting. It is nothing groundbreaking, but is a solid conclusion to the Erekose sequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming tale","review":"I enjoyed this novel because of the quietness.

This collection of articles is merely a descriptive to moralistic commentary, put into some complicated academic and semi-activist style. The level of their analysis is desperately shallow.

The generic battery I bought doesn't hold much of a charge after a dozen uses. Also, double check the voltage and capacity (mAh) of the generic, often times they're cheaper because they're underpowered and have less capacity.

The holographic label on Canon's package is completely different. The Vortex batteries fell out of the package, Canon's package must be torn apart to get to the batteries. The labels are slightly different. The Vortex batteries are shinier and darker, the cover does not stay on the Vortex batteries.Buyer beware!!!!Go to BH Photo Video or Adorama to be sure you're getting the real deal.

Luckily, I was shooting outside and didn't need the flash, so the Canon battery held out once I put it back in. The backup battery doesn't seem to hold a charge now.

This one was so expensive I thought it had to be authentic. It arrived 4 days late. I question the authenticity of this \\"Canon\\" battery - Cheap cardboard packaging had faded colors, instructions on paper of low quality, the label on the battery was a faded off-color, not like any of my OEM Canon parts, there was no punched hold in the cheap plastic tray to use orientation to indicate charged/not. I can't prove this is a knock-off counterfeit - but even the \\"hologram\\" looks fake. I have more faith when Amazon does the fulfillment directly, and I thus hesitate to use 3rd parties for this category of product.

The Chinese push out their crappy knock-offs to unsuspecting consumers (like I was) just to make a quick buck. Also, don't trust the glowing reviews from the generic sellers. They are self-generated.

The ending itself was extremely disappointing, I've rarely felt so let down by a book as I was by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too extreme...","review":"A note that I would give this book a 2.5 Stars if that were an option.I first became fascinated by Sheri S. Tepper's writing after reading the surreal _Singer From the Sea._ I first heard about this book mentioned in reviews of Singer. Let me just say that it's not nearly as fascinatingly-written as Singer was, and several scenes of sadomasochism (among other gross items) rather ruined a good deal of it.The plot is good enough but the beginning skips around a lot. There's several subplots and sub-major characters that don't all come together until of the book is over and done with. I did enjoy the reversed society where women are more important than men. That's definitely something of a \\"new\\" concept.Over all, read this only if you don't mind occasionally disturbing scenes. If you really want to read a good book by Sheri S. Tepper, I'd suggest _Singer From the Sea._"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing and Deus Ex-Machina rule in this book.","review":"Ms. Tepper starts with an interesting premise and an interesting puzzle. Unfortunately somewhere around two thirds of the way through the book, the puzzle becomes evident and the climax which happens later seems forced and not really a true climax. This book could have used several rounds with an editor. It appears to this reader that the book got read by someone who pointed out a few flaws causing Ms Tepper to make some changes. Those changes were not reflected everywhere in the book.Once again Ms. Tepper insists on having a moral too her story and rather than leaving it to the reader to pull the moral from the story, she insists on hitting the reader over the head with it. Whether you agree or not with Ms. Tepper, I find having a position forced makes for unnatural and uncomfortable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Pay Ninety-nine Cents, You Get About Five Cents Worth.","review":"This book is a great disappointment and a vast wasteland. It's TERRIBLE. I bought it because I read 'The Companions' by the same author and THAT was a great book. I was expecting something along the same lines but, instead, I got rubbish. I got incomprehensible, verbose, inane gibberish. I got feminist lunacy. I got a Dempsey Dumpster. I had to struggle to stay interested enough to read the first four chapters. I used speed-reading to browse through about six more. Then I gave up. The book got less and less interesting; more and more useless, stupid and trite. What did the author do? Toss a bunch of flowery words into the hopper, spin it up to max rpm and let it spew a hodgepodge out the chute? Most likely.Don't waste your money - don't waste your time.

Penguin gave both their coveted \\"Rosette\\" rating along with a \\"Recommended Recording\\" citing while Gramophone richly rewarded both CD's with the top \\"Gramophone Award\\" for chamber music that year. When these two major reviewers agree like that, one can be assured something special is there which is the case with this CD. (but the sound quality is hardly best-in-class).Faure is something of a neglected French Romantic composer hiding in the shadows of Debussy, Ravel and others. Yet, his music is some of the most equisite, beautiful and rewarding - from the Violin Sonatas (Tomes/Osostowicz) to the Piano Trio (Floristan Trio w/Tomes) to the Piano Quartets here.

Firstly, you do not need to be a particular nationality or type of person to like Marmite. That's just ridiculous. Secondly, it is not a \\"cultural thing\\" to enjoy savory or \\"umami\\" foods, any more than it is cultural to like sweet, sour, bitter, or salty flavors. You either like it or you don't. Does everyone like double fudge ice cream? Incredibly, no. I find Marmite delicious, but potent. I think many times people don't enjoy it because they've eaten a gob straight from the jar or they spread it like jam. That's too much!

Upon closer inspection I found that the basin had developed tears at the bottom seams where the basin folds when you collapse it down for travel use.I'm a little disappointed that this would happen this quickly after use, but I also understand that this sort of thing happens from time to time. Since I'm still in the midst of my vacation I'll have to find time to reach out to Coleman to see inquire what or how they'll address this."},{"rating":"1","title":"too flimsy for car camping, too heavy for backpacking","review":"This thing leaks. I ended up throwing it in the garbage awhile back after a couple of uses. I've gone back to using 2 plastic washtubs that don't take up that much more room (assuming you use them to store stuff in them).So for car camping I would go with something sturdier for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just not durable enough","review":"It only lasted one Camping trip. The second trip it developed a leak at a place where it folds. Yes it folds for compact storage. I guess folding is a good idea to have it compact but not if the material can't take it. It's very thin material. I would have paid more for a durable one. I threw it in the trash at the camp grounds as it's not worth getting it replaced under warranty.We are now using a Rubbermaid 18qt clear storage box, we use for transporting camping stuff, as our sink. It is made of Polypropylene, it's tough, worked in an emergency and now it is the main solution. I bet I paid $10 for it at a local hardware store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"Poor PVC quality!

The sides of the wash basin do not stay up so you can wash the dishes and keep all of your water in. When we used it the sides were always colapsing whether there was a lot or a little water in the basin. I will not be using this item again. most likely throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless item","review":"My husband used this when camping. After the hot water was poured in, the basin became very soft and pliable. After about half way through washing dishes the first time, a hole came in the rinse side. He did not get one whole load of dishes washed. He expected better from Coleman. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Big or Stay Home","review":"I really despised this Coleman PVC sink and it now lives in my bin of rejected and unloved camping gear. I gave it a chance, but it is too small to be useful and very unstable. With hot water, it feels like a child's pool toy that's been left out in the sun. It was a waste of money. It won't last and will soon end up in a landfill. There are far better products out there.Seattle Sports Pack Sinksare larger and tougher. I use two of them when car camping. It costs more, but it works and makes the whole camping experience that much more enjoyable. Problem solved. You don't need to settle for this chintzy and cramped little piece of junk. Spend a little more for something that works and that you can depend on. Go big or stay home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty nice addition to our camp kit","review":"I really liked the idea of this piece & went ahead and got it. Definately works well, I didn't have a problem at all with the sides collapsing and water flowing out?? Not sure what the other reviewr experienced or why, but I found it to function just perfectly. I did however have a hard time walking back from the water spigot at the camp site to our kitchen tent with the double sink filled. I had to actually have someone else help me. We use our camp kitchen sink to wash dishes, one side of this collapsible sink to rinse and the other side we use with clean clear water + a capful of bleach to sanitize our dishware."},{"rating":"2","title":"very small","review":"We bought this double sink becaue we go camping every year and my father in law always uses a plastic tub. The picture is a little deceiving because it is tiny. Despite its size it still worked well, but if I had realized how small it was I would have gone with a different sink. The fact that it is double definitely made the purchase worth it though.

It is a simple item made entirely of plastic (with nylon straps) and is as pictured.After sitting in the gear box unused a few times out for short trips, I tried to use the product. There was a leak in one of the basins at the bottom, rendering half of the item useless. The plastic doesn't stand up to the folding induced when the item is stored (as delivered).The construction is poor and the materials are the cheapest available. Given how the product is folded for storage it is inevitable that it will leak and soon.The cost was low, but seeing as I was not able to fully use it once before breaking, it doesn't matter.Don't buy this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible produc","review":"As all campers, I am in pursuit of products that take up less space, durable, and serve a practical need. This product was attractive for its' space saving feature.First use it leaked, that was fixed with duck tape. Second, you cant fill it past halfway or it easily tips over and spills. Third, it is impossible to clean and a residue remains after the first use. Spilling and residue attract bugs and raccoons and they don't mix well with camping. Second time I used it the original hole widened so this thing went into the trash. It is plastic, with plastic parts and I expected a short life span but this didn't even make one trip. Very poor product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, quality control issues","review":"As some other reviewers mentioned happened to them, one side of our unit sprang a leak on its inaugural trip. The other side held up fine with no collapsing even without water in both bins. We used the leaky side as a holder between wash and wipe. It was helpful but not as helpful as the functional unit would have been.Given that some people love this and some hate it, I am wondering if the big issue is one of quality control. I am still thinking about replacing it hoping to get one of \\"the good ones\\".UPDATE 9/18/2011I did purchase a second one and when we opened this one there were two holes in it. We spent some time trying to figure this out, it is a great idea. Clearly others had successful ones. We wanted ours to work!

We used it so much on our last camping trip and don't know how we survived before. My wife stated the only thing that it lacked was a drain!We never used real hot water, but water sufficiently warm for washing. We used set on camp table and never had issue with collpse as many have made comment about. It is smaller, but it is sufficient for normal size plates.

The demonic creatures kills the tenets before the owner can collect the months payment...I like it when the cops come to investigate as they are just waiting for the landlord to slip up and make a mistake...the landlord always gets stuck cleaning up the mess that the demons leave behind (most of the time).

With all of the engagements, the breakups, the pregnancies(spelling?),the marriages and the proposals, you are always left guessing at the end of an episode. This is also how they ended the series. The ending is half happy but at the same time half sad. A couple splits up and a couple gets back together. A town comes together to show their love for one of their own.

The only good events were all the stuff with Lane and Zack, everything having to do with Rory though sometimes i wanted to put her through a wall and just leave her there, and the very last episode. The moment that i most cheered about was when Lorelia and Chris divorced. I jumped, literally jumped out of my chair when that one happened.

Every season was refreshing and exciting, and this last season started off the same, but the end seemed abrupt and wrong. Rory and Logan's ended relationship seemed to me like the writer was pulling a \\"That Girl\\", meaning that a woman couldnt have it all, there is no reason Rory couldnt have a relationship with Logan and pursue her career.

The main creator and writer of the show left after the 6th season. Season 7 the last season in the series was written by someone else and it never worked. It was not the same funny drama we had all been used to. They tried to duplicate the banter but failed miserably. The characters seemed like different people.

Still, in the end, it is a message of hope and faith in the human will. Not for all, it will cause all to question where they fall on this scale, and many will find themselves changed by the reading experience. Inspired, at least in part, by Daniel Keyes \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", it shares the sense of fatalism leading to inevitable conclusions we do not desire. This is not to say it is not a true piece of art, fully capable of standing alone on it's merit. Disch, like Sturgeon, has long been undervalued by the SF community as a whole. Here you see Disch at the top of his craft, with something to say and a unique, unforgettable way of expressing it.I believe many readers will identify with the central tenet of this book, that being that we all share a human condition, and there is no cure.Short and sweet, worth the read, and you'll end it all too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"Disch is probably the most underappreciated science-fiction author in the world. His novels have a power and a scope which is almost impossible to find in science-fiction. In England, apparently, he is condsidered to be one of the U.S.'s finest poets, as well as one of our best SF writers (kind of a strange combination, huh?). In Camp Concentration, Disch shows us insights into the world of Louis Sachetti. Torn by disease, posessed by brilliance, this is a character never before seen in science fiction. Brilliant new ideas, engrossing style, extraordinary characters, and one heck of a plot make this novel what it is. Extraordinary. Pringle said it was one of the 100 best of all time. Samuel R. Delany said it was one of the 3 best speculative novels of the 1960's. I'd say its the best to come out of the 60's, and I've read my fair share of New Wave SF (Aldiss, Ballard, Zelazny, Delany, etc.) I'd put it at number 3 all-time, behind The Stars My Destination and Mo! re than Human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concentrated Brilliance","review":"This novella is a burnished jewel of concentrated thought. Disch's hero is all too much like we are, and when he begins to experience the mind-expanding effects of his \\"therapy,\\" we watch his shifting perceptions register the pleasures and horrors of the change. His dry commentary on the other experimental subjects is by turns empathetic and dispassionate-- but always grimly fascinating. Disch has created an SF framework for this cold meditation on mortality, but it transcends the genre. The plot satisfies-- but it's the precise writing and the brittle and cynical philosophizing behind it that make this special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disch's Dystopia","review":"I am glad I accidentally found a used copy of this book and bought it. A lifetime sci-fi fan, I believe this novel belongs on the top 100 list of the greatest of all time, if not the top 50. The mind-numbing dystopia that Disch presents to the reader gets more convoluted and intense as the narrative goes on, with two fairly predictable twists and one final twist I'll wager you won't anticipate. But be warned, this is not a book for lightweights. There are tons of literary, cultural and religious references here, and they come at the reader fast and furious. I earnestly look forward to more Disch; Camp Concentration is surely the work of a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The godlike Disch.","review":"A noteworthy piece of literature, comparable I think with both Eco and Pynchon. This is written from the point of view of an intellectual - high on the mental equivalent of killer steroids, living in a commune of likewise mentally enhanced political prisoners. What I think is paticularly at issue, is the fact that Disch to some extent ( I think anyway ) satirises intellectualism, and knowledge's more exigent demands upon the human spirit ( as he did in 'the squirrel cage'). Hence the inmates scholarliness is synonymous with the drug / disease palladium. It is a book tinged with an inimicable sadness, and Sachetti's triumph when it comes, is realised at a price - does his 'transcendence' violate his conception of his own humanity?. Whatever. This is a very good book by a master of dark, dark parody. READ!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Worthless","review":"My book club read two books this last month, one of which (Daniel, by Keith Yocum) we rated among the best we've read, and Camp Concentration, which we rated the worst we've read, by far. Unfortunately for other people searching through Amazon's offerings, they will find that the two books are linked by Amazon's \\"Bought Together\\" and \\"Also Bought\\" side bars, I suspect, because our book club did buy the two together.We want to make it very clear that Daniel is an excellent read, and Camp Concentration is a complete waste of time. There, that clears our conscience- you've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"I read this book in 1982.

Anyone if even faintly familier with classical piano has heard of Rubinstein who is certainly considered one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century. Unfortunately he is not one of the great actors of the 20th century and this staged production done,I'm guessing for TV or the schoolroom,is truly pathetic. The film is dark and grainey and the fidelity is awful.I know this was made in 1953 so what should I expect? Better than this.There are some wonderful classical performances on DVD with supberb audio and video so maybe I'm spoiled. If your looking for a great recording of Rubinstein buy the Phillips Great Pianists of the 20th century 2 CD set. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Boy, A Stinker For Sure","review":"I really do hate writing bad reviews of Trek novels because I love Trek novels so much, but this has to be the worst novel based on Trek that I have ever read.

Your favorite characters meander in and out of the story uttering such absurd lines that you wonder if the author knows anything about \\"The Next Generation\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" generally. The story itself is clearly something that has been (badly) shoe-horned into \\"Star Trek\\" from some other genre. It could be an interesting premise of a story, but is just badly done. I would give this book zero stars if the option were available."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"This is one of the worst Star Trek books I have ever read. The story was flat. It just seemed to go on and on. The characters were so poorly written that you just could not get into the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want the last 4 hours of my life back!","review":"This book belongs in the children's' section - it reads like it was written for (and perhaps by) a 6th grader. It is clear that the author has no knowledge of the TNG characters beyond that of watching a few episodes. Their rich backgrounds and varied mannerisms in other books are reduced to caricatures of the characters - forget expansion of their stories, this is character contraction. This book started out bad, but just got worse. The destructive climax of the novel was resolved using a tired cliché, and the resolution evoked a deus-ex-machina solution that felt as bad as a reset-button trick. Forget saving your money - save the hours of your life that you are contemplating wasting with this load of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like all this author's books, it breaks the mold.","review":"People either seem to love this book or hate it. But this is true of all S.P. Somtow's books. I'm suprised to find him writing a Star Trek novel, but like his other works there's plenty of color, spectacle, lyrical writing, unusual imagery, and complex depictions of strange civilizations.I've noticed that when Somtow writes in a \\"borrowed\\" universe (like in his hilarious \\"V\\" novels and in his \\"Crow\\" book) there's often a twinge of irony. I think that a lot of people probably haven't noticed the satirical element in \\"Comet\\" ... that's what's escaping them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, poorly executed","review":"The execution of the writing is simply bad. The prose has a lyrical quality to it that is off putting and the characters are flat and dull. I really had no sympathy for any of them since they were cardboard cut outs. Familiar Trek characters didn't seem themselves. And were barely focused on. The back cover copy sounded so interesting but the writing let the premise down. I could barely make it through the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"rich and unusual -- a genuinely original star trek novel","review":"Many Star Trek novels deal in cliches or are just some other story remade with ST characters. This one presents a vividly imagined culture, a bit like India or some other exotic easterm country. The normal characters don't appear that much but the invented ones are complex and full of baroque motivations. The average ST novel reader might find the book weird, but it's definitely rewarding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book","review":"Though it bears a certainly similarity to one of S.P. Somtow's short stories from the \\"Inquestor\\" series of the 1980s, also about a comet who turns out to be human ... he's done a great job of revamping this very original tale and wedding it to the ST universe ... reviews seems remarkably controversial, with everyone either raving or hating it ... one could hardly expect less than controversy from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Readers Sleep?","review":"A wonderful title. Unfortunately the prose did not stand up to the same expectations. The idea of an interstellar war carried out at sub-light speeds creates a lot of possible twists and turns. At the halfway point of the story, I knew the out come and solutions. No surprises.The characters seemed flat, even the reoccurring ones. The plot showed no real motion. There seemed to be no action. As a novel about first contact, I felt S.P. Somtow never watched the episode focused on first contract. Picard and his crew interfered into a culture that never developed on their own.I was truly disappointed in this walk around the park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The whole thing just seemed \\"off\\", the characters, the narration. It's almost as if the author has no real understanding of Star Trek. This reads more like a standard SF fantasy rather than a ST story. The narration has this epic quality that seems way over the top, it's as if he's talking about a Norse adventure story. I find myself skimming the end because the plot is just so boring. There's no action, just some history that doesn't really make much sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really a Star Trek story?","review":"My opinion of this book is that the author tried to work in some kind of connection with Star Trek just to get it published. If I wasn't told, and there weren't some Star Trek characters (poorly portrayed) then I wouldn't have known it was ST. It would have been better to develop the story better and publish it on it's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It!","review":"I feel bad rating this book so low because I hate to give anything \\"Star Trek\\" a bad rap. I can't honestly recommend it to anyone with a clear conscience.

Unless you feel you've just got to read every Star Trek novel - skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfire","review":"There is some potential in this novel, particularly with the discussion of Thanet's religious beliefs. That potential is lost amid a sea of ambiguity that detracts from the overall story. The writer could have done a better job with it but missed the opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"This book has a very weak plot, for all that a synopsis of it sounds promising enough. The idea (sister planets engaged in a millennia-old interstellar war, headed towards mutual destruction) isn't very original, the handling of it is pretty shallow and silly, the characterizations are rather two-dimensional and cardboard, the dialogue is bland and stilted, and the ending is contrived. Other than that, it was great!Sadly, even with all of that, it's far from the WORST Star Trek novel I've ever read, which is why I rounded my 1.5 rating up to two, but seriously, unless you REALLY need a Star Trek fix and there just isn't anything else handy, I wouldn't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"Saw her open for Stars in NYC, and bought this record on the strength of her performance.

I'm not happy with them, but they are so cheap that it is not worth the shipping cost to return. I will donate and hope someone out there is happy with them.

It is more of a slick material that has a raised design on it in attempt to help in gripping (I say attempt, because it hardly works). In the photo, it looks as though there is a design in black on the opener, but the actual item is completely white and only has a raised pattern on it.

Thea King plays a basset clarinet, a reconstruction of the instrument for which these pieces were written; it has a richer tone and several lower notes than are available on modern clarinets. Because Mozart called for the full range of the basset clarinet, performances on modern instruments involve re-writing of the clarinet part; King brings us the notes that Mozart really wrote. Mozart achieves an amazing spirituality in the hauntingly beautiful slow movements of these works. The Concerto is wonderful, but the Quintet is a real revelation, and is alone worth the price of the disc. King handles the technical demands of the music with aplomb, all while playing with great feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one to have","review":"Hyperion, the English label, just became 20 years old, and selected the best 20 CD's.

Just listen to the unfolding wind and brass choir which opens the 2nd movement. Ms. King's clear articulation and subtle dynamics are spell-binding throughout.I am baffled by the 1-star reviewer whose juvenile screed evidently apes that of \\"some (as yet unidentified) clarinet teachers\\". Are we listening to the same recording? Can that reviewer educate us by citing particular examples where Ms. King's \\"sound and articulation are simply dreadful\\"? Or is it, as I suspect, that Ms. King is \\"simply dreadful\\" and \\"VERY UGLY\\" from start to finish?Thea King, who died in 2007, was one of the greatest clarinetists of the 20th century, as this wonderful performance clearly demonstrates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"Although the orchestra in this recording does sound quite good, Thea King sounds far below the professional level of many other recordings of this piece. Her sound and articulation are both dreadful. Some clarinet teachers have actually been known to give this recording to students as a way of showing them how NOT to play the clarinet!! Put very simply, THIS IS NOT PRETTY CLARINET PLAYING, IT IS VERY UGLY.Sabine Meyer, Harold Wright, and Robert Marcellus have all made wonderful recordings of this piece. If you are looking for a quaility recording, with a high level of artistry, those recordings are a great bet.

I go mountain biking 1 - 3 times per week in the Northeast (XC). Pretty hard stuff but no downhill - so I guess I don't pound it as hard as some of the hardcore riders that are posting. So far, this has been a very reliable mount - I have only lost the GPS unit one time. I think that I will begin using the lanyard as suggested by another rider. My biggest concern is vibration over time - will that damage the unit? The thing is built to military specs, so perhaps not.

Anyone who has been to Wisconsin knows that our roads can be very bumpy as a result of our harsh winters.

However, It should last longer than 6 months. If you register the unit, DeLonghi still won't honor the warranty unless you have the original receipt. Then, at your expense, you have to package it and ship it off to some distant repair station, unless you live in one of those few cities that have one. I'm sure DeLonghi knows that most people would not be willing to go through the expense of having the unit boxed and shipped.

It delves into the mind of the female characters of the book making the love and sex scenes that much more erotic ..Needless to say, this book and plot contains some very very strong women who are not hestiant in putting their finger, if other things, on what they really want and usually get.The story is set in 1870's Australia which is interesting since one could hardly accuse Austrlians of being a matriarchal society making women such as Melanie and delie that much more interesting ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too big for a mouse cable!","review":"This thing may be handy for large cables like power cables to your PC, but it certainly isn't intended for something like a mouse cable.

By all means check out this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, and Biased Besides","review":"This book gives short shrift to anything vampire-related that doesn't interest the author personally.

BUT the positives defintely outweigh them:1) A VERY efficient workout: 1 hour will give you weight training, cardio and stretching.2) Emphasis on upper body weight training, which I loved. You really see results in your sholders, more than with other Firm tapes.3) Nothing beats the Firm's high quality music. It's made for the workout, and perfectly complements it. It actually reduces your need to look at the screen, a plus when you're doing the floor section.4) PERFECT for weight loss, because you get your cardio AND weight training in just 1 hour, and YOU WILL SEE RESULTS IN 10 WORKOUTS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video for people who really want to lose weight","review":"This was one of the first Firm tapes I purchased and after all these years I still see results.I feel that anybody that truly is serious about losing weight and building muscle will see plenty of results.People who are dooming themselves to failure will not enjoy these tapes because you have to really work.There is none of that prissy aerobics where you can't even get your heart rate up.The Firm will definitely firm you up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is NOT a low impact aerobic workout!!!","review":"This video claims to be \\"low impact aerobics\\", but I can guarantee you, it is the very high impact.

It's well over an hour of solid sweating. Doing the video a day or two without weights would be a good idea, until you master the tricky steps. I get the feeling some of the quick bends with weights and fast repetitions might not be the safest, so I'm really careful with the knee bends, etc. It might be too much to do every day, but I use it every now and then when I need a good sweat.

I tried evenflow, medela, gerber, and parents choice bottles. LEAKED In all of them. This is a great price for nipples, and you might think you should stockpile ( I did, I bought a dozen) but it's not worth it, you get what you pay for. My choice for standard nipples is Playtex ventaire nipples. Since we began using those nipples NO LEAKS. In fact, we noticed no gas too, we switched to using almost allPlaytex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottles 9-Ounce, 3 Pack (Colors Vary)as our main bottle.

Our baby glugs down the contents of his bottle in what feels like under a minute, and then ends up spitting everything up. I also held 3 of the nipples under a trickle of water from the faucet to see what happens - not only do all of them leak out of the tip right away, they leak at different rates, so it doesn't seem like this company has very good quality control standards (one nipple had giant drops that came out maybe 2 per second, another had smaller drops that were about 4 per second). We are combining breastfeeding with bottle feeding and these nipples do not come close to emulating breastfeeding.

Very disappointing since I'm not sure where to find other nipples that will fit the glass bottles I prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too fast","review":"I tested mine with water before giving to my baby, and when I turned the bottle upside down, it is a straight flow , no drops, just a long straight flow. It is faster than the fast flow. This is ridiculous. I am returning this to the store. I recommend always checking before giving to your baby. He would have definitely chocked on this. I don't recommend these unless you are willing to go back and forth to the store and returning them after you find the ones that are actually slow flow.

The gameboard is warped and doesn't sit flat, so the pieces slides around and players lose their places. The card \\"ejector\\" doesn't work, period. We finally took the cards out and made a draw pile on the table, which pretty much wiped out the only possibly novel aspect of the game. My kids were bored silly, even though they thoroughly enjoyed the movie of the same name. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read these reviews","review":"Just set this up on Christmas morning and the card ejector only works about half of the time. This game is DEFINITELY NOT worth the money. I'd take it back but we already have all the stickers on the game. Even if the card ejector worked, it's not all that fun. No strategy or imagination at all- my 8 year old will most likely shelve this one and go back to Monopoly and scrabble."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I great disappointment if you have seen the movie. The cards in the game we have keep getting stuck and you have to constantly open up the back and fix the button to make the cards come out. The overall quality of the game is poor. You have to put the game together everytime you play it and the board gets damaged everytime. My kids ages 3, 6, and 7 still do get some enjoyement out of it, although they get upset everytime it breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for college students (I think)","review":"I use it to fall asleep to, and when I wake up I get a good state of mind.

Zipes' forward provides a very short history of the fable tradition. The translated by Slavitt is brilliant - the translation is loose in a way that translates the irony of the original. The fables as great fun to read - never the heavily preachy tone that often appears in translations. Here you will meet Charlie the Tuna; you'll find the crabby crab mother lecturing \\"Why can't you look where you're going, go where you're looking, pick up your feet, put your best foot forward, try a little harder, stand up straight, pay attention, put yourself sometines in the other person's shoes, ...\\" If you can't have fun with this collection of fables, don't be such a sourpuss, look on the bright side, did you get up on the wrong side of the bed? ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant comedy","review":"This is easily the funniest show I've seen in many years, and brilliantly pulled off by writers and actors.

One must take into consideration the fact that Zionism is NOT representative of Judaism as a religion, and as a matter of fact there are many Jews who are adamantly AGAINST zionism due to its racist and imperialist tendencies. This is not propaganda-in 1975 the UN general assemby passed a resolution that Zionism is a racist ideology. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has publicly stated that the Israeli government has adopted policies that are reminiscent of South Africa's apartheid government. This is all true, and you won't hear about it in U.S. media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detroit's Sports Broadcasters","review":"This book is promoted as follows: \\"...takes the reader behind the scenes, tracing nearly 80 years of electronic reporting\\" and, \\"Recall Detroit's great sports moments through the eyes and words of the legendary Ernie Harwell, Van Patrick,\\" etc.This can lead one to believe that interviews were done with the announcers, but that is not the case. Instead it is a picture book with relatively short, uninspired captions accompanying the photos. Usually the only information given is a list of the stations the individual worked for, and the span of years that he or she worked in the market.The choice of pictures is also odd, as there are ten photos of George Blaha, yet no pictures of a number of notable broadcasters, including Gene Osborn, Tom Johnston, Tom Hemingway, Ann Doyle, Red Jamison, Mel Ott, Don Watrick and Harry Wisner, although most of them get a passing mention at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good tweezers!","review":"Have bought several different tweezers trying to replace my 20 year old Tweezerman's that got lost.

Alas, I should have listened to it before ordering. Debbie Campbell's interpretations of these songs is just plain terrible. It's not that she alters them with a jazz interpretation, she just plain changes them, warbling all over the place. Often she rewrites the melody completely, without any understanding of what the song is about.

The Busta Rhymes cameo on #4 is pretty good. Overall, this album is delivers a few great songs, a lot of good songs and a few questionable ones.

I noticed there was more smoke flavor in the chicken but that may have been my fault. The instructions says to cook at 475 degrees for 10-15 mins with the oven door cracked 2 inches then reduce to 375 degrees and cook the remainder of the time.

But when the kids at Amy's school all begin to behave perfectly, Amy suspects something strange is going on - not a single student has been given detention in over a week!

I also couldn't make the awful squeal stop until I unplugged it. My experience with the repair attempt was also the same--repair would have cost more than the TV. An inexpensive TV--but STILL.

Also, wether the TV was on or off you can here some little noises inside the TV, also sounding like something was cooking.

It not only explains the lines, mounts, and shapes of the fingers, but it also gives the reader a practical guide to its application for real life.

His guitar playing is great and his voice is in fine form. The sound quality leaves little to be desired. His performance is good, but as someone else noted he has this odd way of just abruptly stopping songs, like he's embarrassed to be taking up the audience's time.I give 4/5 stars only because this is a LOT of solo Kozelek, and it gets a bit samey after awhile. He doesn't do much to texture the sound or vary his dynamics, which gives the whole thing a trancelike quality. If you're in the mood for that, it's great. But sometimes I listen to it and have to turn it off after a few songs because it just starts to drone in the background.

He bases this data on the balance of hormones, mainly insulin and glucagon, which determines how your body digests food and stores fat. The data seems very convincing, and the description is easy for the lay person to understand. With this balance of nutrition, the body sheds excess fat, muscles are built, and the brain runs more smoothly. He cites tests in diabetic patients, world class athletes, and average, overweight Americans. In this book and the sequel, he gives good suggestions on achieving this balance in one's diet daily in the modern world of quick meals and fast food. His conclusions are much different than the governments recommendations of low-fat high-carbohydrate diets, but the idea of balance in ones diet is appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only does it work, but it is EASY to follow!","review":"I've tried them all--fad diets to serious medical \\"prescription\\" diets.

He was thrilled. But then he lost another 10 and couldn't put them back on. Every time he got just a little teensy bit hungry he would become a nightmare of crankiness. When his triglicerides dropped to 1/4 the level they had been he was thrilled. Given his uncontrollable weight loss (he now looks eerily skinny) and the horrible mood-swings, I question the quality of the life he has choosen. If I had to feel that way every day for the rest of my life I wouldn't want 10 more years.In Barry's defense, I try to eat Zoneish at lunch.

Maintenance and adjustments are difficult to perform. To change the oil requires attaching a chute that can lead to a mess. Even leveling the blade is a complicated task. Most disappointing is the cutting capabilities. Cutting tends to be uneven and I often find the mower scaulps the grass when there is any uneveness to the surface.

I like the fact that it is not conventional in any sense of the word. To expect every book about a gay man to be a work of political rubbish or to make a \\"gay statement\\" takes away from what the book is about.

The suspension of disbelief that Quinn expects from the reader is an insult to intelligent and/or well-read audiences. The fact that this book has been optioned for film is an embarassment and reflection of the rampant poor taste of the American film community. Scott and Michael, are ugly portrayals of sterotypes and reflect the author's inability to paint plausible plot lines and characters. Penguin should be embarrassed about publishing this drivel; it was a waste of time and paper. I've read science fiction that was more believable. This just proves that the gay community is just like the straight: There are brilliant essayists and lousy pulp wasters. It's unfortunate because the idea could have been explored much more creatively and with far more humour. Read David Sedaris for funny, dysfunctionality that hits home.

It touched me on so many levels. As a gay parent myself, it was wonderful to read the story of another gay man who became an accidental parent.The author was quite clever in using three different points of view in the story. The book started out third person, describing the life of Michael and his legal battle to adopt his nephew. The second part of the book was told from the nephew Scott, and it was wonderful to see the world through his eyes. The third part was in Michael's voice, and that is where I cried again."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

But good intentions don't always make for good writing, unfortunately, and this book tends toward flat, unrealistically presented stereotypes and too-convenient plot devices.

What was suppose to be a strong heroine was turned into a joke. Why does almost every book with a woman who is strong, intelligent and doing what she is capable of doing alway turned into a whiner just waiting for a \\"MAN\\" to fix all her problems. This could have been a great story of equals, instead Eli makes the decisions, even in situations that he should not have a clue about and Ray is reduced to the most uninteresting level.

Bad","review":"Nothing is much unexpected about Lori Foster's latest effort and in fact the predictible plot slumps to a pool of cliche. Mercenary Ray Jean Vereker is hired by rich business whiz Eli Connor to rescue his spoiled brat of a brother Jeremy when he is captured by guerillas in Mataya. Ms. Foster expects us to believe that Ray is the manifestation of wonder-woman who chops and kick ass - taking the guerillas single-handedly with a few nasty punches. Eli is reduced to nursing the wounded heart of Ray when he finds out she bears the guilt of losing her partner in a mission. The worst part of it turns out to be when the recycled and obsolete plot device of pregnancy is used to convince readers of a happy ending. Ms. Foster clearly disappoints with this unexpectedly trite romance which offers raw sexual tension aplenty but not much of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"I started reading Lori Foster 6 weeks ago and after the first book \\"The Winston Brothers\\" I rushed out to find any/and all of her books.

It took me over two weeks to finish this book, when I usually read them in one sitting! I kept on hoping that going back to it later on will get me interested, but no success...What should have been a short story was stretched into a full book, it was painful to read Ray's ongoing struggles on proving herself capable in her profession, and hard to believe Eli's continual amusement at her prickiness.

I have read everything she has written; and while I have yet to find a book as good as \\"Too Much Temptation\\", I have loved her books until this one. The story line is long and sometimes boring. In the beginning, I had trouble figuring out what Ray's job was and what her connection to Eli was going to be. It wasn't until the third(?)or fourth chapter that I found out what her purpose with Eli was. I also grew tired of Ray's tough-girl attitude. I found that I had to leave the book for a while and come back to it later. This is DEFINITELY NOT one of her best, but I will continue to read her work.

This is not a 'how to' book, though anyone familiar with the bookbinder's craft will gain insight into specific procedures. Rather, it is the exploration of why we love books, love those who love books, and love the preservation of an ancient craft, as it is handed from master to student. As her understanding of her craft grows and deepens through her relationship with Anthony, Wilcox shows us her heart and gives us a glimpse into the soul of this master binder. While the subject is bookbinding, the real story is that of passion for a craft, for the unique combination of intellectual, aesthetic, and physical skills that go into any fine craft. To share that passion with another, as Bill Anthony did in his teaching, and as Wilcox does in her book, is a very great gift, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Pleasure","review":"I loved this book. At once a touching tribute to the renowned conservator and binder to whom the author was apprenticed, a look into apprenticeship, and an insight into the ethos of book conservation, the book is a delight to read.

Grant and Lisa, the two main characters, are likable and engaging, and their back and forth email repartee turns into a contest to see who has the most insane ex. I sped so quickly through it that I guess it was inevitable I be disappointed with the ending. It seemed tacked on (and if you don't want a spoiler, please skip this part), as if Winnie and Grant broke up so that Lisa could enter Grant's life. The revelation of Winnie's infidelity doesn't jive, as she and Grant are presented as a happy couple who get along well with each other. As Grant details Winnie's flaws, making her into yet another psycho ex, Lisa is able to take her place. But for the most part, the book is a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I loved it. I picked it up on a Friday night and didn't put it down for two days. I liked both characters.

I also didn't care for how every email started \\"Dear Lisa/Grant.\\" I know that's picky, but if this is meant to mimic how people communicate now through email it should have been a little more consistent with how people actually send emails and less like formal letters.

It was beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"Talk about disappointing! This book had maps that were hard to read and not in scale. Try finding a book that lists off mile markers because the descriptions this book uses to get you somewhere get you LOST! The street maps were useless. It is obvious that those who wrote this book didn't go to some of the locations they list - because they were misrepresented. Sometimes they'd talk about a really cool waterfall...and then not put it on the map - so good luck finding it. I wish I had bought a different book for my trip to Oahu.... This book gets a failing grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have - But More is Needed","review":"As you can see from the previous reviews, this book is a must have.

You will want to compliment it with a more traditional book like Fodor's for that information."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are headed to Oahu, don't go without this book!","review":"I bought this book 6 months before we went. I studied it cover to cover and picked out where we wanted to visit from the magnificent pictures and descriptions. It helped me to get online and make reservations and get a real feel of what kind of trip we were in for. It was the most magnificent trip ever! The book's maps and photos helped us find our way around and the accuracy of maps was incredible. I would never EVER leave home without this book!

I send a copy to friends and family a few months before they come for a visit, so they can pick what they want to do when they get here. This book gives them just about as much information as anyone can get.The maps work great and show all of the roads. The inside info on the different beaches and places to surf or which beach to take the small children to are all in there, along with any other water activity. The pictures are great and the location of the camera taking the picture is on the adjacent map, which really can give a sense of scale to the map and identity to the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"indispensable for the motoring tourist","review":"I found this book at Amazon four days before I was to depart for Oahu and ordered it by overnight delivery.

The book filled with many old photos from 50 or 60 years ago and looked like a history book instead of a tour guide book. Overall the photos in this book are not impressive and you can get them from many other resources. The other thing I want to mention is the printing quality of this book was really awful, and the colors were not accurate and images were fuzzy. Compared to the previous edition, this one is definitely a setback.

It highlights the sights most seen by tourists."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only guide you need!","review":"My husband and I had previously visited Oahu with our parents and done the usual Waikiki Beach/Pearl Harbor routine that all tourists seem to do. Our decision to go back to Oahu for our honeymoon was based entirely on this fantastic book. It showed us how much we had missed on our previous trips. Instead of spending a week on crowded Waikiki Beach, we spent our time on beautiful remote beaches or hiking through the jungle to a waterfall. This book has info that no other guide has. Every location has color pictures and a detailed map on how to get there. This book made our trip to Oahu our best vacation ever. Don't bother buying any other guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & useful! Perfect island road safari.","review":"This is a fun guide to some great spots on the island of Oahu. We used the accurate maps in favor of a more detailed, but bulky, road map. It was like having a friend with us who was pointing out neat routes and points of interest. It really made our trip interesting and allowed us to take full advantage of having a car. Even after the trip, we enjoy looking up where we visited and sharing the details with friends.I recommend this as part of your travel kit for Oahu. Most guides are too general to Hawaii or too specific to Honolulu, but this one focuses so nicely on the entire island of Oahu and the highlights! It was also nice to use when we decided to have Hawaii movie night since the book notes where movies were filmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Guidebook","review":"I just got off the plane last night from a week in Oahu. We found this book on the coffee table in the house we rented on Lanikai Beach and it was our constant companion in our explorations of this stunning Island. I've been all over the world, used a lot of guidebooks, and this is the most beautiful one I've ever come across in terms of pictorial content, maps, and graphics. Even if you never go to Oahu, this makes a lovely coffee table book. Anyone contemplating a visit should take a look at the book, it will firm up their resolve to get over to Hawaii!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Organized & Detailed Guidebook Ever Published","review":"After a week in Oahu with only Sullivan's book as a guide, I can't find enough praise to describe how usefull, accurate and entertaining it was.

The photography is beautiful (but no where a beautiful as Oahu is in real life). This is a must if you love nature and are interested in venturing away from the tourist traps of Waikiki (which can also be fun...) The authoring gives explicit and easy directions to Oahu's most beautiful natural places--beaches, trails, landmarks. It is so easy to follow and definitely one of a kind. I have used it many times during my trips to Oahu. This author also has written the same book about Maui, which is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aloha, Hawaii !!","review":"Very good for someone who wants to be sure they see everything and know what they are seeing.

DRIVING AND DISCOVERING HAWAII is definitely one of those hard to find copies, since basically you've got everything you need. I wished I had one of these when I visited the U.K. early this year, an extremely packed guide with great information. This book will be my best friend when I visit Hawaii in the future, definitely. The photographs are fantastic; you've got maps to wonderful places and detailed driving or bus directions. And besides all that, the author gives you sincere and excellent insights. If you have this book you'll have a phenomenal and guaranteed trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brians CD Review","review":"This CD is awesome.

A little less quality than most well known shoe brandsa. lacing system - I question its durabilityb. rubber soles a little under cut in terms of qualityIn short these are good looking well thought out shoes. However I believe they cut some corners to fill the niche in the market they chose. If these were a North Face brand or Hiking shoe brand they may have used a better quality and construction of materials. But being what they are they are comfy and i like them. Just some things you have to like and some things you don't.

Great for the golf cart also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little heater","review":"I purchased this heater for tent use as well as in my cargo van. I have slept in both with the heater on low and the temps in the mid 30s and it made a night and day difference. I highly recommend this product for anyone who car camps in cooler temperatures. I found the legs to be adequately sturdy, and they have the rotation direction printed right on them so no problem there either. It seems that the time ratings are a little optimistic, I found 5-6 hrs on high and 10-11 hrs on low to be more typical. The auto start is nice but I'm not sure if it is worth the money, it also takes a solid 5 to 15 seconds for the gas to build up enough to light, which takes some getting used to. I ran mine for an hour before use in a tent and that seemed sufficient to burn off any smell. Overall I am super happy with this purchase, it has extended my camping season to almost year round in Wisconsin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunting Blind Heater","review":"Bought this little heater to put in my hunting blind. My blind is a 4 x 6 (x 7 tall) plywood structure with glass windows on 3 sides. It is non insulated but seals up pretty tightly for a hunting blind. Bought this heater because of it's size and portability. Tried it out this morning in 41 degree weather with a 10 mph wind (so probably high 30's) . Fired up easily and after 10 minutes with setting on high I was comfortable without my hat, gloves and jacket. For my purpose, I am extremely happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rugged, easy to use, good for camping...but watch your fingers!","review":"While outfitting for \\"primitive winter camping\\" I first opted for a 400W oil-filled electric heater w/ power control, to be run off a battery backup pack at night--this to preclude any CO/CO2/fire hazard problems. A backup pack big enough to do the 400W'er, plus several other minor electrical things, is not in my budget.So...I bought a BlackCat, tried it out on some of our prematurely cold Central TX nights (suck it, GlobalWarmingWeenies) and loved it.I loved it so much I just bought 2 more. I don't do campfires for warmth or cooking, so these BlackCat's have a lot of work to do.

Will need to look for something else, or just deal with the cold :)Item was returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman BlackCat PerfecTemp Catalytic Heater with InstaStart Technology","review":"Bought this item for frequent camping trips. Recently used it in Yosemite for 3 nights and was very glad to have it. If there was 4 1/2 stars I would have selected it. The difference between the outside temp and the inside temp was quite noticeable (maybe in the 7-10 degree range, just a guess though). There is a small flame when you light it, but it's really just a minor arc on the face of the item. It does smell, but to be honest so did the kids and I (and both were bearable). Lit it in the tent, changed the canister in the tent, re-lit it in the tent, no problems and no worries. Only thing that would have been nice to have was a small fan to help circulate the heat a little as the heat tends to go 'straight up'. All and all I would definitely purchase this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for Money","review":"I received this product, didn't bothered to open it. Went to Camping, opened in the night, attached the recommended propane tank to it and used instant start. Works great! earlier version of heater from coleman required batteries for the fan to operate but i believe this uses the propane pressure to heat. 7-8 hours each of the propane tank lasted overnight. Very good product from coleman.

I buy all my school books here, but unfortunately I will be purchasing this one at Barnes and Noble.POP: Display LPN Notes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"Avoid this one....It's a very basic book aimed at low level players, showing a range of the e4-e5 openings. In each example, it follows the standard opening, then one side makes an error (Usually suicidal in nature.) allowing the opposition to mate or at least obtain an overwhelming advantage in the next 1-2 moves. Pandolfini gives the instruction on how to do this.As mentioned by everyone else the book is packed with errors, i.e. diagram 1, the black knight f6 is missing, diagram 149 white has 3 rooks etc... the list goes on and on.You will spend you time wondering why a) someone would make that error and b) why you wasted money on the book.i gave it 2 stars, because its cheap, the advice is reasonable and it does show various patterns, within the openings. It's a nice idea for a book, its just this one is terribly done. dont waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"As it Claims","review":"This book teaches what it claims. As stated, it does not promise opening repertoire studies but more traps in the openings. I found that this books works best when I utilize it to study the different ideas and patterns of traps and look for common grounds of various positions as oppose to studying each individual move explicitly. I may not go as far as to say that this is a necessity to a chess player's library but it does consist of good information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet its stated goals.","review":"In the introduction, Pandolfini explains that this is not a book full of opening lines \\"that charts numerous moves, with little or no commentary.\\" Unfortunately, this book does not provide a useful analysis of the openings to the amateur player. Instead, an extremely bad position is shown where the opponent has made one or more blunders followed by Pandolfini's explanation of how to exploit the blunder. This book also suffered from numerous printing errors. There is an error in the very first diagram! This book is a fun exercise in how to destroy a weaker opponent, but helps little to improve your game."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHESS TRAP BOOKS ARE GOOD - - This one has some flaws, but does cover a lot of traps","review":"If you learn chess traps from the prospective of not trying to set up cheapo traps by using inferior moves then you are on the right track. Traps will teach you the tactical parts of the openings and help you learn the openings.I was rather diapointed when there were moves that were played that were very weak and the book doesn't tell you why or show you what should have been done. There is little analysis in the book, and when it is given it is usually well into the game where the trap is being used - too late to know how to avoid it and where did the player go wrong and why is not covered!There are some serious mistakes in the analysis in several traps. There one good point - there are a lot of traps covered, but you are largely on your own to figure things out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool title...that's all","review":"This was one of the first books I purchased just after joining the Army many years ago. It will show you a few tricky openings but will do nothing to improve your understanding of the game. If you want a book that has the potential to advance your knowledge of the game then this is not what you are looking for. At least 90% of chess books don't teach you anything and were just thrown together to make money. This book was published by Fireside Chess Library. Fireside published many terrible chess books so buyer beware.If you click on my name you will get my personal information and see a recommended study list. I put together this list of books and software with only one thing in mind...to improve your game without wasting your money. If you want to get better at chess this list will give you the most bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Unrealistic Examples","review":"A number of the examples require your opponent to make such a bad move that the situation is unlikely to happen; or if he's that weak, you would likely win anyway without studying the book. Some of the examples are useful as real traps that can occur. The well known Petroff's Defence trap for instance. The examples are given 1 per page in classic Pandolfini style which makes each idea easy to study. One may find the attacking tactics, especially how to spot a weakness useful. This book involves an number of the most popular e pawn openings only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagued with errors","review":"A big no-no for an instructive chess book is to have errors that make it difficult for the reader to learn the lessons. In the very first exercise, in the board figure, there is a missing knight. If I had been playing the exercises on the board, the knight would be there, but since I was trying to analyze the position based on the figure, the text made no sense. So I'm not even going to bother going through the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes advantage of naive but well meaning amateurs...","review":"The problem with these books is that they are tailored to what beginers think they should know,and not what they really do need to learn. As a beginer,I to was initialy enamoured with this series-but looking back now as a more experienced player, I believe the author is most likely more interested in churning out low quality books than in improving the novice players game."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books out there. Why choose a bad one?","review":"I have to full-heartedly agree with the review written by Jason D. Enochs \\"army_tacsat\\". The title of this book sounds juicy, but there's no substance behind it.It shows you a few interesting openings, but if you faithfully read the book cover to cover, you don't walk away with a better understanding of the game. You almost certainly don't walk away with anything you can bring to a game. It's trivia, not a teaching book.There are so many better books than this one. Why settle for something substandard?I actually disagree with Jason D. Enochs \\"army_tacsat\\" on this book:Chess Traps: Pitfalls And Swindles (Fireside Chess Library)While I wouldn't give it 5 stars, I certainly wouldn't give it the one star he gave it. This book actually delivers on what its title claims, and after reading it, I DID walk away with things I could bring with me to a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book","review":"This book helped me choose a particular opening, play it over and over, and master it. With this book, I have no problem in the openings and now focus on my middle game tactics. This is not a tutorial book for learning to play, but a great reference book and my personal favorite. The only down fall is it does not go beyond the King Pawn Openings (1. e4 e5)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"Personally I found this book to be of very little help in improving my chess game. The author targets the book for beginners and writes it in an attempt to teach them how to aviod opening blunders and how to capitolize on your enemies mistakes. The only problem is, the book's examples are way too specific and each example is full of terrible moves. Every chess game played has a mistake or two, but in this book the author points out opening games where in 10 moves or less a handful of mistakes have already taken place. The bottom line for this book is, its too simple for advanced players and too specific to help beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic jazz album...","review":"Out of the 800 CDs I have, this is one of the most frequently listened to.

Instead, buy an SD expansion card, install RealOne player, transfer the songs to the card (using a memory card reader/writer, your cradle, or the builtin infrared sync device on the Zire71), and let the mp3-enjoyment begin. I have used my Zire71 in this way for six months now and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma Kirby Is Enchanting!","review":"One of the nicest things that a friend ever did for me was to give me this recording, and to introduce me to the pure, graceful, and sweet soprano of Emma Kirkby. Here, in this recording of Dr. Thomas Arne at Vauxhall Gardens, Ms. Kirkby shows why she is one of the great interpreters of Early and Baroque music. The opening track 'The Glittering Sun' taken from the Cantata Morning,is absolutely enchanting and well suited for Ms Kirby's pure soprano. Ms Kirkby also shares the spotlight with Tenor, Richard Morton who sings 'Sigh No More ladies' and other songs. Written in 1745 just after being appointed composer to Vauxhall Gardens, these songs are Thomas Arne's most famous works. Arne often gets short shrift as a composer and is overshadowed by giants of English Baroque music such as Handel and Purcell. This recording will surprise and delight anyone who loves Baroque music and Ms. Kirkby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"Issues with this product when used with a Mistubishi TV and OTA reception.1.

I don't think there is a single track on this CD that isn't great. This is definitely one of Dan the Automator's best efforts to date, and Mike Patton and Jennifer Charles are just great as the vocal accompaniment. Don't be dissuaded by the tongue-in-cheek presentation--don't even be dissuaded by the proliferation of samples from the 70s spoof comedy Airplane! in the track \\"Everyone has a Summer.\\" This music is ... possessed of a sensibility somewhere between trip-hop and soul, and could definitely be used for seductive purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of love...","review":"When I first heard about Lovage, I immediatly thinked:\\" God...Patton singin' love songs on hip-hop beats, that must bes***\\".

But, let's not forget other Lovage members that are not unknown; Jennifer Charles of ElysianFields (on vocals with Patton), Kid Koala (turntables) and all this produced by the master himself: Dan The Automator (Dr.Octagon,Gorillaz) with special guests Prince Paul (alias Chest Rockwell on all his works with the Automator) and Damon Albarn (Blur,Gorillaz). Each song is a masterpiece, and sounds really differently.

Keep your memories of the original and wait for someone to fully appreciate how fine this thriller was and is. I find it odd that amazon even allowed this version to find its way into customer hands. Boo Hiss. The tendency is to go with versions of these old films/public domain--that are more expensive than the cheepies. Not knowing what these other versions look like--DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION.

We wanted to update the look of an old glass cooktop we were placing in a rental house. These did the job nicely. As a previous poster indicated, there can be a problem when replacing a \\"push down and turn\\" style of knob. Because the disc inserts have a hole in the top, there is nothing to stop the knob from slipping down too far on the knob stem. We fixed this problem by super gluing a small washer to the top of the disc before inserting them into the new knobs. The hole in the washer needs to be smaller than the hole in the top of the disk - we used a #8 washer. The glue sets in 30 seconds and the washers were less than a buck. They work great! (We needed the \\"H\\" shaped insert for our cooktop.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cool but........","review":"Great faucet. Looks unlike any other out there.

Runaway greenhouse effect has ravaged the world, sending starving Arab armies into the heart of Europe while the United States faces chaos as the breadbasket dries up and blows away. Against this background appear the Blue Woofers: mysterious lights that may or may not be alien visitors. They're thoroughly inscrutable, but they do seem to be interested in observing human beings under conditions of extreme stress... This is a very solid first novel, with alien aliens, well-crafted battle scenes, and taut psychological suspense.

I had recorded my own copy from a PBS broadcastnearly fifteen years ago, but the demise of my final VCR several years ago rendered the tape a mere dust collector. This DVD release is bittersweet: the program is still wonderfully entertaining and informative, but the quality of the transfer pretty much compares to the old VHS tape (grainy and flat) with audio that pales in comparison to the original CD tracks.

He obviously had nothing new or interesting to add, so we must suppose that he needed to pay off a new car or boat and so added this travesty of the earlier volumes. Not only does he not resolve any of the unanswered questions left at the end of volume four (which were tolerable ambiguities), but he completely destroys the essential world view and philosophical leanings that he developed in the earlier volumes. If you want a sense of completion to the series, stop with volume 4 and imagine anything else that you want to address anything you find unresolved.

It sticks very well and has managed to remain on for about 5 days, without me having even cleaned the windscreen first.One comment I have noticed that is wrong is that you cannot angle it sideways. This is actually quite easy to do simply by adjusting the angle at which you attach the suction cup to the windscreen. If you angle the suction cup section so that it is not straight up and down the windscreen then you can get the units face to point off to the side and the rotating head (directly under the GPS mounting bracket) allows you vertically allign the GPS itself.Would be 5 stars but for the movement and the difficulty of putting GPS in/out with power cable in.Steve"},{"rating":"2","title":"Received Shipment in a timely manner","review":"Received Shipment in a timely manner.

I think the narrator is a little more to blame than the author, but the story isn't exactly fast-paced either.

As a developer I can modify the business tier code to conform to my companies requirements and concentrate on the presentation layer."},{"rating":"2","title":"More end-to-end ASP.NET, less e-commerce","review":"This is primarily a book about constructing an ASP.NET web site using stored procedures, and less a book about e-commerce. There are a few sections, mostly at the end, which are specific to e-commerce. These include the order processing pipeline chapter and the credit card transactions chapter.This is not to say the book is bad. It's very well written and the code is described step-by-step in detail. There could have been more emphasis on architecture, and a little more on e-commerce. I would also like to see some emphasis on the sticky legal issues like customer data management, password security, transaction security, and how and when to migrate the data off of the machines on the open Internet and back into safe storage on the Intranet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever!","review":"This book is extremely informative, as it provides you with examples for every form there is to complete during your case management practices.

But starting from the cover (what is that thing on there?) to the absence of introductory remarks from DWS (yeah, I actually read it...gives me an idea on what went on during the selection process), SNW-IV left me wanting. Unlike I-III, IV only had a few stories that were interesting and/or entertaining. Granted, I have high expectations given the past three collections (and each were terrific). IV just seemed like it ran out of gas (ideas) and was just going through the motions for the sake of maintaining the franchise. I love fan fiction...so many different point of views (fresh minds, new ideas) but only two stories are worth recommending, hardly enough to justify purchasing the book. Borrow a friends or check it out at your library..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange New Worlds \\"Forget It\\" !!!","review":"Well it is clear that this concept has long since run out of steam with this the fourth, and easily the weakest of the series. It boggles the mind that the garbage that is in this collection could be the best of the \\"hundreds\\" of submissions. In fact many of the stories in this collection are either pointless drivel or obvious plagarism from original scripts. (* I can't help wonder what the original writers of the shows must think when they see their ideas trashed by well meaning but misguided fans !) Of course much of the blame must be directed at the editors who choose the works that go into these books, as it was their job to assemble original, exciting and worthwhile contributions. Unfortunately this collection has few worthy efforts and as for a fifth book, well I think they should quit now, before they do any more damage to the Star Trek legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"This series of toys is great.

To my untrained ear, however, this rendition is exquisite. My only quibble, shared with at least one other reviewer, is that the disc is on the quiet side, but as noted in that other essay, all you have to do to correct is turn up the volume a bit. The Ceremony of Carols takes up half the release, the other half given over to other, shorter works by Britten, including the Missa Brevis in D. What you hear is the Choir is Westminster Cathedral, accompanied only by harp and/or organ, and their sounds are by turns contemplative, insistent and joyous.

Sensing that it could become a winner, he gave them $92,000 and, in 1977, went to work for the company. Three years later, Apple went public and Markkula made millions. Time and again over the decades, this amazing story has repeated itself on the San Francisco Peninsula now known as Silicon Valley. getAbstract finds that historian Christophe Lécuyer does a capable, intriguing, intricately researched job of taking readers behind the scenes to learn how Silicon Valley first developed, what makes it tick and what its high-tech mastery has accomplished. While some of the technical terms may require a learning curve, this is the place to learn about the center of technology in the U.S. before it came to create and dominate the high-tech industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Burned Out!","review":"I read this book, hoping it would be written on an adult level. It is not. It is patronizing and condescending toward those diabetics like myself who have lived with the disease for many years.

I would not have survived this long had I not had good self-management skills. Yes, I have had both counseling and been put on antidepressants. In spite of what is going well in my life with diabetes, I still scored poorly on every test! Unbelievable, so now I am feeling worse than when I started the book.

This should not be advertised as a durable and tough toy, or at least it should be revised for bigger dogs. I called the company and they were great, told me to send it back for a full refund.

Yeah, I rolled my eyes too when I read that but I really enjoyed this book. Jane isn't the usual weak, helpless, STUPID heorine. She's no superwoman but a real person.

Instead, the writers of \\"House\\" continue to raise the stakes. Plot is almost always moving forward, characters are almost always being developed. This season, which includes the death of House's father, the suicide of one of his team members, and House's hallucinations and total breakdown, is one of the best. There's not much on television that I consider worthwhile - so much is pure entertainment with no intellect, no art, and nothing to ponder when an episode ends. This series is an exception.

Critics comparing this book to legendary stories such as \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" are very apt. A wonderfully written, mostly male-driven adventure. The one problem I had with the book was the incorporation of some breathtakingly long paragraphs. One of these suckers goes on for 12 pages! It was quite taxing on my eyes. Despite this one drawback, I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Robertson's book. Hopefully, HarperCollins will make the effort of republishing the two sequels. Without hesitation, I'll read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!!","review":"This book is horrible. It is boring, confusing, and dule.

He would just say for example, I am playing (some obscure) F diminshed that you won't be able to find on your own.

Everything else is top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book despite flaws","review":"I use Fritz 8 to study my books, so I can go through the variations and see the state of the game with ease. With that in mind, there are some flaws in this book, three most notable:1) Moves made by the amateur described as \\"the decisive error\\" are sometimes the ones that the million-move-monster recommends2) The master in question sometimes makes less than perfect moves, and a few crushing tactical opportunities were missed3) There are at least 3 errors in analysis per game. For example, in Game 19, 13. ...Re8 is billed as \\"the only move,\\" when it leads to forced mate in 5. 13. ...Nf6! 14. exf6 Bf5! holds the game for Black; White is still better but immediate mate is out of sight.However, these errors do not detract from the instructive quality of the book at all. It still does its job very well: Explaining why many common amateur moves are inferior (and showing how to exploit them), and teaching a great deal about strategy. I learned much from reading it. So will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many typos!","review":"This book is written in the old descriptive notation. If that weren't enough to scare some people away, the amount of typos in this book is simply ridiculous. Pawns will magically disappear off the board, opening rook files, bishops will suddenly jump onto the opposite color diagonal. Pretty soon, the entire game is just illegal move after illegal move...There really isn't much to learn here because of all the typos.

Joel Fiulton's coments at times are very contrite. For about $5 bucks less you could buy Chris Bird's \\"The Concealed Handgun Manual\\" and be better off. The only thing that is any good in this book is the recertification test. The course of fire is fairly generic as well. Overall, this is more of a \\"initial\\" CCW manual than anything for advanced information."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh, just grand","review":"This is a very good book. I bought it because I'm a great fan of Dylan and also very interested in that whole 60's folk scene. It reads like a novel and I couldn't put it down-- and it even contained a few things about Dylan I didn't know, which books on him never seem to do. Its only fault is that it makes the Farinas out to be much greater talents than they actually were. Richard Farina is made out to be Dylan's equal, and to have invented \\"fok rock\\"; both ideas are absolutely ridiculous. But I strongly suggest this book for any fans of Baez or Dylan...and anyone else interested in a truly unique time in our culture's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling reading!","review":"Truly this book makes for compelling reading! To read about these four young people, so beautiful, pasisonate and in the case of at least two of them, with talent to burn, is to immerse oneself in a world where music really meant something, and singing could make any dream seem possible. Other reviewers here aren't happy with the way Dylan is depicted. Apparently he comes off as far to human. But that's just what he was, a genius with many failings, not the least of which was insensitivity to others and an over-riding narcissism. For me this book brings to life the words Joan Baez sang so famously in her song \\"Diamonds & Rust\\" -- \\"..speaking strictly for myself, I could have died right there!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Mimi and Richard Farina biography!","review":"This is one of the best books on the folk era ever written. Mr.Hajdu burns through the nostalgia and brings to life something more valuble.....living, breathing human beings who happen to have made some very lasting music. The book obviously fills a void by covering the lives of Richard and Mimi Farina...two frequently overlooked artists. The book is so well-written that Richard's tragic demise still mangages to shock and sadden the reader even though most know the sad tale. The book is especially poignant and timely as Mimi Farina is battling an illness. It must be satisfying to know that what she helped create, so many years ago, is getting some well-deserved attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a Name-Dropping Gossip Columnist's Attempt at Biography","review":"I listened to the audiobook version of this book and had to force myself to finish the whole book. A lot of name-dropping and snide remarks about people based on what I don't know. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. It was obvious that the author had a thinly veiled dislike of the four main characters and made very subjective comments about them. There was no attempt to be objective - and I was irritated by the reader's attempt at imitating the accents of different characters - like Albert Baez, for example - and kept wondering where the author got his information. And if the imformation came from someone he had interviewed - how did that person know what people were thinking. VERY unprofessional writing in my opinion. Don't waste your money on this book. Look at how these people lived their lives instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively Don't Bother","review":"\\"Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times...\\" reads like a hatchet-job on Dylan and Baez; an ain't she sweet love poem to Mimi Baez-Farina; and tainted hagiography for Richard Farina. I don't think any of us in our callow youth would fare much better as personalities, the problem with this book is that Mr. Hajdu doesn't have much of a feeling for the art that came out despite the creepiness of the milieu. It's a problem he shares with Howard Sounes's \\"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan.\\" Both books rank as over-inflated tabloid fodder. As far as giving us a feeling for the Greenwich Village folk scene - well, we catch a whiff of its seedier aspects, but Mr. Hajdu hasn't been able to find much joy in it all. If you'd like to check out a well written, critical biography of the troubled and talented Bob Dylan, I'd suggest, \\"Behind the Shades: Take Two,\\" by Clinton Heylin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been Down So Long This Reads Like Garbage","review":"This book reads like a gossip column. The only difference is that the author reveals his sources. The idea is sound: use data from hundreds of interviews and write a non fiction novel from the point of view of a fly on the wall. It simply does not work. The people whose lives and relationships are now being scrutinized produced some of the best music and literature that their generation had to offer. Instead of praising them, though, Hajdu seems to want to destroy the myth by exposing the baser sides of their personalities.Spend 20 bucks on something by one of these four that you don't already own rather than buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the music?","review":"This book reads like an extended version of people magaizine.

For the start of the 1968 Fall TV season, 57 year-old Ball was getting old. Even her heavy makeup and elaborate wigs could not hide her age. Nolonger would she allow to be filmed closeup. Any funny facial expressions she was known for in \\"I Love Lucy\\" and \\"The Lucy Show\\" were a rarity on this dated show. A slew of weekly guest stars, Ball's children and old fart co-star, Gale Gordon is what carried this show for its 6 year run.The Arnaz kids, Lucie & Desi Jr. inherited the show upon their mom's death.

What about the love he felt for his comrades, how did he feel when they were wounded, how did he feel when some got to go home before he did? He touches on this type of thing, but again, no real emotion seems to be expressed. I felt very let down at the end of the book.

But, beware-- although the behaviors described in the book are based on observed behavior in nature, the words to describe those behaviors are decidedly anthropomorphic and therefore subject to gender stereotyping. For example, one baby animal loves his daddy because he teaches him to be brave. Ummmmm.... do animals have a concept of braveness? I don't think so. In which case it begs the question of why use this word and why use it to describe what the daddy does and not the mommy? But, overall, in combination with the I Love My Mommy book, there's enough variety to offset these occasional lapses and make mommies and daddies equally \\"brave\\" (mommies aren't afraid of the dark) and equally \\"nurturing\\" (daddies feed their babies too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Sweet ....","review":"This is such a sweet book to read with your young one!

What you receive is a 1996 re-issue from Amazon.Trying to get that info across to customer service is like banging your head on a wall. Rather than be sent 2-3 more copies of the same re-issue because customer service believes with unshakeable faith that this listing HAS to be right. Which I would then have have to return.

Try Ebay or Fragrancenet instead.As for the scent itself, it is a classic, but not for everybody. It's woodsy with lemon and a little bit of lavendar. It is very strong, and overpowering if you spray it. It seems dated as most colognes now are more for a fresh light fragrance than a strong masculine one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective sprayer","review":"I have ordered this in the past without any problems or issue but on this last order the sprayer started fail and now wont list put instead sprays out a heavy stream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cologne leaks by the cap; disappointing","review":"Cologne leaks by the cap; disappointing.

I don't know who Guy Laroche is but he seems to have good taste. The smell is potent! ONE SPRAY on the wrist, transfer it up to the neck, is all I need. It lasts all day, and too much is seriously off putting. I wear it when I'm feeling my most aggressive, for toned down, more romantic situations I go with ck one, and I prefer Azzaro Chrome for colloquial situations or business when I want to be distinguished but not necessarily seductive. This product tends to be a few dollars more, I think this is correlated to its quality. I have a lot of cologne, the cheaper stuff while sometimes smells good tends to be not as strong and wears off much faster. Of coarse there are always exceptions but in this case, as well as the other ones mentioned by name, I think you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"This was sent out fast and the quality was excellent.

I liked that they were gilded and, while not so concerned with price, the price seemed great: over $140 off the MSRP. That should have been my first clue. These lamps are not made of wood or metal. They are made of resin. Are they gilded? Gilded by the definition of \\"covered in a thin layer of gold or silver leaf\\"? Doesn't look like it to me - looks like paint. I think they meant gilded as in \\"having a deep brownish or gold color,\\" which they do in a manufactured way. No where on the description did these say they were made of resin. If looks are all you care about, then these might be a good fit for you. On a positive note (the one star), the shades are a nice shape. Overall, the bases look cheap and I'm sending them back. If it matters to you, FYI: the lamps are made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bathroom Fan with a high noise impedment rating?","review":"I've had this fan for almost two years. It was installed when my bathroom was remodeled. I liked the idea of a 'good looking' light fixture coupled with a extremely high 'noise impedance' level fan. However, for the past year and a half, I have suffered with a noise level that rivals the $19.95 ceiling fan that it replaced.Hunter led me to believe by it's advertisements that this fan would be 'whisper quiet' and at the same time move a large amount of air. Not True!This fan is not only almost as noisy as it predecessor (that cost under $20) but it takes forever to move 'shower steam' from the room let alone foul odors. I'm sorry but I feel I wasted my money on the Hunter 82023 Belle Meade Bathroom Fan & light.Oh, by the way, they don't have a 'customer satisfaction' guarantee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine and includes sending unit","review":"Installed this to replace original Westerbeke marine engine gauges.

The organisation of the chapters is perfect.My only criticism is that the oxygen and CO2 dissociation curves are not very accurately drawn, but the book is otherwise full of useful diagrams.Well worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"This book does not explain concepts very clearly. There are other more lucid texts available for this subject. Most of the figures in the book are graphs (2D cartesian plots) which are poorly explained in either the captions or the main text. My reading of this book was largely supplemented by accessing other resources because the book's poorly written style is not conducive to learning the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and concise","review":"I've read both Nunn and West's respiratory physiology. Although Nunn's has got more detail, I think West's book is written better. Another good supplement for reading respiratory physiology is in Miller's anaesthesia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Do not buy this book! It is very poorly organized, often referring to figures and concepts in other chapters. The index is paltry, having very few terms indexed and therefore making looking things up very difficult. In addition, there are multiple typos. This is like the 7th edition and there are still typos?!? Let's get serious here. Also, there are no explanations to the answers! The text in general is leaves much to be desired in terms of organization and clarity. Again, maybe you don't get around to it on edition 1 or 2-- but by now, write some explanations (especially since the text is so hard to understand). I conferred with classmates on opinions of this book, and they all agreed at how poor this book is! Look elsewhere for a resource!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for medical school.","review":"This book might be a good review text for people who are already familiar with the material, but it can't be used as a stand-alone text. It just doesn't have the necessary explanations. I'd recommend sticking with the respiratory chapters in your favorite comprehensive medical physiology textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex","review":"I got this book free from a friend. This book was too complex for me in med school and is still too complex for me as an intern interested in Pulm Medicine. Stick with your school's curriculum to understand the concepts as best you can, like I did. I read reviews for another book entitled Respiratory Physiology: A Clinical Approach (Integrated Physiology) by a different author. I was so impressed by 10 5-star ratings for this book, I decided to purchase it now to regain better insight into pulm physiology. I wish I came across this book while in school. I'm purchasing it today, will go through it this June, and write a thorough review for it. As for John West's book on pulm physiology, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre review book, terrible textbook","review":"I have revised my review of this book. I first gave it 1-star.As a textbook, it is horrible; far too short, abbreviated explanations, not enough/poor pictures for visual learners, too many graphs, etc. In the preface, the author does state that this book can be used as an \\"introductory textbook.\\" I'm sorry, but I strongly disagree.He also says it can serve as a review book. As a review book, it is okay, and although I think there are better books out there, I do find myself referring to this book occasionally.A painful read. And yes, I read the entire book, cover-to-cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, but not for the faint of heart","review":"Invariably, if you are studying pulmonary physiology or respiratory systems or anesthesia or anything involving the lung, you have heard of \\"West's zones of the lung.\\" Take it from the source. And while at first glance you might think you can get through this text in an hour, be prepared, it reads like Finnegan's Wake.....well, maybe more like Ullyses.You should expect to read this book cover to cover at least twice. Some sections will require the same amount of time you would engaging a much longer, more belaboured text and your brain might feel like scrambled eggs. But once you've read and understood West, you understand lung and respiratory physiology.Full of useful diagrams and explanations, the only thing i felt this book lacked was a good flow from one subject to another. But from PFT's, to alveolar function and cellular physiology, this book will cover everything you need to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for quick review","review":"Our syllabus for the respiratory course was pretty poor. I found this book to be a great, quick review for respiratory physiology with pictures/diagrams that were really helpful for solidifying important concepts. I'm definitely going to hang on to it to study for boards..."},{"rating":"2","title":"more info about the war years","review":"The book mentions en passant a fascinating episode during the worst days of World War 2 for Australia. This was just after Pearl Harbor was bombed and the Japanese took Singapore. Australia's army was mostly overseas, in North Africa, while the Americans were rocked back on their heels and had yet to deploy troops to Australia. The book says that panic seized Australia, with people in Perth fleeing inland, and likewise in other cities. I grew up in Australia during the 70s and 80s, and I never heard mention of this in the books I read, or in the accounts from Aussies who lived through that time. I don't doubt what the current book describes, yet greater details about that brief and fraught period would have been a welcome addition to the narrative.After all, it may well have been that people from that time simply were reluctant to relate of this because of sheer embarrassment, and so that later histories just omitted it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality.","review":"I bought this for my mom and I was not disappointed. The quality is very good and the design is pleasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"betsy is back","review":"Back to School with Betsy is all about Betsy and her third grade year. Things aren't going like Betsy thinks they should. Her favorite teacher has left. Before too long the new teacher turns out to be great too. The students have a great year and learn a lot. Betsy's friends are back as well and you never know what they will be up to next.The book is full of good old fashion fun. No violence or bad words are found in this book.

I had to go to my local farm supply store 30 miles round trip to purchase the right size bearing...unaccepatable to have to spend this much time on a simple task. This should not happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't cut the mustard","review":"I used this spreader to put rye grass seed on a couple of food plots, using a riding mower to pull it. It lasted all of 1 1/2 plots before the gears separated and the wheel stopped spinning. When I tried to see if there was something I could adjust I was amazed at just how flimsy the rotating components were and how loosly they all fit together. The hopper, wheels and tubing which hold it together are fine; but the rest is extremely undersized. I do not recommend this unit for any application. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"this speader is junk! used it 3 times on lawn and the gears are locked up,wheels wont turn junk junk junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"This unit worked well at first, but after a year of service as one other reviewed stated the gears don't stay meshed and the spreader stops spinning and the product just dribbles out the opening. The gears are sealed in a cheap plastic housing and cannot be maintained without destroying the housing. Another case of stupid design.Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews on this unit until long after I had bought the unit. I sent a letter of complaint to agri-fab but they just ignored it. So I will buy a commercial grade spreader from someone reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty controls","review":"The controls are formed of a brittle plastic. Mine broke after 2 uses.

Please?","review":"Ooof! I got suckered in on the price, and quite frankly, as one who has unwillingly been relegated to doing his own lawn maintenance due to the lack of professional results (in other words, I do because I must, not because I want to be out there over-doing lawn maintenance every weekend), this unit should have been just fine.I literally used it 3 times on my paltry 1 acre and the spreader stopped working. I've learned since then that this is because it has a plastic differential which is prone to stripping out early on. Make sure you buy a spreader that does not have a plastic differential. If there is a saving grace, it comes with two good tires that you can strip off before inserting the rest of the unit in the trash. Steer clear of this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice","review":"Almost two days of assembly and I still had to return it. A cheap price for a cheap product can mean money wasted and not money saved.

This disc, second in a series from this label, presents four large orchestral works (two are premiere recordings). All are beautifully (and aggressively) performed. There are some surprises in the a few of the works themselves; \\"Jonchaines\\", the opening work, is often quite melodic and at times reminded me (slightly) of Bernard Herrmann (!).I suspect more attention will be focused on Xenakis since his recent passing. This is an excellent inclusion in the recorded canon of his works and recommended without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"hours of entertainment","review":"I researched gyms for the best one and this was it.

I'm excited to see how he'll play with it when he is sitting up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy for the price!","review":"I was surprised when I read other reviews for this playmat. Our 3 month old daughter absolutely loves this! The toys are removable, and have come on trips with us (when we didn't have room for the whole playmat). She just loves the mirror/funny face and the ladybug! I can lay her down on the mat and fold laundry without worrying about her injuring herself. The mat does have a strong edge and one end which helps with the \\"bunching\\" issue under the baby....and while my daughter wiggles a lot, the mat stays mainly in place. For a less-expensive playmat, I think this one is a success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This toy is fabulous. My son loved it. He started playing with it at about 3 months and still plays with the items they just aren't attached anymore. It is annoying that the material bunches up but we just took it off or put a changing mat underneath if we needed additional padding. I would definitely recommend this toy. It is one of the better gyms out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after the first few weeks","review":"I bought this baby gym with a giftcard for the birth of our second child. I was estatic when she, at 6 weeks old, seemed to love to lay under it and look at the dangling toys. That excitement was short lived, however, as while the gym is set up, the toys bend with gravity toward the floor, making it very difficult for the baby to see and play with. I would even go so far as to remove them each time she was done so they could \\"morph\\" back into their true form, which never really happened. After awhile the gym part was put into storage and the toys simply scattered on the floor for my baby to play with.I would NOT recommend this gym to new parents - go for the link gym instead. I have one of those from my cousin (10 years old) and was able to hang all kinds of toys from it with links I purchased at the store with MUCH more and longer lasting success."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"we literally just received this as a gift for our 3 month old, and we expected more from fisher price. we were so disappointed in fact, that i hopped up to write this review.

If not, you're only out a couple bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"HDMI Cable is good, but it does not support ARC","review":"The cable is good, the shipping was great, and the price is even better, yet wanted to clarify that this hdmi cable does not support the latest hdmi standard, v1.4, which is the technology on both my new Smart TV (LG 55LW5600) and new 3D Receiver (Sony STRD820). As a result, when I am attempting to stream / watch a NetFlix movie via my TV / Receiver, I can see the movie fine, but I cannot listen to the audio of said movie through my home theater (surround), only through my tv speakers.Again, not saying anything negative about the seller or the product, just stating that if you need 3D, Ethernet, and Audio Return Channel (ARC) for your home theater and TV, you need a 1.4 HDMI cable instead of this one, so check your external devices connected to your tv carefully for the required HDMI cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save your money, buy these","review":"The cable was well made and the picture quality on my TV is great.

The only real factor to consider is build quality, and this cable is of the poorest quality. If you want a super-cheap cable to hide in a wall and never touch, this is a good pick. If this cable will be anywhere near people, go for a better cable! Most cables have a 1 piece metal connector, so if you yank on it a bit, it won't break. This cable has a two piece connector, and the two pieces are not attached securely! This means that a tiny yank will pill the cheap connector out of the cable and break it. Do yourself a favor and spend $2 more on a cable that won't break so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"I took it out of the bag and connected it - nothing happens!

I hunkered down for a jolly old Doc Martin marathon, thorougly relishing the first two episodes, then was dismayed and stunned to discover the third episode of Series 3 was a repeat from my Doc Martin Series 1 or 2 DVDs! Then again it happened on the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh episodes! If you already own the Series 1 & 2 DVDs and don't mind spending $30 for only TWO episodes you've not seen, then by all means go for it; the two new episodes, like all the others, are a delight. It is of note that one of the two \\"new\\" episodes ought to have been shown much earlier as it introduces, obviously for the first time, the officious narcoleptic/agoraphobic village policeman we met early on (probably in Series 1) who was later replaced by gentler \\"Mark\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doc Martin - Great Series - But Victim of December 24 Viewing Problem","review":"We love the Doc Martin series.

The bumbling Doc Martin drives his car over a helpless Yorkie and crushes the small animal to death beneath his 4,000-pound luxury car. One of the unwritten rules of drama is that you don't kill dumb animals to progress your simplistic and indifferent plot. Sadists among us already prey upon helpless domesticated animals without the cheer leading and encouragement of TV shows like this.

I found the questions to range from easy through very difficult. Some nurses only work in certain areas of critical care i.e., cardiac, burns, brain trauma, so this offers a chance to gain knowledge in areas other then your expertise. It's so simple to answer a cardiac question if you deal with it day in and day out, but a burn question may really stop you in your tracks. What is best is the answer is always given along with the rationale. Also hints are given if you need them, although I like to try and use that option only when really stumped. I also found there to be quite a lot of questions although some come up more often, which would be the only drawback. Another nice options is you can pick the categories you want and the amount of questions you wish to answer. The animation is an added attraction. It puts a little fun into the study time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great test review tool!","review":"I love this CD! It is a great way to take a break from studying, have fun and still use your precious time effectively! It is filled with humor and even gives you praise for correct answers.

You can choose 3 different modes: endless lecture, problem patient, tedious textbook torture. You can then pick your content from a list of topics. I use it before our units tests to see what I still need to rewiew! Watch your test grades improve. I highly reccomend this fun CD for any nursing student, or anyone considering critical care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Easy misses it's mark.....","review":"While I am a big fan of the \\"Incredibly Easy\\" nursing series, this one glosses over areas that need more in-depth explanations.

The chapters are organized logically and the content is easy to grasp with great graphics and illustrations. The accompanying CD would be helpful for nurses studying for NCLEX boards, as well as a review while studying for the CCRN exam. The chapter quizes are comprehensive and help to solidfy the information presented. It's ideal for use as an educator in lectures and teaching moments. I would recommend this book to anyone working in ICU or PACU who want to review pathophysiology and patient care related to alterations in these systems.

It's also out of date.Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"First off, this book is difficult to read. It's too concerned with being cutsie and doesn't flow. Each paragraph has a new heading, and you have to read the cartoons in the margins to get basic info. Also, the author assumes you have a very good working knowledge of anatomical vocabulary. I'm a critical care nurse and specialize in certain areas. I wanted to brush up in other areas, and some of the terminology in those areas I haven't used since nursing school. I had to pull out my medical dictionary to refresh in some areas. Also, I was looking more for something that will give me conditions, symptoms, lab results, and solutions. This book spent way too much time going back through anatomy and physiology and pathophysiology. You have to pick through too much to get the information you need. I cannot comment on the CD, as I have not tried to use it. Overall, this absolutely is NOT what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for students","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it really made things easy to understand.

Some people don't appreciate her beautiful voice and I feel sorry for them. I first heard her voice live in a concert here in Ann Arbor in December of 1980 and she stunned me. The memory of her beautiful voice still lives in my mind and heart.Well, this disk gives us 18 selections from a number of different composers from the Baroque. Every one of them is a treasure and has its own charms. I can't pick a favorite, but I can say that each of these pieces show off her voice and singing style in different ways.Yes, I wish she had included more Purcell and something even nicer than what we have on track 3, but what would I give up? Well, that is where I say we need this to have been a two or three disk collection.You won't go wrong with this wonderful disk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of an Angel!","review":"One of the most beautiful angelic voice in the world!

It just looks like a gold ring with greyish gold stripes. The ring definately comes at least 1/2 size larger than what you expect after getting sized at the jewelry store. I had read some of the other reviews that said this but still ordered a size 10. When the ring came it was actually a 10 1/2 so I am exchanging it. They are very good about exchanging it. One other thing about this ring that you may be interested in knowing is that there are some faint lines running across the stripes every quarter inch all the way around the ring. you can only see them on the grey stripes and you have to look close, but they are there.

It isn't that he writes bad songs - some of them are quite engaging - only that he sings them so monotonously. JT's interminable drone makes him the most sonambulistic singer of all time. I'm amazed his career has lasted this long. I can't imagine where his appeal lies. The quality of his compositions grows progressively worse with the 70s decade. Early songs like \\"Fire & Rain\\" were at least original and interesting. By the time he got to \\"Shower the People\\", they became candy floss. Yuk !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want some JT? -- Buy this!","review":"This is the first James Taylor CD I ever purchased, and I LOVED it. Later on, the CD became misplaced, and, rather than repurchase it, I went out and bought a bunch of the underlying CDs. My mistake. This import is a great collection which allows you to listen to all the good songs without a bunch of also-rans disturbing your listening pleasure.

I dare you to try playing this just once - I put it on repeat for about 30 minutes and never tired of it.

Gibbon's voice is interesting and emotive, as always, but the lyrics seem to lack edge, and music isn't especially interesting- piano and orchestral mainly. I understand that artists want to experiment and not be pidgeonholed and whatnot, maybe Beth Gibbons didn't want to spend the rest of her life as a Trip-Hop Goddess, but this album seems like a sort of ordinary use of her extrordinary talents.

The directions are generally good, although the directions to a lot of the Sabino Canyon hikes is a little lacking.What really irritates me about this book is the trail profiles. For example, the Agua Caliente trail profile begins at an elevation of 5420'. It ends at 5420'. It goes up in the middle, but it is nearly impossible to tell how far -- there are no other elevation marks besides the first and last. This pattern is repeated on a number of different profiles, and is the only thing that prevents me from giving 5 stars.Those familiar with reading topo maps may be able to decipher altitudes, but for the rest of us the profiles are useless on many hikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"sabino canyon to 7 falls to bear canyon","review":"the book was outdated & unhelpful. the trail was unmarked & unmanaged. wouldn't recomend it to anyone at any skill level. trail #24's sign was hidden beneath a tree & without guidance we'd have missed it. bear canyon's trail was also unmarked at 2 crucial turning points. without guidance again, we'd have not known to go right at 1 crossroad & left at the other. we were very fortunate to have encountered helpful hikers along our path. it was unfortunate we didn't encounter any along the trail from 7 falls to the base of bear canyon's trail as the trail crosses the river several times & was difficult to find where it picked up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fussy and dated","review":"Knowing I love color, my husband just gave this to me, but he should have known better.

The old sets had a Mama Noah (as my 18 month old calls her) but the new ones don't. Also, the fuzzy animals are impossible to clean. I bought this ark only because the one with Mama Noah, and without the cloth animal parts, wasn't available anywhere.

After returning both incorrect toys my money was refunded and I learned that the Noah's Ark that is pictured is being discontinued. If you want the THIS Noah's Ark that is NOT the Touch and Feel, you will have a difficult time finding it.

The CD truly represents the Rhythm of Snow, from its speed to its texture. Every track attacks the same subject matter but from a different perspective. It is definitely one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yagya '- Rhythm Of Snow","review":"Yagya made a big splash -- if one can splash in sub-arctic temperatures -- with RHYTHM OF SNOW. The album wears its dub techno influences proudly: \\"Snowflake 1\\" is all about the background crackle and the long, sustained chords. And while the individual tracks don't differ greatly from one another, the cumulative effect of the album is akin to being snowed in; the deep, resonant tones, the beats fluttering by like drifts, the build-up of ice. \\"Snowflake 4\\" starts to sparkle a little more, and \\"Snowflake 5\\" almost sounds perky by comparison. The beat of \\"Snowflake 8\\" seems to emanate from the heart of a melting glacier, and by \\"Snowflake 9,\\" the beat has broken off and disappeared into the Arctic Ocean. The slow float of \\"Snowflake 6,\\" though, stands out in particular for its lovely, lush chord progression, which is reprised in \\"Snowflake 10,\\" though the melody is more filtered. A lovely album that stands up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"snowflakes but i am disappointed","review":"I own this cd.

They flop over and refuse to stand upright. The posts that the bottles rest on are just too short. And on top of that the grate that the post are a part of is made of pretty flimsy plastic, and if you don't balance the distribution of your bottles the grate will warp, making it even more difficult to keep the bottles upright. I'm not going to replace it since I've had it for a year now and just suffered through until we switch fully to sippys. I suppose it's not terrible for sippy cups, but I had assumed, incorrectly, when I bought it that it had some special design that made it perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles.

I'm not sure how we got by without it - you can fit a LOT of bottles and their accessories on there, and it does a great job of drying.

The only downside is that they are quite bulky to transport, and do not always sit perfectly flush, but otherwise they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea... bad execution","review":"If you're using Dr Brown's bottles, you already know it is a 5 part bottle, 6 if you count the bottle cap, which I use on every bottle, to keep the nipple clean after I assemble them for use.Not to mention part # 7 the bottle cap which I also use!So you can imagine cleaning one bottle after use means I'm drying 7 parts! The rack itself is great, but definitely does not accommodate all of the parts I have to wash and dry! Still I don't think any other rack would have come close to what I need with the dr. brown's bottles. Because there are so many parts, I honestly don't know what would be better! (That's not my job!) But I do wish there was a better organizational way of drying all the parts. Because it serves its purpose I rate it 4 stars... because it does not take into account all the parts I have to dry. I take one star away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great bottles, mediocre drying rack","review":"I've been more than happy with Dr. Brown's bottles, dishwasher containers, and formula mixing pitchers... but this drying rack is a disappointment.

If you wash at night and need things to be dry in the morning, try something else. There just isn't enough air flow to get nipples, bottles, or breast pump accessories dry on the inside. We had no idea how bad it was until we tried another rack - the Boon Grass drying mat. It cut our evening washing time in half because we no longer needed to hand-dry everything we needed for the next morning. I think pretty much any rack would be a better choice than this one - look for more air flow under the items, or racks that hold items at an angle to let air in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good in theory!","review":"This could have been a great product but it really is not.

Sarah's daily insights, her depictions of life on the trail, her descriptions of the hardships, the triumphs, and the evocations of her memories, combine to form a vivid and accurate image of pioneer life through the words of a pioneer who headed west to escape the ravages of the American Civil War to start her life anew.

I ended up choosing to wall-mount them because of my stud locations, but these would have easily mounted on my ceiling as well.

It is organized by topic with key points and sub-topics in large bold font. Accordingly, this makes it quick and easy to find the information that is of value to you. You can gloss over or skip those topics of less interest without concern of missing an important point.I would recommend this book to anyone who finds it difficult to start or maintain a conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time and money","review":"I bought this book on the strength of several other reviews and its rating, but I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a book in my life. This should be titled, \\"The Absolute Moron's Guide to Conversation\\". There is nothing in here that anyone with the most rudimentary social skills doesn't already know.Wow, I didn't know that I shouldn't call people when they are in a movie theater, or that discussing death is poor social etiquette at a party. And what isn't obvious is patently ridiculous.I teach English conversation skills to non-native speakers and was hoping that I could find some tips that would help my students. Sadly, even my least skilled students would find this book far beneath them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good read.","review":"I really liked the simplicity of this read. It was well organzied and gave me a concise vision of how to start conversations. It is most important to the person who does have a history of being shy, which I do.

After I reviewed it, I want to return it! It was of poor quality, the acting is on a lower level and the topics are even lower. It is an inappropriate series that involves extensive drinking and doesn't even come close to reflecting an accurate view of an Indigenous population. If it were titled \\"Coyote\\", then it would have been more appropriate. It was just a dumb series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time, Money and Brain Cells.","review":"PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!I am Native American and I am mortified someone actually spent money on this steaming piece of manure.The money could have gone to feeding starving children or funding ANYTHING else.Boring characters, laughable plots and not so attractive native people just drain you and your patience.I would say your time is better spent hitting yourself in the head with a CLAW HAMMER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is an all out great punk recording, it's a must have!!!","review":"the fits are a great band and i love their music this CD is a really great CD and if you love punk than this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"geeah","review":"eiht tales the story here his verses fit right in with the storyplot to the film menace to society one of the best gang anmthemns of 93."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Until You Vomit","review":"The funniest book I've ever read, eclipsing his two former works, which were hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only Ok","review":"I bought this book thinking if I peed my pants reading \\"The Gallery of Regrettable Food\\" I'd love this, but I didn't care for it and I love baby books of ALL kinds.

A lot of the time, I found myself \\"standing up\\" for the old-fashioned advice because honestly, a lot of it made sense when you think about the era. For example, they still teach us that newspaper can help with delivering a baby if there are not better materials available.It is worth a read if you have an hour to kill, but I probably would not purchase it again since reading it once is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I thought this book was inappropriate and crude. Some parts were mildly funny, but overall I wish I hadn't bought it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of an Enema","review":"James Lileks makes me laugh like a hyena on nitrous oxide. Parts of this book were so true that they brought back vividly horrible memories, particularly of being chased down the block by my mother who, because i was bound up like a geisha's feet, had whipped out the old red rubber enema bag and the castille soap...Mr. Lilek's brilliant descriptions and explanations of back- in- the- day activities of daily living will make any reader cringe and wonder how children of that era survived into puberty, much less adulthood. For those readers who loved The Gallery of Regrettable Food, this book will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but a little sad too","review":"I absolutely loved James Lileks' two previous books and found them achingly funny, but like several other reviewers, I found \\"Mommy Knows Worst\\" to be tinged with sadness at times. Yes, it was very funny, but on the other hand I ended up feeling so sorry for mothers that actually followed this kind of advice (like my mother) and kids who were subjected to it (like me) that it tempered my enjoyment somewhat.I can remember looking at my mother's baby care book in the early '60s, and the illustrations on how to prepare formula -- sterilize the entire house while you're at it, why don't you? -- were so daunting that I'm amazed anyone actually wanted to have children. Wait, maybe they didn't. Perhaps a chapter on reliable birth control, or lack thereof, would have been a funny addition to MKW. At any rate, I'm still glad I bought the book but will re-read Lileks' \\"The Gallery of Regrettable Food\\" when I want a belly laugh (pun intended)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funnier without commentary","review":"Not exactly what I expected. I prefer to look at the vintage ads and excerpts and come to my own conclusions about why they're hilarious or outrageous. The author's commentary was barely ever funny to me. And there is a TON of author's commentary. I suppose all the historical documents are real, but something about the layout and colors used in the book made it feel fake to me, like it was designed to be a gag gift. All in all, a let-down of a book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, timely shipping, very pleased, thanks","review":"Book was given as a gift. I did not read but giftee loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"Another winner for James Lileks, whose work is hilarious, bordering on hysterical. Even after having read this and other works of Mr. Lileks before, when I read them again, I cannot stop laughing. Do check out his website, too. It's just as funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"As a fan of Lileks' \\"Regrettable Food\\" volume, I bought this only to be greatly disappointed -- it's just not funny enough. Rather than let the vintage material speak for itself, the author feels compelled to make sarcastic comments which are not very clever or entertaining. Many of the reproductions of the vintage material are small and hard to read, and there simply aren't enough good ones to justify this as a full book. It would have been better for the author to have culled only the best and most outrageous of these items and used it as a chapter in some other book. Therefore, I simply cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"I love exploring James Lilek's website and this book is just more of his wackiness. A majority of the items were way before my time but I did note my not-so-beloved \\"carseat\\" in there. Nothing like being hooked to the front seat with some metal tubing and a thin plastic strap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest thing I've read in awhile!","review":"I laughed until I cried when reading some of these great old time ads.

It is also very hard to find the typ of battery. The memmory is good, and you cand just erase all of the bad action scenes you filmed, but the batery won't keep up w/ the memmory. But mainly it is an excelent camcorder and has tons of extra things on it like being an mp3 player, a recorder, digital memmory storage, and a cammera.

Yes, through it away...as in, put it in the garbage, all $700 of it.The sound system in the camera has an intolerable intermittent crackling sound, very loud. The external camera is utterly worthless in that once it is turned on it will not turn off...ever. When it is on it sends a completely erratic and distorted picture image to the camera.

The minor arcana were all line drawings from DaVinci's notebooks - monochrome... non-descript... often having nothing to do with the meaning of the card. The card stock, itself, was thin. I didn't read thru the book, so I can't comment on the value of it. Overall, I would say this set is cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"arbitrary art","review":"the cards are not laminated, the art ois good but irrelivent to the themes. i would not recomand this deck.

That is a real problem when shuffling and (especially) cutting the deck, because the \\"fatter\\" cards are going to always be the ones your hands find. Therefore, you can't really randomize the cutting.Given the amazingly beautiful quality of some decks (U.S.Games' Golden Tarot, for instance), I'm disappointed in this book/deck set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to review dish color","review":"I bought this dish to see what the set pattern and color would look like.

But what i got was a bunch of footage that I've seen many times. Compared to other WWE videos, this was not very detailed. It seems like they put this DVD together in less than an hour. It was relatively short and I was very disappointed with the content. Unless you're a diehard John Cena fan, don't but this DVD.

John Cena delivers with this one. There are some funny moments in the Extras as you see Cena and Eddie Guerrero in Singapore and you see Cena behind the scenes at the filming of his three YJStinger commericals. The chapters are amazing as well as you see Cena is some battle raps, doing some freestyles, and mingling with the McMahons. This DVD is one that should belong in your DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This dvd doesnt really do much justice for Cena. It was rushed in a hurry but for what purpose? The matches are good but the documentary on him is where it sucks. It forgets he beat Angle in his first match, and just kind of skips around to when he first started to rap. The raps are good for a few times around, espeically against Big Show. If your a Cena fan you might enjoy it , but there is alot left out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing special -but enjoyable","review":"The dvd contains some full matches, extras and a lot of battle raps from WWE performer John Cena who is described as \\"the future of WWE (SmackDown!)\\".I have to admit that there could have been more information about him and his past but in my opinion this is just one dvd of many thus I didn't expect to get the ultimate information anyway.He has many years left, the best of the current John Cena was shown-I guess there isn't more so far.All things considered I recommand \\"Word Life\\" only for the John Cena fans and although the price is a little bit too high (1 Disc-20 bucks), I wasn't dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I'm a huge John Cena fan, and this dvd was just not at all what I expected. It's just him and his posse of bald white dudes sitting around and talking about his freestyles. The full matches were good, but there wasn't really a lot of information about him outside of wrestling. i wish they had some of his matches form OVW or something like that. maybe even from his stint on Manhunt or whatever...but nothing. Just a bunch of freestyles, most of which are hard to hear cause they didn't edit the sounds of the fans out or anything. if you can rent it instead of buy it...do that instead...it's definitely not worth the 20 bucks i paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great DVD","review":"Not only does this DVD tell you everything there is to know about the Doctor of Thuganomics but also it takes a look at what made him famous. That is his famous rap promos dissing Lesnar-Taker-Angle-Show. All his classic rap promos + Battle raps with Angle and Show are in the DVD. His classic matches with Taker and Angle are also there to see.The only thing that this DVD doesnt fufill that it doesnt have MORE RAP PROMOS of CENA...1 CD should have been totally devoted to every single rap promo he did since Thanksgiving 2002!!!But at the end of the day, a great DVD and Im sure his 2nd DVD will be even better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the $$","review":"The only reason why WWE made this DVD was to capitalize on how over John Cena is on the fans. John Cena's had a limited career at the time this DVD was made, so not many note worthy matches. The \\"special features\\" weren't that great either.Get it if you must, but it's not really worth it.

It is nicely illustrated with color photographs correlated with descriptions of the probable genotypes of many horses of several breeds, and the tables and appendices will be useful to owners and particularly to breeders who are concerned with coloration. A much more cursory description is given of donkey coloration, the genetics of which is far less well worked out.

The notation is unwieldy, the explanations are unclear and there is very little to help your intuition. This, by the way, is not because of the mathematical or technical content which goes no deeper than introductory stochastic calculus and control.

Eleven of disc one's tracks were previously compiled on ONCE UPON A TIME and TWICE UPON A TIME. The so-called 'new' song \\"Dizzy\\" is an alternate version of a single sold on their 2002 tour. The selections skirt the Banshees' primal premiere, THE SCREAM, the underrated follow-up, JOIN HANDS, and 1982's delirious A KISS IN THE DREAMHOUSE. The 1978 pop hit \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" is the only (and highly uncharacteristic) evidence of the early, pre-Budgie lineup. Superb sound underscores the urgency of the need for a remastered Banshees back catalog. Why disc two is padded with remixes is a mystery, as there are dozens of original B-side songs that never been issued on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"been there, done that","review":"As most posted reviews have stated, the majority of these songs have been released on previous singles collections (but what singles they are !!!).

In one example, the book describes the complex life cycle of Velella, from deep sea denizen to the pelagic blue sails seen awash on beaches. Throughout, A Living Bay shares a fascinating story of Monterey sea life, from towering kelp forests to miniscule colonies of byrozoans--with beautiful photos, detailed and passionate writing that keeps you reading.This is my favorite book on sea life: a must-have supplement for lovers of Monterey bay, aquarium visitors, and all curious minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birth of a Nation.","review":"This is a must read for anyone who wants to renew their allegence to his/her country.

Wonderfully collected letters from common soldiers and key military/political players empowers \\"1776\\" with a deep felt honesty. Authenticity is maintained while still managing to not let the leviathan of information required for this book dull its delivery.

Too much of history is summaries and opinions of what occurred. But in the case of this country, we have the written words of those that made the history. The letters between congress and Washington's army, the letters home and even the letters from the British and Hessian troops. Why then do we need a summary from a scholar? David's book it an artful stitching together of conflict and personal stories. His willingness to give those writings equal footing to his own is a testament to his skill and desire to do right by these men.Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as it was advertised","review":"Enjoying the book - but didn't want to spend full price.

What a struggle to get through it. And how do you produce a book about battles, troop movements, and fortifications with NO MAPS? Beats me, but this author and his publisher seem to think readers don't need this type of graphical information. Maybe everyone knows where the Harlem River is and how Washington positioned his troops on Long Island. The included reproductions of ancient unreadable maps do not do the trick. If you want to read history with some life to it, try Jeff Shaara's, \\"The Glorious Cause.\\" Although billed as historical fiction, you get a better feeling for the personalities and challenges of 1776. Yes, Shaara's book has good maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I found this book to be very well researched. However, if you want to follow the battles and the movement of the troops you will have a very hard time if you are dependent on the maps. They are the original ones, drawn at the time, and extremely hard to read. I finally gave up and didn't bother; it was just too frustrating. Another problem that I had with the book is that the action really doesn't center on any one individual, but rather on a pastiche of different people. There are approximately 40 generals, both American and English that are introduced in the beginning of the book. The book begins in October 1775 and ends with a whimper and not a bang early in 1777. It is slow going in the beginning, for the first 120 pages and when it finally picks up you are left hanging with victory at Trenton and a quick summary of a couple of pages. The pace,structure and maps of this book are most unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"1776 in review","review":"I bought the book thinking it would read like a novel.

With the standard edition you simply have McCullough's word that the British had a better map of Boston than the Americans had. In this edition you can see the map for yourself. The same experience is repeated throughout the book, giving the reader a chance to experience the process of creating an historical narrative. I would have given this book 5 stars except that it is an abridgment and I don't like having books abridged."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible, magnificent book","review":"This book is absolutely breathtaking in its depth and scope of the year 1776 of the American Revolution. I have an entire lawyer's bookcase devoted to the American Revolution but not one of those books can come close to David McCullough's 1776 An Illustrated Edition. To be able to hold copies of letters, maps and documents from actual participants in the Revolution in your hand is a thrill. This is a \\"must have\\" for anyone with even the most passing interest in the American Revolution.As for the negative reviewer, someone should tell him that he is not the supreme literary dictator of the world. The aspects of the war that McCullough choses to cover he does with fantastic expertise.Don't let this great book get by you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why couldn't this have been my history class?","review":"This was a fantastically detailed and intimate look at the start of the Revolutionary War, from both the Rebel American and British sides. The author revealed Washington's great leadership skills, his lack of confidence in his abilities, and in some cases, his lack of ability and good decision making. Reading through most of the book you have to wonder how the British didn't win this war. The human cost of the rebel American's was tremendous, but their passion was strong. Washington's strong leadership carried through devastating defeat after defeat. Britain was experienced and made better tactical decisions - but they were arrogant and didn't believe they could win. I just wish it didn't end at 1776 .. now I can't wait to learn about the rest of the war!Note to American teachers -- if you can teach as well as McCullough wrote, students will remember their Revolutionary War history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing analysis of Washington","review":"This is a strange book. On the one hand it is very well written, engaging, and it illuminates the events of the revolutionary war in 1776 very well. On the other hand, the events of that year do NOT confirm the perspective that McCollough chooses to take toward his subject. The author clearly adopts the noble, father-of-his-country attitude toward Washington but then, simultaneously and confusingly, describes the military events of 1776 that show his hero as an ineffective, hesitant, and, arguably, incompetent leader. I therefore found the book unsatisfying and somewhat incoherent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative/inspiring.","review":"I love Mcullough's writing style as well as his reading style. It is both low-key and inspiring at the same time. We Americans need to listen to/read this wonderfully researched book or other such works related to our country's struggle to exist. Over and aver the reader is made aware of the sacrifices made by all of the brave men and women (and even children) of the time. I have only listened to the CD thus far, and am listening to the book a second time. I also own the book and will be enjoying that as well, I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth history lesson on 1776 Revolution","review":"This book reveals amazing details of the 1776 American Revolution. What stands out to me is how desperate the American army's situation was throughout that year. It is remarkable that the Continental Army was able to prevail in this war with such a challenging begining.McCullough delves into small and large matters of the events as he uses letters and accounts of the times to try to capture the reality of the events. He provides readers with insightful views of the leaders of both armies, and states of the armies, the attitudes of the citizens and governments.At times, it seemed like the writing was caught up in the minutiae of the times, but it all comes together to paint an extraordinary picture of the first year of our independence. I don't think history buffs or novices will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you slept through history class then read this book","review":"And if you want more then I recommend reading Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton as a follow up. The two books obviously share a common chronology yet give different perspectives on an incredibly rich period of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time to read!","review":"I found David McCullough's book a fine read. He brings a viewpoint on a most important part of American history that is not normally shared in the manner that this book is written. Many of the more subtle points of the book bring an understanding of the challenges of these times and make for an interesting read. You certainly learn more about George Washington than is normally available in traditional history books, or even in classes taught in college given that he is able to dedicate the whole book to a brief 1 - 2 year period in our history. I also found his style of writing to be very easy to understand while still providing a strong factual base of knowledge without being overly academic in his approach. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going back","review":"I really enjoyed the sense of immediacy McCullough develops in this work. Even though we all know how the story ends, as you read you find yourself a bit anxious about whether this will turn out right. The British point of view is also fascinating; King George really didn't think that the American rabble had much of a chance to prevail in that conflict. An excellent use of reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"History as a Nitpicking Grind","review":"If you like your history told in broad strokes then don't read this. However, if you are interested in George Washington's household accounts or the weather then climb aboard.You will learn that Washington was particularly fond of \\"fresh fish\\" and his kitchen in Virginia contained \\"beef, lamb, roasting pig\\", wild duck, geese, turtle... plums, peaches, barrels of cider, brandy and rum by the gallon, and limes by the hundred, these to fend off scurvy.\\"And I thought it was the British who were the \\"limeys\\"!This is a typical extract from this book which presents a bottom-up view of history with so much trivia and detail that it is impossible to see the forest for the trees.It also takes an approach to Washington that is more hagiographical than biographical.American patriots might love it. This foreigner who, incidentally was cheering on the American side in this conflict, was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"1776","review":"This book was very well written. The way the book flowed with depictions on both sides of the ocean, to the colorful descriptions of all the characters that were included.

And so it started! This stirring book covers our struggle starting decades before Boston and 1776 ended with Washington surprising the Hessian\`s at Trenton New Jersey. The Americans hadn't won in 1776, but they hadn't lost. They had survived by tactical retreats and outstanding leadership in the field and in Congress. America was a very large battlefield with few muddy roads and angry inhabitants. A really great book, that adds several centuries to your intellectual age.

I see nothing inappropriate in McCullough's emphasis on Washington's leadership; after all, his determined (if somewhat strategically challenged) direction united the rag-tag Continental Army in its darkest hours, not the high-minded idealism of philosophers in Philadelphia.

It's all about George Washington and \\"his\\" revolution and no one else, with the possible exception of John Adams. Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, among other notables, do not even appear in this history! In this \\"illustrated\\" edition, it gets even worse. Although the book is beautifully illustrated with lots of pictures and copies of important letters, it leaves out letters and documents by Franklin, Jefferson and other vital figures. Is David McCullough trying to rewrite history? Is he reflecting his bias in favor of John Adams and against Ben Franklin? Check the index and see what I mean. It's incredible.

It is good medicine for you who have insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"He finds the heart of the story.","review":"Too often history is written with an exhaustion of details. Trivial facts that, while interesting to the devoted, rarely mean much to the overall and grander story. David McCullough doesn't fall into that trap with this book. It's short (for a history book) and it accurately paints the awful circumstances, the frustrating human failings and the glorious triumph of this glorious nation. And it does it in less than 300 pages.Add to that the almost novel-like structure - foreshadowing, parallel narratives with intercut scenes, a limited cast from thousands of potential characters - and you have a really exciting story.This book makes you proud(er) to be an American.

It develops the story leading up to 1776 by telling about different battle of the war. David McCullough did a good job writing the book. I enjoyed reading the beginning of the book so I decided to read the whole book. It was a pleasant read for me because I enjoy war books and learning about past wars but there may be too much information for someone who is not as interested in war because some parts are a bit boring to read. It includes battles that are less known and I found them interesting because some I hadn't heard of before. Overall it is a good and fun read for someone who likes learning and reading about wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Quite Come Together","review":"McCullough probably knows 18th century America as well as anyone alive today, and yet in focusing on one year of that century, even what is arguably its most dynamic and important year, he misses the scope that was there to make John Adams the great book it was.1776 had a hollow feel to it. It seemed hurried and shallow and had it been slightly longer I think it would have benefitted from greater exploration of the daily life in these times. This book is still worth reading and is yet another feather in its author's cap. In other hands this would probably be a book I'd speak of with more praise and less nitpicking, but knowing as I do what McCullough is capable of in top form, I recognized that this book was slightly sub-par for an historian and writer of his talents.I do, however, look forward to his next book, which I'll be sure to pre-order, as I did 1776."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I thought I had it rough when I served my country!","review":"This book should be required reading by all our country's high schools!

Through the quotations of historical documents that grace nearly every page, the author peeks into the innermost thoughts of the army's soldiers, most notably General Washington.The author does not merely give a textbook-style lecture on the war; instead, he showcases the hardships and triumphs of the Revolutionary War in a compelling and interesting tale.\\"1776\\", by David McCullough, is an excellent read for the history buff, nonfiction lover, or simply anyone searching for a page-turner novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coherent and compelling","review":"Most books on history are informative but dull--1776 was engrossing. Even knowing that Washington must eventually prevail, I was anxious for him throughout the book.

The result is the most coherent historical book that I have read.

It is a clear and concise chronicle of the events taking place during 1776 to found and shape a new nation. McCullogh's documentation brings to light the hearts and minds of the soldier by including accounts from diaries, journal entries and letters of the men who fought in the Revolution. 1776 by David McCullogh is the quintessential work covering the day-to-day events of the early American forces as they followed General George Washington into battle. Many of those conflicts were losses for the rebels and 1776 clearly paints the horrors and sufferings during those conflicts with detail, and the Patriot's exuberance over their victories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - needs a proofreader","review":"David McCullough is up to his usual standard of excellence. 1776 was a well written fast-paced history of the most critical year in our war for independence.I got a little annoyed, however, at the constant misuse of \\"principal\\" and \\"principle\\".

I've read other books on the revolutionary period, but I expected a fresh and detailed approach from this author. Instead, what I got seemed like a rehash of what I had read numerous times before. McCullough's \\"The Great Bridge\\" and \\"The Path Between The Seas\\" were great and original ideas done in an interesting and informative style, but this book is basically a junior-high-school-level introduction to the subject. Forget the hype, this book is a potboiler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish there was more","review":"Slow starting book that soon became very interesting. Thought the ending was too abrubt. Have read His Excellency by Ellis and John Adams by McCullogh. Would recommend His Excellency as a companion to this book as it provides more information on Washington to his death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Read But Material Isn't Fresh","review":"McCullough earns his pay. His writing, compared to other respected historians or even to best-selling novelist, is top-notch. Truman and John Adams were incredible works that turned historic figures into living people for me and I'm sure for countless others. His latest work, 1776, is every bit the equal of his earlier works when it comes to readability. But it lacks something I find important in first-level history books: wider and more in-depth information.I don't mean to attack McCullough's research on 1776. As usually, it is meticulous. But it seems as if he simply picked up the research notes he didn't use on the Adams book and use it for this book.1776 starts before 1776 and ends after it, but limiting the book to a little more than one year left me wanting more of the story. I guess if that is the worst you can say about McCullough, than he most be being a lot right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary Masterpiece","review":"1776 is one of the most descriptive and influential books I have ever read. McCullough is an extraordinary author and put every ounce of energy into writing this book. The book contains countless hours of research conducted by McCullough, and boy was it worth it. The way he describes the ups and downs of the Cause makes you more than thankful for freedom. Washington, Greene, Knox, Putnam, Howe, and Cornwallis are all the main characters along with countless others who all risked everything they had for the future of the colonies. Every American should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Respect for Washington","review":"1776 is an outstanding account of the Revolutionary War. It is not intimidating in any way as I remember all my history text books to be. It covers the war from both sides and allows the reader to make his or her own mind up about who is a hero and who is not.Washington was a hero without a doubt, but in 1776 we see the human side of the man which is in stark contrast to the stoic face we see on the dollar bill. In many ways 1776 has reminded me what the term \\"hero\\" should encompass.I shudder at the thought of taking the trash to the curb on a cold morning wearing my PJs and slippers. I can not imagine what it must've been like for the Continental Army to march across the frozen grounds of Boston, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware.On second thought, yes I can, thanks to this wonderful book, which had me saying, \\"God Bless America!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"1776","review":"quite possibly the best book on the american revolution ever written , if your a history buff you should own a copy"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MEN MAKE MISTAKES","review":"This is an interesting and easy to read chronology of the first year of the Revolutionary War with a personal and human perspective rather than a philosophical or economic assessment of the relationship between great Britain and the emerging 13 colonies at the time of the break from Britain. The figure of Washington is seen as a man with his own flaws and prejudices but with an unflinching personal commitment to a responsibility that he often regrets having assumed. Washington is hard headed and at least initially seen to be without a full grasp of the military situation confronting him in New England. As time progresses he gains an appreciation for the \\"Yankees\\" from New England and finds the true strength in the leadership of Nathaneal Greene and Knox. The book is not overly technical in terms of tactics and battlefield analysis but does give a good look inside the man who perservered to final victory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR EVERY AMERICAN!","review":"David McCullough is at his best in 1776. His narrative is extremely skilled, precise, and eloquent. He is not only a great historian, he is a master of the literary arts.

Even though I am a history buff, he provided many new insights into what really happened that fateful year of 1776. I wish that history were taught using such books as 1776 as mandatory reading because it would make history seem alive for the student and not just some exercise in memorizing dates and names for a final exam.Again, my hat is off to Mr. McCullough for providing such extraordinary insight into the early years of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"like your local high school team beating the Yankees","review":"This is an excellent account of the early years of America's War for Independence. McCullough traces the history behind the war, and really does an excellent job going into the personalities of those involved, both on the American and British sides. His writing is wordy and tedious at times, which is my only reservation concerning this book.This is a wonderful book for adults to revisit their American history days, and much of the information is new for those of us who are not terribly well-versed in American history. It is truly amazing in retrospect how the American colonists defeated the British considering how much more of a \\"fly-by-night\\" force we were.

In my opinion it is simply not up to the standard he set by his terrific biography of Truman or his wonderful story of the Panama Canal, The Path Between the Seas.That part of 1776 about the battle of Trenton does not begin to compare to narrative on the same subject in the book, Washington's Crossing by David Hacket Fischer; a book I recommend to all having an interest in that part of our history.SRW"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I'm going to go against the grain and say that I did not like this book. It was long-winded, rambling, and more than a little disjointed. I am normal a huge face of his work (Truman is one of my favorite biographies of all time). But this book seemed like he gathered up all the scraps from his Adams biography and dumped it into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book. Wanted to learn so much more about the founding fathers of this great country.However, this book was way too flat for my tastes.

It is a great book","review":"This book like no other brings George Washington and the war years to life. As an American this is one of the best books you could ever read. It is one of the best historical books ever written. Anyone that calls this a good book has no perspective. I am an avid reader and have read many books on history and on of course other topics. This is a great book by any measure. Anyone that says otherwise does not have a clue about literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requires some prior knowledge","review":"1776 gives an excellent account of what it purports to be about, the year 1776 and its importance in the Revolutionary War. The narrative pertains almost exclusively to the military operations that were undertaken that year, some of which were very significant in the war, and rarely strays from that arena. However, the narrative is interesting to follow, and it provides good insights into the people involved in one of the most significant years in American History. That said, the book is a look at a piece of the overall story of the Revolutionary War that does not give a complete look at the war, the economics, and the social consequences. But McCullough never said it was going to be about all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"1776.\\"","review":"David McCullough has done it again! A suberb account of the early trials and campaigns of the Continental Army, it also features intriguing character sketches of Generals Washington, Greene, Knox and others.I was particularly fascinated by McCullough's account of how Washington was \\"out-generaled\\" and out-manuevered in the battles in and around the islands of Long Island and Manhattan in the second half of that fateful year.The book was so interesting that I was sorry to see the year end!I recommend the book to anybody with the slightest interest in American and/or military history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of American History","review":"I had been told by many people that this is a must read.

The courage and wisdom of those who struggled for freedom comes fully to light in this book. For those readers who enjoyed 1776 (as did I), I would also highly recommend readingGod of Our Fathers: Advice and Prayers of Our Nation's Founders"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to our nation's history","review":"David McCullough's book, though not thorough in introducing the reader to all the twists and turns of our nation's early history, does an excellent job in introducing George Washington, King George of England and the daunting task that Washington had in trying to hold a truly \\"rag tag\\" army together while the British tried to vanquish the Revolutionaries in the Colonies.Washington is seen as a solid general who knows when to fight and when to retreat. The British, for numerous reasons, never took the fight to the Americans when they had the opportunity to do so. The book will help anyone get a better understanding of how fragile the Revolution really was in 1776 as McCullough does an excellent job in writing about that historical year.If you want a good start (a well written primer) on our nations' early history you can't go wrong with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I'm half-way reading 1776 and I think it's one of the best books I've read. If you enjoy reading non-fiction, especially history books, then this is a must. The author does a great job of chronolizing the events and what i like most is that he throws in a lot of exerpts from letters and historical documents. Obviously, a lot of research was done in writing this book. The level of detail in describing the events is excellent and riveting. The author does a great job of portraying the personalities and backgrounds of the main characters. Reading this book has given me a great appreciation and understanding of the revolutionary war that I never had before. I think this book is excellent. If you're even slightly thinking about buying it, do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"George is the man","review":"The book was just under 300 pages. It was a page turner. The history was accurately told and well footnoted. The force of George Washington's personality and the loyality he engendered was amazing. How precious our freedom seems when you consider what George and his troops had to go through and ultimately how lucky they were. I enjoyed this book. I am not sure why I am not giving 5 starts. I wasn't impressed, I guess. The book felt formulaic. The year 1776 seemed like such an artificial construction. Too much of the war went on before and after 1776. Too much was left out.I am definitely reading \\"John Adams\\" soon. I enjoyed the writer's style and people told me after I read 1776 that this wasn't his best book. If that is the case, I'm strongly looking forward to reading more from McCullough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! But better if you know what it covers first...","review":"I have recently been reading several books of our founding fathers and the revolution in general. I also recently read McCullough's John Adams.I find this book emminently more readable. I was gripped by the story almost from the start and could hardly put it down.I will say though that I thought this would be an overview of the entire Revolutionary War as well as some thoughts on the Contintental Congress and the writing of the Declaration of Independence (I know, that would require 10x the pages, but I was hoping). Instead, the book covers primarily the war from late 1775 when King George III commits troops to quell the rebellion and ends in January 1777 shortly after the crossing of the Delaware and the skirmish at Trenton. It only mentions the Contintental Congress and the Declaration in passing.If you know that going in, and that's what you want, then you will have found an excellent historical read."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCullough does it again","review":"David McCullough is one of those rare treats that can successfully straddle the line between academia and pop history.

It can be a tiny bit dry but that is overwhelmed by his fine writing,"},{"rating":"2","title":"History told at its best","review":"A liitle tough to read in the beginning becasue of the use of \\"old English\\", this book spells out in detail the year of 1776 and how our country came into existance. After reading the book, it's a small wonder Americia still isn't a colony today."},{"rating":"2","title":"David McCullough at his Best","review":"In this fine, concise work, McCullough permits the reader to view the pivotal year of 1776 through the lens of American \\"rebels\\" and the English / Hessians who clashed with them- at every level of society. Most think of 1776 as a year of American glory and the signing of the Declaration of Independence, when in reality, it was a shaky, pivotal, bloody, brutal year for His Excellency, George Washington and his rag-tag troops. McCullough takes you from Bunker Hill and the British retreat from Boston to successive American defeats to a conclusion with the battles that would sustain the revolution- Trenton and Princeton. \\"Sustain\\" is the operative word, as the Revolution would require help from overseas powers and 6.5 more years to succeed.McCullough's attention to detail, personalities, and seemingly minor factors such as wind direction that had disproportionate effects add up to a new take on an old subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding history at last!","review":"The narrative abridgmeent of 1776 by David McCullough, read by the author, is terrifc. My 15-year old son suggested we listen to it on a road trip after he got sick of listening to Emmien, and 1776 lasted us for 2 or 3 days as we meandered through the Colorado Rockies and the Navajo Reservation in Arizona. It is a terrific story, very well told, and full of suspense for both of us--even though I suppsoedly learned all about the American Revolution about 30 years ago in school! A good book to listen to with teenagers, or other adults.Patrick O'Connor, St. Paul, MN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Simplistic","review":"I am big fan of the author but this book was a very simplistic look at the revolutionary war. I picked up the book hoping to gain a greater insight of the war and the occurences of 1776 but what I got was a very gloossed over version of the true events.If you want a basic explanation of the begining of the war, then this book is great.

The book comes in a cardboard case and the case was broken, which may not seem like a big deal but as this was the second one I ordered and both were broken it was rather irritating.

Disappointing that the quality of the product did not meet the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the best","review":"I read David Hackett FIscher's 2004 \`Washington's Crossing' on the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, and thus neglected McCullough's \`1776' when it was published in 2005.There's none I esteem more than McCullough (John Adams, Truman, The Path Between the Seas, The Great Bridge, etc). His only possible rival is David Hackett Fischer. And in this case, after recently reading \`1776,' Hackett Fischer's \`Washington's Crossing' remains superior.That said, McCullough excels at setting the stage of disaster (unsuccessful rebel campaigns, Washington's indecision and near fatal mistakes, and contemporary correspondence - especially Joseph Reed).\`1776' is an able and accomplished work. It plumbs the depths of nascent rebels and Washington's trials (and scarce triumphs). If Hackett FIscher excels on Trenton and Princeton, McCullough serves a valuable course on the desperate state of rebel affairs. If you have the means, read them both and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Blow by Blow accounts","review":"This book on CD is read by its author David McCullough. David is a scholar on all of the letters that were written by soldiers, Washington, the British and others during this period. This is not focused on John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and what the Continental Congress were doing in 1776, but on Washington and his armies. The camp set up and troop conditions are told constantly. This is an eye opening account on how close the United States came to losing this war. What is most interesting about the book is George Washington himself. Here you have this great leader who is often indecisive, worried, and having his leadership called into question. Sometimes we forget that guys like Washington and other great leaders are like the rest of us in these areas. This is not an account of the entire war, but is just simply 1776. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Not going to go into a full review here... plenty of people here have said it just fine, so no need for that. What I would like to add is that this excellent book is even better when read by the author on audio book. I highly recommend that if you like audio books, you consider getting the audio book version of 1776. McCullough is an excellent reader.This book will show you just how close we came to losing our independence. It is filled with gripping tension, while at the same time having interspersed anecdotal humor. I enjoyed it very much one single very long road trip from southern California to Washington State, and it made an excellent companion for the road. It was hard to stop listening... not a single moment bored me. When I would stop for meals along the way, I could hardly wait to get back to it.

But I soon found myself racing to the final sentence and enjoying every page. Unfortunately, the year 1776 had to come to an end (likewise the book) and I was wishing there was a \\"1777\\" follow-up.

It is not just accurate history but it is inspirational reading. I have never before read a history book that kept me on the edge of my seat wondering how it would end. Of course we know the history of George Washington and what happened in 1776 but the masterful way that McCullough has presented this great man and the history of this pivitol year will leave you wondering how America ever got started in the first place. Read everything David McCullough has written and will write."},{"rating":"2","title":"A turning point in history","review":"Most of what many of us know about the American Revolution comes from high school or college text books. In 1776, David McCullough fleshes out the history by including descriptions of the physical and personal characteristics of those most heavily involved with the winning of this nation's freedom. George Washington, in particular, is no two-dimensional hero, but is shown with both his virtues and flaws. The condition of the Continental Army is described and documented in detail, including the absence of shoes and proper hygiene. Things could not have seemed more dire for Washington's forces after they retreated from New York in 1776. The turnaround came at Trenton, described by McCullough as a \\"plain little place of no particular consequence\\", which suddenly became the city of Washington's most significant victory. This book will be interesting to most, but especially history buffs who will enjoy the detail of military tactics and mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"1776, A key year in American History","review":"David McCullough's latest offering is a well, researched and written narration of this important year in our history. While not as detailed and in depth as his outstanding John Adams biography; this book is just as wonderfully written and throughly descriptive. The fair handed showing of both the British and American perspectives bring the conflict to life in a very clear and easy to understand manner.I would recommend this book to any casual student of American History. It provides an excellent overview of the key events of 1776. The insight into the moods, decision making, and relationships between the key figures of the American Revolution as well as their Britsh counterpartsThis history publication deserves a place on every history readers bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Book by David McCollough","review":"Having read a number of David McCollough books it is not surprising that I find this another example of excellent entertaining and educational reading. McCollough has a way of intertwining historical first-hand accounts with his reflections on the times that make this book a wonderful account of the first year of the Revolutionary War. I have read other books on United States early history and most, while quite good, are forced to \\"gloss-over\\" subtleties of the time becuase of the enormous volume of the story that is being told. By focusing on only 1776 McCollough gives the reader the opportunity to learn about the incarnation and early stages of the war--in many ways the year that demonstatrated to many of the time that this was not to be a fast war. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a greater understanding of the time--you will be edutained."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a treat!","review":"1776 is Vintage McCullough -- a thoroughgoing and highly entertaining popular history. I had the added pleasure of listening to 1776 read by the author, the best of readers. I only wish McCullough had gone on to chronicle the remaining years of the American Revolution. A superb book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings history to life","review":"From my experience, very rarely will a history book produce effects and feelings similarly found in movies or tv. Visual stimulation is usually high on the drama and theatrical effects, whereas books tend to be more detailed and historically accurate. But this account succeeds in both aspects.The characters jump off the pages and come to life. You get great insights into the way life was back then and how we managed to fight the war with a lack of experience, men, and arsenal. You get a great appreciation for what Americans (well not even Americans yet) went though. Men with very little military experience were asked to step up and lead a revolt against all odds.A well written, historically sound read with some parts, specifically some quotes, that were found in the Benjamin Franklin biography. All in all worth the time to read but if your not a die hard historian you may wait and see if comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"A very well written book full of life and history. Very few writers can put together a historical moment without making it look like a text book. I felt as though I was living in the moment looking around me, even feeling the temperature. The book draws you in. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great hook to reintroduce you to the War for Independence","review":"I'd read some Revolutionary War books before, but after hearing all the hype of 1776 I thought I'd give it a read. It was such a refreshing and new take on a war fought so long ago in a time so very different from our own. The author explains the roots of the war so the reader has a full knowledge of what spurned the movement for independence. I had never realized how reluctant yet dedicated a leader Washington was. I earned a new respect for this character that most now only associate with a $1 bill. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was that it ended too abruptly and left me wanting more! Thankfully, I found some other great books to see me through until the end.Rarely does a book live up to all the hype but this one clearly does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"This book was about 200 pages too long, could have been written in about 100 pages. McCullough repeats himself multiple times concerning the disposition of General Washington's troops. Not very descriptive with the battles or the political atmosphere. McCullough get's caught up in mundane detail and returns several times to these descriptions. I was hoping McCullough's style to be similar to Stephen E. Ambrose \\"Band of Brothers\\" or James Bradley \\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\". Unfortunately I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I was dying to get a copy of this book. When I finally got it I could not wait to dive in. I dove in and it was ok. I figured it just started slow and dry. I month or two later I tried it again from the beginning. I made it a few chapters farther. However I could not stay interested no matter how hard I tried. I have read history books and been captivated. I was never captivated.

Truman is my favorite book of all time. 1776 is horrible. I can't understand why no other reviews critize this book for being boring, unreadable and utterly lacking in charm.

Some positive some not. After reading I must admit that I was suprised at the sudden ending. Washington had just been successful at Princeton and the war was turning in favor of the Americans . Previously MvCullough described in detail all of the battles won and lost then he devotes one sentence to the surrender at Yorktown. That's it. He previously devoted 12 lines of type describing the goods left behind by the rector of King's Chapel when the British retreated from Boston, but only one for the ending of the war. The negative reviewers were correct.

Since buying Mr. Ray's CD we've gone to his live shows and it is obvious how much other kids and parents like him.

RAY doesn't play down to to kids at all. Rather, he elevates their musical sensibilities. This is a musically sophisticated and hip disk that even parents will really dig, even after repeated listenings (when did you ever think you'd hear a fellow parent say THAT about a kid's record?!). \\"Starlight Angel\\" could easily stand on its own on a typical rock album.Lots of different musical flavors. The Beatle influence is very much apparent. Even the retro Theremin sound on \\"Kalien\\" will make parents smile, as will as will mr. RAY's request to \\"sing it louder space cadettes!\\". Incredibly clever. Every song delivers a positive message- something every kid needs these days.This guy is already huge in his native state of NJ, and deservedly so.

In the book Franklin goes back to his room to make Bear feel more comfortable and gives Bunny a hug and says Good night to Bunny. In television episode, Franklin called Bear's parents and let him talked to his parents. Then they playe with the flashlight doing signals to Bears parents.

They are taken prisoner by the Japanese when the plan fails, and they learn about another enemy who lives by a different code, who also reacts with \\"honor\\", but one that is vastly different than that of any Westerner.

The eleven short stories are told by the male perspective, which to the typical Red Dress fan will feel a bit foreign yet not much different than discussing Love and Basketball with spouses or boyfriends. Just think of movie selections and how men prefer blood and gore while Cary Grant or Oliver Stone (even if Elvis lives) is agreed upon not because males want to see a fine romantic comedy or a deep exposé, but watched in the ever hope of scoring. Each tale is an intelligent well written story told by the male lead. Though there is some profanity (what do you expect from the Y chromosome?) readers who want to try something different will enjoy the switch from AC to DC (chick lit to hunk shtick) male spinning account of the war between the sexes.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"great detective novel","review":"Craig Kennedy adventures in the silent bullet is a comfortable read along the lines of Sherlock but these take place in the early 20's USA.

Some of these are on the Atlantic set \\"The Birth of Soul\\", but if you like Ray in the (mostly) piano, guitar, bass format this is a very complete set. His piano playing and singing are wonderful, though derivitive. But this shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of the music. Granted, this stuff was recorded before he started creating his own distinctive fusion of gospel and rock and roll that made him a true original. However, this music is great on its own terms. Ray gets really deep into the blues numbers and his piano is right up front throughout, with no horns or back-up singers to distract from his pure sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"protects","review":"It's a foru inch baseball catchers mask throat protector.

The science involved is unbelievable. Some issues are never addressed that need to be.. (Niko the chimp has Andrew's complete memory and personality, and one would assume, intelligence, yet he is ignored for the most part.) Some coincidences are so extreme they are laughable... (Peter just happens to arrive at Bethisda during an archeological dig of his hometown, which evidently was burried shortly after he left to follow Jesus, since he tells the archeoligists what they will find, and then, moments later! they do.) And finally it is never believable that Peter so rapidly becomes accustomed to 20th century life.All the same, the book is fun reading, provided you aren't too put off by Bailey putting his beliefs into Saint Peter's mouth.

With BTW French, you'll learn far more vocabulary, faster than with French With Michel Thomas and you'll learn you create your own original sentences.I think you will enjoy using both courses because the methods are totally different.BTW French uses a great native French woman's voice named Celine.Very easy to imitate and to get the accent right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"I am a second year French student and my first year was far from pleasant, to say the least.

Now, I am doing well in French and not afraid to speak up in class (which is taught immersion-style). I highly recommend these CDs from beginners or for a refresher course. It doesn't teach you everything (grammer, etc), but it is wonderful at helping one get over the fear of learning something new.

She needed no encouragement from me since, at only 16 years of age, she had already produced an engaging piece of literature that could hold its own. C.H. demonstrates a command of English that would incite envy in a seasoned writer. The world she creates is complex, enticing, and fresh; a difficult achievement in the over-saturated realm of fantasy publications. C.H.'s eye is not set on the writing of her peers, but on the literary accomplishments of the great western writers such as J.R.R.

It starts with unsecured wireless enabled, with easy default user and password, so be careful to secure it quickly. Also, if you disable the wireless, you have to do a factory reset to get it connected again. The default timeout for DHCP is too low, and there is apparently some sort of problem with a computer trying to refresh its IP (doesn't work, and seems to cause the router to reboot). The router will mysterious reboot for no reason with only one computer connected running virtually no load.The one redeeming factor of this router is that it can do whitelist MAC filtering which I wish the other vendors would do with their low end routers.

All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ingredients not as described","review":"This is a Thailand made product and includes Vanillin (a petrochemical derivative and substitute for vanilla) - a fact that is missing from the product ingredients listed on the page as of 9/6/2012.\\"IngredientsMalt Extract, Milk, Cocoa, Whey, Tapioca Syrup, Palm Oil, Vitamin Mix, Calcium, Thiamine, Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin A, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin D3, Iron, Lactose, Manganese, Potassium, Magnesium, Folic Acid, Zinc.\\"Totally overpriced in the US for a product that has worse ingredients.

Easy to set-up, easy to store, easy to carry, easy to start, all around very simple and perfect for what it is for. The only downside I experienced was trying to use 2 medium/large pans on it at once. I could do it, but I had to take down one of the wind shields. It was kind of windy at the time, but the burners still stayed lit, so obviously it was not much of a problem.This thing gives off plenty of heat and is so easy to start, use and set-up with no tools required. I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great camp stove!","review":"This is our first camp stove, and hopefully it will last us for years. We really liked the instant start instead of using matches. And the burners work very well. I like the wind sheilds that double as a spoon rest also. It worked perfectly, and is very well constructed. I wish the handle was more comfortable to use though.

I would recommend getting bag as well for carrying this stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third and last try being returned","review":"As of today, I will have ordered and returned three of these stoves, all of which were defective out of the box. The first had a warped grate or stove top (not sure which), which prevented the grate from sitting firmly in place (it wobbled like a table with a short leg). The second and third both had deformed bases (stamped metal that wasn't stamped properly) and so did not match up with either the stove top or the lid, leaving open holes and jagged edges along what should have been a snug seam. If I were Coleman, I'd be pressing my Chinese suppliers for compensation for the consistently shoddy manufacture/assembly of one of my core products. I will look for something else at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK stove","review":"I have used many Coleman products in the past and used to have high opinion of them. The two-burner stove does not have the same fit and finish as Coleman stoves used to have. In fact there is no carrying handle but a whole to slip your fingers into! The InstaStart did not work for me no matter how hard I tried. The user manual meekly says to use a match if it does not work. Otherwise it is like any other propane stove. It heats up quickly (may be too quickly if you are cooking rice). The stove is for our occasional use as we go through kitchen remodeling.

So called adjustable burners use 1/16 of the knob to go from off to high, the other turn and a half is just wasted motion. A true testament to how far Coleman has sunk from the quality products that made their name for 50 years. Looks like it was assembled in a Chinese kindergarten."},{"rating":"2","title":"beyond perfect!","review":"I used this stove during a 2-week car camping trip to several national parks. My companions and I love the stove! It heats fast, and is easy to set up, take down, operate, and clean up. It handled multiple daily use very well and was extremely reliable. Heating a cup of water for tea took a minute or less. I only heated water or cans of soup myself, but one of my party was from Indonesia and made delicious spicy fried rice from scratch every night. Once in a while, one of the burners didn't ignite with a press of the red ignition button, but it would light with a match. I would use this stove at home on the patio when I want to stir-fry or deep-fry something at high temperatures without having the house smelling of cooking oil.

I've heard (most of) them enough times as background music, without context or concentration, that they turned to plastic; Cat Stevens and Elton John, in particular. The genius of the movie is that they are all forgiven of their detours, the cache of bad memories is cleared and the songs are reborn. It's like the first time you (anxiously, carefully) set the needle to the vinyl.If you enjoyed the movie this will continue its vein until you can see it again.

I never get tired of listening to it and I have listened to it for 3-4 repeated cycles at a time before.

Not only does this bad-boy come with more effects than you can shake a stick at (be warned however, the wah is very weak), it also comes with a pitch shifter and harmonizer. For those that do not know what am I talking about, a pitch shifter allows you to change the tuning that you are playing in without re-tuning. You can go either one octave below standard, or 2 octaves above standard. A harmonizer allows you to play those beautiful harmonies without the need for 2 or 3 other guitarists.

I never used the conventional electric any more. This unit is not as uniform as gas, it still cycles on and off to control the output. It has ten output settings though, which gives much better control than an electric coil range. One feature that I wish for is a lower output at the 1 setting.

For best simmering,one needs an adjustable flame. Period"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"Very good kitchen tool! Small, very quick ! ENERGY EFFICIENT!

It is easy to use, almost comically fast to bring water to boil. I was disappointed to discover how few of my stainless steel pans worked on it tho--the Farberware and Revereware seem to have too much aluminum or copper. Cast iron was fine( but I was always worried about scratching or damaging the glass top with such a heavy pan). Wish I had run the magnet test before purchasing it. Now that the new stove is in I'm not sure how much use it will get but an extra burner might prove handy from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new way to cook.","review":"I really like the speed and ease of cleaning this little cooktop. It takes a bit of practice and trial and error to figure the power, temp and time needed but it works a dream. Just remember it seems to be hottest at the center ring and not as efficient at the outer ring. But I have used a cast iron pan which seems to distribute the heat better and it has worked very well. Much faster heating and cooling than an ordinary electric burner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cooktop","review":"I got this unit for doing some hobby craft work- basically I use it to boil water most of the time.It was larger than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. I use a large enameled cast iron pot and it fits great.I love that it has the \\"temperature hold\\" feature. I can set it to keep water just below a simmer and it works a treat. The only downside (which is slight) is that you have to live with pre-set temperatures; for me it's either 210F or 250F, nothing in between.The fan is a little noisy, but it doesn't bother me.I use it on a butcher block counter and the feet left little black marks the first time I used it.For the price, I'm thrilled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small cooking area","review":"The cooking area of the burner (the section of the pan that actually gets hot) is only about 5\\" across, and, at least with my cast-iron skillet, it really doesn't spread. I tried putting a couple of inches of water in the skillet, and it boiled reasonably fast, but only in the small area. I waited several minutes, and only that area was boiling. This would make sauteeing or frying almost impossible, since food that's not in the center of the pan won't get cooked at all.On the plus side, the controls are reasonable (though having to press a button repeatedly to adjust the temperature each time you turn the thing on is likely to get old fast), the power is adequate, and the noise isn't bad. However, the small cooking area makes it almost useless unless you're working with a very small pan. I have returned the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative experience","review":"It only worked about 12 times. The surface scratches easily.The last 4 times it acted weird.The lights would all sadly blink and then the unit would cut itself off without running the fan.This happened on levels 1, 2 and 3. It was not overheated. I was boiling eggs and it shut off before the water started boiling.Last night when I tried to plug the unit into the electrical socket, the unit blew up, shooting a flame into the air from the back of the unit. My arm was over that flame. Luckily I had on a shirt with a tough long cuff. So I was not injured.I think induction technology is great. However, this is not the product to buy to test out this wonderful technology. Buy any other product except this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised [mostly]","review":"These induction cookers have some really great application, if you need one.If you want to cook where there isn't cooking facilities, this is the ticket.Don't try too large of a heavy cast iron skillet, it will overload."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor craftsmanship issue","review":"My initial reactions to this product are more due to my lack of familiarity with induction cooking than to any real issues with the cooktop itself.The only \\"real\\" issue I've got is that the main cooking area is apparently fastened to the rest of the frame with a glue, and on my unit the top wasn't squared with the frame before the glue set, leaving it slightly askew (about 1.5 degrees left). But it doesn't have any impact of the functionality of the unit, which so far is just as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as well as the expensive ones.","review":"Went to a cookware demo for a very expensive set of cookware.

We cook on a propane stove and it takes forever to boil a gallon of water this cook plate boils that same gallon in a 10th the time and does it amazingly efficiantly. I actually do most of my cooking on a paper towel to keep the mess down. My wife a traditional cook had reservations but now uses our Max B 6000 almost exclusively. If you try it you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, cooks well, interface could be better, beeps too loud","review":"Induction cooking is fantastic, far superior to traditional electric and more efficient and practical than gas. This is the cheapest and best value to get into induction cooking. This is powerful. The other similar portable units are 1200 or 1300 watts usually, and this is 1800. It boils water noticeably faster than our other portable unit. Unfortunately, every push of a button emits a very loud beep, which really isn't necessary. And when the timer goes off it just beeps once instead of more noticeably (of course it stops cooking as well, so it isn't a real problem, but just not ideal). The interface is a little less straightforward than our other unit also. But this is the most powerful and the cheapest portable induction unit, and it works great. We've had no problems so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"Never thought I would invite people over to look at my hot plate, but I do this one. I especially like the feature that turns the plate off when the time is up, making it great for pressure cooking.

You can either spend twice as much for a brand that is more likely to work the first time you order it, or you can spend less and deal with the potential inconvenience of having to exchange this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I paid $74.99 through Amazon for this item 2 weeks ago","review":"the seller was Global Tool Depot, S&H; was $7.99.That having been said, we like this induction cooktop. We're considering replacing our electric cooktop with either a gas or induction cooktop. We would have to have a propane tank installed if we go with gas, so we were interested in alternatives. It has about half the power of the more powerful induction burners on installed cooktops and has only a 5 inch or so cooking area. It boils water quickly, it is indeed every bit as responsive as a gas burner and we've had no problems with it yet. I think we'll go ahead and use this cooking technology based on the performance of this small cooktop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to cook with","review":"I used this unit for 15 months. My first and only use of induction. Selling point for me: this is the hottest BTU avail. in this price range. Duration timer, and ability to set temp is vital. One thing to be careful of: The grommet where the power cord attached to the unit can wear out if you move the unit around too much. But company stands by unit if that occurs.Be aware it's a glass top. Note the weight limits. I use a very heavy wok with no problems though. Bring a magnet with you when purchasing cookware.

The first one I ordered arrived with the glass top broken near a corner. I returned it and asked for a refund. I ordered a second time thinking, \\"What are the odds I would receive TWO broken cooktops?\\" The odds are 100%. The second cooktop was also broken. The manufacturers box was simply put into a cardboard shipping box with ONE sheet of kraft paper to \\"cushion\\" it. That is totally inadequate. The cooktop is GLASS.

After a couple of weeks using this cooktop it has shown me its strengths and failings. First it works as described. It heats pans quickly and is apparently very energy efficient. With the pans I have and the way I cook (slower than normal, I don't like to burn stuff) all of the settings I use are between 1 and 3. Their scale of 1 to 10 goes way past what I need. and their fine tuning leaves a little to be desired. I have been using a towel under the pans to keep then from scraping the top surface. The unit is easy to clean and looks like new still. My learning curve with cast iron pans is complete.(I now know how to keep them seasoned.) The fan noise is similar to a computer fan. The high pitch sound on mine only occurs on high settings. (Which I rarely use or I can't hear). Overall I would switch to induction cooking if they had a scale of 1 to 100 for heat settings and they used a fan that was a little quieter."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fantastic value!","review":"To be able to buy an induction unit for less than $70 is astonishing! The unit is powered by the \\"normal\\" 115V, so one can plug it to any 15 amps socket, as long as it is not overloaded. I thought that my stainless steel cookware was compatible with it, UNFORTUNATELY, it was not! One must realize that the cookware has to be ferromagnetic in order to work with an induction burner (a magnet has to stick to the bottom of the pot). People should be aware that they may need to buy a new cookware set! An extra expense. Luckily, I found an excellent cookware set at Walmart online that sells for \\"only\\" $149 for 10 heavy-duty pieces, which are ferromagnetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cooktop ever","review":"Boils a full pot of water (+3 cups) in under 4 minutes - incredible!

It works well on the lanai for deep frying to keep the grease outdoors. It contains a fan that makes a little noise that is unnoticed outdoors.

Yes, it gets very hot quickly. Due to the size for surface cooking, it was limiting when we were searing a large cut of meat. With a little maneuvering -- had to brown the meat in sections, we were finally able to get this done. Our main use for this induction cooktop is to use it outside on the patio so that we don't get a grease laden house. The controls are plastic and are probably not the best quality however they seem to be sturdy enough. Frying oil heats up quickly but you must crank it up to the highest temp. Managing the controls for the right temperature can be a bit tricky and inconsistent. Just need to practice this more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for long term","review":"I purchased this item at the end of Jan 09. From the day it arrived it would randomly come up with an error that the book says needs to be unplugged to reset. I thought that it was OK to deal with this, reflecting back I don't know why. The cooktop has many neat features such as temperature control and timer so it shuts off after cooking for the time you set, which is great for someone that forgets the water is boiling until it is half gone. It boils water faster than any method I found.The story ends this way, It is the end of October 09 and the unit blows a fuse if it is plugged in. Less than a year with a couple of months that it was not used is hardly a good product in my view. I would not purchase this model again, yet the concept of using induction cooking is awesome and I would choose a brand that has a better guarantee. This is ideal if you want a low cost test on what the technique is like, which is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product - But Heat Control Failed after a few months","review":"Bought the Max Burton 6000 1800-Watt in Feb 2011 after quite a bit of research.Love it for stir fries, steaming veggies, making soups.I especially love that it uses much less electricity and does not heat up the room.Unfortunately the pressure control button to reduce heat setting just stopped working.Very frustrating, as makes unit basically useless after only six months of use.It did not fail during the warranty period, so now I have paid more than my electricity savings.Seems to be a problem of poor manufacturing.

That really is unsatisfactory.I would be more responsible of Watson if he can go to a good teacher to train up his voice instead of trying to earn more money but turning out more albums when his singing is deteriorating at such an alarming rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful singing by a singer without any style","review":"Just like some others have said, this is certainly one of the worst vocal album that I've ever heard.The singing is pretty awful in a lot of places, and the singer Russell Watson doesn't seem to know the different stylistic demands of the different pieces in his program.The result is a caricature of operatic singing, and is therefore the worst possible starting place for anything who wishes to sample classical singing.I really wish to award this album a zero if that's possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny singing","review":"I laughed out loud several times when I was listening to this recording, for the singing of Russell Watson is so bad that it almost amount to a vocal joke!As a serious recording, it can, of course, earn little mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"best\\" album","review":"Reprise is probably at or near the top of anyone's list of Watson albums. On this album more than any others, we find a perfect set list, performed by Watson at his vocal best. The album has no weak moments.From the opener, Torna a Surriento\\" through the end, tempos vary, but all songs belong right where they are. While critics and Watson fans love to critique albums and performances endlessly, this one remains something of a Sistine Chapel.Absolutely brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible experience","review":"To any Russell fan, this album needs no explanation. To anyone who hasn't heard it, you're missing out on an incredible experience. Watson's voice is unbelievable.I discovered his voice many months ago seeing a British all-star cast broadway type show and Watson came out an stole the show with his rendition of a song from Phantom of the Operar. After that appearance, I've been buying every CD of his.I play with a rock-band part-time at night. Every night after the gig I would come home, put on the headphones, and revel in this CD's beauty. Like my dad used to say; they don't make 'em like this anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a tenor!","review":"This is not good singing, and in particular this is not classical singing.Shame on Decca for listing this autrocity in its catalogue among the world's greatest. A third-rate opera company would not even consider producing an opera with a \\"voice\\" like that. It's untrained and ugly. He does not even get the lyrics right most of the time. But this fellow does have a good manager. Better than anyone I've ever known of. He or she ought to be listed on the cover which boasts a smug Watson enjoying a lifestyle you've paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"No appeal at all","review":"I find this recording of be of no appeal whatsoever. The performances are boring to the extreme. The singing is so unsubtle that it's like having a person screaming at you for a full hour. What a painful hour of listening this is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuccessful cross-over","review":"I don't think this is a successful attempt at cross-over. The reason being that Russell Watson does not have the technique, charm and charisma to make the music appeal to a wider section of the public. He has a face, yes. But other than that, he has practically nothing to offer. And when one is merely listening to a cd, this is clearly not sufficient. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only a great album but a fun album","review":"On his third album, Russell Watson holds nothing back. Russell's tenor and baritone voice soars more aggressively than ever, and the orchestra's roars along with him. Russell puts the definitive stamp on such perennial favorites as \\"The Pearl Fisher's Duet\\", \\"Granada\\", Core \`ngrato\\" and \\"La danza.\\". He does wonders with \\"The Living Years\\", \\"That's Amore\\" and \\"Nothing Sacred\\".Like the rest of the album, he is brilliant and sings on high octane. Russell had recorded \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" on his Encore album and, again, on this CD, he kicks into high gear and rocks like crazy.All in all, this is not only a great album, it's a fun album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson's best classical album","review":"It was typical of Russell Watson that when he had to do his third CD instead of adding more pop songs to make it more palatable for the average music lover, he concentrated on Neopolitan classics and produced this unjustly-overlooked gem in the US.With beautiful arrangements, this is a wonderful collection of classical songs and a few pop-rock songs. Among Watson's very best classical albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever. Period.","review":"The consensus (which happens to be true) is that Watson is one of the best singers to appear on the scene in long while.Everything comes together perfectly. Watson is at his vocal peak, in simpatico settings, interpreting some of the best songs and a brimful of confidence and spontaneity. There's just the right mixture of tenderness and power, listen to the rendition of \\"Core \`ngrato\\", which counts as one of the best Watson classical performances.The pop tracks, \\"Nothing Sacred\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"The Living Years\\", and \\"That's Amore\\" are top-drawer, both as songs and performances, that it's mind-boggling. Russell sings with the ease of a man strolling down the street, yet his style, manner and diction are anything but pedestrian.His genius is matched by Hayward etc. brilliant arrangements. This is simply one of the best albums ever. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant","review":"This is the first I ever heard of Watson and I have been fixated ever since. My collection now consists of all of his Cds, all excellent. Given my experience, I'd say this is the best introduction to Watson you can get.On this album, you see all of Watson: the classical, his forte, pop and rock. You also see great musical arrangements, showcasing Watson's many voices. The classical tracks are highlighted by his beautiful rendition of Core \`ngrato\\". You get a gist of his tremendous versatility in a lovely duet with Cleopatra on \\"The Best That Love Can Be\\". He is absolutely brilliant in the haunting \\"The Living Years\\". The most interesting arrangements on the album has to be Watson's rock version of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".In summary, make this your FIRST WATSON PURCHASE. Forget all those other cross-over singers that lack the cohesion and overall strength of this conceptual masterpiece. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of his Cd's","review":"This CD offers any Watson afficionado, either just beginning or ripened, the best of his works so far. I enjoyed hearing all of my favorites, however I now have some new favorites.There are some numbers which I have heard for the first time and they are refreshing. I have all of Mr. Watson's Cds, and this one gets the most airplay, challenged only by his \\"Nothing Sacred\\" single CD for Kristy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper","review":"You really cannot improve on this album, \\"Reprise\\". Russell is relaxed and smooth singing these great songs. This is one of the keepers. You can't go wrong with any of his selections on this CD. This cd is proof why Russell is such a popular singer. Jeez, just buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Watson's best","review":"Don't let anyone tell you different, this is Watson's very best CD. From the word \\"go\\" we are under Russell's magical spell. How often can you truly say that you love the whole cd? If you don't like this ,then maybe you shold consider checking your pulse because your probably dead!With tracks such as \\"That's Amore\\", \\"Nothing Sacred\\", The Pearl Fishers' Duet\\", \\"La danza\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"Santa Lucia\\", and a duet with Cleopatra \\"The Best That Love Can Be\\", you can't go wrong.If you are starting a collection of Russell and don't want critic's telling you what's what, then start here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singer without a voice","review":"Russell Watson no doubt has good looks. Unfortunately, looks are irrelevant to a singer, especially in audio recordings.Watson evidently lacks a \\"voice\\" here. By this, I mean that his voice is in a very poor shape - narrow range, insecure intonation, raspy high notes, lack of flexibility etc. etc.His singing fails to satisfy on recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A voiceless singing","review":"I'm afraid Russell Watson's singing has gone from bad to worse with the release of this new album. He is so close to cracking (even when recording in the studio!) that the listener is constantly afraid that he will encounter some vocal mishap. Needless to say, one simply can't enjoy the singing. One only hears a voiceless singing struggling with the notes. It is not a musical performance at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rival to Bocelli and Frangoulis","review":"Listen to this album, and then follow it up with the releases of Bocelli and Frangoulis, one will immediately realise how bad Russell Watson's singing is when compared with those real artists. I don't think there's any area which Watson does better than those 2. Needless to say, with things so much better in the market, one needn't buy any album with such inferior quality as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"The previous 2 albums of Russell Watson are already uninspiring creations. This, unfortunately, is even worse, for both the singing and the interpretation register a further decline. I can find nothing good to say about this new recording, and I can only urge people, and especially those who enjoy good singing, to avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson can't hold a candle to Safina","review":"I must say that Russell Watson is no match for Alessandro Safina in classical cross-over. Where Safina has a strong voice and a solid technique, Watson can only sing with a whimper. I've friends who were previously fans of Watson but have immediately stopped listening to him after hearing the wonderful performances of Safina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safina and Frangoulis are much better","review":"As the title to my review suggests, Russell Watson's performances can't be compared with those by Safina and Frangoulis, who are real tenors with great voices, true artistry and great charisma. By contrast, Watson's performances are very much below par."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst album that I've ever listened to","review":"I borrowed this album from a friend, who said that she wouldn't bother to listen to it again. After playing it through, I immediately understand why she's so disappointed.To put it simply, Russell Watson just can't sing! He has a poor voice (or was in a poor voice when recording this album) and he completely fails to grasp the different style required by the different pieces. Such an appalling standard of performance will surely put any people off.I'm afraid I have no intention to submit myself to Watson's singing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear-opening experience","review":"To me, this album is an ear-opening experience. The reason? I can't imagine any singer who sings as badly as Russell Watson can receive so much inflated praise. That's the power of modern hype.No, this album won't do, coz the singing is really bad. If you have money to spare, do give it a try. You'll just laugh your head off after listening to such ludicrous singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalled by the standard of singing","review":"This album isn't cheap, and I therefore have high expectations on it. Yet, I'm severely disappointed by what I heard here. The singing is simply atrocious, one of the worst that I've ever heard on recordings. I'm angry at all those hyperboles surrounding such a voicless and talentless singer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the previous two","review":"This latest album by Russell Watson is definitely worse than the singer's previous 2 releases. If Watson's first recording, \\"The Voice\\", can earn 3 stars, and that his 2nd album, \\"Encore\\", can take home 2, this is most certainly a one star recording.It is very disappointing that, not only has there no improvement in Watson's singing, he seems to be going from bad to worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cd that I've listened to","review":"This is definitely, and by far, the worst cd that I've listened to. The choice of music is unimaginative and the singing is simply gross! I would in particular complain about the abysmal qualities in Russell Watson's singing, or perhaps yelling. His performances in all the tracks are quite appalling. There're no redeeming features that I can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgraceful recording","review":"How can Russell Watson call himself a classical singer when he simply doesn't have the voice and technique to be such?How can Russell Watson can himself a tenor when he doesn't have the vocal range for that voice type?How can Russell Watson call himself the \\"people's tenor\\" when he sings so badly? Does he think that ordinary people who have little knowledge of classical music deserves to be treated with performances which are of inferior quality?All I can see and hear is a very hypocritical attitudes towards music and performing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A vocal wreck","review":"This album is unacceptable, as the singing is very bad indeed. Russell Watson is little more than a vocal wreck here, and his singing gives no pleasure at all. He dodges almost all the vocal challenges presented by the music, and he is also unable to make the music alive.As a result, it's a most boring album which makes painful listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"The failure of Russell Watson","review":"The chief failure of Russell Watson is that his singing is uncommunicative. He seems to think that good singing must be loud. As a result, his performances are insensitive to the extreme. There's no subtlety in his renditions of the music, some of which are poorly arranged.A shame of an album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory recording","review":"This recording is unsatisfactory in many ways. The singing is of poor quality and there're far too much engineering involved for bolstering the voice. As a result, the sound is unnatural. The orchestral playing is also ordinary and uninspired.A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson's great","review":"I tried to think of a one line summary, but I fear that is impossible.Watson's great interpretion of the classical arias in this highly successful album reach masterwork levels with this album. \\"Core \`ngrato\\" may be beautiful, but with the second listening, the Watson depth of lyric and meaning emerges as an eclipse of the meaning of love.This album is a must for the true appreciation of Watson's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I own 850 cd's, this is one of the best","review":"I own over 850 CDs in all kinds of genres. Many of them are considered \\"great\\" albums. Although I haven't heard every CD in the world, I'm inclined to think this is the most beautiful album ever made.I could analyze why I like this record so much, but I don't want to -- Like a water to a sponge, I'd rather it just soak into me and fill me up with each listen.If you're looking for a recommendation I'm giving it and I am not overstating anything. You'll just have to hear it for yourself to understand why, you just might, once in a while, get results that rise to the level of this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD!","review":"I fell in love with this album the first time I heard it, and have played it until I think I might be wearing it out and will have to purchase another one.Listen to his fabulous voice singing the Neopolitan classicas and then his amazing pop voices on \\"That's Amore\\", \\"Nothing Sacred\\", \\"The Living Years\\" and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". He is sensational in \\"The Best That Lvoe Can Be\\" with Cleopatra. His \\"Core \`ngrato\\" is one that you will die for.I love this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Extraordinary Performance","review":"I remember when I first read a short review of Russell Watson's first CD, \\"The Voice\\", and was intrigued enough to listen to a couple of snippets from it. I have never been so blown away by a first hearing of any artist and I remain entranced. This album is probably his best although it is hard to pick one over the others. Watson's voice here is stronger than ever, his choice of selections is perfect and once again I find myself listening to them constantly. The Pearl Fishers duet is a tour de force and reason enough alone to buy this CD. Add to that beautiful renditions of pop (The Living Years, Is Nothing Sacred), classical (Ave Maria, Recondita Armonia, La Danza),and in-between (Granada, Santa Lucia, That's Amore0 and you have a truly remarkable musical experience. Buy this record--you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Watson could have stopped recording with Encore, but fortunately, he didn't. This album, Reprise, is perfect. There is nothing that I would change about it. It is also amazing how he can mix classical and pop on the same cd and make it so seamless.I must I admit that I play some of his swinging pop tunes more frequently since they're easier to listen to, but it's his classical voice that really achieves its goals most completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Russell Watson, Fresh and Unique","review":"I have read some of the NEGATIVE reviews written here and have decided that quite a few of them must have been written by the same reviewer (same wording and same repetitious phrases and terminology). You've made your point but if you will read the rest of the reviews, you'll find that you are CERTAINLY in the minority, so enough ALREADY! I found the musical arrangements wonderful and Russell's renditions of Core'ngrato, Recondita armonia and Vesti la giubba....perfection!! I do, however, agree that it's time for him to rest his voice before he does his 4th CD. 3 CD's in such a short amount of time plus all the promotional trips and personal performances certainly must play havoc on an entertainer's voice. I consider him to be a rare performer with a beautiful, powerful voice that is always \\"on key\\", such feeling he projects and such a nice demeanor with his audiance. Wishing you much success in the future. A REAL FAN!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational piece of work","review":"This album has a purpose and that is Watson concentrating on classical Neopolitan songs. He again has added his hit single \\"Nothing Sacred\\", which was on his Encore CD.This album came after a year with no Watson on CD and again is a runaway smash hit in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Every one of my friends who are into classical music have this CD and have worn out their copies. It's a sensational piece of work start to finish and strangely overlooked in the USA. He is in superb voice both in the classical and pop genres and is intent on giving Decca the best he has to give.This CD tells a lot about the measure of the man who, whatever you've read, is really a highly moral and dedicated individual with the highest standards and immeasurable talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard production","review":"Something must have gone very wrong during the production of this album. The music chosen for the recording is bland. Some of the pieces are very much beyond the ability of the singer. The recording is far too resonant to make comfortable listening at home.Most damaging of all is the poor quality of the singing. Russell Watson's dimunitive voice and haphazard technique cannot do justice to the music. HIs charmless performing style is also a major liability.There many other cross-over singers out there who can outdo Watson even when they're half-asleep. This album therefore does not provide value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can only speak to one track","review":"I have an odd hobby: I collect recorded versions of \\"Au Fond Du Temple Saint\\" the duet from \\"The Pearl Fishers\\" by Bizet. My only comment is that while Mr. Watson may have a passable voice, his rendition of \\"Au Fond Du Temple Saint is abominable. Not only has he egotistically attempted to sing both parts of a Tenor/Baritone duet, he has used an arrangement that destroys the beauty of the song. On top of all of that, the final climactic line in which the two friends pledge to be such even to death has been altered, for God knows what reason to mean something else alltogether. If you are a fan of Mr. Watson, you no doubt will like this CD. If, on the other hand you are a fan of the music that he sings, you may have a different opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After reading all those praises of Russell Watason, I'm disappointed to say that his singing does not live up to expectations. His voice is of ordinary quality and it is clear that he does not have a great technique. His performances are also charmless. Certainly not as good as some people say."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"Russell Watson is a charmless singer. He also doesn't have much technique. And all these defects shows in this ill-considered venture.Maybe Watson can win some fans by virtue of his looks or the marketing strategy of Decca. Unfortunately, if one assess the album purely in terms of music, it falls far short of expectations. In fact, the performances here can't even be said to be musically decent. It also appears that Watson's voice has deteroirated in qualtiy when compared to his already uninspiring work in his previous 2 albums.Definitely one of the worst vocal releases to have come out in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of the price","review":"This album doesn't worth its retail price at all, because the quality of the singing is very bad.As some other people have suggested, Russell watson cannot even hold a note properly. There is no room left for interpretation.Terrible singing, terrible performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical rubbish","review":"This is music at its worst, the equivalent of musical rubbish! None of the track is even competently sung. Most of the performances are so bad that they amount to sheer noise pollution. I won't recommend it to anybody with a sane mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A vocal wreck","review":"I can only use 3 words to describe this album - a vocal wreck. The singing is abominable. Can't be recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cd I've ever heard","review":"To be honest, this cd is a complete waste of money. The singing of Russell Watson is so bad and boring that I don't care listening to it again, whatever the occasion. I think it is irresponsible of Decca to release such a substandard recording at such a high retail price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible CD","review":"I am so disappointed by this CD!The singing here is so unvaried and boring! I don't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the first 2 albums","review":"This, the 3rd album of Russell Watson, is much worse than the 2 predecessors, which are themselves not of a very high standard. The choice of music here is uninteresting and the singing is lustreless. A most boring album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous CD","review":"This is a fabulous CD. No doubt his best recording yet as he improves his classical voice by leaps and bounds and his pop voice continues to amaze me. His \\"That's Amore\\" is another, new and wonderful voice that I've never heard before from him. If you love Watson and you want to keep alive the memory of the worlds greatest opera arias and great pop tunes, then you gotta by this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally discovered Watson","review":"I did not know anything about Russell Watson until my husband gave me this CD for Christmas. I did not listen to it until a couple of weeks ago. I love every song on this CD and I wonder why he has not toured the USA. I am now purchasing his first CDs and I agree with the other reviews that he does have an amazing voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget your problems, just listen to Watson!","review":"Here's an album that will make you \\"want to get away from it all.\\" Well, all except the music. From the very first track, \\"Torna a Surriento\\" you will feel that these are songs in which the whole world connects with Watson and what is remarkable, however, is that Russell makes it sincere, and he'll leave you asking for more.You get plenty of it, with the likes of \\"Granada\\", \\"Ave Maria\\", \\"Nothing Sacred\\", \\"La danza\\", \\"The Living Years', and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". I end my list there because I'm not going to just rename all of the songs on the album; they're all great.The only thing to keep in mind is that the whether its classical songs or pop music, Russell accomplish what he set outs to, and that is to take the listener around the world and to forget about our problems with our daily lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Album Continues the Pleasure","review":"This third album of Russell Watson's unique blend of classical/operatic and popular selections is another winner. The powerful and beautiful voice is even more so here and sounds a bit more mature as well. The selections are interesting and I enjoyed all of them although \\"Granada\\" and The Pearlfishers' Duet are particular standouts (the latter is really stunning, with Watson singing both parts beautifully.)In addition, \\"La Danza\\" is a tour de force and \\"Ave Maria\\", \\"Santa Lucia\\", \\"Torna a Surriento\\", and \\"Core n'grato\\" are especially beautiful, as is \\"Nothing Sacred\\" in the popular area. Heartily recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is really bad!","review":"Such a kind of bad singing that is heard on this recording doesn't deserve to be heard by any civilised being. In this recording, Russell Watson belts, screams and croaks his way through the music. His unfeeling way of singing and his totally uncommunicative style is also off-putting. What a terrible recording this is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst of Watson","review":"This album is really the worst of the 3 produced by Russell Watson. The voice itself sounds uncomfortably strident almost all the time, and Watson can't cope with quite a number of musical phrases. In many instances, Watson's singing is virtually a travesty of the music. Such poorly sung performances just won't do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody does it worse than Watson","review":"Having listened to most cross-overs releases of the past 10 years, I can say that this, the 3rd album by Russell Watson, is by far the worst of the batch.Here we can see how a singer with little voice, no technique and hardly any sense of style ruin all the music that he sings. The performances are technically defective and interpretative-wise appalling. I don't think there's actually any redeeming features in this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labored and joyless singing","review":"It is difficult to find another vocal album that is worse-sung than this one.The singing of Russell Watson is so labored and strident that I actually doesn't even feel comfortable listening to this album. In the lighter numbers, the performances by Watson lack any sense of joy. In fact, it almost amount to noise pollution all through!Russell Watson has been the subject of over-hyping. When one listens to his recordings without reference to all those exaggerated promotional slogans, one would immediately realise that his kind of voice and manner of singing are not even worthy for being recorded for posterity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far less good that some others","review":"I found the singing here to be far less good that that of some other singers. Like Groban, who sings with a heart. Like Bocelli, who has a better voice and technique. Like Safina, who has more charima and power. Like Frangoulis, who is more stylish and more handsome.Russell Watson just cannot compare with those others that I've mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few does worse that Watson","review":"Having listened to all sorts of vocal recordings, including a great many crossover ones, I must say that few do things worse than Russell Watson.The performances his are absolutely unacceptable: technically substandard, stylistically incorrect, musically careless, there aren't really materials that ought to be issued by any record company.One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad singing by a wretched voice","review":"I'm afraid the singing of Russell Watson has gone from bad to worse. While he shows some promise in his first album, both his voice and the stadnard of singing declined considerably in his 2nd album.This 3rd album has reached an all time low. Russell Watson cannot even sustain a note properly and, again, he has to cheat musically here and there.A disgraceful 2nd encore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I found this album to be very disappointing. After hearing all those hype about the singer featured here, I'd expect great singing. Unfortunately, the singer here is even less than decent. I can't understand why such an album can be released by such a respectable record company as Decca. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing singing","review":"The singing on this cd is very embarrassing. There're just too many defects here!I wonder how a record company can release such a substandand product in the market and ask for a full price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't imagine a worse performed recording","review":"This album is really bad. Russell Watson's voice has deteriorated since the release of his first album, The Voice. Here, that much touted voice is almost a sort of caricature of its former self. But of course, Watson isn't a real classical singer and his attempting songs that his beyond his very modest abilities have wreacked havoc to his voice, which sounds thread-bare and worn-out in this recording.I found nothing enjoyable here. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing seems to be right here","review":"Nothing seems to be right as regards the singing in this album. The notes are wrong, the style is inappropriate and the interpretation isn't true either.The performances here are just gross caricatures of the music. Just listen to other singers perform them, and you'll realise at once what sorts of things Russell Watson is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD will not disappoint anyone!","review":"I have to give this cd five stars. It is such a nice CD to listen to, especially on a quiet evening at home. My favourite songs from the album are \\"That's Amore\\" and \\"The Living Years\\". I think \\"Core \`ngrato is the best song from Russell.It was a surprise to me that i liked this cd so much, because I'm not really into Classical music, and I've always been a fan of the semiclassical singers such as Groban, Church, Brightman, etc.This cd can't be a disappointment to anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I thought this would be sick, but it isn't, it just some dude whining about some chick GET OVER IT SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU AND WE DON'T REALLY CARE!!!!!!! This is half hearted \\"emoetal\\" album that is... so lame. It isn't even that heavy, man all I heard is just crying over a chick, turn it off turn it off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"F*cking christian rock","review":"another 11.99 down the tubes. musically the cd is cool, good guitar, good bass, good drums. but then i read the linear notes and found out these guys were screaming about how much they loved god. great, so you love god, thats not a good reason to be screaming about it. give me a break, and really if god's so great then how come you have to scream about a world that he/she created...think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"belhhhhhf","review":"Yeah, another generic metalcore band with the same old chugga chugga breakdowns. Not that i don't like those, but it just gets boring when AILD does it. Instrumentation? Not bad at all, but the vocals have to go. the best song in my opinion is \\"Distance is Darkness\\" It has more of a grind thing going on, as opposed to generic metalore sound. If AILD sounded like that in most songs, they'd be a lot more interesting. If you are a generic nu-metal or metal kid, listen to this band, they are more suitable for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"AILD rocks","review":"These guys just flat out bring it! I saw them this year at Rockstar Mayhem Festival and bought this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not to good...","review":"i was very dissapointed with this album. alot of the songs arn't really that good and theres only three okay ones. what a let down, not there best by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never knew Christians could kick so much A$$!","review":"This is one brutal cd. Not many clean vocals through the CD, most of it is all screaming. 94 Hours has to be my favorite song, followed by Forever. But the songs do get repetitive after a while. Has some replay value, though the listener may get bored after a while. All in all this is a great band and in the boundaries of Christian music it's one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must listen to","review":"I was looking for a good, heavy metal band that 1) didn't cuss (cussing in music sucks in my opinion) and 2) rock. My one friend who is a Heavy Metal guru introduced these guys to me and after listening to several tracks, I knew I had to buy this c.d.It freakin owns. I aboslutely love the vocals, guitars, bass, and drums. Plus thier lyrics are awesome. They convey a message that is absent in alot of mainstream bands. I may be a Christian but I dislike bands that all they say how great God is but they don't do that and I love it. They talk about other matters and subjects though still loving God.In my opinion, this is a great album and band. Can't wai tto see them at Cornerstone Festival this next summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"fromthesky","review":"this is 'melodic metal' at its greatest, some of these reviews made the band out to be heavy metal 'every song sounds the same' type of deal. they are so far off its not even funny, if you have even the slightest musical knowledge, you can clearly hear distinct differences between songs. the cd is absolutly amazing, its up there with bands like the bled and atreyu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"I first heard As I Lay Dying about a year ago with their first album (at least I think its their first album), \\"Beneath the Encasing of Ashes\\", and I must say I was not impressed. Then about 10 months ago I heard kids fussing over their latest cd \\"Frail Words Collapse\\" like it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, and I thought to myself \\"Whats the big deal?\\". Well I finally came to realize what all the hype was when I purchased this cd in October. \\"Frail Words Collapse\\" is quite possibly the best cd I purchased in the year of 2003. This band has greatly improved since \\"Beneath the Encasing of Ashes\\". The drumming is the best I have heard EVER, and the guitar riffs are a lot better too. BTW, for all those doubters that think the double bass on \\"94 Hours\\" is fake, ITS NOT! I saw Jordan Mancino do it with my own eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible improvement","review":"I will be honest, if I had heard of \\"As I lay Dying\\" when they only had their first album, I wouldn't like them at all. I don't want to say that they toned down from the first album, but from what I've heard of it, this one is clearer, the vocals are better, the breakdowns are awesome, and the cover art and cd itself are cool looking. Everything falls into place nicely on this album. The tracks are spaced out very well. When you say to yourself, \\"gee, it would be cool if the next track is slow heavy or an acoustic interlude,\\" that is what happened. Tracks 6 and 10 are like this. The best song on here is 94 Hours, but the rest are great also. You won't be let down by these guys. I am going to see them on May 27."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truely Amazing Ear Shredder","review":"First of all, I don't recommend this album to anyone that is just walking into the world of hard rock. This album takes a while to get a good taste for. First time listeners from Rap or other genres skip through the songs and always remark on how monotoned the cd is. When I first heard this cd it truely blew me away. The vocals are abolutely loud, harsh, and agressive. (Probably the best scream next to Howard Jones from KillSwitchEngage). You would think the music would be violent, but what makes it even better is the incredible lyrics behind the harsh voice, which reveal the true emotional nature of the album. The band is also on point. The drums boggle the mind with the double bass peddle that sounds like a machine gun and the guitar is fast and incredible. This is a must buy for metalcore listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Best CD","review":"This is the best cd ever.

Fast, and hard drumming ( one of my favorite drummers ), great vocals, and amazing guitars. I highly recommend this album to anyone in love with metal. My favoriet tracks are \\"Elegy\\", \\"Forever\\", \\"94 Hours\\", and \\"Song 10\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure raw brutality","review":"This album along with shadows are security is one of the best.As i lay dying is a great band the drumming is so freaking amazing some of the best ever,and tim's vocals are pure raw power throaty screaming stuff.If you like them you will love this every damn song is perfect and keeps me headbanging all the time.Stop with the metalcore hate many bands are awesome while others are just \\"hardcore\\" and not metal at all so admit it's one of the heaviest stuff out there.So get this album it's loud,heavy,fast,brutal,and amazing it has melodic death metal too so enjoy this great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive material","review":"Frail Words Collapse is a tribute to what metal is all about. Thrashing guitars and relentless vocals make this release near flawless. This is a much stronger release than Shadows Are Security. Tim's vocals sound much more defined and meaningful in this album. My only gripe is the lack of vocal range that is on display here. Grinding vocals on the same key the whole time can get somewhat annoying. But the backing vocals are well done and are a welcome change. Better than Shadows Are Security but doesn't show As I Lay Dying's full potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"I THOUGHT I GOT HIT BY A TRUCK!!","review":"Frail Words Collapse slaps you in the face from the first track through the whole album.

Sadly little of that holds up to much attention with choppy rythym shifts ans shapeless tunes. The album clocks in at under 38 minutes so theres little time for song structure development (most of them are over before they catch fire). Sadly while As i Lay Dying show distinguishing elements they lack solely in structure and shape.

Metalcore and Emo are on the opposite ends of the spectrum, why mix 'em? I love older AILD, but will never buy this album. Secondly, here's \\"slayer dude\\" criticizing the lyrics, religion, and everything else about AILD when he listens to Deicide and Acacia Stain....hmmmm. Deicide coudn't make an album without heavy technical tweaking and they use the same riffs in nearly every song.(I would know, I use to listen to them in'90-91 and it got old a loooong time ago) Dont get me started on the songwriting.

Faulkner is a real pompous art-for-the-sake-of-art author. The stream of conciousness style of writing is INTERESTING but doesn't make for much of an enjoyable reading. 'Sutree' by Cormac McCarthy has a similar prose that he uses in certain passages for strictly the sake of describing the environment that the characters find themselves in. Cormac makes his story so tangible and the surroundings are tragic in a beautiful sort of way. Back to Faulkner, you have to give him credit for his lack of punctuation and his consistant change of subject from line to line. Congrats to Faulkner for what I imagine is another confusing bit of pretentious art literature.

Anything beyond what the Bible states about rewards is a moot issue. We know that God rewards us in heaven for our good works on Earth. However, we do work for Christ because it is a privilege to do so (Matthew 20:1-16); it is an honor to be a part of His plan and see it come to fruition. The Bible never says that we pick up our crowns after we have placed them at His feet. The few passages given to support the author's premise offer little information on this topic and not enough to write a book or give a definitive conclusion. He has a habit of drawing conclusions where conclusions are not given. Focus on working for the master and not on the rewards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Driven by Eternity","review":"Awesome, life changing!Driven by Eternity: Making Your Life Count Today & Forever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This book is,of course, just like all of the John Bevere books- hitting the spiritual nail right on the head.

Before reading, hang up your pre-conceived ideas, your denominational teachings and the teachings of the world and read with an open mind with your bible at hand for reference. While reading, discern what God is telling you rather than theological think tanks that have their own denominational adgenda.

The overture transitions to a magical moment as Karen sings \\"Christmas Waltz\\", milking each note as if it were gold.Much of the original album is missing here, not that the songs added are bad, they're not.

It's been a family tradition ever since I can remember. We used to have it on record, and when they brought it out on CD, it was the first one we bought! I have come to associate this particular album with Christmas itself, that's how ingrained this music has become.The Carpenters have a unique and beautiful sound, sweet and soulful. Karen Carpenter has a gorgeous voice and it always moves me to hear it.This CD includes not only traditional Christmas carols but also a couple of songs written by the Carpenters themselves.

I never liked all of his selections, as this one starts with the over-long overture from the 2nd album, and omits some key songs with vocals by Karen.Richard and A&M; Records recently released the original 1978 album, along with the 2nd one from 1984 on the 2-CD \\"Christmas Collection\\" for the many fans who had been requesting it all along. This \\"special edition\\" CD should have been deleted years ago, but it shows up every year. A much better single-disc compilation with all of Karen's vocals could easily be created to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time I got it...","review":"I was but a child of eight when Karen left us. Now, decades later, I've yet to hear anyone whose voice can carry such joy or let you feel the pain that the music only can help push the feelings to you. Having grown up hearing these songs here and there (and not all of them, sadly) on the radio or in the stores around Christmas, it's time I actually go out and snag a copy of my own. Karen's untimely passing left everyone - young and old - with a feeling of emptiness that could only have been filled by the songs that she'd not yet sung, but she left behind the music she had recorded. Thank you, Karen, for sharing your gift with the world. Were you still with us, I've no doubt in my mind that you would still be singing new music that tugs at our souls and filling our hearts with feelings we didn't even know we had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another absolute must for your Christmas collection","review":"This is one of several Christmas albums which I can call \\"one of the best\\" without hesitation. Of course, Karen's tragic death affected us all, and this feeling of loss undoubtedly increases one's love for such an album as this.But her voice and the loving arrangements here make this an absolute for Christmas. One can't even really go over the songs and select the best, because each has its individual charm.I do especially enjoy the inclusion of Victor Herbert's \\"March Of The Toys\\", and the excerpts from \\"The Nutcracker\\", in addition to the basic standard Christmas selections.There's not much more to say other than if you don't have this in your collection, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It wouldn't be like Christmas without The Carpenters CD","review":"The original \\"Christmas Portrait\\" was one of my all time favorite Holiday albums.I remember the Christmas special The Carpenters had on TV when this record came out.I wish this show would be released on video,but untill that time comes,I can always play this great CD.I love how the songs run in to each other.My favorites,\\"Its Christmas Time,\\"and Richards,\\"Merry Christmas Darling,\\" is one of the greatest modern day Christmas records ever made.I remember three of my buddies singing this song while at work in the Steelmill.Karen has a voice like an Angle.You fill like she's just singing to you.\\"Little Altar Boy,\\" is sad,but beutifull.Its unreal,but Karen's been gone for almost 18 years,but The Carpenters music still brings joy to all of us every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then 5 star","review":"The best Christmas album EVER.

Being a part of the minority group of gay Christians, I was intrigued. The \\"target audience\\" for the book is for homosexuals and their loved ones, but it really could be read by anyone, and I think it should be. McNeill offers theology on living in fear, guilt, shame, anger, and living with pathological faith and the importance of maturing spiritually. I think any Christian can relate to any (if not all) of these topics, and not just struggling gay Christians. It's the kind of book that you may want to read with a pencil or pen in your hand so you can underline parts that are important to you. (That's what I did.)

Well BIG mistake, reading all these other reviews I see I was not the only one disappointed. Not even a year it would not play DVD's anymore. (And I only played maybe 20 dvd's in that year) Told me that playback feature is not available on that disc. EVERYONE OF THEM. Soon after that It started to eat my video tapes, recording them and playing them. Even after rewinding them it would come out chewed up. I will never buy a Magnavox again.

They then said my unit was indeed malfunctioning and I could obtain a replacement unit for [full price]. ...

Instead, I went back to the store and got them to give me a replacement unit.It's January 15 and guess what? Last night the DVD drive on the replacement failed just like the first one.For the record, I do not use the thing more than about three movies a week, so it's not like I'm demanding an industrial duty machine.I can not state it strongly enough: it is a piece of junk, I would never buy another and my former faith in the Magnavox brand is no more.

We spent 2 long sessions merely investigating the kidknapping in the second chapter.The remarkable thing is you can actually read this and be entertained- its that good. If you have one and have played it, for goodness sakes sell it- this is a treasure.The materials provided are excellent, and really add a depth to play that you will be hard pressed to replicate elsewhere.Grade: A+++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the inflated price","review":"Unless you're a rabid CoC collector who has to have this iconic campaign, don't get fooled into paying the ridiculous $100 asking price. It's an okay adventure to read, being a sort of sequel to the story its based on, but playing it is more trouble then its worth. Roughly the first seven chapters are just getting ready to leave to the arctic, getting threatening leaders, and a few attempts at sabotage that the PC's can't really prevent, and ultimately the writers of this adventure just tried way too hard to make the whole campaign as lethal as possible. If you're dead set on playing it go buy a PDF and, if you need something physical, print it out. You can even listen to the campaign on an audio game on the RPGMP3 podcast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"These pins are nice, very easy to grab, I do wish they were longer, but that was my mistake, overall a nice item"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced, but they are as described.","review":"I needed pins for some projects.

It is the most relaxing acoustic Christmas album I have ever enjoyed. It is very calming. I first purchased it over twenty years ago as a tape when my son was just a baby, and we used to fall asleep listening to it at nap time--and we even started listening to it all year around. I wore out the tape, and was so disappointed because I looked everywhere for it. I could not find it. Then, years later, I found the cd once again,here on Amazon, and even though I thought it a bit pricey at twenty-one dollars, I was so pleased that it was still available, I splurged and got the cd. It is uniquely beautiful in its clarity and simplicity with the piano, oboe, flute, and classical guitar. The arrangements are lovely and true to original form. It also makes a great Christmas present for friends who hear it at your house and say, \\"Who is that?

Think again. David Lubin demonstrates why Titanic can really be seen as an allegory--about race and class, humanity and technology, and much more--with amazing depth and sophistication. He's an academic but he writes like a journalist, and you'll be amazed at all the fascinating tidbits he comes up with. Plus the book is beautifully produced with dozens of photos from the film to illustrate (literally) the points he's making. Just a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood Liebestod","review":"Any movie as large (in every respect) as James Cameron's TITANIC, deserves to be understood, not only in the contemporary consumer context in which it was created, but also through the complex philosophical, cultural, and artistic history which served as its genesis. David Lubin's splendid, captivating, and handsomely packaged little book is a rare jewel for any reader interested in popular culture as subject for serious analysis. We come to understand Cameron's film, although cloaked in melodrama and crude dialogue, as a fully realized \\"synaesthesia,\\" striving (not entirely unsuccessfully) to consume and re-imagine everything that came before it. Lubin, without a hint of pedantry, goes a long way towards revealing the mysterious zeitgeist at the heart of a global blockbuster. This is a marvelous book, and it deserves to be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough","review":"These are tiny, easy to back-pack, and run on battery (4 AAA) or the plug (provided adapter), which are all pluses for this product.But do they sound OK?

The book is missing a lot of details, and if you have any knowledge the mistakes will jump out at you. For example, on page 44 it gives the OSI model (from 1-7) as Physical, Data Link, Transport, Network, Session, Presentation, Application. Then, it says make sure you know the correct order for the test. Why? The authors don't. On another question, the book says you should answer, \\"I don't know because you haven't taught me, yet.\\" Try answering a question on the CCDA exam, as I don't know it's beyond the scope of the test. Also, the editor must have just used the spell check and not actually read the book. There are a lot of errors like \\"form\\" for \\"from\\" and \\"wit\\" for \\"with.\\" You can figure out what they are trying to say, but it is annoying and makes you lose your focus on studying.

El eventually went on to own his own record company, Definitive Jux, while Bigg Jus was relatively unheard of until he released Gaffling Whips ep. With an LP soon to be released, on this album, Jus has displayed his authentic and witty, truly New York, lyricism prevalent on Company Flow's earleri releases (Funcrusher Plus). The sounds of this album shadow those of Company Flow in their gritty, hardcore, accentuation of traditional hip-hop blends, but also mixes that up with some un-traditional experimentations, similar in fact to the production present on any Def Jux release. Overall, the album reflects Jus's lyrical abilities and love of the underground"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are El-P and Mr. Len when you need them???","review":"Ok, here's the deal. Lyrically, this album is pretty nice and Bigg Jus proves that he is indeed talented. Yet, it is know lyrical masterpiece. That being said, this album is just about intolerable due to its production. While songs like \\"Gaffling Whips\\" are just plain boring musically, songs like \\"Tongue Sandwhich\\" are almost painful to listen to. While some call this creative, or abstract hip-hop, I call it [bad]. El-P found ways to make cacophonous sounds work together in harmonious beauty on his solo LP, why couldn't Jus do the same? Maybe its due to the fact that Jus is not a producer by nature. Who knows. All I know is that Jus's nasal flow sounds better over simpler soundscapes than the ones presented on this album. In closing, you should only pick this album up if you are A BIG FAN OF BIGG JUS! Otherwise, wait for his full length solo and leave this failed experiment in its place on the cd rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, 4.7 Stars","review":"Warren G still has that G-Funk passion in his second album. He puts more songs on this album, thank God!! He still has that fun, easy listening, rhythmic flow that makes him fun to listen to. His standout track, \\"Transformers,\\" has a faint, whistly keyboard synth, and a neat use of a talk-box, and a funky, bass-heavy beat. He refuses to become a gimmicky rapper, and for that I give him props. He sounds calm and collected in the nice chill-out track \\"Relax Ya Mind.\\" He does step up the hard-core factor a little since his first album. Songs like \\"What We Go Through\\" and \\"Reality\\" get into more of a gangsta mentality, but he does not overdo it. So, he offers something for gangsta rap fans, and fans of more laid back rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft rap - pure g-funk","review":"So... concidering Warren's first album this one is more soft, more comercialised.

Very good g-funk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible G-Funk era comeback!","review":"I'm surprised that Warren G survived THIS era! The lyrics on the album are bland and you would think that it was just another copycat album of \\"G-Funk Era\\" if you didn't know it was Warren G rapping on it! I gave it a 2 because 1)he's Warren G and does derserve some credit for trying to punch back and 2)because of couple of the songs were very decent, but most of the album was pitiful.The tracks that made the album worth listening to were \\"Annie Mae\\", \\"Smokin' Me Out\\", and \\"Relax Yo' Mind\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing sophomore effort","review":"This is the beginning of Warren G's slump of sub par albums. The highlights on this album are few and far between, with one hot track, \\"I Shot the Sherriff\\". Unless you absolutely need to hear more Warren G, I would steer clear of this. Warren's lyrics are pretty bland and meaningless, which was ok on Regulate...The G Funk Era because they were accompanied by tight beats, but here the beats don't make up for the poor lyrics. Warren's worst album."},{"rating":"1","title":"g-funk is nothing","review":"This cd issssssssss nothinggggg there are only 2 good songs that i like on this album maby the ppl over at weast side love this kind of music but east coast isint down with this g funk garbage warren g isint all that with his lyrics this cd isint worth buying trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Miss The G Funk Era","review":"G Child bring us his second best work to date. This album really brings so many nice memories from the past, when fun is all that really matters. Sonically this album is more polished than G Funk Era (Not necessarily a good thing) but this album is a classic too, anyway. If you want a great album for this summer '12, then get this inmediately. You won't regret, and bring back some nice memories from '97. G Funk is still alive in our ears and hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tha G-Funk Era Continues","review":"This CD is Regulate... The G-Funk Era Part 2. Nothing more nothing less. Not to say that's a bad thing. The original Regulate was and still is my favorite CD. Listeners to it will find themselves at home with the strangley familar beats here. In addition to that many of the lines are ripped strait from songs found on Regulate. This is nothing new to Warren G fans who may have noticed many lines in Regulate were ripped from Snoop Dogg's first album Doggystyle. To make things even more familar the song Annie Mae smells deeply of an attempt to conjur up fond memories of Regulate (the song itself). When all is said and done though even if most sequals don't live up to the promise of the original we all have to admit that we still enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Album","review":"This album is not as good as g funk era but it is worth buying.

And that was a while ago, so perhaps four stars seems a bit much. But this was my first foray into the espionage genre and I haven't slowed down. It was a look into a supremely exciting, albeit grim business. I doubled back afterwards to read le Carres earlier works, then on to all of Helen MacInness espionage books and through all of Clancys and so on. And whenever I find a le Carre book I haven't read, I correct that immediately. I don't think there are any. I give TTSS four stars because I remember it as the wonderful adventure that started me on this terrific road. I can't get it on my Kindle, so I'm re-reading it in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I was prompted to re-read the book after watching the latest movie adaptation. The movie was awful. Not only did it take handsful of liberties [the scene with Tony Esterhase being threatened with repatriation is one of the worst], but it just couldn't compete withe the BBC/Paramount Pictures multi-hour version.As I re-read, I could see why producers would be attracted to this book. The dialog and scene-setting are superb; the main character, George Smiley is a real human not a Bond-like fantasy; and the plot line is compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Finest Espionage Novel Ever?","review":"Many who are/were \\"in the business\\" have stated that it is. I know as a lay reader that it's the most fascinating spy story I've ever experienced, and the most superbly written.Note: for a supplemental treat, see the BBC 6-part television adaptation produced in the 1970's starring Alec Guinness and an extraordinary supporting cast. LeCarre considered this to be as perfect an adaptation of any of his works as he could imagine, and he dedicated the final book in his \\"Karla\\" trilogy to Guinness in tribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I watched tehe movie twice. I read the movie plot on wikipedia. I read the book. Now I understand this great but also complex piece of art. The book is a tough read as it is an investigation, with a lot of dialogues, not much action, many today and past back and forward, however the story is a complicated one and I donot know if there would be a simpler way to tell it. A must read for spy novel lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd forgotten just how goods this book is","review":"I first read this book back in the seventies and recently bought and read it again. I'd forgotten just how good it is.As a writer myself I can only sit there with my mouth open in complete awe. This book seems to break all modern rules.It is nearly all exposition with very little action in the present time. But it is done so elegantly, in an almost mesmirisingway. Many people have praised Mister Le Carré as the master of this genre, so I'll just stick to this book. Read it (even if like meyou read it all those years ago), you'll love the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOORRREING","review":"It may be blasphemous to criticize an author with the stature of LeCarre', but, I read for enjoyment and found precious little in this work. The usual grist for the spy writer's mill: car chases, fist fights and shootouts, are absent, leaving the reader with a cerebral and convoluted plot that becomes more tedious the farther you read. The story moves along with painful slowness as the Brits try to find a mole in their system through exhaustive attention to every detail of the investigation. This book is definitely not a page turner, and will not keep you up late at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"May I have a cast of characters, please?","review":"I've had this novel on my shelf for a while but - when I found out a new movie was coming out - I decided to read it. It's only the second LeCarré novel I've read. As far as the plot goes: George Smiley is recruited to identify a Russian agent (he coined the term \\"mole\\") working in British Intelligence.It's a good novel, and I correctly guessed the mole, but it is not an EASY read. Part of the problem with spy novels or mystery stories (this is both) is that there is SO MUCH plot and SO MANY characters, it is very easy to get lost. It would've been nice if - Agatha Christie style - the book had been published with a list of characters in order to keep everyone straight. Added to which, much of the story is told in flashback.This is not a beach read - it demands your full attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good.","review":"I tried reading this book shortly after college in 1994 & it didn't capture my attention then. I reread it this year & liked it much better. I did find myself drifting a bit during certain passages...Le Carre is somewhat long-winded at points. The book does contain some funny British humor. The story itself isn't all that exciting but it is a good mystery...we work along with Smiley to determine who the mole is. Smiley is an interesting character...in addition to his spy work we also go through the pain of his wife deserting him for another man. I'll try reading some other Le Carre stuff...this wasn't bad at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this book about...","review":"I have not a clue as to what this book is about.

Found out I could not download it (as with other Kindle books) because the publisher would allow only USB transmission. This was irritating before I even began to read the book. Usually purchase my Kindle books but this one was over-priced for an \\"old\\" book. Happy I did not spend the money as I agree with the 80% of book club participants who found the British jargon difficult to follow, the characters confusing and the cold war era spy concepts not relevant in today's society. Reading is relaxing for me; this book was torture and I will not finish it but return it so another reader may explore its idiosyncracies.

From internationally acclaaimed spy-turne -author John Le Carre comes Tinker, Taylor Spy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tinker Tailor","review":"The first in Le Carre's Smiley trilogy, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is not a spy novel. It is a novel that has spies in it. The prose is contemplative and subtle, the characters frightfully english a la Cambridge in the thirties. They are mostly older now, and what we see running throughout the book is disappointment. The heady years of world war II are over, the cold war is in full swing and we discover that more than one of the idols of that heroic time have feet decidedly made of clay. This is a bona fide work of literature - the themes are universal and touchingly revealed, the writing clever and contemplative and the verisimilitude of the world of Smiley and his shadowy confederates convincingly drawn. A delightful surprise for those who have been dismissing Le Carre through years of seeing him in airport bookshops."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have read.

What I find myself doing is reading a bit and then make up what I think is going on. It's kind of fun. I keep hoping something will be said that will acutally confirm what I think is happening.

The plot was pretty convoluted and I didn't remember having as much trouble keeping everyone straight.Still LeCarre does some things quite masterfully especially in developing his secondary characters and establishing some of the places like the school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"A very good espionage thriller. John Le Carre has was a way of building up his stories. They all start slow and tedious but build chapter by chapter into wonderful thrilling tales. This is one of his first books and is a little more detail oriented then his most recent stuff and often seems to suffer from detail overkill, but by the end of the book and we learn more and more about the story the earlier details have a way of making you feel for each character in very specific ways. The hero of the story George Smiley is just as flawed as the villan \\"Karla\\" is and I like this. So if you are into very honest detailed character leaning stories read this wonderful mole hunt espionage story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read!","review":"I found the book hard to read, did not like the writing style at all.

I see no point in seeing the movie either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just could not get through it","review":"Having heard this book mentioned, or read references to it, for many years, I was anxious to get a copy and read it. The style of writing, however, and slow pace of action (or would that be non-action) so put me off that I just could not force myself to read it all the way through.

The plot if very complex and keeps you engaged until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I had hoped for a more interesting and entertaining offering, but except for the relationship between Jim and the boy, didn't much care for any of the other characters.

For a genre book it is very literary in intent and in style. The proof of this for me was that I was not entirely satisfied with the book the first time I read it but was intrigued enough with the material to try it again a few years later. Knowing the basic plot, including the identity of the \\"mole\\" enabled me to really focus on and truly enjoy the themes of betrayal and British decline. Only a rare mystery/thriller would pass this test. On the purely technical level the book is also well done and the various steps employed by Smiley to solve the case are a great pleasure to follow.Read this book and Smiley's people.

You get glimpses of your town, fire & police. The legend behind the movie is interesting as well. The movie is good, the ending a little dragged out. It lost me at the end, because it was so fictional. However, the parts where the true story was unfolded was interesting and well done. I live in Princeton myself and the person before who stated that this should be pulled of the shelf needs to calm down. I've only lived here a short time and I've noticed two sides to Princeton. One side- \\"high-class\\" (as they stated), snobby, rich. Other Side- Friendly, earthy, farm owners, very in tough with nature. I guess it just depends on what part of Princeton you're living in. As for the movie, well done. Making a movie must be tough & it's no one's right to make such rude comments about someone's passion and their projects.

It is very boring and slow. The events that are suppose to be paranormal/creepy include such things as doors opening and winds picking up. I didn't care for the flashbacks in time that are suppose to join the two characters together. The effects were lack luster. I guess the only positive thing I can say is at least there was a ghost in it as opposed to the ghost being a figment of the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie!!!!!","review":"Personally I don't exactly enjoy horror movies but I saw this one.

I would definitely watch this movie again and tell my friends about this!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true story of Lucy Keyes or Princeton","review":"As a very long resident of Princeton and living very close to where the true Lucy Keyes home was I was offended by the movie. Nothing in the movie is what Princeton is about, the attitude of neighbors, the Lucy Keyes truth, the unfair view of what the people of the town are about. This movie should not be presented as Princeton or Lucy Keyes. This town is high class, warm and a friendly place to live. I recommend your pulling it off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and whiney...","review":"The Legend of Lucy Keyes, when I checked it out at the video store, looks promising. It even has a \\"Winner Audience Award Independent Film Festival of Boston\\".I though the entire movie sucked.(1) The kids were not acting, but whiney the whole time. It grated on my nerves like fingernails against a chalkboard. Constantly whiney whiney whiney.(2) The parents' acting was very bad, I thought. They too were whiney and got on my last nerve.(3) There was not much of a story in it. Other than irritating the daylights out of me, it was incredibly boring. Where was the suspese? AT WHAT POINT WAS IT SCAREY???? If this movie scares you, so would the cartoon Casper. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING IF THIS IS SCAREY. It's BAD.I thought it a kind of cheap water downed imitation of the movie Poltergeist, which was an awesome movie.I'm just giving you my honest opinion. It was boring, grating on my nerves, and not once ounce of scarey in it.

It is made from fairly heavy metal and the drive setup is fairly straightforward and easy to access. The case fan can be quite lout but it can be slowed down usually with motherboard software and is pretty quiet on level one. 1700 rpm.I only saw 1 degree of cpu temp difference between level 1 and 10 on the case fan with my atom 525 board.The power supply has lots of connectors including sata and the usual 4 pin.My only con to this case is that it isn't a little smaller. It can hold normal atx boards apparently, but I was hoping for a slightly more compact foot print.Also the feed for the vertical position are width adjustable and make it hard to slide it into tight spaces since they don't clamp to firmly to the sides of the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - perhaps due to translation from another language?","review":"I purchased this book after becoming intrigued with the plot presented on Amazon.com. While the plot did indeed capture me, several things bothered me throughout the book. Perhaps this is due to a poor job of translation, if the book was indeed translated into English from another language, but there are numerous instances of very odd sentence structure and incorrect use of words which kept me from enjoying it as much as might have otherwise. In addition, the conversation often seemed very stilted and did not flow well, again, maybe due to translation problems. I had difficulty finishing it and only did so because I rarely put down a book without finishing it and wanted to know how it ended. All in all, the book reminded me of a piece of music that is really not very good, and you keep listening to see if it might get better as it goes along, but it never does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This was a wonderful read.

Overall, this book was a pretty good book with an almost pathetic romance intertwined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing Help Needed","review":"The story is intriguing but the writing is weak. I suppose part of that can be blamed on the translation. However, the book needed a serious edit to trim the flab and make the text readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information clouds the plot","review":"While this could be an interesting and exciting book I found all of the historical information and quotes from Dante to be distracting and frustrating. It kept the plot in the background too much of the time. While some of the facts were interesting most of it overwhelmed the advancement of the story. The characters were also hard to relate to and believe in. I often found myself shaking my head over a character's actions or responses. Although the premise of the story is quite interesting the writing is not. I found this to be a very frustrating and disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic","review":"While the premise was quite fascinating, the actual book was boring and written in a style reminiscent of books written for teenagers. Characters were quite shallowly written; the end was just a little too wonderful; coonections made in the book didn't always make sense. The whole book was in dire need of tightening and editing. It is possibly a better book in its original language, but I have no way of verifying that."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential ruined by a lame ending","review":"I bought this book because I love historical novels. The beginning of the book was intriguing and it captured my attention. The discription of history and locations and beliefs was facinating. Then at about the middle of the story it began to get silly in spots. But still I was captivated. The challenges and physical tests the three main characters have to endure is punishing, but they continue to push forward. Then comes a total disconnet when Ottavia runs into a childhood \\"friend\\" who tells her the truth about her family. This exchange does nothing to further the story and seems completely out of place. Finally, the story climaxes with the final challenge and then paradise. As soon as the main characters hit paradise it's as if the author ran out of creativity and instead relied on gimicky, sappy nonsense. The ending takes the book from a 4 star to a 2 star. I would tell people to read the book, but stop after the last challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Cato","review":"Being swarmed with a bunch of religious thrillers...i was a little apprehensive about reading this, but iam glad to have picked up this book.

But I learned a great deal in reading and translating it, and I think it is quite ingenious and also devastating. An important book. I wanted to say that the book's English title is considerably more sedate and formal than the Swedish title. Readers like the ones expecting a traditional military history might have been misled by the publisher's decision to omit the Swedish title: \\"Bang! You're Dead!

But that's not true -- World War I was the dawn of the use of the kind of bombing with which he's concerned. And that involved three parties, the Germans, the British and the French. All of the bombing was white on white.There's so much other good data in the book, that it leaves one wondering where it would've gone if he had simply omitted his entire racism theme. But then again, without that, maybe he would have had no desire to even write the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Author","review":"I hoped to learn about bombing as a military/social tactic and instead felt I received a pacifist-distorted view. If he changed the title to 'All war is Bad' it would be more apropos to the content. Also they are guilty of evaluating historical behavior with a contemporary viewpoint instead of in context. For a citizen of a country that sat out WWII to accuse others of deliberately attacking the wrong targets in Germany is untenable.

The Japanese DID NOT surrender after the first Atomic bomb. The military arm of the government considered a coup NOT to surrender after the second bomb.

Japan's culture was steeped in the belief that surrender was a shameful act. The more you study Japan's culture and war tactics, the less likely you will believe this book.Japan was willing to fight to the bitter end, and the end wasn't in sight until the second bomb was dropped. After the first bomb was dropped, the Japanese Army heads were convinced that there were no more bombs available. After the second, they believed that the US had a stockpile of atomic bombs. I wonder what they would have done if they knew there were no more bombs ready? Would they have gone ahead and surrendered, or would they have kept fighting?I wish the author had researched the existing Japanese documents, and used them to write a balanced story.

It is a very heartwarming book. It shows to others that dreams can come true if you just hold on to your beliefs. The road to fame and fortune had been a very hard and long road for these really special people. They show over and over again that not compromising your values does pay off. The book is great for all. We read it with our kids and they liked it very much. Just as their show it is appropriate for all ages. Especially read it before you see their show and you will appreciate it all the more. Read the book and experience the magic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Magic","review":"For anyone who has ever been or still is fascinated by Siegfried and Roy this is the book to read. It's out of print so I think the only place you can get it is through Amazon. The book has lots of pictures and is writen as though Siegfried and Roy were speaking to you about their experiences. It traces their childhoods, how they met, and how they rose to stardom. It ends with the years at the Mirage and before Roy's accident in 2003. Hopefully there will be a second book--their memoirs. I highly recommended this book for Siegfried and Roy fans and fans to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIEGFRIED AND ROY: MASTERING THE IMPOSSIBLE","review":"WOW! WHAT A FASCINATING BOOK!

The 1/4\\" by 1/2\\" size fits most OLDER exterior doors. On the top and lock side of the door, mount the weatherstripping on the edge of the door stop, but on the hinge side, mount it on the face of the jamb just inside the door stop. If you mount it on the stop by the hinges, closing the door will pull it off. Been using this type for 50 years. Oh, Amazon shows this product as a HIGH density, but it (product #02071) actually IS the low density that that you want. If you have a newer door unit that has a weatherstripping that looks more like auto door weatherstripping, you have to pull off a section so you can find and replace it with similar product.

The main issue is that the angled sides leave very limited room for cooking pancakes, which is what we usually have when camping. It would have been better if it was made with a larger flat surface with a small lip around the edge. Also, the non-stick surface has not held up, even with careful use. It certainly needs to have a thicker coating of more durable material. Finally, this Coleman griddle doesn't fit on the Coleman 2-burner stove--go figure. I suppose it might be good for making a really big omelet, though that's not something I typically cook in the woods. Overall, I think it's a poor design and I'm sorry I didn't return it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Griddle too small","review":"This griddle is too small to fit over both burners and too big to fit over one.

You can get this identical product at Wal-Mart for $13.99, but it's not even worth that. It fits over both burners of a Coleman stove, but the griddle only heats directly over the burner. The griddle doesn't evenly heat. And most importantly, it is definitely NOT nonstick. The first time I used the griddle, I made pancakes, and from the first pancake, all stuck to the nonstick surface. Subsequently, it appears as though the surface was burned off by the heat of the burner (even though it was on low). Now, I have a useless griddle. I will pay more money for a heavier griddle next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Star Ramps Rule!","review":"I use these ramps to load a 3,500# mini-skid steer onto my dump / landscape trailer.

Information like telling me and other people about what every single move some of these people make such as brushing there teeth in the morning, and tying there shoes.This booke does not have enough dialouge in it and that makes it hard to figure out who? is who? in these stories.Almost Touchin The Skies is a pretty decent book because people can read about true stories of people who survived a lifestyle which might be like their's and the reader can see they will survive too. So all in all this book is kind of touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual fantasy","review":"What strikes me about this book is the author's faith in her religion and God. The story is fun and the langauge straightforward, but what I liked the most about Neveah and Natas were the themes of love, forgiveness and redemption. The characters are only human, they have flaws, and they falter. But they are all forgiven, or are given the chance of salvation. In addition, some of the characters achieve great things, but the author makes sure that credit for the feats all go to the old man upstairs, to demonstrate that we humans are merely instruments of God's will. It is humbling yet satisfying. The book is definitely what the title indicates it is, a spiritual fantasy.

One small tip they also work on some cases for 3.5in Media card readers, for the ones that have 5.25in bays, and 5.25in covers, with 3.5in punch outs in the centers."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},R={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-3fc66a9b"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/50.md","filePath":"glossary/50.md"}'),N={name:"glossary/50.md"},G=Object.assign(N,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
