This one was by far the best of the lot. Best photos. Best variety of items. Best organization.

Highly recommended to anyone interested in Hull pottery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book","review":"We bought this as a gift for my girlfriend's sister and she absolutely loved it.

Highly rated seller, 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior coating","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this filter. I initially thought that it was a high quality German filter. The craftsmanship of the filter is worst than any quality Japanese brands (hoya, Kenko, Nikon and etc.) which are 2x cheaper mostly. The finish of the metal bezel is rough, and the words looked like they were painted on and showed unevenness. Worst of all, this filter has the worst coating I've ever seen. Comparing the amount of refection between this one and my B+W and Sigma DG uv filters, this one looked like a mirror and reflected a LOT of light, which shows inferior coating. The price of this filter is highway robbery considering the low quality and performance it offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heliopan UV filter Review","review":"I have been looking for the best UV filter for my 20mm f1.7 lumix lens. When I have found this Heliopan expensive filter I thought it was a very good quality filter because it's high price and Germany made(also I have read Heliopan web).I was wrong. It produces LOTS OF FLARE with artifical and natural light. It doesn't have enough coating. My Marumi DHG Lens protector (13 USD) cheap filter work better than this Heliopan.

Like many fans that watch this video will realise just how much control or lack of control wrestlers have . Bret had so much respect for vince mcmahon that it was tragic to see how vince treated bret The video gives you a behind the scenes look and also some very special scenes of bret with his family. throughout the video you see the pain and heartache of a professional wrestler grow and not only do you hear the truth behind the rumours you also get to see how it affects Brets life afterwards with even more tragic turns that shakespear could have only dreamed this video is a true keepsake for anyone who wants to see the best technical wrestler that thanks to vince no one else will ever come close to the excellence of execution"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Excellence of Execution","review":"Needs to be realeased on DVD.But as far as the documentary itself you wont find a better behind the scenes story of the ins and outs of Pro Wrestling.Bret Hart is and always will be the \\"Best there is,the best there was, and the best there ever will be.\\" Vince Mcmahon lost more then fans after this doc hit the streets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who screwed who?","review":"Just one comment, as far as the comment 'Bret screwed Bret' goes, many people are connecting that with his move to WCW. It wasn't a move that helped him, even he says WCW had no direction but lest we forget, Bret was TOLD by Vince to get the contract from them, as he couldn't honour the contract he was offered by the WWE. See that, he was TOLD by the man to do so.It's pretty clear as to who was the bad guy and who screwed who and gues what?He's not Canadian."},{"rating":"2","title":"After this, Bret allows himself to be screwed again???!!","review":"This is the best movie ever made about wrestling. However, Bret Hart made his first apperarance in a WWF ring last night since the screw job, and he lets Vince kick him in the gut? Bret, I was gonna buy your book anyway, do you have to let the devil himself promote it? And humiliate you again in the ring?

Great reading for 4-8 age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dance of the Forests","review":"Although I was introduced to this book because of an english assignment, I became entranced by the book by the first 10 pages. And although it is confusing at times, and a teacher explaining the story as you go along is a signifigant help, the lyrical blend of Western experimentalism and African folk tradition is quite inebriating. If you are at all interested in African folk lore, this play is a must read for you. Wole Soyinka is one of the most respected play writers in all of Africa, and this is one of his best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe why scratch cooking got lost","review":"My mom cooked from scratch and passed away before most of her recipes were known. I couldn't wait to get this book to get more down home recipes. I wasn't thrilled with the presentation but the proof as they say is in the pudding. Note, that this is not a book for a novice. One recipe says to make the cookie any size and cook for 10-15 mins. In cooking, size does matter. Next recipe says cook chicken until done. Doesn't say how to test for doneness. It says use chili sauce with no recipe for making it. Isn't that why you bought the book for the \\"cook\\" to tell you times and full recipes. Although it's a lovely tribute to his mother and is a nice momento for his family, people shouldn't be fooled, BBQ sauce takes more than 15 mins to simmer. The food is good but there are other books where the food taste great. Needless to say I don't use it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking from Scratch","review":"I love this book! I've tried just about everything in that book. It's a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive. I wouldn't give this simple book to anyone. I learned nothing. The recipes aren't worth the effort","review":"This was a waste of my money and time. This is the worst item I have ever gotten on amazon. I am African American and my shock at the lack of respect for the consumer from this author is immense. The recipes were repetitive and extremely small in number. Shame on anyone who buys it . You have been warned!!!I must reply to the comment. I appreciate it-sincerely. Being African American has nothing to do with it. The cover pictures a beautiful kind looking African American lady. The appearance leads one to deduce she has great skill-which is not the question or concern. The book is one I personally would never buy again-period. I did not learn anything from it. It was overpriced, and the amount of recipes were ridiculously small in number and repetitive. I own over 100 cookbooks and spoke from my personal perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE LOST ART OF SCRATCH OF COOKING","review":"THIS BOOK WAS SO DISAPPOINTING. THE REVIEWS INDICATED A CHARMING WAY TO SEE HOW TO COOK IN A WONDERFUL OLD ART OF COOKING.

IN TODAYS MARKET FOR THE PRICE PAID, IT SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE DETAILS ON THE FAMILY TRADITIONS, PHOTOS AND SOME ZIP THAT MADE YOU EAGER TO COOK SOMETHING INCLUDED IN THE BOOK.I AM A COLLECTOR OF COOKBOOKS, PERHAPS NOW IN EXCESS OF 200+ AND WOULD RATE THIS BOOK AS A MINUS 1.

It is not worth the 17$ it cost(that includes the shipping)- I will be more careful in the future about depending on the book reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I must agree with the prior reviewer. I purchased this book expecting not only many more recipes than were provided, but I also found the recipes presented were not particularly helpful.This seems almost like an unfinished project rushed to print. In its totality it is closer to those 'theme' cookbooks you can find in tourist traps. It's certainly not worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there yet...","review":"As one who cannot resist any cookbook reminiscent of a nostalgic trip back to Grandma's kitchen - any Grandma - and any ethnicity, I had to get this book. While there are plenty of the old-fashioned recipes you would expect, the complete lack of pictures is disappointing.The layout and style is of the fund raising type you find at your local church group or club, which is fine, but I'm spoiled enough these days by newer technologies to want pictures of the finished recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scratch enough.","review":"The book is misleading as a lot of the stuff she uses to make her food I don't consider to be scratch.

For the amatuer wanting a well-designed guide to develop an understanding of how classical music works, this is by far the best. The steps are clear and logical, the exercises just what the learner needs, and the accompanying book of music examples a highly advisable purchase. You could do this on your own without a guide, given the fact that the materials have been tested in the classroom. The bibliography is also useful, if for nothing else than to show you why this vademecum is the most user-friendly and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Techniques and Materials of Music","review":"This book is so wonderful.

That is ridiculous, seeing as it's less than an inch thick. It's supposed to cover centuries of music theory, yet each principle is explained vaguely and with few examples. If you want to get a really good step-by-step on Western music theory, take a look at Clough and Conley's \\"Basic Harmonic Progressions,\\" which will give the reader a solid working knowledge of basic music theory (\\"basic\\" meaning the core of functional harmony). Unless you have a music class where this thin little book is required, stay far away from it. If I'm not able to sell this book back at the end of this year, I intend to take it to a target range and dispose of it properly. It will be the most expensive target I've ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like This Book","review":"I don't like this book. Neither does my Professor. It's written like some old math book from the 50's or something. Or a law book. They don't say things plainly in this book.

The only difference in this DVD is that it has a book of press interviews and it is in English with subtitles in French, Italian, German, Spanish and Swedish.

Don't waist your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevrolet Truck book","review":"I thought that this was a very good book that covers all years, good, bad, and yes, even ugly. The pictures were good and the text very informative. It even has a few pages about the Blazer.

You can hear it whenever, in whatever mood, whereever, and always it lifts you. It has been with me during the past 25 years and never has it become dull. Because it is inspired. When Narada sings lovesongs, it is spiritual love; actually everything in the songs refers to the path of enligthenment. It is like a modern western \\"kawali' music of the Sufi tradition - with fantastic guitar solos by the best players, spiralling violins, and bass and drums that kill.

It cuts through the verbose theory in other books and gets straight to the syntax and applicability. Many other computer beginner books could learn a lesson from SQL in 10 minutes. The lesson is you don't have to try to cover every nook and cranny and confuse the hell out of people. Beginners are seperate from experts who are seperate from guru's.

Bravo, Ben!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and accessible with an irritating flaw","review":"This is a handy, inexpensive memory-jogger for those of us who can't seem to recall everything we need to know about using SQL.

I love 'armchair travel' books, and I enjoyed the fictional story this plot wrapped around as opposed to a nonfiction traveler's journal. I have backpacked around Europe and this book was reminiscent of my early twenties, where your whole life is ahead of you and you're not sure what direction you want to take. It hit home for me the way the main character imagines a life of her own in each place she visits with her friends. It spoke to my inner desire to leave it all, travel the world and start all over again. I give it four stars because I didn't like the ending - pretty much from the time her boyfriend shows up it went downhill for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I really enjoyed this book from the very beginning.

This was a huge disappointment.The concept was cute (last-hurrah holiday prompts overworked law student to contemplate life - if only someone else had written it!) but the characters were never really developed, the progression of the story was predictable... which happens in a lot of chick lit, but this lacked any clever dialogue or anything to make up for it.If you need a travel chick lit book, go for Backpack, Wanderlust, or Bridget Jones the Edge of Reason over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, Re-records May Be Present","review":"The following note is provided inside the liner notes: \\"For the benefit of the listener this product may have been compiled from a variety of sources, including where thought appropriate, live material.

Granted, it's beautiful with gorgeous pictures and some great technique descriptions. Perhaps my expectations were too high but considering the size and cost, I would expect this book to be fairly encyclopedic. But when you need to resort to another book for fly patterns/tying and leader construction, I think that is reasonable cause for disappointment.

Having had 2 years of belly dance instruction, I wasn't expecting to learn any new moves, but I learned several! This being the case, I wouldn't recommend it for absolute beginners, but is great for someone with some level of experience.The instructors execute each move exquisitely, showing their expertise and beauty. They are simply inspiring. Using combinations instead of drills, this feels more like a class and less like a workout. It is just so much fun. I have never looked forward to putting a workout video in until I got this one; I enjoy every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Instruction","review":"This was my first belly dance instructional video and I felt it was arranged and presented well. The way the dvd is laid out, it is fairly easy to get to the specific section you want to review. The instruction is easy to understand and follow. If I were to make a recommendation, I would suggest increasing the camera angles. A variety of angles would help to ensure that you are making the proper movements. Great costumes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bellydance Workout","review":"I thought this DVD was well done. Also, the instructors don't take themseles too seriously, which I really appreciated. My only beef, and it's a minor one,is that a beginner beginner might be a bit confused at times. Otherwise, two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun video but not as easy as it looks","review":"This should be your first work out tape unless you actively do an arobics exercise and are in reasonalbe shape. I found Neon's instruction in the 'step-by-step' section very helpful. This section is great for thoes who do not have any background. For thoes who have background, the section makes a great check and drill. No matter your size, this workout really works out most of the target areas. I think Luscious is a nice but challengin work out for beginners. I am pushing into my one year in belly dancing, and i found this video informative, creative and simply divine. the music is perfect for each section. I never got bored with this workout because of how each dancer lead the section and the different costumes. My arms and thighs alone burned with satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I found this DVD to be very enjoyable. The instruction portion is veryclear, the costumes are intriguing, and the dancers are lovely. This is a great beginners DVD. I'm not a beginner, but after surgery was advisedto ease back into it. This is easing me back into it and I'm loving it!I like that you can choose to work out with verbal cues or just music. The pants that the dancers wear are so cool, I think I will have to make a pair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The video and audio quality are terrible, but since I didn't get a chance to use the video right away, it was too late to return it by the time I did. Also, their costumes make it impossible to really see their legs and feet, which I think makes it more difficult to learn than it otherwise would be. It is a decent workout though, which is why it got two stars instead of just one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, Sexy, Sexy!","review":"In addition to finding a fun way to tone my ABS, I got this Luscious Belly Dance Workout to entertain my husband. The women who do this type of dance make it look so easy. I found out fairly quickly that it was not as easy as it looked but, with continued practice I got better and better. Some movements I have mastered while others are still not as easy to me yet. The sexy dance styles are expressed through muscle control and graceful movements. My husband is very pleased with my progression and it has spiced up our life! I'm sure anyone who gets this DVD will love it! You may feel frustrated at first, especially if you haven't worked out in a while. Just take it one dance move at a time, tune in with your body movements and you will be Lusciously sexier in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I highly reccomend this dvd to beggining students who need to build muscle memory. Some people may like or dislike the technique used in these videos, but the way the dvds are made are wonderful for learning transitions while building movement recall. So begginers, these are really nice dvds. The NYC videos are really made well. The movements are introduced, broken down, and explained. Then the movements begin at the bare bones for practice and build in complexity. I really like how much the movements are repeated and the way the segments are seperated. I also like that there are voice-over options for practice. These videos are all very well thought out. Again, they are beggining level. The trailers for these dvds are lengthy and leave you with no questions about what you are buying (THANK YOU!) One minute trailers do a huge disservice to consumers, so all around, I really appreciate the amount of work and effort that goes into the making of NYC instructionsal dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I bought this hoping to learn from beginner level on up. This has you moving your hips one way and your arms in the opposite directions, and all moving too fast. Definitely not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it but .......","review":"ok , so I absolutely love this dvd but the only problem is that its sometimes hard to follow because there facing you . It would be much easier if they were facing a mirror . I love the format and the transitions . It is probaly my favorite work out . But some times I get mixed up and wish they were facing a mirror so I would n't have to stop and figure out which direction Im supposed to be going ."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAKE ANOTHER ONE! I Loved it!","review":"I loved this video. It was fun AND beautiful. It didn't feel like an ugly sweatshop workout! Finally, a way to exercise that looks and feels beautiful.

The only thing I don't like is that you can not see the positioning of the feet during the dances. Other than that, I have been \\"shimmying\\" away."},{"rating":"2","title":"START WITH THE TUTORIAL","review":"If you start the dvd from the beginning, it starts with circles, and can be too fast paced. I tried it once and put it away for nearly a year. Then I took it out again, and realized you have to deliberately start with the tutorial, and I highly recommend it. It takes you step by step through the movements, and the video can be too hard to follow without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painter with a Pen Review","review":"Arguably the best pen & ink artist ever. Some of his techniques resemble scratchboard. A wide variety of subject matter is depicted from landscapes, cityscapes, cars and people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful addition to Shakespeare literature","review":"This short little tome is a wonderful and welcome addition to the body of literature that reviews and analyzes the Bard's work. It is not a deep analysis, by any means. But it makes a nice read in the sub-catagory of Shakespearean trivia. The book lists dozens of phrases common to our language, and gives a quick review of the quip's context in the play, followed by a critique of the modern usage of the same. A fun tribute to the continuing legacy of Bard's body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"shipping","review":"I didn't expect my book can be shipped in such a short time!!it's nice to receive the book in such a good condition too.

French make great house music. Get on board."},{"rating":"2","title":"French rock ROCKS!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this CD!! (Even if One Night in Paris isn't about France.) Fille Atomique is def my favorite song!! If you really like this bad you should also check out Superbus!! They have some good tunes and and fun way of using both French and English in their songs. But they are more bubble gum pop, so don't be expecting Nous Non Plus Duo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Restoration!","review":"First of all, against another person's review about this DVD, Alpha did no restoration whatsoever. It is a copy of a DVD release from Grapevine Video and Alpha simply created their own generic title screen and superimposed their own logo in the corner of the screen. For those who have bought or watched this movie, I'd like to state that from the beginning. No restoration was done. Alpha hired someone to compose a music score, that's all. The film has been \\"altered\\" from the Grapevine Video release and doesn't even have the original title screen. Probably Alpha's way of branding the film so others cannot copy it. Secondly, it's NOT a horror movie. It's a drama that takes place in ancient Egypt. So if you are expecting a rare horror movie, forget it. Of course, Alpha alters almost all of the movies they release on DVD, superimposing logos in the corner, adding sound effects to the sound track of talking pictures, etc. You'd do better buying the Grapevine Video release on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Love","review":"Each Song, each sound.... pure passion!

That's right, I said NBA, you won't believe how influential the ABA was on the game you love today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the 70's","review":"A great book about a time when professional sports were more \\"sports\\" and less \\"professional\\". A bitter-sweet tale of the \\"other\\" basketball league."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Read","review":"As far as sports books go I liked Loose Balls. I liked the author's approach by interviewing all the key participants of the league. It was great to get some insights of the personalities that made the ABA a unique league. As a sports buff and ex basketball player I have a book that will keep the memory of the ABA alive for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipient of This Book Loves It","review":"This book was on my son's wish list for Christmas and he tells us it is one of the best he's read in a long while.The fact that he has carried this book with him to read in any spare moments while waiting to pick up children from ball practice, etc., shows that it's hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book for raptor lovers only","review":"Wanted to like this book because I love Mary Alice Monroe. So, I kept reading a page a time, put the book down, read another page later. If you want to know everything about raptors, go for it, you'll love it. Everthing else about the book, relationships, fell flat. I did not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is far more captivating","review":"When I first glimpsed the cover, I expected an engrossing story with captivating characters as Monroe previously mastered in The Beach House. I felt the plot was cliche and the characters two-dimensional, with the exception of Lijah and Santee (bird of prey). The birds of prey subplot could have been more developed and engaging. Overall, the book is an interesting weekend read, but falls flat when compared to The Beach House."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Skyward\\" by Mary Alice Monroe","review":"Mary Alice Monroe is the best writer I've come across in a long time. You feel like you are there with the characters in the book. Since I live in SC, I love the stories based around actual places here in my state. Every book I've read by her has been wonderful. If you read any of her books, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skyward","review":"I loved this book. It is beautifully written. It is a book that I look forward to re-reading on a cold wintery night. Mary Alice Monroe's writing is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monroe takes you to a beautiful world","review":"Monroe's captivating book takes you to a sanctuary for birds of prey along the coast of South Carolina. Her passion and knowledge of the landscape and wildlife is clear in her vivid descriptions. The characters are carefully drawn, and in the case of the Gullah wise man, Lijah, powerfully compelling. The birds were like characters, too, so vivid were they! I feel I've been taken to a special world in her book and was captivated by her parallels between our human relationships and nature. Inspirational. Highly recommended for readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre + raptors","review":"I am ambivalent about this book--it kept me enthralled throughout and I came to really care about the characters. But when I got near the end and realized that Monroe had simply modernized the plot of \\"Jane Eyre\\" (complete with plain governess, single-father-and-daughter, final destructive fire...), I felt completely ripped-off. Chapters are woven together through the vehicle of different raptors being rescued and (hopefully) returned to the wild (hence the title).Great characterization and description. Realistic dialogue. A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystery Man of Music","review":"I use to play the Walker Brothers \\"The Sun Ain't Gonnna Shine Anymore\\"on 45 in my room as a 12 year old kid. It was then that I realized thatScott Walker has one of the strongest voices EVER. He left the group attheir peak, to pursue a solo career. He has put out several solo projectswhere he interupts other peoples songs with dark passion, but strongcommunication skills (sounds like a Vampire ?) anyway he has been comparedto Jazz Greats; Johnny Hartman and Billy Eckstine, which is great, but he is much more of a experiementalist. I have to admit I enjoy his earlierworks more than his most recent efforts, but I would drive from Miami to NYC just to hear him live. This Video captures his story, life, music etcif you watch it, and go hmmmmmm, becareful, like the Vampire, once you invite him in, you'll never be able to get him out of your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"very simple review","review":"If you are a fan of Mr. Walker - you'll love it.

Look for the original version in Italian if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent soundtrack...terrible version","review":"This version really dissapointed. Ornella is wonderful but the lack of coherent editing and the horrendous English dubbing makes you wonder if it's worth 90 minutes of your life. Would like to know where to find the original Italian and the soundtrack which brings back memories of my childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"When the item arrived I was especially disappointed by the \\"belt buckle\\" which is manufactured with some sort of weird styrofoam material. Also, the dress ties in the back. Overall, it's pretty cheap-looking & flimsy, though, what can you expect for the price?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good.","review":"It isn't often that the movie version of a good book is as good as the book itself, but this is one time it actually happened. I thought the book was profound on a level that Tuesdays with Morrie never reached. Jon Voigt is a superb actor, and he is outstanding in 5 People. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. While some people may regard the \\"message\\" as trite or schlocky, this powerful dramatization of the fact that our lives are all interlocked is something we need to be reminded of often.It also demonstrates the futility of excessive guilt, and the fact that one never knows the complete story in any given situation. And does so without resorting to preaching or mawkishness. Read the book or watch the DVD- the impact is the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I loved the heck out of this movie! After having read the book in a couple hours, I had to see the movie. It didn't disappoint. It had the right amount of matching events and I have watched it several times.

The movie is only 2 hours long but feels like it takes a month to watch. john Voight does a great job acting but i just feel the story telling was weak.

This is about the people in your life who have impacted you, or you have impacted them, the most. Its an interesting story, and well told in this movie. Super acting.My understanding is that Mitch wrote the book thinking of his uncle, who had led a boring life and accomplished nothing. This movie details in a way, how we are all capable of making a difference, even if we don't know it. The movie has some intense war images that might be hard to watch. Nothing too gory, but war is war.

A sense of purpose, and sense of there being a meaning that's too big to see. And Hope.Not being a very worldly fellow, I believe it may be said that the message in this story cuts through every boundary it might encounter. I feel badly for anyone cursed with enough cynicism to blind them to the simple beauty of this story.

Unfortunately, it's the Mitch Albom story that is the big problem. The theme is hugely belabored and is just too over-the-top in its determination to be a \\"three-hankie\\" tear-inducing experience. And it is LONG - God, is it long!! Clocking in at 2 and a quarter hours, it begins to try one's patience after an hour, if not sooner. I've concluded that Mitch Albom is just not my cup of tea; I recall reading \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and, far from being moved, found it morbid and maudlin and about as subtle as an anvil.

I think this concert is the reason Liza had all her hip trouble afterwards.The tap dancing is wonderfull,but it had to put alot of strain on her joints,but that's Liza,always giving us the best she can.The early 90's was a great time for Liza.She had a Gold album,\\"Results.\\" This concert was breaking all records,and she made a fantastic film,\\"Stepping out,\\" that should have been one of the top movies of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"a spectacular show","review":"If you're a fan of Liza, you must have this video as part of your collection.

But if Amazon wants to reap more sales from it, they need to fix the severely screwed-up sampler selections on this album! 'Nights Are Forever' features (just barely if you strain to hear it) the last, fading-out line of the song, THEN the between-the-tracks silence, then the beginning of the next song! It continues being one song off until 4-5 songs later, when it totally LEAVES OUT the sample for 'We'll Never Have To Say Goodbye Again', then corrects itself for the next song.

Hmmm. A dubious moniker indeed. By the end of the 70's this singer song writer craze had disentigrated into the likes of Air Supply and you guessed it England Dan and John Ford Coley among others. This is typical overwrought self indulgent 70's pap. Not only is it extremely dated it is trite and truly awful. There's no David Gates here to save it from it's sugary self. This was 70's MOR ... and I for one am glad that it is long gone.......and by the way is England actually his name, or just a cool nickname?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit back and enjoy.","review":"England Dan and John Ford Coley did themselves proud with this collection. The songs are enjoyable and will bring the listener hours of pleasure as you listen over and over again.

If you're a romantic at heart, here's your music. This album expands to many of the desirable album tracks left off of their earlier \\"Best Of\\" disc, and includes many favorite LP cuts. If you just can't get enough of their sound, try one of Dan Seals' solo efforts, which largely continues the same smooth and heartfelt melodic craftsmanship with the same trademark introspection and sensitivity. \\"I'd Really Love To See You Tonight\\" is only the tip of the iceberg. Delve deeper into this one and you'll never be sorry that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"England Dan & John Ford Coley Were The Best!","review":"I have always loved England Dan and no other artists or band could ever compare to his music.England & John's music was so emotional and it came from the heart,,Nobody can do it better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for England Dan","review":"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD THE SONGS ARE GOOD AND I WANT ENGLAND DAN INSIDE ME THIS CD IS WORTH BUYING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Relaxing Music.","review":"Earth Rhythms is great for realxing just about any situation.

A live performance she gave at Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady, New York on July 18, 1993 that aired on NBC as a Thanksgiving special later that year. So why is it labeled as the \\"authentic\\" MTV Unplugged performance? I guess somebody felt the need to lie to people so that they'd be tricked into buying the DVD so that their regular yacht payment could keep comming in on time like it usually does ;-)And they are deceptive, aren't they? They, literally, took the photo that the MTV Unplugged CD used and stuck it on this DVD package to help with the con. Did these dummies ever think maybe, just maybe, it would've been better if they got Viacom to actually let them release the REAL performance Mariah gave for MTV Unplugged back in the day? NO! Instead, they pull this type of stunt. Fans don't deserve this type of crap. What a ripoff!!!

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Abherration!","review":"The book, in itself, has produced horrid nightmares in all six of my children with it's hateful depictions of the frightful nightmare boogyman, known as Senoir Cadaver.

Grandma Beetle tricks and annoys the strange skeleton, Senor Calavera, by saying, \\"Just a minute!\\" over and over again. The skeleton, who never speaks, may have been there to take her life. Each time she delays Senor Calavera, something funny and interesting happens. The sly look in Grandma Beetle's eyes lets you know that she is tricking Senor Calavera. Recommended for people of all ages, but use carefully with young children who may be afraid of skeletons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uno, dos y tres for a trickster of a tale!","review":"I found this children's book to have a very grown up meaning dealing with death. Senor Calavara has come to take Grandma Beetle into the afterlife when he knocks on her door. However, Grandma Beetle has some tricks up her sleeves for Senor Calavara. Grandma Beetle is clever as she make Senor Calavara wait \\"just a minute\\" until she reaches all ten of her daily chores and is ready to go. The pictures show the chores Grandma Beetle had to do before she was ready to go and just how impatient Senor Calavara was getting with each chore. I enjoyed the bright colors used in the pictures throughout the book. I also liked seeing the numbers in English and in Spanish to show the children how the numbers go together in sequence.

I'm not sure if I was supposed to have found a message in this book, but, if there was one, I missed it! Tuffy was an interesting character but I never felt like he or the book went anywhere.

I get a good seal, and the bass does sound quite natural, but if you listen to rap or any dance/trance/heavy rock, you will miss the hard-hitting bass. I guess it's a sacrifice one has to make for clear sound in a small package. If I had more money, I would probably get some Seinheiser HD 485 cans for the home or when I crave bass.

Also, you skipped some very crucial items such as Jamestown, and help from Squanto, who basically showed them how to keep themselves alive by living on and cultivating the land. The song quickly progresses, sometimes skipping more than 100 years between events.

Whereas Mozart, Beethoven and other classical or romantic composers are the masters of quartets due to their counterpoint and fugue, Pink Floyd music does not translate into string quartets. There is no power here, no dynamics; all necessary to Pink Floyd music. I kept wanting some electrification! The piano is capable of power, but not allowed to sound off in this recording and only provides an accompaniment to the mellow strings. It was boring. Does not have the complexity of the masters to maintain interest. Go to the classics with all their structure to enjoy string quartets for listening pleasure.

Love it or hate it, it was reported to be the most brutal and ferocious movie in decades. Now, a lot of independent movies get lots of fan love at film festivals but only marginally live up to it's reputations. I, however, and very satisfied and find it easily to be the equal of last year's Inside, another amazing French import. Sharp and brutal, it is certainly not a film for everyone. I can even understand the reported walk-outs it supposedly elicited at film festivals. That being said, any estimation of its ferocity should be measured along side its potential audience. While unseasoned viewers may indeed be met with the most brutal, uncompromising movie experience of their lives, I'm sure spectators more accustomed to horror violence will fare much better.

I will just say one thing to the poor ignorant sadistic chap who came up with the brilliant idea for this movie: martyr means witness because it originally meant just that, a witness in a trial, and later also a witness of the faith or cause in which he believes. It has nothing to do whatsoever with witnessing life after death.

Make no mistake, this is primarily a bit of grindhouse nastiness, but \\"Martyrs\\" also plays with the conventions of horror films in a masterful way.

In the end, I felt the movie was more than I had bargined for. The message conveyed is that of such significance to those willing to see.

The plot summary intrigued me and I thought it may be something like Darkness (Spanish horror movie)- but this movie ended up having no plot or resolution. For most of the movie you were watching a very large man violently pummel a small, chained woman. It felt like I was watching a snuff film. The beatings went on and on and on until they had almost killed her and then they skinned her alive. I will not even go into why they said that they were doing this because the reason is so absurd.

There is no redeeming feature whatsoever, no merit, nothing to be gained. As a horror afficionado who doesn't mind being shocked, I have a very liberal idea when it comes to censorship... but this filth should be banned, unless you believe snuff movies should be available for purchase.Someone who wishes to be an artist but has no soul cannot create beauty. All they can create is something that shocks people with souls, or scratches the itch of sadists. Hence this \\"movie\\".I advise you to avoid anyone who claims to have enjoyed this \\"movie\\".

Then it skips ahead to when they're both young women and Lucie's tracked down the people who kept her prisoner earlier. Then.... I watched this whole thing just to see what the point of it all was, and guess what? THERE'S NO POINT!! This is nothing but torture porn, sort of like FUNNY GAMES but with fewer laughs.

JAG is family friendly, with a good mix of action, courtroom drama and humor. It's also a show that you can watch over and over and not get tired of.

I thought the color and sound used in the film were excellent and was actually better than what i thought it would be. Ivan Rogers got the most out of what he had for this film which reflects favorably upon his directing and acting ability.

Take one foot out of the water, pat dry and cut the nails Immediately before they start to dry and harden. Keep the other foot in the foot-soak while cutting the first foot's nails.

This is a fast paced read centered around Ny, the underdog you can't help but route for and his reluctant quest for a truth that will change everything.One of the best things about a good book are the questions it leaves behind. Even better is when something you had seen as a plot hole is neatly and very convincingly explained.

I imagine that they didn't want to ship me the paper due to their pricing error - rather than honor the price (as they said they would) they just decided to 'sell-out' the rest of the paper...

He became so enthralled with the chanting he encountered there that he ended up staying and studying there, immersing himself in the culture and the language.Some of the songs (e.g., \\"I and Me\\")on Brink seem to bring an American sensibility to the concept of chanting. This could confuse or annoy purists, but one of the things about Stringer that appeals to me is his ability to convey the universal aspects of chants.It's hard for me to imagine what this album would sound like to someone who has not seen Dave's passion in action, but it is both deep and light-hearted, an important contribution to the chanting genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Western movies","review":"Great group of Weatern movies.

After all, 37 of the 50 films offered date from the '30s to the early '40s. Possibly there were a lot of start-up film makers then who produced films of little lasting interest to any but the most ardent buffs. You will find in this collection the usual barroom brawls, individual fistfights, tough-looking men riding horses at top speed, in groups or singly, firing pistols with apparently 50-round magazines, and of course slim blonde heroines with shrill voices and zero personalities. A number of films seem to have damaged sections, making plot-following even more difficult.I purchased this \\"collection\\" several months ago from Amazon on sale for $10, so I can't complain too much. Moreover, I was recovering from a broken hip and consequent hip replacement surgery, so I had a lot of empty time to fill.

They are quite soft, but the twist-up feature keeps them from breaking and getting fingers messy. They can be used without water as \\"fat\\" crayons that produce a vibrant color or as water color paints by using a brush directly on the crayon or on the paper after it is applied. These will smear a little bit if applied heavily and touched once it's on the paper, but not as much as oil pastels often do. If you have worked with artist-grade crayons, these do not compare, however they are not intended to and overall are a good introduction to water soluble crayons. Make sure you purchase \\"water color paper\\" to use with this because even thicker artist paper will not hold up if water is applied. They are probably not my favorite student-grade water color crayon, but still decent and a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creamy Crayons","review":"These crayons worked well on the coloring castle, but they can stain carpeting.

I was wrong. First of all, the teacher on the accompanying instructional video has zero personality, something that I find very unmotivating. Also, there is not much in the way of demonstration. She will tell you, for instance, to play the G scale, then she will proceed to play through the entire scale without actually showing you what to do. There is no way anybody could learn to play on their own using this method. At the very best, this is a music book - that's all. My advice is to save your money and spend it instead on a real violin lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better","review":"This has to be the second worst book that I've read in along time.

In the profit scheme this production task would not have taken very long to correct. It's bad enough that I'd feel ripped off it I bought it for a buck at a garage sale.

A lot of JT favourites are included on the video but the star song is \\"Copperline\\". To summarise; great music from great performers in a great location.

Well, the reason is the horrendous score by Ennio Moriconne! What were both DePalma and Moriconne thinking? There are scenes in the movie that have some impact potential, yet the score makes them laughable! It's as if Moriconne messed up the recordings and gave M2M the wrong score! The movie would be much better if it was re-released with a different score...

This score, however, does nothing of the sort. It is trite, distracting, rambling, disjointed, and ugly. The use of several poorly-generated synthesized sounds in the orchestration highlight Mr. Morricone's lack of compositional ability.This score performs poorly in the theater because it has no musical value. It would perform even worse in a CD player.Do not buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Year","review":"I have like Morricone's work in the past, including The Untouchables and The Mission, but upon veiwing the film, the audience LAUGHED at different times the score!

I remember going to see this movie on a free movie pass I had won. I didn't catch the composer's name in the opening credits, but as the (yes, somewhat lame...) movie progressed, I became increasingly impressed with the soundtrack! At some point I just knew it had to be Morricone...I stayed for the closing credits to be sure, and there it was!

My kinky/frizzy hair was smoother and straighter but still had body, unlike when using a straightening iron, so it was okay. After three months the large barrel base cracked so it wouldn't lock into the base. I used the small barrel, with much cursing, to semi-control my poodle hair. Two weeks later the unused-by-me \\"rotate\\" button fell off, allowing the barrel to spin freely.The device itself is a good styling tool, but 4 months is too short a lifespan, even at this reasonable price.

I bought this one to replace it and was horribly dissappointed. The air flow is so weak that you HAVE to use another dryer to dry your hair before you can use this to curl your ends. The barrel loses its grip with the slightest resistance, which means that every time you hit a tangle the barrel rolls and straightens your hair instead of curling it and you have to take the dryer and push the barrel back on it. And then it broke after only 3 weeks of use. What a waste of money! I will keep looking for the old model that I used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Where do I start? Air flow too weak. The plastic \\"seat\\" for the smaller roller unit broke when still fairly new. Neither roller units were easy to clamp in and once in they loosened and fell out. Handle too thick to turn easily. I don't know what country this thing was made in but Revlon should be doing more product control on what they put out on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"used","review":"I did not order a used brush/dryer, but it arrived with a large scratch on one portion and there were hairs in the smaller brush attachment!!! I wasn't happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after 2 uses!","review":"I got this because I thought it would cut my time in half when blow drying my hair. Here is why I give it only one star:1. The first thing that I noticed is that there is not a lot of power behind it, but it did add shine which I liked. 2. The first time I used it, both barrels came out as I was using it. I have kind of thick hair so i always separate it into smaller sections so as not to overpower any tool I'm using, but this couldn't take even small amounts without falling out of the dryer.3. It is supposed to spin, but even before I ever put it to my head, it never spun. The only think it did was loosen if it got tangled in my hair4. The second time I used it the barrel split in half in the middle of using it, again on a small section of hairOverall a good idea, but poor quality. Frankly i expect more from Revlon."},{"rating":"1","title":"it didnt work!","review":"the hair dryer/curler looked used and it had hair rolled on it...it said it was new on the amazon review.

The Revlon RV 444c hot styler because it falls apart in your hand while you are trying to dry your hair. It is not sturdy and it makes it really hard to you use! I sent my back and got a Conair one that it is a lot more user friendly and durable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Cheap Redesign","review":"My previous Revlon 444c hot air brush just died after about two years so I bought the same model again-- but the new 444c is a total redesign and not what is pictured on Amazon's website. The newer model has fewer rows of bristles in the brush (much smaller surface area) and the handle base is not only fatter but constructed of really cheap and flimsy plastic. The brush attachment is a little wobbly too. Compared to the previous model, I don't think this one is going to last 6 months. I've lost loyalty to Revlon now. Pay attention corporations--I'd rather pay MORE money for a better quality item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The styler pictured is not the new model. Don't waste your money.","review":"The styler pictured is the older model, which I loved. Each time one would wear out, I would replace it with the same model. The new model is terrible. It's bulky to handle and they have re-styled the airflow. It blows air out at the base of the brush and blows your hair away from the styler. It's impossible to style your hair with this product now. I'm looking on ebay to see if I can find one of the old models. Otherwise, I'll be looking at other brands. Revlon needs to go back to the original design.Helpful tip: If you are stuck with one of these like me, I took a strip of black electrical tape and wrapped it around the base where the air blows out the holes and now at least the style is functional. Just be careful not to get the tape too far down that it prevents inserting the brush into the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Bought this for my sister as I have one and love it. My one concern was that her hair is much longer and thicker than mine, but she is thrilled with it. I will buy this for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever redesigned this product never dried their hair with it!","review":"This hairdrier has been redesigned. I am very upset with the Revelon Company for doing that. The brush surface has been shortened and air vents put in the brush attachments. That makes it very difficut to dry the hair because the air from the vents blows the hair that is not on the brush and disturbes the styled hair that has already been dried. The handle has been made larger around. That makes it very hard for someone who has difficulty gripping to use it. I have used the earlier designed hairdrier for years and loved it, but this one leaves a lot to be desired. I wish Revelon had left the design alone and not made the so called improvements. I know the person or persons who redesigned the drier never dried their hair with it. Because if they had, they would have never gotten through the styling process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last long!","review":"I bought this hot air brush at KMart, its the only one they have with a larger size barrel. This is the third one I bought in a less than a 2 year period. I use it daily, and it gives great results. However, it does not last more than 4-6 months. The point at which it breaks each and every time is where 2 flimsy screws are attached to the barrel. I am now looking here at Amazon to find a different brand, for when my current airbrush breaks I will not buy another Revlon one. If it wasn't for the barrel breaking off so soon after purchase I'd give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotating Barrell ###%@%^&&","review":"I have had a half a dozen of these hair dryers over the years before they introduced the rotating barrel \\"feature\\". This is THE most annoying thing you can imagine. It is impossible to control once it starts spinning and it is impossible to keep it locked in so that it doesn't spin. This product is the only thing I know that can make me curse first thing in the morning. I was so happy with the old hair dryers without this \\"feature\\". I have switched to a similar product by Conair."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke apart in 30 days","review":"It worked Ok for drying and smoothing my thin, straight hair, but not great. It blows air from the handle, not from the bristles holding the hair, The hair not wrapped around the bristles flies away because of this. It was not the best hot air brush design I have used. 30 days after purchase, the barrel broke from the handle, so now it is useless. I do not recommend this hot air brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styler No More","review":"I have used this Revlon Hot Air styler for years, but now they have changed the style and I will never buy another one. The new one has air holes above handles which dry your hair too fast and the brushes are too soft and do not grip the hair.

Ranging from 1970 to 1979, these poems show him working on familiar themes, but he's getting better at expressing himself. His chaotic life is drawing to a close as he settles into married life in the 1980s. These poems are more focused than his earlier efforts, but also a little looser --- he's able to sum up a mood, a day, or an old friend in half a page of non-rhyming verse. These poems are full of wry humor and romance, a far cry from his reputation for booze and sullen moods. If you haven't read his poetry, try this book. You'll find out what kind of writer Bukowski was. It's sure to inspire you to read more of his great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great intro to Buk","review":"This was my first ever Buk book.

The lyrics, the singing, the songs, the artwork, the liner notes, etc. Proggers complain that their music always gets an unfair treatment. Well, this band is why. While not quite as bad as Cairo's first album, this album is a turd. Trent Gardner has taken everything that can be construed as bad in progressive rock and amplified it to frighteningly awful levels. In fact, I would hardly call this album progressive at all. It's regressive. One listen to the opening track's first four minutes will tell you all you need to know about this album--it's completely worthless. Unfortunately, Magna Carta records has this misguided idea that Trent Gardner is worth pumping their money into, and therefore, is allowed to burden the progressive rock community with his misguided idea of what progressive rock should be. This album just ain't it, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronic drums are a debit, songs are a plus","review":"I strongly disagree that Gardner is a bad songwriter. I think the only problem is that the electronic drums are too trebly and distract from some interesting melodic changes. The middle section of \\"Waterfront Weirdos\\" is particularly good. Some songs aren't quite as strong (\\"Under the Wire\\" is practically worthless) but most of them have powerful vocal harmonies and complex, intricate changes. And it is surprisingly catchy in places.

Trent Gardner is obviously gripped by the worst kind of Yes-worshipping complex (circa 90125). I gravitated toward this band because they did such a good job on the Magna Carta tribute albums. They need a lot of work honing their songwriting skills. There is no doubt in my mind that the band is talented, but they are trying too hard to ape someone else without finding a vioce of their own. And on top of that, the lyrics are embarassingly puerile."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining..","review":"It isn't anything new nor does it bring anything earth shattering to the audience; but, it was enjoyable. The movie was a bit slow in the beginning but once the group discovers the body of their missing member it picks up. The reasoning behind the texts and the deaths are explained.

It realy left a bad taste in my mouth. Only the beginning and the end held anything good in this book. Bad enough that I had to return it so that seeing the book doesn't spoil my love of Honor Harrington."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible disappointment","review":"Very unlike David Weber. This book is incomplete. Most of Weber's work is both great, rollicking reading and literarily sound. Generally, if you open to the middle of one of his books you find the middle of the story it tells. Not so in In Enemy Hands. The center of this story is about 50 pages from the end, plus it doesn't so much end as simply stop. It reeks of \\"editor says print now, give me what you've got.\\" DO NOT read this book unless you have the next one waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid exploration of characters as well as action","review":"In Enemy Hands violates one of the key rules of series fiction--this episode doesn't end at the book's end--but overall the book significantly advances the series, allowing Weber to develop his characterizations within a solid action plot. We discover reasons to like some members of the People's Republic; we learn more about the psychology of treecats; and Weber gets closer to the female psyche in its many forms. If only his grammar were better! But the book is definitely worth adding to any space opera collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"great light reading","review":"hey, this is really great light reading. Good is good and bad is bad: the good guys on the good side win, the bad guys on the bad side lose, and the good guys on the bad side do the right thing.I've read all of them, and I'll read the rest. This series is as good (albeit about two levels down) a read as the nautical series by O'Brien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of the lectures","review":"OK, I read a lot of science fiction, especially military SF. The first few books in the Honor Harrington series were a wonderful homage to Horatio Hornblower and a nice bit of fresh air in space opera. Books 1 through 3 were quite good, 4 through 6 OK, and then I was sorely disappointed by this one.The story was OK; the plot was OK; the development of the overarching series as a whole was OK. What was NOT ok was the fact that Weber descended into so many author filibusters that it A) felt like a full 1/3 of the book was Weber telling me I am not concerned enough with the plight of women and B) I wanted to stop reading the darn book. In the end I finished it, but Weber's ridiculous screeds almost put me off the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one and go on to the next book.","review":"OMG! This has to be one of Weber's worst of the series to date. Page after page after page of of blathering on and on about things not even remotely relevant to the story. I have read the previous 6 books in the series and was HUGELY dissapointed with this work. Save yourself the $$ and just remember the following. 1) Whitehaven has the hots (now) for Honor. 2)Honor surrenders to the Peeps 3) Some \\"good\\" Peeps help her escape. Skip this one and go on to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing Weber !","review":"Well, that's not so bad, six good books in a row !

I hope the (almost) only good space-opera writer will fight back in his following books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A distinctly different book","review":"A very distinct departure in style for David Weber, in which something seriously bad actually happens to our heroine without there being a real happy ending. Granted, escaping from the hands of Ms. Ransom is a good turn, but being stuck on a prison planet is still bad. In fact, you really get the idea he's lifting some concepts from both history and 1986. A few books back, it took a while for me to get the allusion to Robespierre. Once you make the connection between Haven to the French Revolution, it becomes far more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor taken","review":"Honor is in command of a joint Manticoran Graysonian squadron when it is intercepted by an unusually well commanded Peep squadron. Despite her best efforts, Honor's ship is forced to surrender to the Peeps and she is placed in custody of the commanding officer who is quite preparedto accept her parole. Unfortunately, his political officer is of another mind and forces the commander to transfer Honor to 'Civilian' imprisonment where she is forced to endure all forms of degradation. Finally handed over to the Peeps head of publicity - a cold hearted woman by the name of Cordelia Ransome, she is tortured even more and her 'cat Nimitz finds himself the target of Ransome's ire. When all seems bleakest, help is offered from an apparent renegade and the Manticorans find themselves free to escape. Only trouble is that the only place they can go is their destination; the Peep's most secret prison planet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed","review":"I didn't realize this was a coloring book when I ordered it.

That said, I still highly recommend adding this to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"To me this book is better than ok but much less than exceptional to deserve 5 stars. Ther are a fairly substantial number of recipes for all your key breakfast dishes such as eggs, omelletes, waffles, pancakes, stratas, quiches and more. The recipes overall are good, mostly simple and straightforward and some recipes are quite creative and original.Whats missing here is photography. Not a single photo in the entire book. I personally like to see at least a few of the finished dishes to get a feel for the authors perspective. Take for example the Green Eggs and Ham. This is one that I would like to have seen in a colored photo and it would hav complimented the book.Other than that observation, if you like breakfast and want to add some extra flair to your Sunday mornings, it's a good source for some new ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST !!!!!","review":"The ONLY drawback is the large chucks of onions that may need to be cut up if you don't like them whole.

It can even be eaten straight out of the jar, by itself, before you spread it on your ham sandwiches or between your ham and roast beef, with lettuce and tomato on toast. Don't eat meat?

A lot of it is genuinely annoying, but like a pipewrench: when you need really annoying Beatles' covers -- and you know you will -- nothing else will do.The title of my review refers to the included Joe Pesci version of \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\". This little postcard from an early moment of exploration and experimentation in Joe's life, sounds like a bland lounge singer through the verses, but when the chorus kicks in, Pesci's voice hits you like a bullet. If for no other reason, this is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would you think if I sang out of tune?","review":"This was the last Golden Throats CD that Rhino Records released. This time around, they made the decision to exclusively include Beatles songs. This turned out to be a wise decision. The CD is a lot of fun. Most of the performances are very funny, although I'm sure the recording artists didn't intend them to be. Some of the highlights include George Burns, William Shatner, Mae West, Bing Crosby and Joe Pesci. But probably the weirdest track here is the lyrics to \\"Norwegian Wood\\" sung to the theme from \\"Mission: Impossible\\". If you liked the other Golden Throats CDs, you will like this one, especially if you are a Beatles fan. But it's a shame that Leonard Nimoy never recorded a Beatles song, so his streak of being on every Golden Throats CD got broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a poor guide for beginners & no \\"Artist's hndbk","review":"This book is of little use to beginners as it does not offer a progressive method to help one learn to either draw or paint.

For beginning Painters I would recommend LEARNING [or STARTING} TO PAINT IN OILS by Bernard Dunstan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"This is one the typical books from Lynne Graham. Billionaire hero and the ugly duckling heroine meet and feel mutual lust for each other. She thinks that the hero is in love with her body but not her. She leaves after she finds out that she is pregnant, and he follows. When he finds out about the pregnancy, he insists upon marriage. The hero and heroine admit that they both are hopelessly in love with each other at the end. This book is very funny in my opinion. The heroine is very quirky, even though her self-esteem is on the low. The hero is very protective, and he does little gestures that are very romantic. If you like one of those stories where the heroine is a swan-in-disguise, then this book is perfect for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pippa picked a pickled pepper","review":"While the story started pretty well for me, I had a real problem with the heroine. Perhaps I just don't understand how ppl with low self-esteem think.Andreo was definitely placed in great light for his patience and persistence with a difficult woman. He must really care for her.Since one of Pippa's good points is her intelligence; even more than Andreo's in math, I would have liked to see something at the end to know what became of her career if any."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typical Harlequin romance","review":"When I'm in the mood for light and frothy, I devour these types of books. I really did enjoy this one. Both MC's were likable and I particularly liked the H's devotion to the h.I probably deducted a star because of the H's name, he is called Andreo in the book when it should've been Andrea. The author should have been aware of it because the H even says it is one of the most common boy's names in Italy, which it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?","review":"While there is a plethora of compilations revolving around the New Wave genre, many being quite exceptional, this particular collection would definately fall short. Of the 14 tracks on this cd, there are only five I had heard of, 1 of which is VAGUELY familiar. That alone says a lot, since I was a high school student in that era, and New Wave being more of a music preference... it was a lifestyle. Yello, Art of Noise, Blondie, and Love and Rockets are the only worthwhile contributers of this collection. Why not Ebn-Ozn, though they only had one hit, it still chimes the memories of the former \\"New Wavers\\" of days gone by. Next time a corporate executive gets the bright idea to compile a New Wave collection, they should first seek out somebody (perhaps me) who REALLY knows what the New Wave croud actually listened to. Due to lack of interest, perhaps this \\"collection\\" will quickly disappear into the archives of File 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phat Trax 7 - Flat","review":"I was very disappointed by the sound quality of all the songs on the CD. My favorite song \\"Heartbeat\\" sounded old an uninviting. All the tracks are flat sounding. No dynamics. No bouquet of sound. The sound quality is less than MP3. I was completely surprised that it was compiled by Rhino Records. I have several collections from them and never had this problem. Unknown if this is a quality issue with the CD itself or if they used old worn out masters from a secondary source to create this CD compilation. The release date on the CD is 1997. Rhino probably needs to get digital remasters and create a new CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"sure to be a hit","review":"Beautiful safe eye catching infant toy.

Much of these videos I've seen before, and chances are if you're a fan of Santana, you've seen some of them too. The only difference is, the annoying commentary during songs. It's not that I don't enjoy listening to Carlos talk (he certainly has a way with words), but not in the middle of a song. I'd rather hear him play than talk. This occurs in just about every song.The splicing of about a dozen different performances of Black Magic Woman was definitely bizarre and confusing to the viewer. I wasn't expecting much from this DVD (despite a fantastic track list, I was expecting disappointment) so I'm not too upset. But the commentary during songs irritates me to no end (take a look at my Allman Brothers Live at Great Woods review). I'm still waiting for a really good DVD of Santana performing some of these great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of crap","review":"This is the most disappointing music DVD I've ever had the misfortune to purchase. If you want 2 second segments of Black Magic Woman spliced together into one mish-mash of a song then this might be for you. A total waste of time. I would have preferred one full version of the song or even a few different versions of the 'entire' song. As for Carlos talking over the top of the songs - what a joke. They should have indicated on the back cover that this wasn't a music DVD. Totally hopeless. I can't even bring myself to sit through the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Didn't think it was possible to produce a terrible Santana DVD but they sure enough delivered garbage here.

In both there is the element of holiday frenzy, with the orchestra in full pitch. This was followed by more quieter pieces, mainly songs four (paralyzed cowboy), through eighteen (once upon a time). The pieces themselves capture the fleeting moments, favored by what sounds like flutes, piccolos, and other wind instruments.Christmas holiday standards by Dean Martin and Judy Garland help create a warm, enduring yuletide collection.

It is verbose and frequently veers off course to matters only loosely connected to Airstream's history.

The anthology begins with three or four stories detailing the deviant side of sexual horror. Hardly anything to get your pulse racing.These stories are followed by a short group of stories that, in my mind, could more aptly be called erotic horror as these stories dwell upon themes based on romantic relationships, rather than deviant behavior. From this point on, the stories fall into the just plain weird category.If you're a fan of the earlier books in the original series, I doubt that you'll find this collection to be a worthwhile addition to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Stavinsky records ever","review":"Well... one may not like Oedipus rex, all right ; but if one does, this is probably one of the best two recordings.

I don't recommend this one for anyone unless they like ice cold air blowing out of the unit all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissatisfied","review":"I am a smoker. Have been for many years yet I hate the smell in my house myself. I purchased this as I know Non-Smokers visiting cannot stand the smoke odor. Within 3 days, the horrible smoke smell was blowing out of the top of this machine (after supposedly filtering)! To work, at all effectly, I would have to change the filters every 2 days. Not at all practical or affordable. (and that\`s assuming it would work).

I gave this new Holmes filter a few night's worth of trying it out, but it seems that each time it was on, my allergy symptoms were worse. Not sure what was happening or why. Too bad.

Save your money up for a better brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad interior design","review":"dirty air must pass through 2 filters - first through a charcoal filter, then through a hepa filter. when first installing the filters you will notice the hepa filter has a nice rubber seal to separate the intake part from the exhaust part, or so you would think. after using this for a couple of months i looked down the exhaust vent and noticed lots of debris. upon inspection of the filters, i noticed the lager parts of dust that go through the charcoal filter will actually go through AND AROUND the hepa filter. the hepa filter needs a little more pressure (better seal) between intake and exhaust to work effectively. one could rig it, but why. although it gets most of the dust, i don't recommend this for people who need true hepa quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Reliable","review":"I know a lot of folks struggle with the right thing to purchase and I just want you to know that I have had this item for nearly 10 years and it has run at the highest setting non stop. And it still works! There was a \\"brown spot\\" that appeared after about 6-7 years near where the led lights are at but it hasn't affected anything. Looks like I went a while without changing the filter and the LED lights got hot. I'm just delighted this thing has lasted this many years! At this point it's just bragging rights. I hope the rest of you experience the same as I have with this Air Cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"My family has had this for years and has been working great in a smoking home with 3 people smoking. When off, you can smell smoke throughout the house and when I turn it on, It cleans the air on the first floor within a hour. We leave it on speed 1 most of the time and 2 to clean the air more quickly. I highly recommend this air cleaner but be warned the filters can get a little expensive but not to bad because they pretty much last for a year. I am buying a new one for my place for when I move in.New update: Don't waste your time and buy the carbon filters because they are worthless. Now, what I did was go to home depot after I bought the new filters on Amazon and purchased Web Absorber Electrostatic filters. It comes on a 20*25 sheet but I cut to size to cover the grid openings on the door. This works much better with smoke and keeps the new filters much cleaner. At 9.99 I thought it was a good buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 8 months...","review":"The first filter replacement came around, new filters were put in and it never worked again.

I didn't know I had bird allergies until after we got her. I use the air purifier in the living room where the bird's cage is and my symptoms are definitely decreased when it's on.I gave it a four rating because it is loud on the top setting (so much so that I can't hear the TV). I usually put it on the middle setting but it still helps my allergies. Also, it blows cold air, which will be great in the summer, but not so much in the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works REALLY well; louder than more expensive units","review":"It works really well; noticeable almost immediately.It's louder than the more expensive brands, but not bad. Quiet on the slower speeds, but I doubt it's as effective. Since it was purchased for what it can do rather than noise, we always run it at full speed.Great buy for the money. Ordering a few more for other rooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Air Purifier","review":"Bought the Holmes HAP726-U to help relieve my girlfriends allergies when she visits. It works great. Since she is able to sleep at night, I am able to sleep at night. Great product and simple to use. There is a power button, a plus and minus button, and a digital display. To use the timer, hold down the plus and minus button at the same time, and when it starts to flash, use the same buttons to adjust the timer. Its size is a little bigger than a standard computer tower. It doubles great during the summer as a fan. It isn't that loud if you have it running on 2 (out of 4) when trying to sleep.I didn't give it a 5, because the replacement HEPA and carbon filter are expensive. This purifier uses 2 HEPA and 2 carbon filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holmes not truly honor their warranty","review":"Purchase a Holmes HAP756 in January 2009 and it is dead after 5 months.

After contacted the service dept. last week, Holmes refused to send me the same model for replacement claiming the model was no longer in stock because they don't produce anymore.

For the newbies, I would recommend it, god knows the newbies need some guidance on what is good Gothic music and what is not(coughing while muttering the name,AFI..AFI.) So is it worth the 50 or 60 dollars? Depends, If you out there have Limewire or another way of downloading some of these artists first, then try that before you buy this. If not look for it cheaper. It has a good lineup, but, like I said before..the old schoolers need not apply...and just because some band does a remake of the Cure song, \\"The Hanging Garden\\"..does not mean they deserve to be on a Gothic comp!!(AFI)...It is nice to see Charlotte Sometimes on a comp.

We haven't been rough on them and have followed the washing instructions...and yet here we are with a whole set of sheets that is useless because the fitted sheet is torn, and they don't appear to sell individual sheets.

I always follow the washing instructions but that didn't matter. These sheets were on our bed for less than a week when I noticed the threads pulling apart in several spots. I bought these as a replacement for other high thread count sheets I've had for YEARS. Those sheets still do not show the wear that these do after only 1 use. The quality of these sheets pale in comparison to REAL 500 thread count sheets. I purchased 300 TC from Amazon that were much better quality. Save your money and your time.

They first were not the color described on the website. They were supposed to be silver, and instead were light blue. Also, there were not 500 thread count quality. Very thin and not soft at all. (I had recently read an article that manufacturers were counting a different thread type (breaking down the original one thread so that they could say that the thread count was actually double what it was) I feel that is exactly what was done here. So buyer beware when you look at thread counts. Make sure it is a reputable company. And finally, to add the frosting to the cake, the edges were starting to fray and pull and I hadn't even put them on my bed. please look for another sheet set. These are not worth $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked good but didn't last","review":"The sheets are generous in depth so will fit a thick mattress. They are also very silky feeling.

I will not be purchasing these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after a few washes","review":"Agree with other reviewers... the fitted sheet fell apart after a couple of washes.

They were extremely soft and light plus they didn't wrinkle after being washed. UNFORTUNATELY they only lasted a couple \\"cycles\\" on the bed before holes were worn through them at the foot end. If you are an active sleeper like I am your feet will wear a hole in them after they have been on the bed a couple times. If they were cheaper I would still by them because they are that comfortable. If you are an inactive sleeper with well manicured feet I would recommend these. Otherwise don't waist your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the scale!","review":"I have had this scale for 2 years now, and it works very well, and accurately.

There's been plenty of time to get music clearances settled, and TCFHE needs to keep this in mind or they can go f___ themselves: the show was shot in widescreen toward the end of its run and it better be issued that way IF it ever gets a domestic release.

The rudder's range of motion was limited to left of center when it should have been able to move equally in both directions. I believe that the engine was mounted askew and there were no fine tuning screw mounts to address this issue. Regarding durability, the propellers break easily. The fuselage of the plane is very durable but the wings and rudder are very flimsy.

I was so disappointed. Most of the story seemed silly but I could have gotten beyond that part. It was the final chapter that appalled me. How can you talk about killing babies and children when you are writing a children's book? the author actually used the word kill several times. I realize that scripturally it is correct but it was unnecessary. If the author felt that part was important then it should have been worded differently.I would not recommend this book and I sent it back to Amazon. There is no way I would read that to any child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely illustrations, but portrays Mary wrong.","review":"Pretty good overall; lovely illustrations, but Mary is portrayed as a little clueless. I doubt she screamed in pain as Jesus was about to be born, and why has the author portrayed her so ignorant? In the story she has no idea why the wise men arrive to pay homage to her child. Didn't the angel tell her he was to be the SON OF GOD, the King of Kings? Did she forget? In an effort to show the human side of Jesus, the author has gone too far; perhaps adding a bit too much detail (pus oozing from Jesus' wounded head, pain of childbirth) for the age 4-8 crowd. Incidentally, most beleive that Jesus was born in silence, without pain, preserving the virginity of His mother. A few small changes would have made this book wonderful; I didn't read it to my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack","review":"I saw this thrilling indie film on a recent trip to New York and loved the Native American influenced soundtrack.

We received a couple of copies. We gave one away and kept one to play music from the show. Unfortunately, the music really didn't fit with the show and was rarely played. I ended up keeping the cd because I couldn't find anyone who wanted a copy of this used cd.The music on the album is a strange conglomeration. There's some instrumental songs; a moving, semi-spiritual piece; some alternative-sounding tracks; and at least one rock song. Of the thirteen tracks on the album the only two I can really recommend are \\"Inside of You\\" by Richie Havens and \\"Song of the Seas\\" by Vangelis.

They are 'Under the Hammer','Rolling Hot','Night March','Code-Name Feirefitz','The Tank Lords' and an Appendix which gives a history and a background of the Hammer's Slammers universe. There is also a afterword from Mr. David Drake himself.This book is great for people who wish to get into his tank stories, but I think people who already own many of his books would already have many of the above stories.Two more volumes, 'Caught in the Crossfire' and 'The Butcher's Bill' are also NEW collections of OLD stories, with some NEW stories made just for the collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stories, bad editing.","review":"I enjoyed reading the stories. There were two reprinted that I had not seen before, and the new one was extremely interesting. The major flaw, however, was the poor editing. Someone had obviously gone through the text with a spell checker, but had not taken the time to read the stories to see if the correctly spelled words made any grammatical or contextual sense. While that may be (barely) acceptable for one or two instances, it is not acceptable time after time after time. Whoever the editor and proofreader were for this book should either be fired or at least have their pay docked for each error. If I were David Drake I would be upset to see my writing trashed by the publisher in this way. The book would have received a 9 or 10, were it not for the painful reading caused by the errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"The author of this book seems to have made pretty sure that the word \\"cyan\\" appears at least three times on every page.

After thier boat bottoms out trying to save a drowning victim a group of friends discover a beautiful woman on a deserted island. After inviting her to join them the group starts to experience strange visions, along with having problems trying to leave. It may be skewed because the movies I watched before this were pretty boring, but this one actually wasn't too bad. It has some overused characters, the cocky boyfriend, the pretty girlfriend, the best friend in love with the girlfriend, and the strange hot girl who everyone falls in love with instantly. If I was up on my mythology I probebly would have noticed some things that may have made this more interesting, but overall there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.

Don't fall for the deceptional cover cause it has nothing to do with the movie.The mythical story of sirens who lured sailors to their death with their seductive singing could've made an interesting premise. However, the script for SIREN bounces all over the place, inserting senseless allusions to what is real and what isn't. Throw in the inevitably boring lesbian scenes to add to the confusion. The siren herself is about as menacing as a slug and while lovely is hardly worth dying for. So much of the movie doesn't make sense, and it's really boring. The ending is both predictable and unimpressive.An ambulance ride with sirens blazing is more terrifying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poorly Constructed Film Filled With Holes","review":"For the most part, the reviewer who stated that this movie had major plot holes is 100% correct. This movie makes no sense. It is based on the premise that rescuing people can be dangerous. The filmmakers may have tried to create the suspense of movies like \\"Triangle,\\" as the film starts out on a boat (well, after a role-playing scene in the desert that makes absolutely no sense anyway), and then ends up on an island. On the island, it turns into a snooze-fest. Nothing happens until the very end, and the reason for the ending was never really explained. Looking at the cover art for the movie, you'd expect to see a ton of nudity and gore, and there is absolutely none. At least it could have been suspenseful, but the writers/directors couldn't even give us that. And it was so poorly acted that the transitions between visions and reality could not even be depicted at times by those viewing the film. This is easily one of the worst films so far in 2011."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better as a porno","review":"The acting was atrocious, but the sex scenes were awesome.

From my perspective, a label on the cover of a CD proclaiming that the recording features special musical guests is often a handy warning to steer clear, but in this case, I was glad I gave this disk a listen, for Beausoleil sounded as good as ever, and the guests (the most well known are Richard Thompson, Augie Meyers, and Dr. Michael White) are blended right into the musical fabric. As usual, this is a danceable set of tunes, done with style and flair, a seamless blend of old and new, tradition and innovation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Maiden Clone","review":"What can I say; I didn't even buy the CD.

I like the interactively now available through DVD. Unfortunately this game, although based on interactivity, doesn't offer it as it is intended. This game could have been re-mastered or even revamped to suit today's technology. Its so frustrating to see the same video screened repeatedly. No skill needed - a basic game that requires very basic skill, 'pushing the right button at the right time'.

This is the same game but you play it with your DVD remote control. The video quality is top-notch, but the gameplay leaves much to be desired. I expected the game to pause when you make a wrong move (in order for it to seek the disc for the death scene), but this DVD actually pauses when you make CORRECT moves. The pause is about 1 second long. It makes levels such as the chessboard/knight excruciating painful to sit through. I don't understand why there's a pause if you make a choice whose animation sequence directly follows the move. In short, I'd only recommend this DVD for die-hard Dragon's Lair fans. If Space Ace performance is anything like this DVD's, I'll be sure to skip buying it. What I'd like to see is a re-release of all of the Don Bluth LD games on one DVD, with all of the performance bugs worked out.* the search for the ultimate Dragon's Lair home experience continues..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun :(","review":"I bought this game with hopes that it would be a great addition to my dvd collection. Sadly I am embarrassed to tell people I bought it because as a game it just ISNT FUN to play. I loved the arcade version of Dragon's Lair and had hoped the transition to dvd would be a smooth one. It was not. The animation was great, however key scenes had been cut or trimmed down so that the story line seemed choppy and hard to follow. One second you're in one room and then all the sudden you're in the next. Fans of the arcade version will remember the falling platform, in the dvd game this sequence has been drastically cut down. Why didn't they include the full arcade story along with the complete death scenes? This dvd version should not be called Dragon's Lair because it's not fun to play and it doesn't capture the feel of the arcade game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mega dittoes....no, not from Dash Lambast","review":"I have to second the, well, unanimous comments above.

The Cupcakes base their music on a solid rock foundation, but they also throw lots of techno beats in to the mix to make things interesting. The singer has an incredible voice, but sometimes seems overmatched by the busy rhythm and guitar section. Even so, his voice is identifiable enough to have a lasting impact on the listener. Drummer Matt Johnson (formerly of Filter and the Pumpkins) sets the tone for almost every song, and the guitarist seems to weave in and out in between the singer's vocals.

Never having encountered this before I assumed the problem was with my player but after trying the same disc in another player with the same result, I conclude that the problem is the disc.

Sad to say, this CD isn't very great. The music Elton John wrote for this is uninspring. It lacks any kind of showstopping tunes and and the songs really don't further the story. It listens more like a regular album with each track as a new pop song. Pascal and Headley have great voices and you can hear why Headley won her recent Tony award.

Disney, has destroyed the concept of theatre and \\"Aida\\" is the worst show they have put out yet. \\"The Lion King\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" musically are much better than this.After hearing Verdi's \\"Aida\\" this does not compare. But even if you are not a fan of opera and a fan of musicals, this CD sounds like ever-typical musical, such as \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" and all of the rock musicals. The music itself is repetitive and the voices for the most part are not very good. The show lasts on its name and the people who produced it, Disney. Tim Rice and Elton John has destroyed the original opera in all the ways possible, and turned the once loved love story into a show where you want Aida to die, so you can leave. The music is unemotional and when they are in the tomb, dying, the audience does not feel a bit bad for any of them.

The songs are unoriginal and bland (get the original: The Lion King, if you prefer the same tunes)and the singers, led by Hedley, are BAD!Learn from my mistake and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Good Recording","review":"Aida is not your normal recording. It has a variety of different styles of music in it. Heather Headley sings the title role beautifully...so well that she won the Tony for it, but anyways, Adam Pascal does a good job with his role as Radames. The only thing that I didn't particularly care for was that his voice in my opinion isn't suited for musical theatre. Adam is actually a rock singer, but he still does a very good job in his leading role as does Sherie René Scott. The music itself is beautiful by Elton John and Tim Rice (also won the Tony for best new music). This recording is definatly one of the better recordings in my collection. I would certainly say that Aida is worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs stay with you","review":"Where to start I saw the broadway a couple of years ago, I was not fortunate to see it in the original cast but the music calls and pulls and wont leave you alone. I bought this album 2wice, once because when I finally found it I could not pass it up, and the second time because I somehow left it behind when I moved away to go to college. For someone like me that says alot I don't spend money on music alot so to buy this twice... You get my drift. Even for those who have not seen the play the music ties you in and makes you want to sing along side each character. Me being a musical creature I found this to be an exhillerating thing... I even won 1st place singing \\"Easy as Life\\" This is a must have for any music collection 5 stars. This CD inspires the immagination and keeps you yearning for more... I hope one day they record a dvd to compliment this album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great play with some really great songs","review":"I saw this play very recently on Broadway because i got a great deal on fantastic seats. I didn't know any of the music or much about the plot except it was disney's version of verdi's tragic love opera. I absolutely LOVED it; hung on every word and I had to buy the cd right away. I think some of the songs are really beautiful and romantic(Elaborate Lives, Easy as Life, Step too far)however there are a couple songs that are just so-so to listen to(Build a Pyramid, Dress is my Favorite Suit) but to see live is enthralling due to the staging and dancing and both of these numbers got probably some of the best applauses. I also was disappointed with the second female's lead voice(Armenis)THe girl i saw blew her away with power. I was also dissappointed with Zoser's voice b/c the person I saw was much better. I give the CD four stars and seeing it live 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst theater CD I've ever bought!","review":"No originality, both in compositions and singing style; poor quality singing (very nasal voices); poor quality recording.My copy went straight to the used CD store. What a waste of time listening to this overrated album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD! BAD! BAD!","review":"I can't believe a show could be this bad! The music has absolutely no originality and Heather's voice is amazingly...ANNOYING!As one reviewer has said, this show has a major identity crisis. The voices of the lousy actors singing the lousy songs don't make listening to this terrible CD any better.Skip this one and spend your money on more worthwhile Broadway CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst POP concert I've ever seen!","review":"This is a pop concert that masquerades as musical theater. And not even a good one at that. The voices aren't good and the lines so trite I wanted to laugh while the actors were delivering them seriously.Just go see The Lion KIng. Nothing beats the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show is a dog.","review":"I saw this show on Broadway last Saturday night. I want my $190 back. The story is laughable -- they have turned Aida into The Little Mermaid (starcrossed kids who can't marry for love -- yawn) -- and the songs are a bunch of banal pop tunes. Heather Headley is wonderfully talented but Adam Pascal (whom I enjoyed in Rent) doesn't sing, he just screams. I was bored stiff and could hardly wait to leave the theater. And the CD? It perfectly captures every bland and uninteresting detail of the score. Save your money -- Music Man and Kiss Me Kate are much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst soundtrack I've ever listened to","review":"Sorry, Aida fans, but after listening to the CD, I must say that all the reviewers who say that this is horrible are correct. The score smacks of un-originality - the tunes are reminiscent of other movie recordings such as The Lion King. The songs and lyrics are uninspiring at best. And the fact that a weak cast leads this soundtrack doesn't help at all. Heather is not a good singer and her style is not for musical theater at all; she sounds like one of those American Idol contestants.You're better off purchasing the soundtracks of other Broadway shows. There are MANY of them available on amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the Worst Musical of the Decade","review":"OK, I've never been a Tim Rice fan. I admit it! But he's under-done himself here. This is easily the worst musical of the decade. A talented cast is weighed down with vapid, derivative music (Pocahontas goes Egypian). The authors -- and there were 3 of them -- turned a tragic story into a sappy soap opera. The full extent of the campiness may be hard to fathom on an audio recording -- which after all can't present the silly costumes (an asp-boa?), Meaningful Lighting (the 3 of 'em are standing in a triangle. It's a triangle. They're a triangle. Get it? Get it? -- Or was the down lighting meant to suggest \\"Beam Me Up, Pharoah?\\"), or absurd design conceits (vertical swimmers in a vertical pool in Amneris's private spa. Oh my). But worst of all are the clunky, unmusical lyrics (\\"we live in elaborate times\\" -- come on!). Save your money for a real Broadway show. Like \\"The Producers\\". Or even \\"The Lion King\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst musical in years!","review":"There is nothing worth seeing -- or listening to -- in this overrated musical. The music is bland and copied, the actors are uninspiring and bad singers at best (especially Heather Headley).

I never get tired of listening to this cd!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The Aida soundtrack is amazing, especially after seeing the show!

I would recommend this soundtrack to any romantic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, overrated copycat!","review":"Songs and music have no originality, and the voices (especially Heather's) are bad.Get The Lion King instead. Now, THAT's an album and a show that's worth your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is a pop album that masks itself as musical theater. The music, which reminds listeners of OTHER shows instead of directing attention on this one, smacks of a major lack of originality, and the singers, particularly Heather (who seems to want to sound more like Whitney Houston or some American Idol contestant rather than a theater actress), don't make the recording any better.This is the worst musical theater CD I've listened to to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Bland. As many reviewers have noted, bad music and bad singing. Very pop for musical theater.Don't waste your money on this CD. There are many musicals out there that are much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a track","review":"This CD was missing a track from the album! It was supposed to have 22 tracks, but the CD only had 21."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"The recording is very good.....one can tell they are Elton John songs a mile away; It almost sounds like the Lion King sound track at times. With that said, it is hard to understand some of the lyrics at times which is also typical of Elton John songs..but still very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Verdi to Sir Elton, from Ghizlanzoni to Sir Tim","review":"I have been a fan of the Verdi Aida for some time, so I had to see what my favorite librettist and one of my favorite pop musicians did to it. I must say, i was pleasantly surprised. The story was changed a bit, and i guess the show has a book I don't know about, but everything came out clear. People who do not know Elton John's style of writing pseudo- recititive in verses to make the musical hook even more interesting or Tim Rice's style of lyrics which look trite on the page but ALWAYS hide some deeper meaning (usually something pessimistic, though) might be a little turned off. However every song is exquisite, although the show is a little heavy on the slow songs. \\"Like Father\\" is classic Elton John, while \\"Every Story\\" is classic Rice. A good blend, and i hope to see more collaborations between the two in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pop score masquerading as a theatre score.","review":"Elton John has deserved most of the fame he has earned in the pop music arena. He has proven with Aida, however, that he does not remotely belong on Broadway. While the cast (including Rent's Adam Pascal and Tony-winning newcomer Heather Headley) give some wonderful performances, the material simply has no reason for being presented in the theater. Hearing modern pseudo-country-rock songs come out of characters who are supposed to be living in ancient Egypt is anachronistic and ridiculous. The music seldom serves the drama, and never seems completely appropriate for whatever is going on onstage. If you like Elton John, you'll probably like Aida, but if you're a theatre fan, please pass it by, and search out something more deserving of Broadway success than the music in this \\"corporate designed to be long-running\\"--but emotionally meaningless--hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment passing through","review":"Ito ang isa sa pinaka-walang kwentang musical cast recordings na napakinggan ko. Walang originality -- lahat parang re-hash ng mga awitin sa Lion King. Ang pangit din ng boses ng lead actors, lalo na si Heather Headley na parang may identity crisis, tulad ng pagkakabanggit ng isang reviewer. Hindi niya malaman kung gusto niyang maging isang musical actor o kung gusto niyang maging susunod na Whitney Houston. Sa kalahatan, hindi ito musical theater. Para kang nakinig ng pop CD na overacting ang pagkanta."},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience!!!","review":"Listening to the AIDA CD takes me back to the show everytime! All of the passion and excitment of the show are captivated on this fabulous CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just no","review":"If you like the story, go see Verdi's beautiful opera Aida.Leave this mess of mundane pop ballads and sentimental nonsense behind. That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Amazing!","review":"Anyone who thinks this CD isn't good hasn't got any taste for musics! John and Rice are working together perfectly, and even if the lyrics aren't that original, the music is totally amazing (for example The Gods love Nubia, Elaborate Lives, My Strongest Suit(!!!)), so are the singers. Heather Headly has the voice of a godess and is perfectly harmoning with the other actors. OK, this may not be a classical Musical Score, and OK, a real Orchester would've been nice, but if I were you, I'd buy it! You won't regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton John has done it again!","review":"I was always a fan of Elton John and seeing Aida made it official. The musical itself it vibrant with color, and it shines through the CD as well. I see Broadway musicals very often, but Aida truly stood out. It's a story about a Nubian slave who falls in love with a member of Egyptian army and royalty. There love is very strong, but he was already promissed to the princess of Egypt. Listen to this beautiful Love story unfold on this Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's hear it for Zoser","review":"I agree with the many very positive reviews I've seen of the Aida cast recording. I saw the show in Chicago and New York, and I think it's fabulous. However, I'm surprised that more people haven't mentioned John Hickok's rendering of his songs as Zoser, Radames' father. While I like the quality of Adam's voice, I love the evil smoothness of Hickok's. He has a fantastic flexibility to move from sweetness to biting evil--and I especially like what he does at the end of \\"Like Father, Like Son.\\" That growling note goes right down my spine every time I hear it. He's also one of the best actors in the show. Let's hear it for Zoser!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I've seen the show 4 times, and I am a big fan of AIDA, but when I heard the All-star cd I was a bit worried about the quality of this cd. But it's amazing! The music is fabulous, and the stars are great. Heather Headley is simply amazing and rightfully won the Tony for this role. I prefer Adam Pascal on the cd rather than in person. He doesn't have to deal with the whole acting issue as much-mainly singing therefore I believe he sticks out more on the cd. However, the thing that makes the show for me is Sherie Rene Scott. I can't express how amazing she is in words. I absolutely adore her performance and her voice is one of the most amazing voices I've heard on Broadway. If you're a fan of musicals or just good music, this cd is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"omg! the BEST show and soundtrack ever","review":"wow. i saw the show over a month ago, but i still cant get over what a good show it was. all the actors & actresses were great(i had richard blake, not adam pascal). then my friend saw it a week ago & loved it. since, we keep going back & forth about how wonderful it was, so i downloaded all the music & made a copy of the cd, & i'm just sittin here listenin to it. its SOOO good! even if you've never seen the show, i don't care! you have to get this cd. it's incredible. the voices are great, & the songs are sooo good. it's especially fun if you've seen the show, because then you match the music up to the scenes.

GOOO! :), i think you get how much i liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I had the chance to see Aida on Broadway last summer and I thought it was absoloutely amazing!! Heather Headley has a beautiful, powerful voice and the other performers do not disappoint either. \\"Elaborate Lives\\" has become one of my favorite songs of all time. For those who aren't big musical fans: buy it... it's not your typical musical. And for those who are musical fans: buy it! It's an excellent Broadway show infused with great gospel and r&b flavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"ECHANTMENT PASSING THROUGH MY EARS!!!!","review":"I enjoyed this cd very much. This recording has something for everyone. Motown (my strongest suit), soul, gospel(the gods love nubia), rock(fortune favors the brave), pop(A Step too Far), and classic broadway love songs(enchantment passing through, elaborate lives). The album has a great sense of flow from one song to the next, and the story is not very hard to follow, either by listening to the lyrics or reading the synopsis inside the booklet. I am NOT a fan of elton john, but i found the music very entertaining. Whether you like disney, elton john, tim rice, broadway, or just plain good music, there is a strong chance that you will enjoy this cd as much as i did. Buy it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"The CD and show are rather bland and are really not worth investmenting in. Tim Rice's lyrics always seem to be silly and quite simple in most of the musicals he's done and \\"Aida\\" proves to be no exception. I am a fan of Elton John, but he clearly did not come through in this production. Most of the music sounds the same and a lot of the songs about Nubia just renstate the same idea over and over again that Aida needs to protect her land. There are a couple of great songs such as \\"Written in the Stars\\" and \\"A Step to Far\\", but other than that there are not any other stand out tracks.The show itself is quite amazing if you ignore the music (which, is pretty awful considering \\"Aida\\"'s a musical). The sets are fabulous and the dancing is just fantastic. If there was a category for that the show would get five stars.Overall, I think \\"Aida\\" had a lot of potential but came up short."},{"rating":"2","title":"AIDA IS AWESOME!","review":"I think that this CD is a HUGE improvement from the lackluster poppy all star concept album. Heather Headley and Sherie Rene Scott are two incredible singers. It's no wonder that Heather won the Tony, and that Sherie won the Clarence Derwent award for most promising female performer. Heather has a beautiful, powerful voice and really gets to show it off in a couple of numbers: The Gods Love Nubia and Dance of the Robe. Sherie really has range as she goes from a touching ballad to an outragously funny in Every Story is a Love Story to My Strongest Suit. Adam Pascal is good too in his performance but he sometimes comes off as a bit to rock n' roll-ish. A couple of numbers really don't fit in, Another Pyramid and Like Father Like son. I didn't care for either of these in the show either. The show itself is amazing and if you have the chance to, go see it. It's wonderful no matter what the nay-sayers claim. Aida is a great cast album and an even better show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pop music","review":"I have to disagree with the others who reviewed this CD. I heard the CD before I saw the show and have always really enjoyed it. I personally feel that one needn't spend the time or money to see the stage version, because it's just another typical love triangle story and the staging just isn't that elaborate that you have to be there to get the most out of the music.I enjoy the cast recording, the voices are fabulous and the style is healthy, happy pop - good melodies and rhythms. I especially like the duets and trios between the lovers.While I wouldn't go see the show again, I think the CD is worth having. Fun to sing along with and good for all listeners. I would probably buy this CD over the Rent disc - if you aren't watching the show, Rent doesn't really hold its own musically, it's pretty much unsingable and forgettable songs. Aida is the opposite - get the disc, skip the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm never leaving Egypt again!","review":"I bought this soundtrack for one reason: Adam Pascal. I love him in Rent, and he definitely didn't dissapoint me here.I cannot say enough about him and his performance in this musical. I absolutely adore him.The way he sings just amazes me. Heather Headly and Sheri Renee Scott sing beautifully (by the way, Heather has a solo album I have it, BUY IT!!)They are both fantastic singers. Tim Rice and Elton John have crafted a beautiful love story across time that you must hear!If you are an Elton John fan, or simply like broadway, buy this musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST soundtrack I've ever listened to!","review":"No originality, no originality, no originality.Heather's voice is bad, bad, bad.The songs lack charm, lack beauty, and lack sense.Yes, an ABSENCE of enchantment passing through! Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Soundtrack","review":"I heard some good reviews from friends of mine, so i bought the CD to see for myself. I was disappointed in my friends review, the soundtrack isn't good,it is awesome, it was hand down one of the best CD's i have bought. Heather Headley is amazing, her voice is so powerful and beautiful. She sings with so much passion and it is shown in how she sings.\\"Dance of Robes\\",\\"Easy as Life\\", \\"The Gods of Nubia\\" show her powerful voice. Sherie Rene Scott has a great voice. \\" My Strongest Suit shows the power of her voice, though it is no where as strong as Heather Headley. ANd we can't forget about Adam Pascal,who sang with RENT. He is a great singer who just adds to the wonderful positive parts of the CD. This is a must for any broadway fan.... Heather Headley's Debut CD is also GREAT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a masterpiece, but still an awesome entertainment!","review":"I caught the show a few days ago and I can tell you, this is not another Rent or Les Miz...but it's still an awesome entertainment and isn't it actually the broadway showbiz is all about? It's something much better than what some critics make you believe. To say the least, it's an eye-popping visual delight and it still has Adam Pascal in it. The dialogue is a bit cheesy but the delivery of the cast was flawless.And the music truly grows on you. The Original broadway cast has three perfect leads. Sherie Renee Scott, Heather Headley, and Adam Pascal are just perfect for their respective parts. And I confess I really didn't care for the music that much but I assure you it gets better and better.Try listening to it! You won't regret it. The music is quintessential Elton John, so if you don't like him, better stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the heart","review":"I am a big fan of musical theater but I often have to see the musical before I truly fall in love with the music. There were two musicals in the past that I fell in love with before seeing them, they were Les Miserable, and Miss Saigon. Now I am adding Aida to that list. I first got the Aida cd that had popular recoding artists singing their version of the songs and I really didn't enjoy that. For Christmas I recieved the original cast recording. One day I was cleaning my house and I put the cd into my stereo. Well I got a lot of cleaning done that day because I think I played the cd 5 or 6 times. It has been several years since a new musical has touched me in the way this musical has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I see/hear a different show?","review":"I'll spare everyone my review of AIDA the show and concentrate on the CD and score. Hearing the score in the theater, it's just one more drippy ballad after another that stops the action (what little there is) in its tracks (as it does in the theater). Without the look of the show (love it or hate it), we're stuck with the score on CD. God knows, the cast gives it its all but even the leads don't come off well. They sounded better in the theater. I'm a big Elton John fan but he should be ashamed at this effort. Granted, it's not easy to put on a Broadway show but he seems to have no clue how to write theater songs and these are some fairly forgettable melodies to go with Tim Rice's banal, generic lyrics. Truly bad theater writing. What were the Tony voters thinking? Best Score? So far it ranks at the bottom of the list in the 50-someodd winners of Best Score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Show Not Quite Saved By Good Voices","review":"The book and music for this show are truly disappointing. I saw Aida after having seen Heather Headley in Lion King and being beyond impressed with her talent. I can honestly say that I have never been so let down by a show. The music has some nice tunes but is very superficial and silly for the most part.The women in the show are wonderful. Ms. Headley and Ms. Scott have perfect voices for the roles and their acting is superb. Mr. Pascal, on the other hand has a very \\"rock\\" voice which, in my opinion, should stay in the world of rock. Although his acting is solid, he screams and screeches his way through the score. I am not really sure how this man still has a voice after all the sreaming he has done on Broadway.The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because of Headley and Scott's exceptional voices. If you want Elton John, get the Lion King instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"After Aladdin and Mulan, this show up for special DVD next?","review":"Aladdin and Mulan have just released their new 2-disc special edition DVDs. This movie, The Lion King should be next. Among the memorable numbers here is The Circle of Life, which has become one of Elton John's biggest hits...Excuse me? This is NOT The Lion King? But the songs sound exactly the same!Oh, this is musical theater -- you mean, a real, Broadway production??? You must be kidding!!! There's nothing that sounds close to musical theater here! In fact, this is as pop and Disney as any show gets!Really? This is NOT the good animated movie I've seen about lions?

Oh, not surprising then..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Soundtrack to Match a Great Show!","review":"\\"Aida\\" is an incredible piece of work; possibly my FAVORITE Broadway show of all-time! I love this soundtrack. Elton John is ingenius in every respect of musicality. My favorite songs include \\"Enchantment Passing Through\\", \\"How I Know You\\", and \\"Another Pyramid\\". Each song is engrained in your head; I sing along to this everywhere, even when I'm NOT listening to it! \\"Aida\\" is one soundtrack that every Broadway lover needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aida no more","review":"One of the worst shows to ever grace the Broadway stage. Only claim to fame was the fact that Elton John and Tim Rice were behind it. Unfortunately, not exactly a good collaboration. Unoriginal tunes, cheesy plot and lines, lame acting, poor singing. One could go on and on and on about this gigantic failure of a production, but nothing says it more than the poor sales of its low-quality cast recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scott and Pascal Make It Worth Buying","review":"Not the best musical ever, certainly not another Wicked or Rent, but not as bad as most of these reviews are making it out to be. The soundtrack, while rather bland at times, has a few stand-out songs like \\"Every Story is a Love Story\\" and \\"My Strongest Suit.\\" The CD is worth buying just for those two songs. I was personally completely unimpressed by Headley, but completely fell in love with the emotional sound of Sherie Rene Scott's voice. Also a good performance by Adam Pascal, but not his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst musical I have ever seen!","review":"This won a Tony??? This overrated musical sucks BIG TIME!

I agree with many people when they say \\"It should be a rock concert... not a musical!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful--a masterpiece","review":"Having just seen the show today, I am still on a running high from seeing such a spectacular show, and bought the soundtrack at the theatre during the intermission.The play itself is a thing of beauty--the sets, costumes, dance and songs bring you to a catharsis of emotion--upbeat and fast-paced at times, funny and satiric at others, and unbearably tragic near the ending.Some of the magic is lost on CD, I must admit. It doesn't have the \\"live\\" feeling you get from watching it incorperated with the sets and choreography. But the songs still shine through.Adam Pascal, who I have been a fan of since his RENT-days, is great as Radames. Heather Hedley's voice is beautiful, and Sherie Rene Scott is wonderful as Amneries; the beauty-queen princess who reveals her backbone as the play goes on.Elton John's influence in the show is as blatant as his name above the show title on the Marquis--but thats just fine. He and Tim Rice did a great job with this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Is Elton John running out of fresh tunes? There's nothing original in this album.

This 2 CD anthology is absolutely spectacular! The other reviewers here obviously think so too. I know country music is supposed to contain emotion, etc., however, I found myself bawling at the profound words in some of these songs. How did Randy select and/or write such meaningful songs?

All I can say is BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A super Western!!","review":"I am not a big fan of Westerns, preferring my settings to remain in the British Isles, but this one was one really super read.I mean, with a lead character named Ian McShane (???LOL) how can you go wrong???Ann is out to find revenge for death of her parents and willing to go to any length to achieve this goal. And that includes marriage to a half-Sioux, former cavalryman, McShane.

But this book amounts to more than a couple of very stunning plot twists. It is an superbly plotted, often wildly funny and ultimately poignant book that is five stars above the ordinary mystery. Once again, Jane Rubino takes her southern New Jersey setting and her wonderful characters and sets them in motion in a page-turner that allows Rubino to take aim at targets like entertainment unions, talk show hosts, celebrities, and moviemaking, while provoking the reader to examine some interesting themes involving reality versus illusion. This is the most involving and entertaining book I have read in a long time. Rubino gets very high marks for the way in which she has developed one of the best casts and series around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against The Flow","review":"I found this book to be one of the slowest and most tedious novels that I have read, in a long while. To put that in context, I read 200+ novels per year.The murder doesn't happen until page 179 and I found that the use of scenes disrupted the flow of the novel so that it felt disjointed, and never managed to achieve any flow... I had to force my way through it.Contrast this story against any of Ann Perry's, for example, and my perspective is that this author is just not in the same league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well but Not the Battery in the Photo","review":"I purchased this battery as an extra battery for my Sony DSC-T5 compact digital camera. The 2 Sony brand batteries that I have owned for the last 5 years have held up well until recently. Lately, they have not been holding the charge quite as long. This new CTA one, after months of use, appears to be holding up the same as those did, but at a lower cost than the Sony brand.

My C Crane radio has spent almost its whole life on the refrigerator, with probably only 8 trips to live by the washing machine where I fold my laundry, and work on bicycle parts.Despite the fact that I seldom move this radio, the LCD display went bad after 18 months and now I cannot see anything while tuning. Moreover, one of the springs in the battery compartment broke off and now its quite difficult to remove and change batteries. And, this is after recharging the batteries maybe 10 times total in the life of the radio.Tuner quality gets a 5. Tunes like the $130 radio that it is.Build quality gets a 1. Built like a $13 radio, seriously.overall quality is 2.5, which I rounded down to two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD failures","review":"I bought one of these when they first came out and it worked fine enough. Then my wife wanted a radio for the kitchen and I got the silver one. The LCD's on both of these went bad after the warranties were up of course. I can's use the original at all because of it and the silver edition is almost unviewable. The settings are not intuitive so keep the book handy. The handle, of course, is awfull. The preset buttons are noisy. I sometimes wake my wife up changing stations using an earphone at bedside. Something this expensive should have a remote. I bought these from the company and got no reply from an email I sent about the LCD failure quite a while ago. It has been a couple of years since I bought the last one. Whether or not C Crane addressed the LCD problem I don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"CC Radio is a poor choice","review":"I have two CC radios, both of which failed shortly after the warranty lapsed.Both of them had extreme difficulty with intermittant LCD display failures, and ultimately both radios reached the point where they would not even power up.I know other people that have had similar experience with the CC, and also with other Sangean radios.

The AM reception is excellent but 3 radio's in 11 years at $150 a pop. I recommend you stay away from this one if you listen to the radio much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exact same troubles with our CC Radio","review":"I had no idea that the issues we are having with our CC Radio were so epidemic. LCD display is intermittant and the preset buttons are flaky. And after reading all these reviews I've no intention of sending it for a rebuilt radio...just to have the same issues return at a later date. How many years have these problems been known about this flawed design? It's simply planned obsolescence. They won't see another dime from us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected much more","review":"For the price I expected a radio of exceptional design and engineering. I've had my radio for over a year and it is on now ALL the time. It HAS to be, because the power/sleep button froze just after the warrantee ran out. This necessariy means I can't use the alarm or the weather alert function (since they are turned off by the self-same power button). I'll admit, the tuner programming buttons are helpful, but the fm antenna is the same old inflexable telescoping that can easily be bent or broken off. The am reception, to my thinking, is really no better than cheaper radios. The tv band is a nice addition, but most of the interesting stations are on UHF (beyond channel 13) which this radio can't receive. And, for the money, this radio should have LED buttons that would enable easy operation in the dark. In general I advise you to save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"CC Crane = JUNK","review":"This is my second CC Crane radio .The first one failed when it developed a high pitch occilator squeal across the entire band.This of course happened after the warrenty period .When i called Crane they said to return the radio for repair but i would be charged a repair fee.I refused and stated that the user could not possible be at fault for that type of failure.I paid the shipping and sent the radio back to Crane.They replaced it with an older CC model that was reconditioned.Probably with one of the bad ones sent back that you read about in other feedback.The replacement did not have the occilator squeal but it had plenty of other problems i.e. scrambled LED station numbers,hard to push station buttons.All that for one hundred sixty something something dollars.Save your money ,it's JUNK !"},{"rating":"1","title":"LED and WX band problems","review":"I purchased this radio about 5 years ago. It worked perfectly for the first two years. Then the WX band (weather band) stopped working. I finally \\"fixed\\" it by giving the radio a hard whack in the area of the power button. So now, the WX band works about 50% of the time, and the other 50% I can get it to work with 1 or 2 whacks near the power button. I also have the disappearing LED problem (maybe partly due to the whacks). In my observations, both the WX failures and the disappearing LEDs occur when the ambient room temperature gets into the upper 70's F. (The second floor of my Cape Cod gets a little warm in the summer.)

I think the reception & sound quality are terrific. However, the digital tuning and clock fail and it is impossible to tune the radio or set the clock. Both units failed in the same way. When the first radio failed, C Crane replaced it...it failed in the same way. The second unit failed and was repaired at MY expense only to have it fail again. The kitchen unit is locked into one station which we listen to over breakfast. The bedside unit will not auto-tune & with care I can tune manually...often the readout is scrambled so it's blind tuning. I don't understand how the same problem, reflected in all the reviews has not been corrected. I also think that expecting the customer to pay for a recognized design flaw is simply awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to beat a dead horse but have to","review":"I was foolish and bought two of these a long time ago, one silver and one black. They failed and Crane repaired both, for 40 dollars if I remember correctly. Failed again and they still sit in dishonor on a shelf in my shop. So, three hundred dollars thrown away and not enough interest to call Crane again. But hearing a current Crane ad on KGO and knowing they are sitting there broken for years and taking up space, nagged and nagged me to warn others about Crane products.

The various settings such as timer clock frequency etc.are very difficult and time consuming to program. I am still unable to get the timer on timer off working 100%. A call to C Crane was no help. The reception is not as good as my 40 year old GE. I have tried the suggestion on the outside antenna which caused a better signal however with noise and interferance with other stations.

A regular medium wave radio can get weak reception in the UK from Ireland anyway, but after all my expense, (and the addition of the completely useless Terk antenna), the reception I got was still very poor.

The first one I received did not play at all and had to be returned for a replacement. The replacement was promptly received with minimal hassle, but now the LCD display has failed.

When I saw Styx live with him, it was a great show.

Also get a copy of the CCNA practice exam book (ISBN 0072120525); it is invaluable for preparing for the real exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book BUT FULL OF ERRORS","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

Some people in my class where waiting on the bookstore 2 weeks after I already got mine!! Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this fit in the learning process?","review":"I bought this with the \\"Just Listen'N Learn\\" (the beginners level), hoping that it will help me continue the learning process. The first part is not the greatest, but it is a decent introduction (VERY light on grammar, but O'K on useful vocabulary and phrases). The \\"Plus\\" though is just plainly hard to use. The is a huge gap between \\"JLNL\\" and \\"JLNL Plus.\\" It may be O'K for someone who already knows Spanish on an intermediate level, but you have to brace yourself for some hurdles:- again, grammar is reduced to minimum,- structures, tenses, etc. are used without an explanation,- a lot of words and phases are never translated,- dialogues get really boring.Overall, just (barely) O'K to enhance skills, but you will need to rely very heavily on other sources to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"This was the only advanced Spanish-learning \\"system\\" that I could find at the library. Anyway, I brought it home and it was terrific. It is certainly challenging, but it will improve your Spanish quickly. The speakers speak at a rapid pace and use natural-sounding dialogue (they don't use textbook pronunciations--they slur certain sounds together, chop off ends of words, etc), which helps to train your ear and understand native speakers better. In addition to the listening exercises, there are writing and speaking exercises. Overall it is an excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the STEELERS","review":"May daughter lives in Winchester, VA and is HUGH steeler fan!!

This book started out like a read for a complete beginner with talk of how to play Hold 'Em. It continued with a self-inflated view of his trournament history - include hand by hand in certain tournaments. It includes stuff like \\"then with the blinds at 500-1000, I picked up ATo and raised on the button to take the blinds.\\" Jesus - who cares? The amazing part is that this book was written BEFORE he won playing in the 2004 WPT Championship. He was nothing but an amateur with a couple cashes. He had no business writing a book.

Tortuously I ploughed through it to the bitter end. Now I've come to where I can finally write the damned review, and I realize it isn't worth a review.So I'm simply going to say this is the worst poker book I have ever read. More than that, it may be the worst book I have ever read. None of you may like this non-review, and I really can't blame you. But I can state with assurance, you won't be able to say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bikeriders","review":"More a photography book than anything but also has interviews with the people who grace these pages. Chronicles the early years of the Outlaws MC, the pics in this book are amazing. The bridge being ridden across in the photo \\"Crossing the Ohio River\\" which is considered by many to be the greatest motorcycle photograph ever is about a five minute ride from where I once lived. Every time I rode across that bridge I thought about that pic. The Bikeriders is one of the few, if not the only, non-sensationalized books having to do with outlaw motorcycle clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting commentary...","review":"...on days long past. If you're interested in bike culture of the '60s and appreciate good photography, this is for you. The interviews with the subjects of the photos are excellent, too, and really paint a picture of what it was like to ride forty-some years ago, before only baby boomers owned Harleys.Although Danny Lyons is now appreciated as a premier documentary photographer, I enjoyed his writing as much as I did the photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bikeriders","review":"Purchased this book due to its significance in the history of photography.

I really wanted to give books as a party favor and I had a hard time finding something that would appeal to both boys and girls. This book fit the bill perfectly. It's a knights and dragons tale, but it's not violent; on the contrary, it's a very sweet tale. My daughter loved it and I heard positive things from moms after the party too.

This book loves militant leftist/Marxist ideology, has an entire section on Liberation Theology, and overtly criticizes the US while praising socialism/communism. It doesn't mention great Catholic social justice saints like Vincent de Paul, Kolbe, or Francis of Assisi and barely mentions Mother Theresa. It is filled with moral relativism equating the Soviet Unioin to the USA stating directly they both wanted to militarily control the world in the cold war. This book is wrong historically, it fails to promote Catholicism, and is more aligned with the ideology of Reverend Jeremiah Wright than Benedict XVI. Did I mention the book doesn't even mention the Compendium of Catholic Social Justice Teaching? A Catholic school would be negligent to have this book in its curriculum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What Expected!","review":"I received my order today (1/5/12), one day after it was mailed (?)

It is in good condition, but not LIKE NEW. There is underling, cover is curled up, slight liquid damage to pages near the back, and food crumbs between some pages. I only buy a certain type of books.

Mr. Shine bears all - his personal pain, frustrations and annoyances - dealing with the inevitable death of his father and realizing the experience is bringing him close to his brothers once again and the past they share. He indicts the medical community that, he felt, treated his father as a temporary occupant of a hospital bed. Like impatient FAA air traffic controllers, nurses and doctors were unwilling to be inconvenienced by adult children who were reluctant to let the scheduled departure take off on time. A quick and fulfilling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a waste of my time","review":"I read this novel, and I did not like it. It's a story about a rather tiresome Parisian teenager, the daughter of wealthy parents, who spends her time partying it up and spending money. But, despite the fact this young woman has money to burn, all she does is moan and complain and whine about her personal problems. Sorry, I can't feel much sympathy. It gets boring real fast. Hell, the main character is just not very likeable and I found myself thinking, who cares about her problems when the French-born children of African immigrants have it so much worse? Plus, the writing is rather awkward and stilted -- which most probably is the fault of the translator, I'll give Ms. Pille the benefit of the doubt on that score. All in all, this book is a mess, I felt it was a waste of my time, it isn't much of a read. As someone else said about this book, it's a morality tale without a point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"Great read, sharp writing, and I especially admired the translation.

The script is pathetic, the laughs are nonexistent, the music is dreadful, the acting is on the high school level, and the dance numbers are among the worst ever filmed. Moreover, Rochester is the butt of several very crude racial jokes, including a comparison between his dancing and a jumping chimpanzee. This film was made in 1939, that most magic of years in the movie industry. One hopes that someone at Paramount had some shame.

The late Kevin Gilbert does some interesting things with \\"Back in NYC\\", and Robert Berry's revved-up, metallic version of \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" is fairly exciting; otherwise I find little to recommend here. Many of these songs are done by obscure artists who end up sounding like second rate Genesis cover bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time Fan, Thanks B. T.","review":"Love the Persausions totally.

Jenny KNOWS she wants Susan. This is a well-written book about falling in love with oneself and developing a sense of self-understanding.

You know, you've seen all those Pure Trance, and This is Trance, and Trance this and Trance that CD's everywhere. Well, this one sets the standard on what they all should sound like.Superb track selection, lots of long versions of each song, and a well-mixed cd.If you are going to by one \\"commercial cheese\\" trance CD, make it this one and you're done.

While I don't really care for the remixes of \\"Tremble\\", \\"Omnibus\\", or \\"Catch\\", I would say that the majority of these tracks are worth having. DJ Geoffe did an excellent job mixing this album--I like his usage of the phasing/flanging effects. While some of them may be considered \\"cheese trance\\", I really don't see the point of elitist \\"progressive\\" trancers who scoff at the uplifting/hard trance genre. Let the people listen to whatever they feel like. I also enjoy many types of rock music, which always use the same basic instrumentation. I don't complain that they \\"just find new ways to use the same things over and over\\". There are only so many synthesizer settings in the world, you know. If you have a problem with this style, don't listen to it. But don't criticize other people for their tastes. That being said, I will step off the soapbox and suggest that you give this album a second look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD","review":"If you've never heard Trance before, then you need to get this CD.

The information contained in it is very intresting, but not at all useful for improving your game. It is more of an advertisement for the cars in the game than anything else. All of the information contained in the book is in the game itself. For example, car weights, horsepower, and cost. I am very disapointed in the \\"game value\\" of the guide.There are course by course giudes to help you learn each track, but the information is not all that great. The book will for example say that turn 4 is a 75% throttle turn for most cars.There is, however, one good piece of advice in the book. They tell you that the key to a fast lap time is racing your ghost. This is what I have done since the original GT and I have found it to be the best way to improve. A level 4 turbo will not increase your lap times unless you can keep the car on the track.Forget the guide, save your $ to pay for part of another game instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"be a better race driver","review":"This book is a must have for anyone new to Gran Turismo, for al those who played any of its predecessor this is a chance to learn about the new cars and tracks.

NOT ME!","review":"The local Best Buy has a ton of copies of this album in stock. That must mean it's going to be flavor? Naah, probably just means they are popular and gets tons of airplay. Oddly enough, it's none of the above. I still have no idea who these kids are, which one is which any ways? I know by the album cover that one is Asian, I'm not into stereo-typing, and I don't know who is who, they both are avarage, and that's not good. It's a shame he is repping for the Asians, Key Kool, Mountian Bros & even Jin do a much better job. This album isn't complete trash, but it has nothing that stands out. And it has nothing that compel music fans to buy it. Even the ones with Master P standards. They could improve with time, but something tells me that time won't be too friendly to them, and this is going to be their one moment.The first single is \\"Who Want's This\\"Never ask a question you don't want the answer too.

Can somebody tell me where in the blue hell these guys came from? This album was pretty wack, and their hit-single, \\"Who Wants This?\\" isn't very impressive either. The production was sub-par and the quality of their lyrical flow-tations isn't very good either. These guys constantly rhyme throughout their record 'Crash the Party' about how good they can flow, yet, ANYBODY can rhyme when they write it down on a piece of paper. I'd LOVE to see these guys try and spit poetry on an open mic and really see how much fire they got in their artillery. Until then, I can think nothing more of them other than them being just another pointless duo who can do nothing spectacular for hip-hop. As far as the album goes, the only joint I can recommend is \\"Lets Get Naked,\\" but even that cut is barely decent. Expect Smilez and Southstar to disappear from the scene very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Hatin","review":"I think this album is pretty good. You all are forgetting this is a debut from S&S these folks are new in the game so quit comparing them to Jay-Z and Nas. I think every track is banging and this is an album you just let play instead of skipping around from track to track. Eneyone who says the production is wack needs a brain implant. The track \\"who wants this\\" has nice production and good lyrics, the only flaw is maybe a weak hook.The new song \\"Tell Me\\" is banging the lyrics are on point and the beat is banging. As far as one of them being Asian that doesn't affect me because I dont buy albums depending on the race of the rapper, I buy what is tight,so instead of analyzing everything put the cd in ya player and bob ya head,COP THIS JOINT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"these brothaz is cold blooded","review":"First of all, smilez and southstar are very talented. Nothing in their lyrics were whack, or nothin' like that.

Dick Dale was never a singer and those cuts that he does attempt it he usually fails. But hey, thats what makes him great. The instrumentals are absolutely incredible and \\"Pipeline\\" is over the top! I saw him in concert in 1960's in LA and have seen him many times since and he is the greatest in person. He can \\"play the guitar just like ringing a bell\\", to quote Chuck Berry. Buy the CD and then find him on tour, you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The King of Surf Guitar kicks it off!!","review":"In my opinion, this is the best compilation of the King's pickin'. While his earlier releases touch upon his style, grace and energy, this box set encompasses ALL of his talents. He can write great songs. He plays his heart out. And he maintains a sense of the \\"fun\\" that is surf music. With each track on this set, I came to the realization that not only can Dick Dale play the guitar, but that he also has a great (stage) presence. And he has not gotten 'old' like some of the other early '60s instrumentalists.

It is a rare day that I have to force myself to finish a book, but this one was tough due to the lackluster writing style, lack of thought provoking material, and lack of unique concepts.

The ONLY good point I can think of is that you get to hear Rob talk a little. But even that can't get me to recommend wasting money on this cd.

None of these dudes on the record can pull off any of these songs. The purpose of the record is to sucker-punch any die hard Rush fan into buying it because it's Rush. Here is the test, listen to the sample of Track #6 \\"Mission - Eric Martin\\". If you like it, then might as well get it. If you don't, not to worry because it doesn't get any better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad example of a \\"tribute\\" album!","review":"Obviously the musicians playing on this album had nothing better to do than trying to duplicate Rush's songs. This is exactly how a tribute album should not be like, but it's the same problem with nearly any other album of this kind. O.K., the musicians are talented, so why didn't they try to bring some new interpretations? Plus, I have a very own problem with this record:I my opinion Rush were so successful and enjoyable, because they always added great pop melodies to their sound. But this tribute album offers a harder rocking sound, and Rush's fine songs are demoted to dull and cliched heavy rock tunes. This album may be of interest for hardcore Rush fans, for the rest of the world it's not worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"If anything, a lot of fun.","review":"I am one of those Rush purist guys. That said, this is probably the best a Rush tribute will ever get. Yes, the songs aren't performed quite to the level of the originals, but duplication really wasn't the point of the album (if you want the originals, buy the original albums). To me, the point is obvious: this is a bunch of huge Rush fans who wanted to have a lot of fun playing Rush tunes, and it shows. If anything, Steve Morse's playing on La Villa Strangiato is worth the $15 on its own. Well done all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great new way to listen to RUSH","review":"For all real rush fans who have been listening to these songs for the last 10/20 years and constantly waiting for new albums - this is a must.To hear some of the classic songs done in a new way, but not an all together different way, is great to listen to.These obviously do not measure up to the originals, but who could, however they are musically and technically brilliant - I haven't stopped playing it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"It would appear that there are quite a few musicians out there who desperately need work. This album really isn't more than a showcase for Magna Carta, in hopes to attract new people to there line up of progressive bands or their numerous tribute CDs (it would appear that is all they can produce). As for the musicians and there musical prowess... Well, it is self-gratifying and over indulgent. It is one thing to show talent, it is another to do this. I'd call this project similar to physical self-gratification: nothing that benefits anyone other than the person doing it.Let me put a finer point on this. The musicians are not making a tribute to the band Rush so much as they are using another's creative output to further their own career.I grieve for anyone who buys this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Rush--So get over it!","review":"I can't believe the reviewers are judging the disc as if it were a bad recording by Rush.

I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Dirt","review":"Why would someone try to duplicate something pretty much the same way that it was done by the original artist?

If you're a real rush fan, go buy a gold edition CD or one of the live CDs, because this album is a SAD tribute to RUSH; it sucks...BAD. I am a long time RUSH fan, and I can tell you, these people should have never made a RUSH tribute album. They tried too hard and skipped all the difficult and complex pieces. It's like Rutsey decided to redo all the drum tracks that Neil so carefully crafted. The singing is incredibly horrible. Just listen to the audio clips! Just make sure you're near a toilet... This CD is AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so close to the heart.","review":"Artists with floundering careers and overactive egos are not a fitting tribute to the magical chemistry of Rush.

Why would anyone in their right mind think this is a christain book? Let me tell you folks, anyone who spends his life's work on a book about hatred of everyone who is from another culture is just REALLY STUPID!!! This book has absolutely nothing to do with Jesus or REAL CHRISTIANITY. Jesus was a great man, and I believe, the son of God. But I don't try to belittle anyone who is a thinking person with an actual brain. God created EVERYTHING, except IGNORANCE. If you want a Christain perspective? Read the Bible!

However, the entire pretext of the book is - \\"If you don't believe how I believe, you are wrong and/or misled.\\" I can't agree with this. There are other religions and beliefs that are certainly beneficial and valid. Larson's overzealous persecution of other religions causes his beliefs and words to lose their power."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very biased book","review":"I don't understand how Larson does his research. The book is so full of inaccuracies, that they can easily be refuted. Apparently anyone that disagrees with the christian world view is on the side of the devil. In his book he critiques Hinduism, Buddhism, the martial arts, hypnosis and anything else as inspired by the devil. If he took the time to read accurate books on Hinduism, Buddhism and the subjects he argues against he would see that his arguments are full of holes. Most of his arguments are based on ignorance, half truths and distortions. For example Nirvana is claimed to be the state of annihilation. But any Buddhist worth his salt knows that Nirvana is actually the state of Godhead. Buddha claimed to be all knowing. Buddha is indescribable. Buddhist writings have many references to Buddha being omniscient and omnipotent. But nowhere is this mentioned in his book.

He likes to take a superfical view of other religions besides his own. If one has to look at something like cults and religion, one must take an objective approach to the situation. His approach is: if it's not Christian, it is evil. He has many inaccurate information in his book. First of all, the Shiva lingam is NOT PHALLIC! It represents the pillar of light and knowledge to the Hindus. Also, \\"man\\" is not helpless under the reincarnation cycle, \\"man\\" works for \\"himself\\" to acheive that good judgement from God.

I have studied the world religions and the occult for over 15 years. I am a protestant exorcist, so these studies are relevant to my field. I do not disagree with Mr. Larson's christianity, however I do disagree with misrepresenting the doctrines of other religions. As a christian myself, my integrity will not allow me to give a false testimony against another. Some of the information that this book lists as the belief and practice of these religions is highly inaccurate (I hope not purposely misleading). I have unfortunately found this to be true of some of his other work as well. I do not recommend this book. I recommend a strong knowledge of the Bible combined with historical studies of the faiths in question, if you wish to gain an accurate knowledge of the comparative differences between christianity and the world religions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larson smears the great religions of the world","review":"It's obvious that Larson has never met or corresponded with many adherents of the religions he trashes.

They sound like an endless re-tread of a thousand bands before them; no uplifing 'spirit', no inspiration of any kind. After 10 minutes have passed it's time to put in another CD.

This CD is a must for anyone who enjoys great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must buy !","review":"I recently met Sam at a ski trip from our church in Memphis and I bought his cd \\"Beg the Sky\\" and I love it! My favorite songs are Sunflower Land and Ten Times Stronger, which make very good motivational songs for anybody in a period of crisis; be it small or large."},{"rating":"2","title":"rare discovery!","review":"Rare is the discovery of such a gifted, intelligent, and soulful musician and songwriter. Beg the Sky is so obviously the creation of one who has LIVED rather than just experienced this life. Sam Hensley blends the notes of personal experience (pain, love, wonder, hope...) to orchestrate chords of universal understanding and faithful longing for a world which lies ahead- in dreams and in reality.I discovered this artist/album just this week and am already sending recommendations and records to those who appreciate and cherish such musicianship and art. Hard pressed would you be to find a finer addition to your music library than Beg the Sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam's music will touch everyone's heart","review":"I have been following Sam Hensley for years and have been anxiously awaiting the release of his first album. \\"Beg the Sky\\" is worth the wait! Sam's songs range from the thoughtful and touching \\"Two Friends\\" to the upbeat and motivating \\"Sunflower Land\\". Sam is always amazing in concert, and this CD brings the best of his concerts and his friends together. All of the songs will leave you singing, smiling, and, most of all, thinking, for a long time to come. I loved it.

For the most part, the album catches the spirit of Tull, and no wonder, as there are four former members of the band guesting here. Not a single note for note renditon, and each song is lovingly reworked in the idiom of the guest artist while keeping the flavor of the composition.Musically, the playing is inspired and no quibles to the musicianship. My only quibble is with Glen Hughes singing on \\"To Cry You a Song.\\" The producers needed to get at least one more take, IMO.Highlights are Aqualung, Up the 'Pool, Teacher, and Lifes a Long Song.Liner notes are thorough and interesting anecdotes are given as to the person's exposure to Tull and/or Ian Anderson.If you like Tull and are open minded, you will enjoy this disc as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine tribute","review":"There are numerous standouts on this album, but my favorite is \\"Aqualung\\".

No wonder I missed this one when it first came out (I only got tippped off to it while revisiting the early prog rock bands of the 70's with a friend who has a more extensive overview of this camp of musicians).

It is nice to remember the times when rappers were just hanging out, making fun rhymes and trying to top eachother. \\"Can You Feel It\\" is one of the best tracks hip-hop has ever produced. The deceased Darren Robinson (Human Beat Box) livens up every track with his unique style, and Mark Morales (Prince Markie Dee) and Damon Wimbley (Kool Rockski) are lyricists that never really got their due. Don't be fooled by \\"Wipe Out\\" and \\"Twist\\", these were exceptions to the Fat Boys rule. I highly recommend the album to anybody who jammed to them in the 80s or to people tired of the current tired rap scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Quiet","review":"I'd give this 5 stars; but since it didn't include any storage for the accessories (either wall mount or on the unit iteself) I'm going to give it a 4.

If this is supposed to cover everything about kayaking, it's interesting that they advertise a whole series of DVDs on aspects of kayaking at the end.

I turned instead to Everyday Life in the United States before the Civil War 1830-1860. Of course it is also a summary, but it covers a much more specific time frame. Mr. McCutcheon's book left me frustrated and asking, \\"What part of the 1800s? What part of the United States?\\". He does provide some dates, some regional differences, but too few.

Eventually the digital disply completely went blank.I feel like I got burned.

The PR-D2 does an admirable job of receiving all the FM stations in this area that are possible to receive. The sound is quite good for a relatively small radio. Very clear and well balanced. A little more bass response would be nice but not required. The appearance is very nice. Kind of an Art Deco look that would fit in with a Poirot set very nicely.

I listen to Korn, Pantera and other metal bands. But I must say I bought this cd A Blueprint Of The World and its got to be the best thing I've heard in soo long. The Thirst and Oasis are my favorites. This band's music is played so well and mixed so beautifully with the vocals, keyboards, guitars, bass, and drums mixed in just right to get the full effect. The singer's voice is awesome and the guitar is crisp. The drum beats are excellent. I really think this band has something really magical going on here and if they could here me I'm just saying for them to just keep on what their doing because its really an influence on me and from what I've heard alot of other people too.

This band has a talent level that in my opinion is no less that Dream Theater, Fates Warning, Rush and other great bands in the progressive rock genre. The only thing I can see about this CD that could be considered negative is that the melodies had already been written when Ted Leonard joined the band, which did not appear to give him the opportunity to display his excellent range and the emotion he contributes in their other CD's. Like all Enchant releases, the more you listen, the more you'll appreciate what this band has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT...","review":"If you like bands like rush, dream theter or marillion, you should check this...

Product WAS for mini fuses (not ATO!) as other reviewers indicated. I did not get a fuse removal tool (the white thing in the image) and used a pair of needlenose pliers instead to remove the existing fuse. Fit for fuses is tight (take time & care), but the product works great. Used to install a radar detector.Easy to remove and easy to install - very much worth the price. In fact, a relative helped me install a radar detector power cord, and he liked the solution so much he just purchased four - he only needs one in the short term, but likes the solution so much he wants to have spares on hand. This individual has installed many aftermarket electronics in his car, so I think it speaks to the ease of use/installation of the product versus other solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little gate - but a little narrow","review":"Good quality and works well with all the other fencing. The only problem I encountered was that the sidewalk is wider than the gate. Not a huge problem, I just cut the connecting ends off one fence section and use that for one side of the gate.

The rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners. Also, there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips. The sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don't have it fully zipped up. My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that I think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heartfelt journey that makes you look deep inside yourself","review":"The tragedy that surrounded Kerry O'Neill's death was one that shocked not only her family, friends and shipmates, but also the nation. I remember, because I was one of Kerry's shipmates at Annapolis.This book not only takes you through a father's painful challenges of coping with the loss of a daughter, but through the memories of that daughter. Kerry was a blazing light with incredible potential, tragically snuffed out.I highly recommend reading this book. It will fill you with sorrow, but it will also show you a glimpse of a woman who was loved by all who knew her. It will show you how the memories and her spirit renewed her father's faith.Most of all, however, it will make you look at yourself, at what you have done in life, and make you reach for a higher goal.

One every time Patterson is quoted we get a Gitomer quote which often is totally off-base. This is a minor quibble. The major problem with the book is that it assumes you have a customer base from which to start.

This is a shoegaze masterpiece plain and simple. The album cover is just silver, and the music inside is dark and brooding; leading the listener on a space fueled guitar droning journey. This is how music was meant to be, it sucks you in, and before you know it; it's all over. Jason Martin's vocals are hushed and it provides the perfect compliment to the wall of guitar sound found throughout the album. I like the song \\"Sled\\", but really you can't go wrong with any of them. If your heartbroken or just want to hear some real talent give Starflyer a try.

I have very few words that can do justice to describe how good the entire album is, but if you listen to the album from beginning to end, you can't help but to be wrapped up in the high-emotions of the album. On this album, Martin takes heavy distortion and combines it with soft melody in beautifully woven hooks that will leave you begging for more of Starflyer's innovative harmony. Martin's lyrics may be light and wispy, but they provide the perfect backdrop for what really takes center stage on this album and sets it apart from others; the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb Lou Rawls collection that could have been better.","review":"This is undoubtedly a superb compilation of Lou Rawls' most romantic recordings for the Philadelphia International and Blue Note Records.

We're still waiting for your video!","review":"I have Brooke Siler's original book (March 2000). It is still the best book on Pilates method out there, but however good it is - we all know - nothing, but nothing beats a lesson on video. That is why The Pilates Body Kit is such a let down. One would think that in the past three years Ms. Siler was working on a companion video to her popular book. Why the author chose to produce this kit with cards and audio cds is very perplexing, considering the there are so many Pilates method videos out there (good and not so good). Ms. Siler has missed her chance to produce a superior one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The two cd's that come with this are strictly audio ( I was hoping for visual examples of the movements.) You hear a female voice basically walking you through each movement. Really redundent since the cards cover the same material. The flash cards are alright, but really don't show you very many different exercises. The workbook is basically a blank book for you to record your workout progress. Pilates in nothing more than hyped up callistenics/gymnastic/yoga/isometric/stretching moves, which if done religiously will tone the body, but most of the exercises are ones I have alreay seen and done reading other basic exercise books. If you think this is going to do more for you than any other exercise program, stop dreaming and just get to work with what you already know and save your money, wish I had. This product is nice packaging and slick marketing but nothing more. Pilates for Dummies which I bought with this order will be the product I use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for those who are not always in front of a DVD","review":"I bought Brook's original book and found it well rounded. This CD set with accompanying flash cards accompanies that book well. I have taken a pilates class and found the instructor, although certified, lacked an effective teaching technique and sometimes changed the movements to her own adaptation, plus the instructor never provided a backgrounder on the technique. Let's just say I was missing the big picture. Brook's materials let me follow the true technique. Now I can do my pilates exercises at lunch in the gym without paying large fees to off-target instructors. This CD set is not for those of you who require a constant visual demonstration of the moves. This is for those who are interested in doing the exercises and knowing the moves without a DVD prompt."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, Can't Recommend it Enough!","review":"I bought Pilates Body a couple of years ago and dug it out recently. It was fantastic for what it was, but it was a little difficult to drag it to the gym and hold my pages while I attemped a pose. The Pilates Body Kit was the perfect solution. Now I just take the few cards of the poses I am learning and the CD that has the class I want to do. I study the flash card before I begin and then lay them to the side. The audio format allows me to focus on my positioning and pace instead of holding a page or craning my neck to see how something's done. I was making steady improvement with her book but since I've gotten my Body Kit, my pilates practice has really taken off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash Cards are Worth the Purchase","review":"This is an excellent item for someone starting out in Pilates. The Flash Cards give you an excellent opportunity to do a program at your own pace.I do not feel the CD's are really a great asset to the program but as in my title the Flash Cards along are worth the purchase. You will learn the basics and some good intermediate programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS a good buy","review":"As a Pilates student for the past two years, I find this kit really helpful. I take both mat and apparatus classes and the flash cards are really helpful for me when I'm practicing at home. I'm not sure sure I'd recommend these to an absolute beginner, but if you don't live near some guild certified instructors, I'd say both Brooke Siler's book and this set would be steps in the right direction.Her direction on breathing and the drawings on the cards are great diagrams for those needing visual information because form is really important in Pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO BAD","review":"AD SAY NOTHING ABOUT FOR USE IN AUTO.

For you fans, I think you won't find any meat to sink your teeth in Another Man's Posion.

She's having it off with her secretary's boyfriend (who's much younger) and thinks she's pulled off the perfect crime (she's a mystery writer) until a former partner of the husband's shows up. He offers to cover for her but things get ridiculously out of hand and he kills her prize horse. This is not good. Then begins a game of wills that ends most ironically as Davis falls prey to her own schemes. She hams it up in this one and leaves no co-star unscathed. Murky b&w photography doesn't help either. It's slow and very stagy throughout. Her then husband Gary Merrill plays the partner and even he seems at a loss over how to cope with the script. If a Davis film can be called a total waste then this is it. Even she can't save it from sinking into tedious boredom. Stick with her other films instead and forget this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"I collect Bette Davis movies and this is one of my favorites.

Where this becomes a critical flaw is where the velcro straps attach. There is no reinforcement in this area. As you can see from the photo I will upload, after just a few months of use in the relatively benign winter weather in the PNW (rain but almost no freezing or snow), the seams have come apart where the straps attach to the vinyl cover. This has happened on both sides where there are straps. I do not over tighten the straps, this coming apart has occurred through normal application of the straps. This cover wasn't cheap, and I expected it to last at least a few seasons. If you still decide to buy this, I recommend not using the straps at all, however the cover will not fit as well and will blow around, which will likely cause seam damage elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be glad you got it","review":"The velcro straps on each side keep the cover in place even in high winds.

(well, they are all one word) people must learn to have a better taste in music. granted there is at least one good song. a few others are decent, but only because there are no vocals. if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years, you have heard pulse ultra. my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said \\"thats enough\\". do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD cd. when will people learn!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about bitter","review":"Whoa. Andrew Kazdin's book gives a nice window into Gould's studio methods -- the sometimes devious, always crafty way of manipulating sounds to create the perfect studio product -- and his personality. The book is hurt tremendously, though, by the extreme bitterness of the author. Kazdin (Gould's recording producer for CBS) claims to have been wronged by the pianist in business matters. This could have been an excellent book about a pioneer of music and audio engineering, but instead it is ruined by personal squabbles involving the author. For a third person account of Gould's life, I recommend Otto Friedrich's biography. For an account of his music, try Payzant's book _Glenn Gould, Music and Mind_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yup, it's bitter...","review":"I think this book told me as much about Andrew Kazdin as it did about Glenn Gould. I recently read an article about Andrew Kazdin's technique in the recording studio. He likes to have control. But you see, so did Glenn Gould... I'm astounded that Kazdin and Gould were able to work together for as many years as they did. And they did do great work together during those years.Still, go ahead and read this book, if you have a chance, because it does have a lot of details and insight into Glenn Gould in the recording studio. You must take some of Andrew Kazdin's assertions with a grain of salt, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Andrew K. autobiography","review":"I read this book long time ago and still have this bad aftertaste in my mouth - the story of this producer writing about his experience, this \\"poor\\" man kept at an arms length by Glenn Glould - bitching about it over and over again! Mr. Kazdin - you have bad taste. You were hired to do a job - no more, no less! What a pity Gould did not have anybody more giving during this (for him difficult)period - immagine what type of recordings the world might have experienced!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to disprove evolution","review":"I have read a heck of a lot of the works of Ron Rhodes, especially his Mormon material. As with his treatment of Mormonism, his approach to Evolution is riddled with logical fallacies, such as his fraudulent discussion of the 2nd law of Therodynamics and Maco Evolution, as well as his fudging when it comes to a 6,000 year-old earth and a global flood - just where is the evidence for these and other occurances, apart from circukar reasoning? Also, he ignores the impossibility of a literal approach to Genesis when it comes to the Tower of Babel, by not even attempting to defend this incident and the ultra-literalist apprach he and other creationists have.This book is nothing more than card-stacking and is only for the gullible or already converted. No individual well-versed in evolution would buy any of the non-sensical assertions Rhodes makes in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween Fun!!!","review":"This fun Halloween book is perfect for this time of year.

He read it with gusto, emphasizing each \\"Boooooo\\" but overall found it a bit boring and not at all \\"hilarious\\" (unlike Dragon's Halloween by Dav Pilkey which had us both smiling from beginning to end). The repetitiveness of the repeated rhyming patterns was dull for a big kid (3rd grade) and the creatures too spooky for my younger daughter (1st grade) who is not into ghoulies at all. The \\"mad doctor\\" brought back some memories of lost hours I'd like to recover while watching Stephen King's \\"Kingdom Hospital\\" but other than that I found it pretty blah as well.

It is bad enough to include characters like the mad evil doctor, mummy, werewolf, vampire and witch but the author finishes the book by threatening the children with \\"we'll find your house (we know the street)\\". Our children do not need adult-like fears! I strongly encourage you to pass up this book and never look back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fright Night Flight","review":"Ages 4-8...Ridiculous! \\"house of dread owned by folks who once were dead\\". A vampire, werewolf, mummy, mad evil doctor etc that \\"we'll find your house (we know the street)\\". These are such inappropriate characters for small children. There is an attempt to disguise or minimize them with some rhymes to make it palatable. This is told in such a way that my 5 year old looked with wide eyed fear. These are characters known at Halloween and marketed for older adolescents and adults. Just because they are coupled with rhyming and silly-looking drawings does not make them appropriate for this age group. If your child has ever faced worrying about monsters under the bed or strange sounds in the night, this book will serve to reinforce those fears, not make them laughable and discountable. I would highly discourage the this book for anyone under 10 year and by then, the rhyming will seem trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing...","review":"I hate to be the negative one here, but this CD in my opinion just doesn't do it for me. I have seen Mr. Paul in concert at least 20 times over the years and while the performances on this CD are good, to me it just doesn't work. Personally, I feel that the most dissapointing aspect of this album are the new tunes. Why? Because it is Ellis continuing to be Ellis. He isn't changing anything at all. I'm tired of hearing about sidewalks and angels and all that other urban folksong stuff. The music is getting uninspired and frankly, just boring. He is regurgitating the same thing we have heard for years. Look at Dylan and Tom Waits, two often cited Ellis Paul influences. What makes them so great is that they change it up and push the boundaries of their music. Ellis has yet to do that. He has the potential to be brilliant, but still has a way to go.

They're darkly funny, something I understood as a child. I think that's fine: like classic fairy tales, Belloc's verses play with the dangers of childhood, dangers children intutively understand. Whenever I run across a copy of this book, usually in its 1970s turquoise cloth, I snatch it up to give to elect children or asute peers.For me, Belloc's verses provided a playful connection to late-Victoriana and my own Grandmother's childhood. I think it's a shame they're no longer in print. Belloc is like a more humane Ogden Nash-- his verse is clever, but he lack's Nash's smugness and the oftentimes mechanical composition.

It contains mono versions of the tracks, so if you need those - great. If not, the alternate takes aren't much more interesting than what exists on the first edition.Now here's the bad part. Rhino was very sloppy in assembling the bonus tracks. In a few cases, bits of one track flow over onto another track number.

The music didn't suck like Stryper or Guardian, and the message was relevant then and still matters today. They have a heaviness and intensity equal to anything in the late 80's punk/thrash scene. The music is very fast but also brilliant in it's composition.

To get the full effect you can go to Starfall.com and have your child watch this. If they like it then you will know that these videos are appropriate.

The movie, despite most likely not having a low budget, came off as a very low budget film. The acting certainly wasn't marquee, as I felt most of the cast came off as very amateurish.This movie was a complete abomination of what could have been a dynamic movie.

She's got a cute face, fresh new bubbly songs and a colorful image. The music on this CD ranges from partially unique to partially bland, with nothing in between. All in all, it's not a bad CD...but it's not a great CD either. The songs have a Hispanic flavor to them, not unlike the ones of Myra's first CD. The best tracks are probably \\"I Think I Love You\\" and \\"Butterflies Don't Lie\\". If you're into spiritual music you may enjoy \\"Intervention Divine\\".Songs like \\"Kiss Me Crazy\\" and \\"Beggin' Me\\" have hooks so repetative they get annoying. Still, \\"Kiss Me Crazy\\" has a sweet vibe to it that makes it likeable.For a young girl, Kaci also seems to know a lot about relationships...that's mostly what she covers on this CD.

Anyway, It is as impressive as it would have been then. With tinges of rnb (all over you), pop (Im not anybodys girl) and rock (Intervention divine) This is a spectacular treat for your brother, your sister or your best mate. It really is a cd to suite quite a wide age range, though aimed at teens. The Highs have to be Beggin' me and Kiss me crazy. With there britney-esque beats and and there original pop and rock flavours, they are bound to have you bouncin round the house. Very catchy, very good vocals - This is Kaci!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For a young little one.....","review":"Maybe not a Christina Aguilera voice or not a Mandy Moore but overall this artist has major potential. I came across her first looking for mp3s on the net. She was still strictly UK at the time but her single \\"Paradise\\" was similar in sound to major pop artists today but with a unique sound on most of her songs. Yes like all artists she has her songs that conform to the crowd but with a very versatile voice and talent she opens up a realm of possibilties for the future in the US. About 20 percent of the cd can be compared to the ever-so-annoying Britney but the rest of the cd is a class all of its own. I would almost say with some better advertising she could be another Mandy or better. Expect good things from this artist in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...it's better than some Disney...","review":"One thing for sure is that she definitly has more singing ability and talent than hilary duff, which isn't really saying much actually.

I have fished northerns extensively with a great variation of methods. I have a few suggestions for the next book. I think that the book didn't pay enough attention to live bait fishing. I believe that live bait needs to be covered more. I was particularly glad to see the dead bait section and all of the rigs for using both live and dead bait. (I always thought that it was interesting how a pike would hit a chub long after it died.) A second thing that I believe would further enhance the completeness of the book is to inform the readers how to catch how to catch monster pike in the canadian north during the SUMMER and not just the spring. I have found that during this period fishing techniques differ greatly. Other than that I found the book to be an exellent resource and tool to use both as a beginner and an advanced fisherman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only problem: It is 30 years old","review":"This is a great book, but it is slightly in need of an updated 2nd edition. I haven't seen a book that does a better job of explaining the life cycle of northerns.But we (including the authors of the book) know more about the fish now than we did in 1983, and available technology and gear has changed too.I would be first in line for an updated edition of this book. That said, it is the best book on pike if you like to think like a biologist when fishing.If you are interested in river or shore fishing, you'll be left wanting more, but this is a small group of pike fisherman in North America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, and learned a lot in the mean time. This book does an excellent job of first presenting the tendencies of northern pike, how bodies of water change during the year and how northern pike relate to the changes.

I think this book is a great place to start if your looking to get into pike fishing, and is also great for the seasoned angler looking for some new tricks, or a better understanding of the nature of northern pike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing speakers for the price","review":"I recently purchased a 2006 Mazda MX-5 that had some aftermarket Rockford Fosgate speakers.

They fit right in---no adjustments needed. it was just a matter of splicing and crimping the old wire to the new speaker wire. My only regret is that I didn't get a pair for the back seat.

This is the final collection of Breathed's strips, with some older ones and the stories about them. Most of the time that sort of thing tends to be pretty boring but in this case they are actually the highlight of the book (be sure not to miss the one about the time President Reagan called while he (Breathed) was in the shower.)

There is so much subtle hummor that sometimes I do miss it at first. Most of the comics are from the Outland strips which I never saw in any of the newspapers in my area. My favorite character is Opus followed by Bill the Cat. I won't spoil it for anyone that's considering buying this book by telling about any of the strips in detail but I think that if you are a Bloom County fan or an Opus fan(a Sunday strip that I had in one of the papers in my area) then I think that you'll love this book of comics. \\"Try it, you'll like it!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original battery - Be careful","review":"I bought the N-Gage Lithium-Ion battery a few weeks ago, and my old battery keeps more charge than the one this seller had sent.

Anyway, what you have here is the original LP plus a wealth of outtakes/alternate takes. The outtakes which are mostly vocal/guitar demos, put you in the mind of the many home recordings that Hank, Sr. performed-simple, laidback. If you own the original LP, buy this as there is a much better sound quality (even though first generation masters couldn't be found) plus the many outtakes. Kudos to RHINO for releasing this on CD. Maybe we can get \\"Songs My Father Left Me\\" released on CD next!My e-mail:rgreagan53@go.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality...","review":"The quality is surprisingly really good and there are great (unique) covers of songs by Hank Williams Jr. like \\"I'm so lonesome I could cry,\\" \\"I saw the light,\\" and \\"Jambalaya (on the bayou).\\" Those most of these songs are done very much in a \\"1960's style\\" of country, but still very good and worth buying.

In the hands of a more skilled author, this could have been an excellent book. Unfortunately, the author ruined this book with 'secrets', forced seductions, and cliches. First, Skylar's secret was really lame. It was never believable that she didn't confess all as she grew to know Hawk. Second, I like a forced seduction as much as the next romance reader, but the ones in here were really lame. It was difficult to believe that there was any attraction between the characters at all. Third, Skylar was a really dumb heroine. Why can't this author create a heroine who can get herself out of trouble instead of relying on the hero to do it for her? Just pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"\\"No Other Man\\" was the first in the series and the best. If you like alpha males, then this book is for you.

I am a biochemistry major, but have a profound love of reading and writing. When I had to write a paper on this novel last year, i found the maximum of 10 pages stifling. There is just so much to this book, the literally angles and interwoven humanity through each masterfully-crafted tale contained within it, leaves one open to a vast sea of topics on which to write. I hope to one day teach a class which intertwines literature and science, this will certainly be a book on the list.

This book does not give a very realistic perspective on the wholeadoption scean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A humorous tongue in cheek romantic comedy","review":"Cave Girl is a humorous tongue in cheek romantic comedy that follows the romantic relationship of bumbling modern day Rex and beautiful and sexy pre-historic cave girl Eba. The movie follows the bumbling Rex through a series of slapstick pranks and mishaps that culminate in his transport 25,000 years back in time to meet and fall in love with the beautiful Eba. And, along the way, Rex becomes a man that saves Eba and the rest of the local clan from cannibals. Eventually, though, Rex and Eba must face reality. Will Rex return to his own time, where Eba cannot possible fit in, or will he stay and build a life with Eba and the rest of the tribe. This movie is a humorous, and at times poignant, look at the trials, tribulations, opportunities and decisions that young people often face as they come of age. Well worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-","review":"The IMDB site currently shows a rating of '3.1' for this film, which is about what it deserves. The only value I could find was in Cynthia Thompson as the cave girl, Eba. Her raw beauty and innocence reminds me of the lead girl in other, far better films, such as One Million years B.C. and The Time Machine (1960). I mean really, there's nothing to like about the protagonist. With that ridiculous hat and tie, he's like a big doofus version of a young Indiana Jones, trying to act as if he's in a ROTN film. I'm not saying I don't like this film, just that it doesn't offer much in terms of the main character or story, when compared with other B-level movies. I'll probably hang onto it, for the sake of it's 80's appeal and for Cynthia, but I was really hoping for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 10 minutes - find another","review":"Once you get past the girl's locker room scene - which works good in slow motion - find another movie to watch.

The small size of the book makes it easy to keep on you at all times while the extremely detailed content will provide you with the information you need to perform any possible processing on your database.By making use of the information presented in this book you will hopefully be able to extract data preconverted into the format you require instead of having to reformat it after extraction. You will be able to fine tune your code to minimize the need for substantial processing in the calling program. You will be able to harness the full power of mySQL. An ideal reference resource. Unfortunately it doesn't cover all the functions available for converting your data and so in some cases there will be an easier way to set up the call than the functions that the book does list suggests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had my introduction to Chadwick through the Jarvi disk of the 2nd and 3rd symphonies, which I thought fantastic, especially the third. Next to that, I found this music disappointing. It reminded me of warmed-over Victor Herbert band music (with whom Chadwick is largely contemporaneous). Now I have to decide whether I want to continue and buy the Symphonic Sketches. Perhaps, if one day I have $14 burning a hole in my pocket, I'll risk it. I do heartily recommend the symphonies, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well done documentary on China and Indian Railways","review":"This is a very well done production on an very interesting topic. The editing and video qualities are superb along with the selection of contents. For rail buffs, steam fans and people who are interested in Chinese and Indian cultures, this tape covers all those territories. Eventhough the tape is not catered towards the most mechanically oriented rail buffs, it still presented present day China Rail and Indian Railway in a concise and interesting fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly engrossing and entertaining!","review":"Empires of Steam focusses on the beauty, power and mystery of steam trains with an underlying storyline that encompasses the global transformation of the industrial age to the new information age.

With beautiful color illustrations on every page, you can really begin to understand what these people and their surroundings looked like and what they believed in. Even though I rated this book 5 stars, because of the wonderful artwork and descriptive words, this book was very short. I'm in the 7th Grade, and it only took me 10 minutes to finish, so I recommend just reading it in your library or bookstore rather than buying it outright. All in all, 'Cat Mummies' was very informative, though it could have been just a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"King successfully jumps genres.","review":"Like the short story \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\\" Dolores Claiborne is more of a character piece than a horror novel. It invites us to get to know the titular character and her strange and interesting life. For fans of King's horror, this may be disappointing, but it still makes for an engrossing read.King being King, after all, the book can't be all rural Maine slice-o-life. It centers around Dolores' confession of a murder she may or may not have comitted, and around a day when a solar eclipse gave her a glimpse of someone else's life (mirroring a similar scene in Gerald's Game). Though the story is told in flashback, King creates admirable suspense.Above all, though, read this for Dolores' point-of-view narration. It's not Pet Sematary, but it's a heck of a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, off-genre plotline. One of his best.","review":"One of the last decent books published by King, it makes me believe that perhaps King has misplaced the bulk of his efforts by writing horror. Unlike _Gerald's_Game_, it accurately captures the unhealthy attitudes America has (used to have) regarding women, and the nature of strong women who manage to overcome those prejudices. To quote from the book, \\"Sometimes you have to be a high riding bitch. Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman's got.\\" Astonishingly well-written, King even manages to overcome my personal pet peeve regarding his writing, and ends the story exactly where it needs to be ended and not a page later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"I really enjoyed this story. The only thing is i wish that i had read the book before i saw the movie because all i kept picturing Delores as is Kathy Bates (eventho that added to my humor when i was reading about her) i only wonder how i would've pictured her if i didn't know that she played her in the movie. Oh well, it was still a great book and i recommend it to any Stephen King fan (as i am)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different than all other King's writings","review":"I loved the movie very much hence I read the book. There are differences but both are outstanding. This is very different than all other Stephen King's books. It is not horror. More of drama but very well written and you would dive deep into the book and with the character Dolores. Great reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good - Ties with \\"Gerald's Game\\"","review":"If you read this one I would suggest reading \\"Gerald's Game\\" as well. They have a tiny little tie-in that is neat if you have read the other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe now they'll take him seriously...","review":"With this novel Stephen King proves once and for all that horror is not the only thing he can write. There is not a hint of monsters or the supernatural here; what you have is a brilliant, moving, and suspenseful tale of the explosive things that can happen in families when love turns sour. This riveting novel should show everybody who thinks of Stephen King solely as a \\"horror writer\\" that the man is simply an excellent writer whatever his subject matter may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping...","review":"Well, to put it short: I liked this novel a lot! It's sometimes creepy, sometimes sad, sometimes funny but most of all it's just pure genious! As far as I'm concerned this is definitely one of his better novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Keep King's New Fiction Out Of The Horror Section","review":"This has been the first King novel I have read since Cujo bored me to death. Why did I put myself through the pain? Why do they consistently place the new non-horror Steven King books in the horror section at bookstores? Here I was hoping to get a descent scare, like King had done in his previous years with such classics as the Stand, Salem's Lot and the Shining.Did I ever choose the wrong book. This is basically about a maid named Dolores who gets in trouble because her husband and her employer both die. It almost felt like a diary. There were no horror elements in this novel at all. It follows the trials and tribulations Dolores has with her husband, employer, her daughter and the cops. This was not a fun book to read and I can't recommend this one to anyone. Good thing I got this hardcover for six bucks in the bargain bin. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witness the fall of a great writer","review":"This book was just the beginning of the ride down the slope. Boring, boring, boring. And the movie was boring too!

I feel like I am seeing this story unfold before me"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down","review":"Allow me to say this briefly. I have a four-year degree in English. I've read tons of books for college and for pleasure. This is a book I could not stop reading until I finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"What I like most about this book is that there's no chapters. It's all a bunch of paragraphs stringed together. I love it! Not a scary novel, so SK fans beware. Still, with a great story and memorable characters it does good to the meaning of the word \\"novel.\\" Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best with yet another intriguing novel","review":"Stephen King spins another tale with yet more fascinating, interesting characters and plots lines in this story, Delores Claiborne. I love this book and have read it several times. It is very enjoyable and fun to read. The movie is also good, but wait until you've read this to watch it. Stephen king has written better, but this is much better than average."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Does It Again... Only In A Different Way","review":"If Steven King were to write a book on how to change oil in a car, I do believe that I would buy it, and not be the least bit dissappointed in doing so. The man just has a way with words. Anything he writes is bound to thrill and chill the reader.Dolores Claiborn is no exception. Though it was not written in the typical Steven King fashion in which so many of us are accustomed, I found it to be a definite don't want to put downer, page turner.I suppose one of the things that really amazed me about this book, was how Mr. King was able to tap into the female psyche so profoundly. But that's only the tip of the iceberg, as far as this book is concerned. Though it doesn't touch base with horror, as in 'STEVEN KING HORROR', it does have its chilling moments, as well as mystery, heartache and that quirky Steven King humor.To put it simply, Dolores Claiborne was an OUTSTANDING, FANTASTIC read! I LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you've seen the movie - read this book!","review":"The movie with Kathy Bates is one of my favorites, but I still put off reading the book, thinking that I would not enjoy it since I already knew how it would end. How wrong I was!Frances Sternhagen is spellbinding as Dolores - I hung on every word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolores St. George","review":"\\"Dolores Claiborne,\\" a gripping suspense novel by Stephen King, is a very enjoyable book. It is told in first person by Dolores Claiborne herself as she delivers a monologue of sorts to the police 30 years after she killed her husband and 2 days after Vera Donovan, her employer, died. The page is a brief 368 pages with four pages of a scrapbook of artificial newspaper articles. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not gripping until the end","review":"I, unlike many other reviewers, did actually like the continued narrative, even though at times Dolores' vulgarities and island talk could get tedious. I actually read the book after seeing the movie on TV and enjoyed both. I thought Joe St.George was a little one-dimensional, but I saw the descriptions of how Dolores and her children dealt with the abuse as very realistic and haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Hmm. I was expecting a good deal from this book--both from the critical acclaims on the jacket promising something really special and the interesting idea of having the narrative as Dolores's monologue interview with the police. But it's nothing really special--Dolores is quite a funny character, and Vera Donovan's quite good too, but as a whole it's like an overblown version of one of the many subplots King plants in his other bigger novels (\\"It\\", \\"Needful Things\\" etc.). Hardly engaging, and definately not frightning--except to show that even a good author like King can stoop to such levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely superb! King at his finest.","review":"This book packs a massive punch! The attitude, personality and lingo king gives to this story is remarkable to say the least. Blew through it in 2 days. Dolores tells an amazing story but when you get right down to it Dolores Claiborne is about pain, heartache, redemption and revenge. It's probably my favorite of all king's non-horror based novels. The horror in this novel is real life. A must read and a king top 10! Claiborne shines all the way to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for Stephen King's Dolores Claiborne","review":"I read this book in about a week last summer. It truly touched my heart. The message I got is that sometimes we have to rely on people outside of our families to survive. I cried often reading this book because I found the characters to be so moving and life like. For instance when Mrs. Donnovan counsels Dolores about her marriage problem. I am a big Stephen King fan and a big Lifetime movie fan so I guess you could say this was the best of both worlds LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"A King Tour-de-force","review":"I have always felt that Stephen King's writing is at its best when he focuses on character development and pictures of small-town America rather than the supernatural. \\"Dolores Claiborne\\" is a case in point.I was a little startled when I started reading this book to find that the text is all first-person stream of consciousness. Everything is written in dialect, with quite a bit of phonetic spelling. There aren't even any chapter divisions. This style of writing takes a little getting used to, and I thought it might wear thin quickly. It didn't, and the fact that King can keep a reader's attention in this style for so long, without breaking character or style in the slightest, is amazing. King is truly one of America's great authors, despite his attraction to the macabre and the supernatural."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few men I've read who can write about women...","review":"I can't believe this book wasn't written by TABITHA King. It's an amazing feminist confessional, riveting, powerful, exciting, witty as heck, and you just come to love Deloris by the end. I thought Kathy Bates was superb in the movie role, and I was surprised at how much I loved the film, because the book is deep and richly detailed, yet the movie captured the mood. Stephen King is our Charles Dickens - he champions the underdog. Real treasures, book and man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Reading Ahead","review":"I am somewhat of a King fan, and I am a fan of more literary fiction, but the two just don't work in the same book. This is a confession of an old woman named Dolores Claiborne (hence the tittle.) The story takes forever to develope and leads up to only one or two relatively exciting but brief scenes. There are no chapter breaks, meaning you'll have to pick your own place to stop--given the choice I ended up reading only a page or two at a time which drug out the slow reading even longer. It just wasn't worth it.The one plus: yes, he does write about women very well, but that fact alone does not make a good book. You need more than great characterization. You need great characterization, plot, narrative flow/pacing, prose, and interest-holding. One out of six just doesn't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dolores Claiborne","review":"This book was ok to read, but like all his new books IT'S NOT A GOOD BOOK. Get back to the good stories. sind disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is Awesome, narrator is not","review":"Stephen King does not disappoint in this audio cd BUT, the narrator really sucks. She is the sheriffs wife (sorry cant think of her name and I already got rid of the cd's) her voice is annoying after about 30 minutes. I have both the book and the movie but could not take the narration in the cds. I was really disappointed. Granted I am spoiled because Frank Muller really is the only narrator that was ever really able to bring out the creepy-ness of King's stories. I would have preferred they try to get a narrator that does not sound like a they are 1,0000 years old and a deeper pitch to their voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the craft of writing coming to?","review":"I have been a long-time fan of Steven King's and make it a point to read all his books. But, Jesus, Mary and Joseph!! What was this book? Sure, the concept was intriguing, which is why I bothered to buy the book. The writing?? Dull-witted and far too conversational. Some may mistake Dolores' rambling monologue as character development, I saw it as one really played-out soliloquy. This confessional mode that King chose for this book really seems like an out from doing the hard work himself. The language level was atrocious: barbaric, stupid: the kind that appeals only to goons, idiots and, apparently, Americans(Canadians are Americans, too, genius). I scoff on the term Best Seller. As far as I'm concerned, it means beans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unkingly","review":"Even though Stephen King wrote this novel, it was as good as the sitcoms on the WB. I have one word to describe it: horrible. It's a rare case where the movie exceeded the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this booked. My least favorite ever.","review":"This book was pathetic. Probably his worst. Don't read thisbook, it should be banned from shelves. I really wasted mymoney with this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best domestic violence fiction","review":"Leave it to Stephen King to write what I consider one the best fictionalized accounts of domestic violence on the market.Sometimes there are unusual twists in real life just as in Delores Claiborne, such as the desperate measures taken by Dolores to protect her child from incest and the most unusual string of events that led to an investigation of how Delore's abusive husband died.Delores Claiborne is an excellent read because 1. it has a good plot, believable and realistic, 2. Good Writing (KIng of course), 3.There are several conflicts going on within the story, societal, mother-daughter, internal conflict within Delores and a moral conflict for the reader; and the third reason this is a good choice for a domestic violence read is 4. the dynamics are there, a layer beneath the surface at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Although I liked Elspeth very much I found Alex to be pretty much a selfish creep. In fact I really didn't care that much for any of the male characters. Also Alex switches for a revenge seeking creep to an obsessed lover seeking to rekindle the flame he shared with Elspeth in Scotland in little less than a paragraph. I may read other Tallchief stories if I come across them, but they aren't high on my must read list. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Sweet","review":"Not my favorite. Tina Malia's voice is a little too sticky sweet for my taste, and every song sounds alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Babies","review":"I am ordering a new one, as my first one got lost one weekend when my parents stayed with the children. I used this for my first baby. It helped me learn the words to wonderful lullabies so I could sing them myself to my baby, and my husband used it to play for the baby when he did the night-night routine. Very soothing. Beautiful lyrics and a lovely voice. We used it in the car, too, if travel forced us to be in the car during naptime. That and a favorite blanket is all you need for a good nap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lullaby Favorites - Get this one it's excellent!","review":"We orderd three lullaby CDs for our newborn daughter and this one is by far the best.

This is the one she LOVES! We keep it in the car and listen to it atleast once a day. It did take a few times for her to grow to love it, but now everytime it comes on she immediately calms down and often falls to sleep. If the CD ends, she fusses and I start it over again =)The girl singing has a beautiful voice that's so easy to listen to. I often find myself singing along with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a fan","review":"I saw so many good reviews, I thought I was sure to like this lullaby CD for my daughter. But I'm not a fan of Tina Malia's voice. She sounds exactly the same for all the songs with the same pitch, so that I feel like I'm listening to annoying elevator music. I also thought some of the songs were odd choices. Anyway, I can see others like this CD, but I just can't stomach it. Only reason I gave it more than 1 star is because it doesn't seem to annoy my daughter the way it does me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bedtime CD for the whole family","review":"I was looking for a lullaby CD and used the reviews to help choose one.

She lives in an institution until a family friend's visit frees her from a dark world and begins to reawaken her past. Intense and dramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"I have read, and loved, every fantasy book David Eddings has written. Ignoring the tepid reviews, I bought this book and looked forward to another (albeit different) Eddings adventure. Sadly, I was bored to tears by the wooden characters and their elementary school dialogue. I didn't care about any of these people and most of what happened made no sense. I'm usually sorry to see a book end, but this time I was thankful when I finally turned the last page. Personally, I think David Eddings should stick to fantasy and leave murder mystery/thrillers to the experts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"When I first read the Belgariad, I was enchanted. Great story, great characters, compelling from start to finish. The Mallorean had so many parallels to the Belgariad, but that was fine because it was incorporated into the story. Then came the Elenium, and I started to suspect that Eddings was a one trick pony. Too many similarities to previous efforts.Well, after reading Regina's Song, I'm going to say I wish he (and his wife) had just stuck to that one trick. A pretty cool idea was dragged into the mud by mind numbingly boring characters and execution. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever read; think noir meets Barbie. Finally, I was offended by the pomposity of the main character, who remains pugnaciously mundane to the highly unsatisfying end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Case of the Overlooked Dental Records","review":"I was looking forward with great interest to this thriller, being a great fan of the Eddings' highly-readable fantasy novels.Unfortunately, I found Regina's Song highly implausible. The cutesy-poo dialogue of the opening chapters came straight out of a 1940s children's adventure story. The novel is set in the 1990s. Do teenagers and 25-year-olds really speak this way? I think not.And then there's the major plot device - the seemingly impossible problem of identifying whether Regina or her twin sister Renata has been murdered - they're identical and don't have fingerprints or footprints to identify them.Come on, that's no problem at all. The newspapers are always full of bodies being identified by . . . dental records. But David & Leigh Eddings ignore this option, because the entire plot hinges on not being able to identify the dead twin.Some good woodworking tips in the novel, though . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was awful","review":"When I first picked up A David Eddings Book it was Pawn of Prophesy. I have to say I was riveted and loved every minute of it. Then as I read further into his novels I began to see how it was all the same. The same characters with different names. There is always a Belgarath type character (Althaus, Mark, Sparhawk) always a Polgara type character (Serphenia, the lady who owned the house in Regina' song, and Emmy.) And they always play the same roles.I noticed as I was reading the Begarath the Sorcerer that Eddings even put it in his writing, how the character noticed how things had a way of repeating itself until the error that caused the whole problem was fixed. Which basically said \\"I only have one story line so I have to alter it accordingly to fit all my new books.Regina's song was no different. It was the same story with different characters and it was boring and old. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"After reading this book, you will neither know or care which of the twins died. All I can say is the surviving one was pretty dull. They try and make her seem intriguing by having her write a Freshman English Comp paper that shows her sane/insane worldview. It then get shown to anyone and everyone in the book to show how extrordinary she is. I showed her \\"paper\\" to friends for laughs and we all agreed that her paper would be a joke in high school and would certainly not have her \\"brother\\" be told by his boss in the English department that she must become an English major. All in all, everyone seemed to be too perfect in their area of expertise, while still not being interesting enough to make the reader care if they lived or died after the book was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, horrible dialogue","review":"The authors had all the right material to start with, but the \\"cutsie\\" prose has me praying for a quick ending. Why are graduate students talking like 8th graders?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing idea, bad science and bad writing","review":"Sure, the idea was interesting, but the writing was bad (as most reviewers have noted) and the references to science was also groan inducing. The aforementioned reference to dental records (to determine which twin survived), the idea that multiple personality disorder actually occurs (it doesn't), and the description of a poison (which doesn't just paralyze, it also kills becuase of paralyzation).Unfortunately, this books was groan-inducing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditch the wife please","review":"This is the first David Eddings book I have read where his wife was listed as co-author.

The plot devices were obvious, the dialog uninteresting and the storyline just really didn't make it into any identifiable category.

Big disappointment. Words cannot describe how big a disappointment this book was. But I still read all the way to the last sentence, like someone who is unable/unwilling to look away from a car wreck.The premise is that one of a pair of identical twins is murdered and they cannot tell which twin is which, because identical twins have the same DNA. Nice, but I've got two words for you:DENTAL RECORDS. I think it is statistically impossible for even identical twins to have identical cavities, tootbrush wear patterns, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This book is truly terrible, like the rest of Eddings' recent works.I can't believe this worthless fool was one of my favorite authors at one point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Let Down","review":"Edding's previous fantasy trilogies pinned me to my chair and quickly established him in my own mind at least as a writer to follow. Regina's Song however drives home the point that The Redemption of Althalus hinted at, Davey boy isn't getting better with age. Regina's Song streches too many pages for a story that could have been told without the jabber of the unbelievable characters. If you're a die hard Eddings fan try this one on for size, but don't go in with Eddings like expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointmen","review":"I have enjoyed all of Eddings earlier works but this book is a disgrace. A step away from his usual fantasy, this novel takes place in Seattle where a string of violent crimes are being comitted. The charecters in this book are incredibly 2 dimensional and all the dialogue is laced with \\"cute\\" phrases and witticisms. Also disgusting is theobvious conservatism of the athor that is continuously injected into the book. Don't buy it and don't read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I don't understand...I have loved all of David Eddings books.

Quite the disappointment, especially since I did really enjoy the Belgaraid and the Mallorean, even if they were a bit repetitive. Its a thriller that doesn't thrill, but thats not the worst part. The characters are uni-dimensional and unbelievable, as are the occurances. If I were only talking about the supernatural aspects, this wouldn't be a problem, however the whole way through the book the daily lives of college students, parents, cops, etc, are just so far away from the way real people behave, its astounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're thinking about reading this book, THINK AGAIN!!!","review":"Ok, I picked this book up in the bookstore, and like most other people was very intrigued by the whole murdered twin idea. As I was reading it I became annoyed with the main characters, the boarding house group. It seems that all of their dialogue was recycled throughout the book.Finally I got to an interesting part of the book, (spoiler ahead) after Twinkie had killed the last guy, in the church Mark and the priest see two twins. They could have gone so many different ways with that plot twist, but no, Mark and the priest decide NEVER TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!

By utilizing the actual function of the tissues and the body processes involved, Ori lays out a pathway to achieving your goals. The text is technical yet explained well enough for almost any reader to grasp. Mr. Hofmekler does not set out to demonize certain aspects of our physiology. Instead, he objectively looks at the information and shows how to optimize the work our body performs. I would characterize this book as the science behind the Warrior Diet.

It appears that the author sets out to impress those in the medical fields. For most readers, it is dry. You will fight to keep your eyes open and have a harder time convincing yourself to continue on with this read.This book is very technical in nature. Unless you are a physician or a biologist, you might want to pass on this book. It makes me wonder what is the target audience the author was trying to reach.

Atrocious. I would understand this quality in an album recorded 4 or 5 decades ago, but not even those are as bad as this one.

This funk-disco group was formed by Jeff Lane in 1972 in Brooklyn NY. They started as David House Rockers in 1972 and later were called the Brooklyn Trucking Express. They were never totally self-contained; even its first major hit, \\"Do It ('Til You're Satisfied),\\" was written by someone who wasn't an official member: guitarist Billy Nichols. The group consisted keyboardist Michael Jones (later well known as Kashif). Nevertheless the Best of B.T has such a good track list and without them your funk collection is incomplete.

If you are a steel player, you must get this just to hear Neil's creativity. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gram Live and Real!","review":"Many of the reviews address the sound quality (which is quite good and typical of the time) and the continuity of the recording. Having been one of the lucky few audience members at more than one of the intimate simulcast radio concerts at the Ultrasonic Recording Studios in Hempstead, LI, NY in the early 1970's, via the now defunct 92.7 WLIR-FM, this is extremely good and Gram is in top form. For those too young to have been there or remember, this was the typical format for those of us Long Island kids, to hear live music outside of a club or concert venue. Listening to these live, was a truly special event, anxiously awaited, and shared with our friends and favorite substances. You will get to hear Gram as we heard him over the radio in 1973. This is history as we heard it and as it happened.(Although we didn't know it at the time.) Gather some friends, play it LOUD, and listen to some \\"Cosmic American Music\\". Enjoy! That's how we did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct remaster","review":"It's ironic a previous reviewer complained about the talking between takes. On the original vinyl version, the song \\"Drug Store Truck Drivin Man\\" was dedicated to the then governor of California, Ronald Ray Gun. Listening to this remix is like listening to a reformed 60s stoner explain why kids should vote Republican and shouldn't smoke grass.It's too bad that the survivors don't have the courage of their, 1973, convictions.Find the record somewhere in a cutout bin instead.Too bad the ratings only go down to 1 star. I'd give it less. Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"This book has raised an awareness, at least within myself. Why are fighting the war in Iraq? We are fighting the enemies that have supplied the terrorists with, not WMD, but millions of tons of small arms that are killing our troops. Who are we really fighting? China, Russia, France, Germany and of course, the enemy that is selling is out from within. Like other reviewers have said, we need to wake up!!! Gertz tells us who are enemies are and we need to quit feeding their bad habits. I don't know how this will take place but we feed one of them by visiting those dollar stores. This is one read that will shock you and show you who the real terrorists are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful but Hypocritcal","review":"Bill Gertz is a \\"thought leader\\" and what he has to say is always worth listening to or reading.This book is absolutely first rate as far as it goes, in lambasting the French, the Germans, the Russians, China, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Syria, and the United Nations for their varied contributions to global instability and corruption.However, the book is also hypocritical in ignoring the documented fact that the U.S. is by far the largest arms merchant and the biggest bully on the block. The book also ignores Israel and the 38+ dictators that the U.S. supports (there are actually 44 still left but six are included in this book).A third of the book is an appendix of classified documents with a great deal blocked out, this is one of the author's signature features, but the bottom line is that the book is a very large Op-Ed. Worth buying and reading, absolutely spot on, but hypocritical and incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRORIST WILL KILL ANY AMERICAN & OTHERS","review":"very interesting book....too point a finger at america selling weapons is ridiculous......we are at war with terrorist. russia understands that,now, maybe, france and germany are not immuned....when terrorist (fundamental muslims) use these guns to kill,it because they want to rule the world and everyone will be muslim or die....... russia, france & germany and others should stop supplying weapons to the worlds greatest enemy......terrorist. some readers are not getting the bigger picture...terrorist are a great threat to all who are not muslim..............."},{"rating":"1","title":"Israel's connection!","review":"How could we wrtie a book about arm prolifecation and not have a chapter about Israerl.

Of course, what he says is happening, really is happening. What he doesn't seem to care about is the fact that our country, the dear old USA has been involved in the same kind of arms dealing for many years. And our arms merchants have sold arms to enemies of nations we say are our friends. It all depends on whether or not the price is right and proves once more that America is no longer the liberal socialist country founded by social liberals like Jefferson and Hamilton.

My four year old loves them. The graphics are fun, a lot of the scenes result in squeals of delight from her. She asks for these videos and that means a lot considering they sit on the shelf along with the Disney collection.I also discovered that the company Preschool Prep has several iphone apps available which I have purchased to further entertain and enforce the lessons with my child. While I'm not sure if these will result in improvements in school I don't think they are hurting.

In fact, it was actually painful to sit through the video with him. The constant repetition was appropriate but the animation and music were quite dreary.

We play them mostly in the car on the DVD player. They are very repetitive but the get the message across. My 3 1/2 year old knows her letters, numbers, shapes and colors already but she still like to watch the videos because she loves when her younger sister repeats the words (as she does not talk a lot...it does seem like the videos are helping her to say more words). I will start working with my 3 1/2 year old with the words but I would like to do that in the house so we can pause and take our time and get her to start learning some of the site words. I do feel like this is a good set of educational DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"grandmateacher","review":"My four year old and two year old granddaughters loved the videos. They watched them continuously which is the key to making the words a part of your long term memory. We have the digraphs, blends, and letter sounds,too. The four year old became so engaged with the vowels that she has become an excellent writer. I watch all of these videos with them and talk to them about what they see. You need to make connections between the videos and books they can read. I recommend buying the sets of reading books and the coloring books that come with the Preschool series. We have moved on to \\"Heidi Songs\\" DVD's and CD's. The 2 year old can also read, sing, and spell most of the sight words she sees. Singing, moving, and reading help to better develop a child's multi-sensory skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"We rented the Meet the Colors video from the library and my two year old was glued to it. We just introduced television to her and this is the set I choose to start her with. I like the characters in the videos the first 3 or 4 videos are appropriate. The site words are a little advanced. In the videos the only words spoken by the characters or the narrarator is the name of the color, letter, number, shape or word. This is good for repetition and learning, however I would like to see evidence that this is a good way to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!

As one reviewer pointed out, what is boring to an adult isn't always so for a child, so I figured I'd give it a try. BIG MISTAKE. I bought the 4 disk pack and I'm really kicking myself because after popping in the \\"Meet the Letter's' DVD we only made it to the letter D before the kids were over it. Literally, there is nothing more to this DVD then that they flash the letter on the screen--and then say the letter over and over. You might as well go get yourself a set of flash cards and use those with the kids--its essentially the same as this DVD.We have Leapster's Letter Factory and both my boys LOVE it. Now I'm wondering what I'm going to do with 4 worthless disks that aren't going to be watched and that got a total play time of 7 minutes. ;/ VERY dissatisfied, what a waste of money. ;("},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Videos","review":"Great Videos!!

The age group starts at 9 months but it's never too early to start learning! I think the videos are good for learning for a small child but they do repeat themselves several times so as an adult, it can drive you crazy but I understand the reasoning behind the repetitiveness and I just put it on for him in another room (that is the reason I rated it a 4). Otherwise the colors are bright and vidid which really draws attention.

So the cardboard backing sheered off, and some additional pages sheered off the back as well.For the first time ever in the many years I've been using Amazon, I have to contact them about damage in shipping, and it's about such a silly item.

The clicking would drive us crazy. The mats are against a wall and no one went anywhere near them. I bought both a 48x20 extension mat and the adaptor from Amazon at the same time, before the reviewer who says he had a similar problem had posted. I didn't know whether it was the extension or the adaptor at the time and was afraid it was going to zap out both mats because the adaptor was extremely hot where it was plugged into the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the mat activate all the time","review":"Don't buy this.

This was the first Simpson CD I've ever purchased and it is terrible. I watch the Simpsons all the time and I know there are many many great songs on the show. But did they pick any of those great songs? No! It had way too much talking on it, and a couple different Simpson theme song paradies. The songs were short, I guess I was hoping they would elaborate on the songs a bit more. There were only two songs on it that were fun to sing along with. I based my CD choice on the reviews of this product and I don't know where those people were coming from, but this CD is not the one with all the good songs on it, so pick another one or build your own off itunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be sorry!

It just cracks us up to listen to it. With the drum, xylophone and car horn.

I've been to many doctors but without a clear understanding of chronic headache I was not motivated to stick with my treatment (I was not confident that anything would have help) \\"The Headache Soucebook\\" has given me a new-found confidence that I know exactly what I'm dealing with! Now...I can understand what my doctor means by \\"prophylactic\\" and \\"abortive\\" treatments! Now I am motivated to stick with taking a pill everyday. Now I am committed to treating these demoralizing headaches. I highly recommend this book. It is well written in clear language with the average person in mind. Everyone can learn from the very practical tips Dr. Paulino and PA Griffith lays out in these pages. Their experience with treating headaches shows. This book is a must-buy for the headache sufferer, his/her family, and friends. I'll be sharing this book with my internal medicine doc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one","review":"Another one out of Sacramento. Cake, Oleander, Deathray, and now Zoppi. Wow. This is just so infectious. Every song on the album is greatly produced. And is even better with Bob Zoppi's voice. Man the guy can sing. He sometimes almost sounds like he wants to growl. Instantly addictive. I will admit that the song writting isn't the best but they're really not bad, not bad at all. All the songs are just so infectious. One of the better album's I bought in a long time. Just buy the album and believe me by sundown the words \\"I will wait, I will wait till the walls come down and we celebrate our life\\" will be coming out your mouth, not mention to everybody else around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Zoppi's \\"Suspended\\" is an amazingly fresh debut in an industry bogged down by the same old artists. Almost every track is air-play material, making this album one of the best values I've seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimp Rock at its finest","review":"Bob Zoppi is obviously trying to be earnest in his heartfelt delivery. His semi-yodel makes the listener think he really means lyrics like \\"You tend to alienate the only world that you come from.\\" This record is not challenging or thought-provoking at all. It is simply an effort to cash in on the recent success of bands like Semisonic, Vertical Horizon, or to a lesser extent, Matchbox Twenty. The songwriting is decent, but their lyrics belong in hair band power ballads of the 80s. Not an awesome CD, but if you are an avid fan of Vertical Horizon, you probably should give this one a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little gloss and no bite","review":"This album suffers like many POP albums do by limiting itself to banal lyrics and less than enthusiastic melodies. The productions sounds good but its like watching an action movie that has the look but not the writing. Its OK but not enough to put down dollars down on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and funny","review":"As a non-US citizen there was information which didn't apply to me, but still Cheryl Demas book has been a great inspiration for me in trying to figure out how to start a home based business for myself.

As a grandmother, I could not have asked for a book that was more fun to read to the grandchildren. It is just delightful. We first found it at the library.

I have sent it to friends' children and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun fall book","review":"This is our favorite kid's fall book. My children love the story and laugh at the tree's silly attempts to change colors. We have also enjoyed Marty Kelley's winter and summer books (along with his very silly book, \\"The Rules\\"). I hope Kelley comes up with an equally creative book about spring to make our collection complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Published And Horrible!!!!!","review":"This book is truly terrible.... I can't believe I bought it...Really Crazy stuff, especially the advice on singing which is il-conceived crap... not from Zeani at all. Just don't waste your money!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential and welcomed","review":"This is an essential coffee table book for any fan of great singing. Ciampa displays vast knowledge, remarkable insight, and a wealth of anecdotes that are insightful, interesting, and often extremely funny. His wisdom comes from having actually worked with great singers and teachers - he didn't glean a pseudo-understanding from reading a history book or taking an adult ed course. He has lived this.At the very beginning of the book, Ciampa demystifies and clearly defines \\"belcanto.\\" No time is wasted: you don't have to read two or three hundred pages to find out what the \\"belcanto\\" actually is. His ability to explain the supposedly unexplainable aspects of vocal technique is impressive and incredibly rare among writers.For serious and intelligent readers, as well as those with a genuine passion, this is a welcome publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belcanto and the Ashkenazik hazzanim???????","review":"The Three Tenors. Renee Fleming. Bocelli. That is NOT what this book is about. What a PLEASURE to read the colorful interview with Virginia Zeani, and to read about the careers of Leyla Gencer, Jan Kiepura, Tagliabue, ALL of the great, grand singers who didn't happen to make a \\"name\\" quite as big as Lucianissimo's.But by far the most unexpected and interesting part of the book is an entire section where Mr. Ciampa, with surprising convinction and persuasion, makes a direct connection between the Italian Belcanto and Minhag Ashkenaz. As an opera lover who happens to be Jewish, I don't see how one could not read this chapter. I don't recall that anyone else has ever covered it, or even thought about it.One of the truly great opera books in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"I am not at all religious, and not even sure if I believe in God...but picked up this book for my kids. Loved, loved, loved the illustrations and the very simple text with an overall message of love and caring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe inspiring book for little ones","review":"My children are drawn to the illustrations and love the story. The illustrated children's eyes are hauntingly beautiful as they explore God's world created for them. It is a sweet, soft story that introduces children to God's creation and His love for them for all eternity. Rather large, complex theological points are made simple for children.I only didn't give it five stars because when reading out loud I tend to fumble a bit. The prose appears to want to be rhyming, but the layout doesn't allow for it, so when you read it out loud you just can't get a rhythm going, and so you end up stumbling a bit. The edition I have is from 2002 with a copyright of 1984, so perhaps the graphic layout was changed from the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Self-help","review":"Tell Me No Lies is more than practical self-help (though just that would be useful).

Better yet, is the DVD/VIDEO with Glenn Carter, most recently as JCS Broadway 2000's Jesus, and Tony Vincent as Judas, you will see an even better portrayal of the Crucifixion {of which I had the glorious opportunity to see!LIVE! 5 TIMES}... This has the Last 7 Phrases that Jesus said while he was on the Cross. Do not forget: JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR focuses on the FINAL 7 DAYS of the LIFE of JESUS, and the trials and tribulations, the fear and the triumph of that week. If you want a musical capsulization of Jesus' MINISTRY, then yes, GODSPELL is the show for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coca-Cola Classic vs New Taste of Coke","review":"Why would Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice want their excellent original version be destroyed like that. Of course, if you are producing a stage show, you can't use the original cast members for ever. But why produce a new studio version that basically tries to copy the original ( except for a few lyrical changes that add nothing) but fails miserably because of an irritating cornyness that was not present in the original. If it's financial, then it's bloody money and you are damned for all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME! JUST AWSOME!","review":"Well , this recording is by far the BEST OUT THERE!!!! Balsmomakes the BEST jesus , his version of Gethemane, is just beyond beaituful!!!!!!!!!....Joanna Ampil was a good mary , but er .... she wasnt the best- er voice is to meek and no strnght to it, nut thatd a minor thing ,plus the 1970 cast has NO diction and they run there words together , but this recoding is very well sang/spoken :-), i am currently in a production of JCS , and were by far doing this music. and now i can finally understand what they sayc when they shout \\"Kill him he says hes a blasphimer , he'll conquer you and us and every ceaser!\\"by all - this IS the JCS recoridng"},{"rating":"2","title":"It exceeded expectations","review":"Even after all these years the music and lyrics still resonate. Forget all the religious crap that has caused so much trouble in the world, this is a story about a man who, for whatever reason, embarked on a journey. In his last few days of life he is just a man scared of the fate he knows is coming. Steve Balsamo's version of Gethsemane (which has to be the best ever) illustrates all that power and emotion so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product was just as expected!","review":"I purchased Jesus Christ Superstar recently and the CD's are excellent quality.

I should have bought the Karoke version and let my son recite the words. Nearly all of the lyrics were spoken instead of sung. Get the original cast recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original album","review":"What I was looking for when I bought the CD was the remastered copy of the original album, the one that was played in coffeehouses all over the U.S. in the 70's. I still have the vinyl but it is too scratched to be a good candidate for ripping to the computer. This CD was not the same people, same notes, etc. I'm looking for a very specific recording and have thus far not been able to find it. I returned the CD after discovering that it was not at all what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Second Favorite","review":"The best thing about this recording is Steve Balsamo. The man has a voice that is unlike any I have ever heard. His version of Gethsemane is, in my opinion, the best there is. David Burt also gives a knockout performance as Pilate. It took a while, but the other performers grew on me as well. Zubin Varla has a pretty gruff voice for Judas, but I guess people like that. His acting is really good, though. Joanna Ampil has a great voice for kim in Miss Saigon, but her Mary is a little weak. Her best song is \\"could we start again please\\", not \\"I don't know how to love him\\". The new versions of the songs are wonderful, and the orchestrations are the best I have ever heard. I would say that if they don't make a cd of the new broadway cast (which is THE best), then this cd is the one to go with. It is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wayyyyyy overproduced. :(","review":"this version completely lacks the amazing classic rock character of the original. the dirty sounding fender precision bass, the completely dry recorded drums, the twangy naturally distorted electric guitars. the 1970s original cast recording has much, much more character."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!!!!","review":"WARNING to all who love this album like I do.

Booooo","review":"If I'm not mistaken, Jesus Christ Superstar was first created in the 70's WITHOUT disgusting compression and artificial reverb on the drums and vocals. This is like Jesus Christ Superstar watered down for mainstream. It sounds way too overproduced. It has no soul. What I always liked about JCS is that it wasn't like all the other musicals. IF YOU WANT THE REAL THING, BUY THE ORIGINAL LONDON CONCEPT RECORDING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Recording...with reservations","review":"Ok, here's the deal: Steve Balsamo did a great job as Jesus. He is by far my favourite. Zubin Varla does a fairly good portrayal of Judas, and Joanna Ampil is an decent Mary. Alice Cooper, well even I didn't see that one coming! Not that he's bad, it's just amusing. The downside is Caiaphas. Why? Why couldn't they get someone like Gary Martin (who can REALLY hit those low bass notes) to play the role? Peter Gallagher was not a complete failure, (he was in the 2000 movie version with a greatly improved voice might I add) but, if you want to hear a near-perfect Caiaphas listen to the 20th Anniversary Recording. Just remember that I said \\"a good Caiaphas\\" not \\"a good overall recording\\" since Paul Nicholas is a terrible Jesus. In short, if you want quality, this album is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new, Definate version of the \\"Rock Opera\\"","review":"This is by far the best Jesus Christ Superstar cd out there. I have heard them all except the australian cast, which i've heard is not very good. The orchestrations are Amazingly clear and powerful. This cd leaves no songs cut, and it includes a newer version of \\"Could we start again, Please?\\". Steve B. who plays Jesus is very impressive and has a large vocal range. Joanna Ampil is a little weak as Mary, but she sings well. Zubin Varla is extremely good as Judas, and the rest of the cast is super. Including the casting of Alice Cooper, yes the rock star, as King Herod. As someone said earlier, the songs have definate endings and no \\"fade Outs\\", real theater performances have no \\"fade outs\\".

The second is a live version of \\"Your House\\", the last hidden track on JLP. Alanis has the most incredible voice range, and truly shows it on this import single. The third track is my personal favorite. It is a Modern Rock Live version of \\"Wake Up\\". The last track is the album version of \\"Hand in my Pocket\\". I've never really gotten into cds of live music, but this cd is incredibly arranged. It's gives you the best of both worlds. Her voice goes right through you live and makes you believe that you are at one of her concerts.

After many weeks back and forth with Griffin Tech Support and HP/Compaq Support, and postings online, still no success. It installs in minutes on other computers, and other Compaqs, but not mine. Time for a refund which Griffin is happy to provide. 5 stars for Griffin Tech Support, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Travel","review":"Last year during one of our snowboarding trips we brought along a laptop so that we could watch a movie during the drive. Only problem was that no one could hear the movie because the laptop speakers didn't have the volume. I thought it would be great to just plug the laptop into the car audio. My first thought was one of those tape deck adaptors, except I don't have a tape deck. Anyways, long story short I started looking at USB FM transmitters.I received this one a few weeks ago and it works awesome. Granted, there is some distortion in the signal, but it is minimal, similar to what I get with my iPod's FM transmitter. It is a nice clean little device, and I really like the fact that with the included software I can pick any channel in the FM range to transmit on. Some of the other ones I looked at were fixed, or required setting of dipswitches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"The signal recieved by my stereo reciever (25' away) and portable radios (5-15' away) has too much interference to make it a worthwhile product. To top it off the software that came with the product did not work and I had to download new software from the Griffin site. Further when I contacted J and R Electronics (the third party seller) and they would not offer a refund and said I had to go through Griffin despite that this product does not perform as advertized. Check twice before buying something through J and R Electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Simply doesn't work 25 feet away and through one wall. Like listening to AM radio in 1971.

This product did both of those things, at a fraction of the cost of many other FM transmitters. Setup is fairly easy, and sound quality/range is excellent (after I did what other reviewers suggested - crack open the RocketFM and extend the antenna for optimal performance). My problems are solved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful item....that doesn't work.","review":"This could potentially be fantastic if it worked...but it didn't even come close. I got zip. Bupkis.

It installed quickly and effortlessly on my machine, but even when I moved my computer and Rocket FM device two feet away from my high quality receiver with a good FM antenna, the static and drop outs and other distortion were constantly noticable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with Intel Macs.

After launching the required software for the first time, I got a pop-up error message that said \\"software is not compatible with Intel-based Macs.\\" This is a major incompatibility for for a huge percentage of mac owners, and it was not mentioned anywhere in the Amazon product info or specification. Furthermore, when I went to the manufacturer's website (Griffin Technology), I discovered that the product had been discontinued. Also not mentioned by Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice gizmo!","review":"Noticed that it may not come on instantly if a song is already playing. But just click on pause/stop and then will transmit once signal begins again. Works great from my laptop to my FM receiver in family room about 15 feet away. (I have external FM antenna in back of receiver so don't know if that makes a difference.) Reception/quality of audio is good. Guy at Circuit City was amazed I could get this at this price and best they could offer was a different brand transmitter for ipods at about $40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Works with any radio...","review":"I bought the transmitter based on a friend's recommendation, because I wanted to be able to listen to my music in every room (+kitchen and bath radios). I stream the music on my laptop in one bedroom, but have set all my radios to the FM station I preset. Very easy to use. I just connected to my Windows XP laptop, and it automatically recognized the transmitter connected via USB, then loaded the software from the enclosed CD and set the channel to an unused (least staticy) frequency."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK ON I-MAC!","review":"I'm extremely disappointed with this product: After installing it and its software on my iMac, I went to System Preferences to set it up and got the message: \\"You cannot open RocketFM Preferences because it does not work on an Intel-based Mac.\\" Thanks a lot Griffen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't use it.","review":"I sent it back after reading the instructions. It seems that every time I would have to change from listening to tunes at my coputer to the use of the transmitter I would have to change the values in Start->Control Panel->Sounds and Audo Devices to use it and then change them back when I was at my computer. I didn't want to do that each time. I have no experience in the effectiveness since I didn't actually use the transmitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Transmission","review":"My indoor FM receiver has a large dipole FM antenna yet when the Griffin RocketFM is a mere 15 feet away and in line-of-sight the reception is not clear even on a clear frequency. However, when used with a friend's laptop computer at a similar distance the sound is very good. Some reviewers have suggested that perhaps this product is too reliant on the voltage output level of the USB port that it's hooked up to. In other words, the RocketFM connected to a computer with slightly less USB output voltage will transmit a significantly lower power FM signal than a computer with a slightly higher USB voltage. I gave the RocketFM to a friend after we confirmed that it worked fine with his computer and stereo receiver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple to use but poor signal.","review":"The Rocket FM transmitter was as easy as a mouse to set up and get running. The tuning app is about as easy as software gets to use.However, no combination of orientation of the transmitter and receiver and frequency I tried managed to get a range of more than about 4 feet, usually a LOT less.I see now why it was in the ultra discount bin at the record store. I will be returning it and would not pay $5 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background sound and...","review":"It's very difficult to find a free frequency in Canada. The sound is not clean, there is always a background sound. Good luck to find a way to place the RocketFM. If you move the wire or the RocketFM around the computer, the sound is good or very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really impressed","review":"I'm not really impressed with the Griffin RocketFM. I purchased this unit for the sole purpose of hearing my streaming XM radio on my laptop into the other room. For some reason, this unit doesn't like Windows media streams. If I launched iTunes or something else, all went well. After Griffin customer service giving me the run around for nearly two weeks, they finally came to the explanation that it was just the program I was using. I doubt a streaming program made by XM would be THAT flawed. Definitely not impressed with this product at all. It's going in the closet with all the broken stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"works pretty well","review":"this product was definitely plug and play (took less than 5 minutes to set-up) on both my mac and pc laptops, and it works pretty well with my Yamaha receiver. The sound quality is good enough for itunes, youtube, etc, but I wouldn't use it for programs that rely on truly excellent sound quality (I'm a recording musician). The biggest drawback is how easy it is to interfere with the signal, even my cat is able to cause loud static when he walks in front of the transmitter. Overall, it does what it's supposed to do, and is useful in getting yet another cord out of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"FM Rocket Fizzle","review":"Great looking on desk, Performance good, but not great.Performs task w/ short distances, doesn't like much interference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your cash","review":"Save your money. I am still searching for a good transmitter but this one is not it. This unit is supposed to transmit up to 30 feet. I can't get it to transmit a very good signal more than 10 feet, and I live in a regular stick built house. If I stick it within 3 feet of the stereo I get decent sound but there is still a bit of crackle that is noticeable on slower acoustic type songs. I have been to the website for the unit and tried all the tips. I don't know what else to recommend but this is a bad solution for music, but may be O.K. for talk shows or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Week signal","review":"It took a couple of hours of fiddling with this device to actually get it to transmit. Once that was worked out, the signal was too weak to give good sound quality on either of the stereos in my house. One of which is 15-20' away from the transmitter.I had this hooked up to the USB2 port on the back of my computer (ie, no usb hub), so it should have been able to get enough power. I would prefer it if they at least offered the option of using a power adapter to get more signal out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRY OPEN THE CASE","review":"okay, so I bought this thing 6 months ago, and stopped using it due to frustration with constant static and noise when I moved it. Sitting on my couch, 15 feet away from my stereo (a nice one) and it can't get across the room without sounding crappy? FAIL.But, today I read the review suggesting to pry the case open and free the antenna - this made ALL the difference. the case will close again, just pry it open and pull the metal antenna out into the air.All in all I wouldn't buy it again, since the antenna will probably break off soon enough, but for now that at least salvages the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My new receiver with a good antenna attached could not pick up a clean signal from the transmitter that was plugged into my computer that is only about 30 feet away.

The amount of static that is broadcast made the sound unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissaponited","review":"I Was very dissaponited with this product!!The first thing is the range.

I had the pleasure of seeing her and purchasing this CD last summer. As comparisons go, which I hate to do because sometimes they miss, I'd compare her to Shawn Colvin, Ani DiFranco, Sarah Harmer and Bonnie Rait. Rachel is a true talent...a strong strummer on guitar with a booming, but sensitive voice.

I wanted to learn C on my own though so I was determined to do it. I read each and every chapter about 3 or 4 times trying to learn all the concepts but it was really agonizing. One thing books like this should mention is a basic understanding of algebra being suggested, I'm sure that would have helped me. I will say however that once I did completed this book the C class I eventually took in college wasn't nearly as bad. At least it made me familiar with C and programming.

There are at minimum, 27 different releases on 24 different labels of his Swing Time & Down Beat Recordings from 1949-1952 when he was 19 to 22 years old. The great beauty of these songs is that he sounds like a man, not a kid and when there's horns they blast. 'I'm Goin' Down To the River' and 'All To Myself Alone' are both so emotional. The first one's a suicide note cuz he lost his love. This is the sweet stuff, before Atlantic Records which is great stuff. This is his earliest material and well worth it. There's apparently 41 to 42 released songs from this period and they appear on 1) The Complete Swing Time & Down Beat Recordings 1949-1952, 2) Ray Charles 45 Great Performances and 3) Mess Around.

Not many books can make me cry but parts of this one did! Ms. Landis made me feel everything that the main characters (Janelle, Joya and Trevor) were feeling. This book had everything---adventure, mystery and romance. And unlike some of the romance novels I've read, this one truly showed the love that grew between Joya and Trevor.

The section that tells you how to deal with each type of toxic personality is also somewhat interesting, if incredibly obvious.The section that lists 'toxic faults' is ridiculous. One would have to be a perfect person, both in terms of looks and personality, in order to be found acceptable by the author. I understand that she focuses on outward appearances because of 'first impressions', but she takes it to such an extreme, I suspect she has some issues with her own looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"UN-ENLIGHTNING READ","review":"THIS BOOK READ LIKE A CHILD HAD WRITTEN IT. IT WAS OVERLY SIMPLISTIC AND SOUNDED SO CHILDISH IN ITS SOLUTIONS, I'M WONDERING IF THE AUTHOR IS A PRETEEN.ON THE OTHER HAND, THE BOOK \\"IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING\\" OFFERED REVELATIONS IN IDENTIFYING AGRESSIVE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHO MANIPULATE YOU IN A GREAT VARIETY OF WAYS.IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO IDENTIFY AND EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH A MANIPULATOR IN YOUR LIFE, READ \\"IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative and toxic in and of itself","review":"Found author tending to blame everyone else for everything, just as author accuses \\"toxic people\\" of doing. Found it toxic, full of jargon, poorly written. Author seems to have no compassion."},{"rating":"1","title":"She would know","review":"I had the misfortune of taking a seminar taught by this woman, and she is herself toxic. It was presented in the guise of helping the attendees, but was actually a commercial for her services. The people I know who worked with her one on one were not impressed, and felt it was a waste of money. Furthermore, she was rude, self-absorbed, insecure about her weight gains of late, and gave little new information that was helpful. She is not the guru she proclaims! Don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A comical book, actually!","review":"As I was reading this book I came across some comical information. I thought I was just not understanding so I discussed it with my husband. He also agreed that some things written in this book were somewhat odd.It did not help me at all. The toxic people discribed were elementary. I put the book down and have never picked it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat tool for survival!","review":"I bought this book sometime ago, I've read it several times, and boy does Lillian Glass provide the reader with a ton of useful information on how to deal with all the difficult monsters who try to transform you life into a nightmare. Lillian Glass plots each toxic type of personality in chronological order, and then goes on to explain how to deal with these people in an effective way that leaves you with your sanity. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to improve their relationships, both personal and professional. Remeber, the people round you do affect the quality of your life and this book is an effective tool to help you rid yourself of all the monsters who want to turn it into a nightmare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical!!","review":"I bought this book because I work with an \\"angry pugilist\\" (as denoted by Dr. Glass). I found this book a very easy read, it was very amusing, so it kept my interest, unlike some of the other really dry ones. She identifies a bunch of different types of \\"toxic\\" people like \\"bitchy bossy bullies\\", \\"wishy washy wimp\\" \\"the mental case\\", and so many more. She gives explicit detailed desciptives of these people, then she gives examples of their behavior, and then she goes into techniques to deal with them. Although some of the come backs she uses are definitely brash, and I probably wouldn't say half of them, they are still REALLY funny, and as I read out loud at work, some of us were in tears laughing so hard. There are a few things I did learn from the book about myself actually, and if I can rethink the way I am, I may have better success dealing with miserable people."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shopping list of pet peeves","review":"No deep insight here, I am afraid. Dr Glass list exhaustingly all the traits (physical and phsychological) that we might find unattractive in others. Eternally undecided friends are as serious a problem as bullying bosses. The message of the book is that, in the name of self-assertion, you can hit out at anything that causes you any discomfort whatsoever. Dr Glass helpfully provides a list of \\"humorous\\" retorts, which are, in my view, so insulting and heavy-handed to guarantee the swift end of any relationship. I went back to read Miss Manner's books with great relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic People: 10 Ways of Dealing With People Who Make Your Life Miserable","review":"No different than any self help book written from the 80's. Human flaws and quirks are just a part of life, and shouldn't be viewed as a constant drama. I interpreted the book as one that perpetuates whining and viewing one's self as a victim. Let me save readers their money: There are no victims, only volunteers. People will treat you the way you let them treat you. If you don't like something, say so and remove yourself from the situation, and if it makes someone mad, they'll just have to get glad at their own pace. Take care of yourself, and everything around you will fall into place.I gave it a 2 because there were no misspelled words."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to deal with TOXIC BOOKS","review":"I've thrown my copy to the garbage. I suggest you do the same (preferably to a toxic waste recycle bin). This book encourages and praises behaviour that leads directly to unhappiness and lack of self condifence. It took me very little to see how toxic and unwise this book is. Feel that you need some good advise? Don't go to this book. Try 'to love is to be happy with' or another book. And don't take ANY book as the sole source of wisdom on earth. Listen to what you want and act putting fear aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Psychology At Its Worst","review":"Are there really that many toxic people in life? I doubt it. But by sterotyping difficult people who are under stress, unhappy with their lifes, or simply are different from each of us, the author essentially mistreated normally fine people by calling them \\"toxic people.\\" There're always sick people in our society, but they are not the same as what the author would like to see. What about learning to forget and forgive??? The author seems to promote a negative approach to learn how to deal with life! Very discouraging and sad. Not a book I would read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"naive and hostile","review":"Some of the author's ideas and recommendations appeared quite hostile and lacking in civility. There was too much emphasis on how others affect us and not enough on the resiliency and strength of the human being. The book has its purpose and wisdom; however, it should not be blindly followed. Good judgment is needed in filtering through the author's suggestions. I can see how certain situations would escalate and possibly become dangerous based on following her recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is Poison to the Soul","review":"Reader beware. She IS a toxic person. Her philosophies are not the kind of stuff you want to poison your mind or world with (was just off to review the one I bought -- Verbal Self-Defense). What a horrible person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"One of the best books I've read. The author gives insights to many different types of people who could be ruining your life. She goes on to tell how to deal with each type. If you find certain people upsetting you, this book will give positive constuctive steps to overcome the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah... almost... but no","review":"Acquired the book and managed to get through everything in less than an afternoon. What does that mean? It skirts the surface of things but doesn't quite help to identify and mitigate toxics. The examples and anecdotes are numerous yet don't quite convice."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"In many sections of the book, the author recommends putting out \\"fire\\" by using gasoline! In other words, she proposes that dealing with \\"toxic\\" people requires confronting such people... in my opinion. this is the easiest and least intelligent way to solve human relationship problems. The book Crucial Confrontations by Kerry Patterson et alli provides a more insightful approach to the above problems. Another book option is Standing in the Fire by Larry Dressler. Anyway, many hints outlined throughout the Glass' book might be somewhat useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!","review":"TOXIC PEOPLE �? We all have them in our live . . . .

Be Happy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Witty","review":"After reading a couple of the Red Dress Ink Series novels, I was (and still am) a little leary about picking up another one, but I'm glad I picked up this one.While the book does follow the \\"formula\\" of so many other chic lit books, the main character is more entertaining, vulnerable, and witty without being too whiny or overly neurotic.The best thing about this book is the relationships amongst the characters and the plot. Also, this book has a really good supply of supporting characters unlike so many other novels in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick, Fun, Predictable","review":"This book moved very quickly as a result of the 3 page chapters. This one had a lot of potential- the lack of any character development left me bored by the end, though. The writing was as shallow as many of the characters. What started out as fun and highly engaging ended up predictable and unmemorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"fashionista","review":"I didn't like this book. I read through half of it and couldn't finish it. It was to boring. The only reason I continued was because I was hoping it would get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I think the lack of character development is a major problem with this book. You don't end up caring about anyone, not even Vig. The plot is rather asinine, and I ended up skimming through just to see how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading - read \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" by Laura Weisberger instead....","review":"My mistake might be in reading this right after reading \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" (both written by Laura Weisberger) back to back. Now about halfway through the book, I feel obligated to finish it even though I really don't like it. The main character, Vig Morgan, is hardly likeable - and that's probably because so little is offered about her by the author. The book has too many chapters, some of which are only 3-5 pages and describe a particular character, situation or day. I wouldn't recommend this book. If you haven't already read Weisberger's novels, RUN to your nearest book store or library and get them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I really didn't like this book at all. I am a big fan of \\"chick lit\\" and this was just lacking. The main character is likable, however, it never goes anywhere. There is a plot to overthrow the evil boss, but... even that is not that interesting. There is a romance, but it is not developed. There is a weird, needy friend, but that is not developed. I thought this was a waste of time and i am very glad that i only rented it from the library and did not spend money on it. I also did not think it was a quick read; it was almost painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hoot & a half...","review":"This book is really funny. I mean, laugh out loud funny. The characters are totally likeable. It's the smartest, wittiest book I've read this year. This fiscal year, that is. Can't wait to read her next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, quick read","review":"I really liked this book. I enjoyed the disjointed feel of the chapters and character development. I thought Alex was hillarious. I haven't really goten into the whole \\"chick lit\\" scene, but this I believe I will read more after this!I do find it a little funny though that a book about copy editors would misspell a literary reference so easy to check as Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth Bennet's name has one \\"t\\", not two. I know that is being picky, but I found it funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok book","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book and was let down by it. I thought the character of \\"Maya\\" was completely unnessary and slowed things down. If her part was eliminated then there could have been more development of other characters.I would have liked to have found out what happened to Allison the psycho and to see if Deila ever got her raise. Not to mention, what happened with Alex and his degree.The plot that the girls have going is interesting and I find myself hoping that it will really work, then you get the bombshell about Marguarite (which is great) so you don't know how to cheer. And, the twist with Jane completely hit me by surprise! I would think the book would have moved faster if, like I said before, the character of Maya were eliminated. The author could have stretched out the \\"plot\\" against Jane a little more. It also would have been interesting to see what other things Deila dug up on people."},{"rating":"1","title":"What characters? What plot?","review":"Of all the \\"chick lit\\" books I have read, this was the only that I did not want to read quickly or completely. The fact that there was no character development is the only thing that spurred me to continue-I kept hoping the author would let me know the main character at some time. If this book was published by Red Dress Ink, I may as well take a few months and write some of my own dribble to be sent into Red Dress so that I can make some quick cash like Lynn Messina did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made Knock Off of The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have never been so thorougly disappointed in a book! The character of Vig has absolutely no substance and I couldn't even get halfway through this book. Normally I can get through a book in two days with my commuting, so I kept waiting for something remotely funny or even remotely interesting as I turned the pages, but alas - this book didn't do it for me. One thing this did do for me is put me to sleep on the train, so it helped with my cat naps on my way to and from work! I was so disinterested, I left it on the train for someone else to catch a few zzzzzzzzzzz's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaad!","review":"I usually enjoy chick lit books, although I know they aren't great literature, but I couldn't finish this piece of drivel. It's badly written, and the situations and characters presented are very unbelievable. Don't bother with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst book I have ever read","review":"I can't even say what it was about, as there was no plot. I think that my 3 year old neice can write more compelling stories. If the author reads this review, can you please try and explain what this book was about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the russian mindset explored","review":"americans, so often victim of their mirror-imaging when trying to figure out other peoples and their decision making, seem to have a problem to adequately reckon the 'otherness of others'. the russian mindset has been - mostly because of the cold war emerging after yalta and potsdam, but even prior to it, and thereafter still - been more baffling then clear to americans of all social and political strata. what could be made up by living in russia for a few years, or perhaps reading the collected works of solshenyzin and co. can be, with a certain focus on the topic at hand, made up by reading this book the scientific rigidity of which is belied by the flowing and even gripping reading it makes for. i have not many a book so compelling in dealing with a topic that may well be considered to be a bit dry otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silver and leather bracelet","review":"The leather broke away from the silver as soon as I tried to open the clasp.

Too difficult to get on and off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marty's freshest, most original album yet. Worth the wait.","review":"Marty Party has abandoned the last refuges of his adolescence and has grown up on this album. He's written a lean yet rich thematic album, lushly produced by Tony Brown, with powerful guest appearances by Earl Scruggs and Johnny Cash.I bought this album one week ago and find myself humming a number of verses of different songs; I can identify with many of the lyrics and moods of the characters. Marty probes the emotional psyche far beyond the typical contemporary country songs which all too often focus on pop melodies and not the lyrics.This really is an album about redemption, hitting bottom and coming back, maybe by soneone who's been there himself.Congratulations, Marty."},{"rating":"2","title":"carol's Pilgrim Review","review":"The Pilgrim is a CD full of treasures disguised as songs that tell a true story written by Mr. Marty Stuart. He is such a brilliant artist, and he amazes me with all of the things he has accomplished. I wish him all the best. Thanks, Carol Slemmer. Ramona, CA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Haunting, Rowdy, Wonderful","review":"For years the only thing I knew about Marty Stuart was that he sang a few rowdy, beer drinking songs with Travis Tritt. I liked the songs just fine but was not particularly impressed with Marty. I bought this CD on a whim, and I am glad I did. It is the best CD I have purchased in years.My favorite singers are Emmylou Harris, Dwight Yoakam and, now, Marty Stuart. Don't expect to hear the pop/country that is played on country radio. If that is what you are looking for you will be disappointed. But, if you are looking for country with a soul, this is the CD for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"The almost perfect country concept album?","review":"Not since I first heard Willie Nelson's \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" way back when have I been so totally overwhelmed by a first listening of a country album. Like a prior reviewer, I have been a fan of Marty's for a long time through his Hillbilly Rock stage, but one always knew that there was something beyond the commercial type music he was making. This proves it. To quote Yogi Berra, there is \\"deep depth\\" here in the lyrics and musicianship. If Nashville would sit up and listen to this and realize that the real country fans are sick of the same old sound, maybe there would be more risk takers and less \\"Life of Chris Gaines.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art that will touch your heart and soul.","review":"This was the best surprise I have had in a long time. I recieved the cd as a gift and didnt recognize any of the songs but I love Marty Stuart and I was sure it would be good. Good is not a word to describe the heartfelt love in this project. I read the cd cover and could not wait to put it on I havent taken it out of my cd player since I put it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a gem.","review":"I think Marty Stuart's CD, \\"The Pilgrim\\", is a once-in-a-lieftime CD. It's like a diamond with its many facets. As you hold a diamond up to the light, you can see many colors. Everytime you listen to this CD, you'll hear something different. I think this shows the depth of Marty's passion for country music the way it should be...not the way it is today. HATS OFF TO MARTY STUART!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful thematic country album","review":"Marty Stuart has built this album around the true hometown story of a tragic love affair and how it affected the life of one of it's principals. While this CD follows a story, each song stands on its own and this makes the album wear well over repeated listenings. I thought ahh, after I hear this story 3 or 4 times I'll be sick of it, but that has not been the case at all. Musically it includes a wide variety of country styles from powerhouse strings to solo mandolin jammin'. I enjoyed \\"Observations of a Crow\\", a quirky laid-back number in which the Pilgrim rates one line only. Ralph Stanley picks a little bluegrass, and Johnny Cash reads a little poetry in a Moody Blues kind of turn at the end. Several other guests pop up along the way, adding to the country-wide feel. Old, new, fast, slow; you've got it all here. And it's good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Country","review":"I bought this cd based on the other reviews.Thank you everyone.This is country. Simple, clean, killer tone, fine picken, soulful performing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Heater","review":"I've only run this heater to test it but it puts out a helluva lot of heat very fast with no kerosene fumes smell. The price I got from my vendor was fantastic, everyone else has it listed much higher. Later I ordered the remote cord thermostat but haven't gotten it yet. It should prove to be a good emergency heat source as well as general purpose cold weather heater for working outside. It should work well to thaw frozen pipes also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"A concept album this is not. When we think of a concept album we think of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", Styx \\"Kilroy Was Here\\", or Moody Blues \\"Days of Future Past.\\"That being said, this is a band defining album. It is reminiscent of U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\" or REM's \\"Automatic for the People.\\" It is the work of a mature band that reached the pinnacle creativity, fluidity and cohesiveness.I have always liked Jars of Clay, even through some of their more \\"challenged\\" works. Good Monstors, however, rises above all previous outings. Although the CD is not filled with radio-worthy diddies, it is rich with musical depth and character. From beginning to end, it is a work of art, with the climax coming from Leigh Nash's performance on \\"Mirrors & Smoke\\".This CD is a must have for the Jars fan. This is also the album for the listerner that is searching for only those CDs that rise above the Top 40 pablum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning new record from Jars of Clay!","review":"Jars just keeps getting better! I have followed the band since their self-titled debut in 1995, and they have never failed to challenge and surprise me with their music. IMO, from top to bottom, this record is their best yet. Beautiful, haunting melodies, fantastic musicianship, deep introspective lyrics that actually mean something. A very rich, multi-faceted concept album that explores finding grace in a world of suffering, the universal search for meaning, and finding peace in the moment . This record was recently named \\"record of the year\\" for 2006 by CCM magazine - No wonder! Even though this is a \\"christian\\" record, it is excellent by any standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year!!!","review":"Five Stars are not even close to being enough for Good Monsters. I read all the reviews and I would have to agree that this is one of Jars of Clays BEST!!! I cannot get the songs out of my head. I wake up every morning with OH MY GOD lyrics in my head. When I buy a CD there are only a couple of songs that I like but with Jays of Clay I can listen to all there cds all day long and not get board. I really recommend this one, you will love it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Jars of Clay CD","review":"My sister introduced me to this CD and after months of having her CD in my car player I decided it was past time for me to have a copy of my own. I love the lyrics and the beautiful music and how challenging the songs are. I admit that there are a few repetitive songs on the album, but not enough for me to put this one to the side."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best JOC albums to date","review":"It's amazing how Jars of Clay manages to get their message across without being overly preachy. It's very refreshing to have music that my four year old can sing along to without offending his grandma.The whole album is quite strong, but our favorites are Dead Man, Good Monsters, All My Tears, and Even Angels Cry.I recommend this album to anyone, Christian or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good Monsters","review":"I got \\"good monsters\\" for Christmas and I LOVE IT!!!!!! my favorite song is \\"deadman(carry Me)\\".Theres really not much else to say except Jars of Clay are AWESOME!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jars of Clay continues to rock","review":"Good Monsters may have to grow on some classic jars fans...but it is still a great album. It's got a little more rock than your used to, but the band always finds a way to change their style without sacrificing anything. \\"Work\\" stands out as a great opener and \\"Dead Man\\" is a good single. I'm always more interested in the \\"B\\" sides of an album. \\"All my Tears\\" and \\"There is a River\\" do not dissappoint in this category. If you are a Jars fan buy the album...if not still give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Okay, so I thought that they couldn't top many of their albums like Eleventh Hour and Redemption Songs, but I was completely wrong! This album has blown my expectations out of the water as each song gets me to say, \\"Wow this is a great album!\\" It brings back some of the rockish sound they've had before, but it really is still their own harmonic based style. They've sculpted some great music in this album and I ask that if you enjoy great and uplifting music, do your musical taste a favor and buy this stunning album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the ALBUM OF THE YEAR","review":"What more can a Dove and Grammy-laden band achieve? Jars of Clay is no longer constrained by needing to prove anything. With Good Monsters, they go against the grain with a delightfully unexpected concept album; an intricate and masterful mix of styles that fit together in a platinum-bound puzzle. This is not a typical Jars of Clay album, except that it's typically brilliant. It's early yet to be naming this the album of the year, but it will surely be in contention.Full song by song review available at SockSpider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"The bad news: \\"Jars of Clay\\", \\"Much Afraid\\", and even \\"If I Left the Zoo\\" spoiled JoC fans rotten. \\"Good Monsters\\" doesn't quite recapture the high quality of JoC's first two or three CDs.The good news: The first track alone makes this album worth your while and is certainly far superior to most Christian music being made today. Along with \\"Work\\", other highlights are \\"Dead Man (Carry Me)\\" and the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"best JoC in a long time","review":"It sounds like they don't care what they used to sound like - or, maybe I should say what people think they should sound like.

The Jars are so incredibly talented and inspirational, too. This one will appeal to younger (teenage) listeners too, since it's got a rocker kind of edge to a lot of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jars Brilliantly Re-Invent Themselves Once Again!","review":"This album is simply a testimony to the band's commitment to sharing messages of peace and self-reflection through music with mass-appeal.

I love their music.My personal favorite is Dead Man (Carry Me). It is crafted to perfection. But all the tracks are very strong.

Do you think down South, railroads, and art-deco jazz? Matt Wignall and Co. says you should. This disc is a back-porch kind of journey, an easy-going shuffle. Havalina doesn't get ruffled, even though their music can hit the blues (Things), and they can throw out a couple jams (One Day, Train Song). One Day, by the way, is an awesome romp of a track, with Wignall mumbling and crying out his way through an old-time rocker. If it had been cleaned up and given some more tracking, it might've been a radio hit. Thank goodness it wasn't, though, and the whole disc stays true to their unique sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, refreshingly different","review":"I love this Group and this is their best album. It is really hard to compare Havalina to anyone else. They just have their own sound. As I understand it, these guys started out as street performers. This title has retained some of that sound. They are always trying for something new in each song, and whatever they do is always fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"I can't believe my eyes at all of the good reviews people are giving this movie.

This film was a box-office smash but that doesn't mean the movie is good. It just means people like to watch silly garbage. The special effects is why I give this movie two stars, everything else is pretty boring. Of course, you have Robin Williams over-acting again, he hasn't done a flawless performance since, One Hour Photo. This movie is designed for children so I recommend this movie to them.

Everyone enjoyed the movie from my 26 year old son to the 8 year old son, Mom and Dad, too. Nothing objectionable from a parental point of view and that is very rare these days. A BLOCKBUSTER film, no....but still lots of good clean laughs. For the rest of the week we were together for the holidays, the boys all kept repeating one liners from the movie. Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs are fabulous. Loved Robin Wiliams as Teddy Roosevelt. In short, \\"BULLY for Night at the Museum!\\" Thanks for a family movie that really is a FAMILY MOVIE. When it is available on DVD it will be purchased for our movie library. Our older son said he would be buying it as well for his family collection as well.

It was simple, funny and well done. It wasn't silly. It made you wish that you were there at the museum with Ben Stiller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids loved this","review":"No, it isn't perfect. There are juvenile jokes and done-before bits. The bottom line is, I took my 4 children to this movie - and they are aged 9, 11, 16, and 23 - and all of them were entertained. That alone is worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 1 curse word or sex scene!!!!","review":"I am so impressed that there was no bad language or sex in the movie. I am not sure if the mom had a live in boyfriend or not but if she did they didn't focus on it so your kid may not even pay attention to it. Being a Ben Stiller movie it was not as funny as I expected because I was expecting a laugh all the way through and loud movie but it was a normal comedy. I am giving it a 5 star rating because it had top-notch actors and the creators and actors were able to keep it clean, something rare in the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the whole family & Spectacular HD!","review":"Night at the Museum is a little slow and boring in the beginning, but the rest of the movie is fantastic. Ben Stiller is comedic without overdoing it, unlike Jim Carrey's style. The storyline captures both adults and children. This blu-ray transfer is phenomenal; the picture quality is crisp and vibrant, and the sound quality is top-notch. You won't do it justice unless you get this in blu-ray. You don't need an action flick to showcase your high definition entertainment center-Night at the Museum really delivers. Having two kids, this movie has a high replay value for me, although I can see myself skipping the first chapter or two..."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Fun Family Film'","review":"Though some adults might yawn in a few spots, I found this movie to be great family fun appropriate for children under thirteen. It was a great breather from my menu of horror flicks and lowered my blood pressure very quickly. Stiller is fantastic as a dad who hasn't quite found his 'dream job' yet. When his visitation rights depend on steady employment, he's not in a position to 'bolt' for the door when he finds out his night watchman job at the museum includes watching over live exhibits.Chrissy K.

First, smash the DVD of this to oblivion and then whack yourself on your bean several times for being such a knob. Dumbness, lameness, lousy acting mixed with a lousy plot and marginal purpose to OK computer generated action sequences. Whap yourself again if you ever think of this terrible movie again.

Don't get me wrong, the movie was funny, and probably the best comedy I have seen in a long time, but I don't think it is worth seeing over and over. The acting was great and the special effects were outstanding. Ben Stiller, I believe, was absolutely perfect for the leading role.I'm reminding you that this is a review; therefore it is an opinion. With this I am saying that this movie is not as good as most people say, but is still pretty good, not to mention funny.Overall I think this movie deserves 2 stars. If you purchase this movie, don't get your hopes up for it being flat out great, but know this film is pretty darn funny and exciting.So, I hope this review was helpful to you.

I am a big fan of Ben Stiller and I have watched many movies with the same theme of \\"divorced parents with a child and the wife tells her ex to get his act together or else he can't see the kid anymore\\"!...whew!! This premise was done a million times better in Mrs. Doubtfire and Liar Liar. You know your in trouble when the funniest joke in the movie is a monkey urinating on someone! The jokes really fall flat in this really stupid and boring movie. Didn't Robin Williams learn from \\"Jumanji\\"!? Look! I am not a harsh critic when it comes to \\"dumb dumb\\" comedies like this(I kinda like them too!),but this one just isn't funny at all!....it's just corny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Stiller can't act.","review":"The movie would have been a lot better without Ben Stiller. Ben Stiller ruined the whole movie with his lame acting. He also does a lot of yelling and stumbling around. The movie is fun for 5 year olds but for adults it is pretty boring. Nobody cares about a dinosaur running around because we already saw that in a better movie called Jurassic Park. The movie would have been a lot better with a good actor like Will Ferral,Steve Carell,or Jim Carrey. Don't buy this movie just rent it at Blockbuster or somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie!!","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"History comes alive!","review":"This is a very enjoyable movie where Ben Stiller takes a job as a night watchman at a historical museum, and gets more than he expects when the sun goes down. The movie teaches how you shouldn't give up when things get out of hand. Great for kids, but parents will enjoy, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all","review":"This is a very funny movie with many elements that make it so. There are consistently funny parts throughout the entire film which kept me interested the entire time. The blu-ray disc specifically looks spectacular on a 1080p display, the colors are rich and vibrant, and the sound field is brilliant with the rear speakers constantly lit up. My only issue is the cliche or joke that people in new york have seen everything, and that nothing surprizes them. This joke has been done in many many many movies, and Night at the Museum is the prime example. Other than that, this is a great family movie, that all ages can enjoy and laugh at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun at the museum","review":"When I saw previews for this movie, I thought it looked great.

I remember my parents seeing this at the theatre while I saw Hannibal Rising. This was on tv, so I decided to watch it and I thought it was really good and very funny! Larry Daley is a divorced dad who can't keep a job. He tries being a night guard at the American Museum of Natural History. He soon finds out that at night, everything comes to life, including a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, Theodore Roosevelt, Roman General Octavius, a little cowboy named Jedediah, Sacagawea, Neanderthals, Attila the Hun, Christopher Columbus, Moai and many others. When the Tablet of Ahkmenrah is stolen, Larry must get it back so the statues can continue to come to life.

Their hellspawn child.. no!However, this role was the one this child-like actor was born to play. As I was watching this film it occurred to me that the reason why I disliked most of Ben Stiller's movies was because they were juvenile delinquencies supposedly aimed at an older audience. With this one, Ben throws his hands up in the air and admits, \\"OK, I give up! It's for kids!! So Sue me!\\"Stiller, Owen Wilson, Robin Williams, Patrick Gallagher and even the under-appreciated Steve Coogan (who will make you laugh out loud more than once with his Monty Python-esque performance) join forces with the classic Dick Van Dyke (!) and Mickey Rooney (!!) to make this a highly addictive rollicking good fun family fantasy classic.Lock the doors, make sure the kids are comfortable and pass the popcorn! You will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"To all who are NOT fans of Ben Stiller","review":"I'll say it right up front, I have never liked Ben Stiller or his movies. However, this one is an exception. So those of you who are like me, do yourselves a favor and watch this movie. It's funny, decent and an overall good time.

The T-Rex wants to play fetch, Teddy Roosevelt wants to woo a Native American guide away from Lewis & Clark, a monkey plays tricks, and all sorts of historical figures get animated including an Ancient Egyptian mummy. Larry has to figure out how to manage all the antiquities from getting out of hand before his predeccessors steal an ancient Egyptian relic and pin it on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family fun","review":"This movie is what one would expect a PG family movie to be. No real surprises, a predictable plot and watchable acting. Still the movie was humorous and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every kid's dream","review":"Ben Stiller matures a lot as an actor in this family comedy. Night at the Museum has a predictable plot, but with the fun of watching Stiller rise above the inane, and Robin Williams hamming it up as TR, it delivers outstanding family entertainment. Steve Coogan as the mini-Roman centurion, Octavius, Owen Wilson as petite cowboy Jedediah, and Patrick Gallagher as a full-sized Attila the Hun, lend strong comic support. Museum relies heavily upon special effects and physical humor, but never stoops to slapstick, dirty jokes, or offensive language. The museum setting itself, with Central Park for a change of scene, is vast and stunning. The dream of every kid who has ever stood in awe before a tyrannosaurus skeleton or an Egyptian mummy comes vividly to life in this non-stop, imaginative adventure. Who says history has to be dull? Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the right blend of slapstick and great writing","review":"A movie that I'm willing to watch repeatedly with my daughter. Plenty of catchy writing and slapstick fun. With a bit of sweetness and a message worth discussing at the end with your kids. Definitely a Friday nite family fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real family film!","review":"We couldn't wait to buy this DVD. We so rarely find a film worth owning, and this is a true, family film. Considering the past films many of the featured actors have done, it is a wonder that they all participated in G-rated entertainment, and that their particular comedic personalities were not muted (well, Robin Williams had to be...). This conservative family freely recommends this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun-Filled Fantasy","review":"I love this movie. Both adults and kids will love this movie.

Ben Stiller never fails to amuse me in just about anyhing he's done. It got a bad rap from critics, and, aside from a slow start to establish the premise, the resulting film is a riotous display of actors having FUN with their material. Probably would be enjoyed much more by kids, but there are good lessons (and education) to be learned, and that's always a good thing. The little guy who played the son was especially good, a real natural. Also, good to see Carla Gugino again. And Ben is as adorable as ever.

Roosevelt\\" when he states oh I am only a wax figure made in ? what can you expect out of me I never did any of those things.(cannal,hunting, ect) What's the piont.I bought it because the previews were funny.

I reluctantly rented it but am now glad I did. Has a bit of everything: action, drama, and even the beautiful heroine whom Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt gets in the end. I truly loved the character of Theodore Roosevelt in this movie - the wise and confident guide - very strong performance indeed. Strong message indeed that really hits home:1. We all have a purpose and mission in this life that is much greater than ourselves as selfish and oftentimes lost individuals.2. Perform random acts of kindness, help and serve others and it will come back to you 10-fold.Rent this movie. You won't regret it. Also, Night At The Museum 2 is coming out in 2009. It will take place at the Smithsonian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie not blu-ray quality","review":"When you purchase a blu-ray you expect the exceptional video and audio quality that makes a DVD look horrendous the night at the museum blu-ray did not live up to these expectations.

I recommend saving your money and purchasing the standard DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family movie","review":"I saw this movie at the theatre and was pleasantly surprised at how creative it was. It's a great way to get the whole family thinking about historic figures and encourages everyone's imaginations. Don't be put off by this thinking it's just a typical Ben Stiller movie. It has a lot of known actors in it. I can't wait to buy this on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"History becomes alive at the Museum of Natural History","review":"Great family movie for all ages. Besides a history lesson, morale and ethics are addressed in a fun adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bully for dum-dum","review":"This movie was the biggest comedy of 2006, and deservedly so. The storyline, though not entirely original, comes pretty close; a museum whose displays come to life at night. The casting is great, and features four top comedians from the past 50 years; Ben Stiller of the 21st century, Robin Williams from the 1980s and 1990s, Mickey Rooney from the 1970s, and Dick Van Dyke from the 1960s. The visual effects are quite impressive, but are not extravagant, and best of all, the comedy is quite original. Whether it is the T-Rex who wants to play fetch, or the Easter Island statue who chews gum, the movie is packed with many original jokes, gags, and slapstick. And the movie is clean; no bad language, no sex, no drugs or alcohol, and all the violence is slapstick. Great movie for the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Rollicking Ride","review":"This was one fun movie. It starts with unstable Larry who is about to lose visitation rights if he doesn't get a regular job and settle down a bit. He winds up working at the museum of natural history only to find out that everything in the museum comes to life every night.My favorite was the T Rex that acted like a canine, absolutely hilarious! It took Larry some doing along with trial and error and a little help from his \\"friends\\" but he foils a robbery and reinstates peace at the museum. This movie is suitable for nearly all ages as it's not really scary and no vulgarity. Needless to say, I watch it again, and again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!

Pencil are harder, and \\"grab\\" the paper easily, so you control your writing.For pens and markers, this paper is a nightmare. Pens seem to be hard to write with on the Mead college paper. They tend to go off, and lose track, making you have to write slowly so the pen won't go in different directions.

You have to wonder if SEP had the time to put into the production that it needed. It sounds raw & maybe that's the way he wanted it but this style of hard rock would benifit more from a much larger/louder sound.

And that is what you get with \\"The List.\\" It's entertaining, engaging, and delivers what I expected. Sure - it's not going to win any literary prizes. But I think other reviewers are too harsh on this front. Martini writes entertaining fiction. This was worth the price of a movie ticket, as I got the same amount of entertainment value, if not more. As for the plot, I thought I had it figured out a few times, but there were just enough twists to keep me going almost to the end. Overwriting of characters? Maybe. But isn't that true of much entertainment? A good read for a tired mind. I was also entertained by the insider look at publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martini should have used a pen name ...","review":"Acting on the quality of his other books, I purchased The List without so much as a glance at the rear cover. Motivated by the sunk cost of the purchase and the lingering taste of his better efforts, I stayed with it to the bitter end. The List is terrible. Overly dramatized characters and unlikely dialogue are ever-present distractions as Martini struggles to hold scene sketches together with baling wire. Attempting to disguise a future plot twist, he includes scenes which must later be forgotten if the reader is to accept the book's conclusion. I lost my 'impulse purchase' trust in Martini ... I'll most certainly read the dust jacket before investing in his next tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"The List Not Worthy of Its Title","review":"The premise of a thriller revolved around the greed and egos of writers and money-grabbers trying to make The Bestseller List was intriguing. Martini ruins it by creating predictable outcomes at every turn, including the best friend turned killer, the man with a dark past turned lover, and the intelligent writer turned brains of mush. The hard-working writer claws her way into the publishing world, creates a multi-million dollar best-seller, then turns everything over to a man she hires as a front, jumps into bed with him, suspects he's trying to kill her, then feels great about him after the real killer is caught! And we're supposed to accept all of this! This book cannot possibly make \\"The List\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyperbolic characters.","review":"I felt the Madriani novels were 6's to 8's.This gets a 4 because all the characters were exaggerated...very much like a comic book. Martini is also trying his hand with a little humor, and it doesn't work. He would be well advised to stick to his strength-Courtroom drama. Please Martini, if you're going to fool around with character development and dialogue, read more Elmore Leonard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Judge A Book By It's Cover","review":"On the front cover of the Australian version of this book, is what my friends would call an \\"Italian Stallion\\". My mother always taught me two things that could have saved me from wasting my time with this book:1. Never ever judge a book by it's cover.2. If you have read a book by the same author (The Judge) and hated it, the chances are you will hate their next one.Too true, I was a fool to expect the plot of this book to be as intresting and mind blowing as the sexy stud on the front cover. I probably could have save myself a lot of time, if instead I got my literary kicks out of some trashy magazine, like Woman's Day. Because at least the articles in it, are better written than any Steve Martini book will ever be.Warning: Looks can be decieving, never buy a book because the front cover is apealing. Don't be a fool like me and at least read the burb"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacation reading!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The only other book I have read by Steven Martini was The Judge, and I definitely enjoyed this one more. It was an insight into the world of publishing.

I belived somethings more amazing,maybe better if shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from an otherwise brilliant novelist","review":"As a novelist myself who is a fan of Steve Martini, I was dismayed and let down by The List. He seemed to have dashed it off in a hurry, giving us a cliched formula plot with too predictable, hackneyed scenes and not very interesting characters. Research was also lacking in some areas. Steve: stick to the court room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring is all I can say!!","review":"This is probably one of the slowest books I've ever read. If you want to know everything there is to know about publishing a book, then you will like this book, but I could care less. He goes into too many details about \\"the trials\\" of publishing and not enough about the mystery and storyline. I kept thinking, who cares, what's the point!!!??? The story line is pretty lame. A lawyer who is a part time writer becomes disillusioned with the publishing world. She writes a best seller and hires this mystery man, who is actually a mercenary, to be pretend he's the writer. Of course he is wildly popular with his good looks, give me a break! This is definately not one of his better books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Having a Martini with Martini","review":"Okay, so I have been reading the other on-line reviews of this novel and they seem pretty mixed. I would like to sit down with Steve and have a Martini and congratulate him.I personally thought that the book was a very entertaining page turner. I am a little confused about how everyone else says that they knew who the killer was from the beginning. Martini kept me guessing until the very end. It was one of the very first books that I have ever read that I didn't predict the outcome of. I thought, although it might not be a piece of literary artwork, that Martini did a fine job. He is a very engaging author. He kept me on the edge of my seat...turning pages as fast as I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read more Martini","review":"The List was an excellent novel. By keeping the characters simple to understand, he was able to maintain a fast pace throughout the book. I am new to reading this author, but this particular book was a joy to read. The backdrop, the publishing industry, is not a common theme. I was blown away by what it would actually take for a good story to make it to the top. If I ever finish my first novel, I hope I don't have to follow Abby's path to stardom."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"This is a very good book and is a very interesting read. A female lawyer has written an excellent book, one that will make a lot of money, but she has given the author a male's name. Now she wants to find a male to pretend to be the author.

I'm a very hard to please reader.Steve Martini has done a truly wonderful job with thisbook. I had to keep telling myself that the book was writtenby a man not a woman. Amazing insight! And what knowledge of his explosives-he definitely did his homework.Finally, suspence, romance, and best of all a happyending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Martini book; I like the Madriani books better.","review":"I've read all of Martini's books and enjoy his Paul Madrianicharacter. This book is definitely different, with a femaleleadcharacter, and many insider literary references.I have to admit I was surprised, and disappointed by theending. The book was a real page-turner, but I felt letdown by the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"I winced throughout the book","review":"Too many cliches and stereotypic characters. The story either dragged or raced. The pacing was really off. I think it would have been better if some of the foreshadowing had not been included. It made the ending too predictable. I would like to know how long it took the author to write this book. It seemed he was in a hurry to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex's Awesome Alphabet","review":"The List, by Steve Martini is a very exciting and thrilling book. It has murders and mysteries, and also goes into a detail on other subjects. For instance, the main idea is that an unkown author writes a book that has the potential to become a best seller. The author, being older, thought it would be better to write the book under a pen name. She tells only her closest friends, but when one of them is murdered she begins to worry. She now has to trust the man that she thinks killed her friend. This book is very good, with an ending to die for; I never would have guessed what had happened. I would suggest this book to many people, because it was a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par","review":"A less-than-enthralling story. From the very start, I was totally unable to respect Abby for thinking she was doing the right thing by pulling a Remington Steele with her book, and the prose got in the story's way on numerous occasions. Plus, the plot was full of holes and inconsistencies--for one example, when the literary agent gushes over the book's \\"insight into the female mind,\\" and a hundred-ish pages later Abby mulls over the \\"strong male voice\\" of her book. The action scenes at the end were well-written and suspenseful, though, so all was not lost. But it's hard to care how it ends when you don't care about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending ruins the story.","review":"The ending is improbable. It made me angry that I had wasted time reading this book. The first part of the book was pretty interesting, but the ending was contrived. In order to have an ending that wasn't obvious, we are given an ending that is not credible. I had read The Judge and liked it -- even though I thought its ending was a little contrived. This was much worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The List?","review":"I was so disappointed with this Martini book. The villain was obvious from the beginning, the characters not at all defined and the plot just boring. I didn't even get the title. What has happened to Steve Martini?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I bought this book because it was one of the few books in English at a foreign airport, so I did not expect much. It was much worse than I'd anticipated, though. The writing was hilariously bad, and the outcome was obvious long before the end of the book. All in all, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it zero stars","review":"I can't believe the high ratings this book is getting! The plot is thin and predictable. Steve Martini has done no research at all (passports are not required to leave from Puerto Rico, as it is part of the US). The characters are one-dimensional and stupid. I mean, c'mon, a lawyer that does not want to know what her lawyer is doing? Only in potboiler hell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic, TV movie storyline at best","review":"It's too bad that The List isn't a better book because Steve Martini has the gifts for conversation, suspense and pacing. But you can tell he has Grisham-envy as The List reads like a script for a TV Movie of the week and unfortunately has all the cliches to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"British Military History AD 300-1100","review":"This book has virtually nothing to do with the 'Arthurian' period, much less literature. It generally focuses on giving a brief overview of British arms, armor, and armies between the later days of the Roman occupation to the eve of the Norman conquest.

I am a classy guy and this paper fits all those guys/girls who like being classy. The day I walked into the classroom with this paper I held my head high and was proud of myself. My teacher told us to take out a piece of paper. I slowly took out my 5 Star Reinforced paper while all the other kids were pulling out normal paper. After the assignment I put in a 1 inch binder.

Outstanding conducting, strong cast (not a weak spot anywhere) and fine sound. No libretto of course but the band by band synopsis is fine. It lacks a superstar singer (e.g. Siepi, Price, DellaCasa) but it really is a very good performance and a strong 4-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on in it's warm inside","review":"This is a FANTASTIC heater but there are some things a new buyer should be aware of. It'll bring a 30x60x12 garage from 0 to 60 in about an hour and a half. However you really do need a 100 lb tank. You can get away with a 40 or 50 lb heating a smaller area on low otherwise the tanks will condense and shut off the gas flow to the heater. They are louder than you'd expect if you haven't used one of these before because of the blower fan. Think mini jet. I've also used the convection style heaters and depending on your needs these are both great. The convection style is much quieter but takes a fair bit longer to heat a large space and you won't get as even a heat in the room.

This author handled the plot in such a way that the reader forgot he was reading a book, but instead, imagined himself really living the story. This is the mark of an exceptional writer. One had to sympathize with Angela and hurt for the terrible things that was happening to her. Once again, the skillful author, Marion Landry, stirred up our emotions and tore us apart, only to calm them and put them back in order with a happy ending, when Angela finds someone that will make her happy the rest of her days. This is the type of story I like to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Gilgamesh?","review":"I picked up this book expecting a great read, since I love the Gilgamesh epic--and was I ever shocked and appalled! Grundy has taken one of literature's greatest epics and warped it into a gay love story! Gilgamesh and Enkidu as eternal lovers! Not in the translations of the epic I read in literature class and on my own. He really missed the boat on this one, or maybe he thought modern readers could not or would not read a more faithful rendition of the tale. Or maybe it is just political correctness run amuck. The classic themes of man versus nature, friendship and loyalty, and human mortality have been sadly eclipsed in this version. Needless to say, I could not finish the book. My advice is to stick to the original versions of Gilgamesh out there, particularly the verse rendition by Danny Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing version","review":"Reading Grundy's new novel is comparable to visiting a gold-plated outhouse--its fabulous to look at outside but it sure stinks inside. It is certainly a well-written book, but his revision and literary license leave me puzzled and more than a little disturbed. Why the homosexual themes and scenes? Why tinker with story events and characters that were already sublime in the original texts? I guess I am too old to tolerate having gay political agenda shoved down my throat. This should have been a great retelling of a great epic, not a writer's egocentric need to flaunt his new, hip revision. What I find most dismaying is that people who have not read the other translations will read this and think this is a true rendition. Not so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time.","review":"This reads like a very bad Harlequin Romance set in Sumeria. Bad research, bad writing, bad plot.

I wasn't dissapointed, but was a bit surprised at parts of it. As the other reviws say, a main part of the plot is his relationship with Enkidu.I felt totally drawn into the world of ancient Sumeria....the rich detailed descriptions of temples, cerimonies, sexuality, people interacting with each other are all so well done. The Ensi's journey from rash, impulsive youth in love with his power, to the man who has been through trials and peril is so thoroughly enchanting.

The last half of the book is Mr. Graham's diatribe of how for the past 2000 years, all of Christendom has misunderstood what is written. But fortunately for us, Mr. Graham explains it all to us. I wish this book had been a little longer. It's obvious that he has done his research concerning the origins, but he makes many leaps in logic.

Rather than paying homage to the classic Kaiju era in a reverent satire, DEATH KAPPA reduces itself to an idiotic spoof that is continually brought down by its sophomoric screenplay and dulled sense of humor. Director Tomo'o Haraguchi intentionally reveals the wires carrying the model planes, the false backdrops, and the cheapness of his scale miniatures for laughs, but each weakened attempt to poke fun at the genre falls flat due to the poor production quality and complete lack of wit. The horrendous costume designs for the two leading monsters do nothing to help, either.

Adam is a 17 year old high school student who daydreams a lot, and one day witnesses a murder. With the help of his friend Leroy, he is able to face the fear and realize his dreams at the same time. The movie tends to go off in tangents with a lot of scenes of Adam's daydreams. There are so many of them, that they tend to interupt the flow of the plot.

There is a little gas smell but nothing like the kerosene heaters I've used and really not a problem to me. The reason for 2 stars rather than 4 is the hose that comes with this product does not have the connectors to work with a regular 20 lb propane container. I had to run off to Home Depot to BUY a gas grill hose to the tune of $15. How hard can it be to either explain that you need a different hose or supply one?

I tested my airport without the base and now it works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must to have for Airport Exprtess","review":"I bought second airport express stand because1. Airport Express should be placed higher place than AC OUTLET position.I could locate it the best position with the base!!!2. It connects with USB and Ethernet thus, without this device the express can not be stable to place.3. Easy to see the status indication !!!I recommend you to have the stand with Airport Express !!!Cheers !!!T.Aoki"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"This product is nice but I feel it is expensive for what it does. Basically it's a piece of plastic that sits on your desk, has an AC adaptor that plugs into the wall, and has the custom Apple connection for power where you can set your AirPort Express. You can accomplish basically the same thing by using one of the custom Apple extension cords that come with the Apple laptops. However if you don't have one of those, have the money, and want your AirPort Express on your desk for whatever reason, it's a worthwhile buy.You do have to push a bit for the AirPort Express to sit properly in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good additional to Airport Express","review":"This allows me to move the Express around, clearing the outlet space for other items. The cord retainer is nice because it keeps things clean. This is a solid addition to an Airport Express setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the price","review":"Works well as described by others.....would look a bit neater if cables were not almost sticking out the top of the express as it sits in the base....but looks good and matches the wireless unit perfectly. At $18, a fairly good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tip","review":"I bought this tip to compliment my 2010 Jetta TDI after removing the muffler (don't worry, it has a diesel particulate filter and 3 cats so the noise is almost the same as stock). This exhaust tip polishes up really nice and is very heavy and durable. The last stainless steel tip I had started to rust pretty quickly which makes me doubt that it was actually stainless steel. However, this tip has held up nice and shows no signs of rust. The guys at the exhaust shop even complimented my choice and asked where I got it.My only gripe is that the overall length of this tip is 10\\" and not the 13\\" as described by Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This item is good but gets burn from the inside.","review":"this tip looks nice. i installed it on a celica. it doesn't make a difference but it just puts sytle to the car.

The pace was fast, the discriptions vivid, and the characters were belivable. Mr. Hogan is a very crisp writer and nothing is put into the book without a reason. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster towards the end of the book. Thanks for a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful reunion of past and new characters.","review":"This book was another one of LJ Smith's greats. It is the first I read in the NightWorld series and it brought back alll the excite her other series had. This book kept you thinking and brought in all the history of how the vampires and others came to exsist. It made me rush out and buy all the other books in the series I only have 4 to go now. I also loved how the book brought back some of the other characters from the previous books. It made everyone in Night World more connected. I can't wait until the next book comes out, but I hope it's not the end. And for all of you who haven't read Smith's other series I highly recomend all of them especially the Vampire Diaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read!!!","review":"I love this book! I started reading it at midnight one night and could not put it down I stayed up all night reading it! I just could not put it down! I finished at about 6am or 7am. You have to read this book people! It is really worth it! I have to say it is one of the top two books I have ever read and I read alot! I don't even like Vampire books or any books with weird magic or anything in it. But this book it just so Wow! Oh and if you like Romace this is definatly the book for you! I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary addition to the Night World series","review":"I have read many of L.J. Smith's books. The only ones I can give five stars to are the books in the Vampire Diaries series.(They are all must reads). Anyway, Soulmate was a great book for anyone who love vampires in love stories. If you have read any other Night World Books this one is equally as good as the rest and is a necessity for all Night World fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulmate- I take my hat off...","review":"This book is one of the best in the Night World series. I cried when Hannah was makeing her soulmate speech to Therriy. All the books are about a world that doesn't exist, but you wish it did. It is strong, dangerous and beautiful. Lisa Jane Smith draws you into this world until you don't want to leave. She is a great writer! Soulmate is a fast and beautiful book. It has funny moments and heart renching moments. Beautiful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!","review":"This is my favorite Night World book. Something about this book draws in more than any other book in the series--so far. Maybe it's because I love to read about past lives and undying love. I don't know. Even though I am a little tired of the soulmate principle, all the Night World books are excellent. A definite reader! Can't wait till the next one"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best by LJ Smith!","review":"I thought it was one of the best of the Night World series. I really liked how we finally saw Thierry as a person, and not just something everybody talked about. I also liked how human Maya, Thierry, and Hannah all were, although Maya and Thierry were both vampires. It's hard to find good YA books dealing with vampires, etc, that also have characters you can relate to. I also liked her other vampire series, The Vampire Diaries, and the books, Heart of Valor and The Night of the Solstice, which were connected, but never lead any further with those particular characters. I really wish she would have continued the series. I wanted to see Janie get her Staff someday! I can only hope. My advice - read LJ Smith's wonderful serials and hope for more in the future!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!!!","review":"L.J. Smith's Night World is the best, and Soulmate is the Best of the Best. I have read every book in the series and this one is by far my favorite! Thierry was so tragic, I think I fell in love with him! Imagine always having your soulmate die, and her thinking it was you that killed her. It broke my heart. I do wish she had become a vampire in the end, but that would have taken away the beauty of being an Old Soul. I have a hard time seeing why some don't like this book. It is L.J. Smith's best Night World yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlighting","review":"This was a wonderful book.Lisa Jane Smith is an out standing writter and I hope that she continues to write much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADDICTIVE FROM THE START","review":"I loved this book and the others of the Night World. I hate reading and one day my friend handed me secret vampire to read because me and my friends really dig the whole supernatural thing. So any way I was like I hate reading why are you handing me a book. But I had to read it and once I did I couldnt stop. I read the whole book in 5 hours which was the fastest time ever usually books would take me weeks to finish. THESE ARE VERY ADDICTIVE AND WONDERFULLY WRITTEN SO GO L.J SMITH were all waiting for the last on Strange Fate. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE EVERYWHERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disapiontment","review":"I cannot belive that L.J.S. wrote this book!!! Theirry is booring, Hannah is lifeless and the plot unrealistic and full of holes. And Maya is more pitiful than evil. Honestly don't you think living for hundreds of thousands of years would give you more reason to live than to simply kill someone else's girlfreind? And wouldn't Theirry notice who is killing Hannah continually and tht it's not his fault? The best part was when there was all the cameos from other books and that was for only a page. I think anyone who read this book first in the sereis who hate it immeadiatly. There are much better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, I like this one","review":"I like this book mainly because of the fact that we get to meet some of the characters from the earlier books. This is what i want to see more off. It would really be cool to focus more these, and maybe on somebody who just became a vampire, or somebody who has lost their soulmate. Mean, i know, but more interesting, deffinately. Especially because that would allow us to see who that person would go to and love after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear Me Out!!!!","review":"Everyone, hear me out here. I have seen reviews of different Night World books and I was very disappointed of the people who come in here and write disparaging remarks about how old the soulmate principle is. I am really tired of this and i wish that all of you critics go get a life because if you don't like the books, THEN DON'T READ IT! Soulmate happens to be a great novel. So please, find other books to read and don't barge in on here!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY!!!","review":"WONDERFUL story! I still remember it to this day. L. J. Smith is a wonderful writer and this story - I think - is one of her best. The plot is so deep, I have to admit, I got a little tearful :') It's great. It DID take me a while to understand what was going on, but once I did, I couldn't put it down! (not good when you've got school the next morning) All in all, it's a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint-by-the-numbers Hardcore","review":"If you've ever listened to hardcore, you've heard this album before. The grooves are hackneyed, as are the lyrics and the singing style. Nothing here is new, or particularly entertaining. Strongarm, just like almost every other Christian band, simply rehash the formula of their genre. Their second release shows a glint of originality, particularly in the lyrics. It isn't what you'll expect, and it might not be what you like. However, it's better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Friend Freckles","review":"I was able to meet Freckles before the book came out. At that time she was somewhat withdrawn. As time went by and with love and care by Paul and his wife Trish, she has become a warm and loving creature. Now, with the popularity of her (or Paul's) book, she is a shining star. She brings this life to the children she visits.I am biased, but this is truly a magical story of being found, being loved and giving all the love back. It's a story for all children of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!!","review":"FRECKLES IS HEARTWARMING AND INSIGHTFUL!Justin, my six-year-old nephew, read Freckles to me today.

I recorded it, and still have it. This version only runs 95 minutes, and most of the story has been edited out, and many of the details are missing. As an example, the scene where Dr DeForge tells Mary Ashley to go to the pharmacy is missing, not to mention the discovery at the pharmacy. Why couldn't they make this a two tape set, and present a complete version? My own recording is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame to sell half of a movie.","review":"I too, have recorded this movie when it was shown on TV in 2 parts. Unfortunately, my copy didn't turn out too well. Once one has seen all of it, can't emagine half a movie being any good. I thoroughly enjoyed this thriller.

I would be the first to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to watch","review":"The movie was messed up. Must have been scratched or something.

I was disapointed by the Putting Game Bible and feel that it was written to capitolize on his very successful Short Game Bible. The book did not really add anything to my knowledge of putting and seemed wordy as if Peltz was trying to find ways to fill a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting Classic","review":"This book has been around for a long time.

I don't know if reading this book will improve my putting; that has yet to be proven. The text is well written. There are abundant illustrations and the quality of the paper, the binding, the illustrations and photographs are excellent. This is not the kind of book one reads in an evening. There are practical exercises, and one must go to the green and apply what has been read. It is a joy to read, and I have a better understanding of why I am missing those putts. It is my hope with persistence I will improve my game, but lets face it ... the ultimate test is one that involves athletic ability, perception, and the ability to convert intellectual understanding into action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting is Not Rocket Science!","review":"Let's face it, Dave Pelz is the man when you talk short game improvement.But,by God man! this is way to much information.Skip the first 200 pages of this book, unless you're some kind of technical information masochist.The rest of the book is an updated version of \\"Putt Like The Pros\\". Don't get me wrong, I think this book is a great help to anyones putting, just way to long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information - but practical solutions?","review":"First the good news: Pelz will tell you more about what can go right or wrong with a putt than you ever would have imagined. More importantly, he will tell you how to test yourself to see how wrong your mind and body are operating compared with how you think they are operating. Now the bad news: The solutions. I did not open this book looking for a free ride to good putting. But the fact is that in order to improve your fundamentals, he suggests you use a bunch of tools that he has developed. He says 80% of your practice should be indoor practice, working on these fundamentals. I think that's great, but do I really have to buy his stuff? I would have enjoyed more ways to practice these solutions with items I have in my house - that's why I bought his book rather than attended his school or bought his tools. That being said, he has great information, and I expect that the awareness of typical faults alone was worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book for scientists, engineers and librarians!","review":"Once again, Dave Pelz reduces the game to mechanics and physics and ignores the most important aspect of good putting which is freeing your mind from the specific mechanics of the physical stroke.Having said that, this book is chock full of interesting facts, most of them completely useless to the average player who wants to improve his putting. Pelz's book does not address the fact that great putters such as Jones,George Low,Palmer,Stockton, Crenshaw and Faxon have utilized widely different strokes,grips and tempo.What they all had in common was a consistent pre-shot routine,tremendous feel,and supremeconfidence that they could hole every putt.Readers looking for technical answers to better putting, which is the focus of this rather unorganized book are probably going to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but training devices required!","review":"This book describes everything you need to know about putting, unfortunately a lot of the methods that you need to groove require purchasing various sorts of putting aids (training aids). I purchased the putter track and elks key and had to return elks key due to the poor quality of the product and the putting track is not worth the $100 that it sells for. Although Pelz empahsises that you do not NEED to order his products, a lot of the practice involves products that only he offers. Plus he doesn't offer all the products he mentions in his book (ie. face angle plates). Buy this if you want to know why your putts miss (ie. due to face angle, grain, wind, gravity, footprints, \\"loopy donut effect\\"), but without purchasing various putting aids (and from Pelz, it can get very expensive) it would be hard to groove your putting stroke. The short game bible was much better in that you could practice the techniques at any decent golf course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Step 1 is reading....You still have do put in time on the range :-)","review":"Great guidance from the master! I bought this book before opting to enroll in one of Pelz' classes.

It's appealing when you listen to it, but the more you listen to it, the more interesting it becomes. Of course the performances by Mayumi Miyata and Stefan Hussong are world class.If you are looking for free reed or Japanese traditional music that is elegant and interesting but not overwhelming, I very highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"On line purchase warning","review":"This purchase was most disappointing. It is not really a \\"book\\" at all, but appears to be binding of copies produced on a standard copying machine. The size is an absurd (for a normal novel or work of fiction) 11 inches by 81/2 inches, but of course that is the size of regular copy paper. The font is the usual typewriter font and the print is so pale that it is barely legible under a 60 watt reading lamp.I have not even attempted to read this awful creation despite its being written by such a fine author, and the only reason it has escaped the waste basket is so that it may be shown to friends, colleagues, partners etc., to serve as a caution when purchasing reading material on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfull taste!","review":"Great rock.

I was luck enough to find the unit but will never use it on my bike or ATV due to fear of losing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magellan Explorist Bike Mount","review":"The mount works well. I read elsewhere that people added velcro to make the mount more secure. I find that if you make sure the little plastic tab on the mount snaps into the small hole on the GPS, usually with an audible click, the mount is very secure. However, I must admit, I don't do the roughest biking (jumping over logs etc.). I would have given it five stars, but a have had a little trouble with is trying to rotate on the handle bars. I kept having to tighten it up. Seems firm now however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the ATV","review":"So far so good with this mount. I mounted it to the bars of my ATV and it works great.

Gone over 100 miles off-road so far with no problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design for mountain bikes","review":"This mounting bracket has a number of shortcomings that make it difficult to recommend. First, mountain bikes typically have handlebars that are wide at the stem and taper and bend towards the grips. If you have a mountain bike there is a good chance the bracket will not fit your handlebars well. Second, if it does fit, the weight of the eXplorist will cause the bracket to twist as you ride unless you really tighten it. This is especially bad if you have a carbon bar. You may be able to mount the bracket close to the stem so that it also rests against it for support. This will keep it from rotating while riding.If Magellan had made the metal parts of the bracket so that it could be rotated by 90 degrees it could be mounted on the stem. This is a far more stable area for something heavy. Unfortunately this is not the case. As another reviewer mentioned, most bicycle lights have better mounting designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"clunky","review":"I got an explorist 200 as a gift and wanted to try is as a bicycle speedometer. Since it has a crude street map database I thought it might be useful on my road bike. I'm not very happy with it but that's a different review. The mounting bracket is big and clunky. It looks like the designer made a universal piece of plastic and then added a makeshift metal handlebar clamp.

The music has great variety and can best be described as a soulful cross between Bauhaus and early Talking Heads. Singer Michael Allen fits the profile of the typical British eccentric and sings with a pronounced English accent. The EP's are in chronological order and trace the band's evolving sound from post-punk pop to more horn-oriented sounds and then to a funkier sound which in later years would become a more club-oriented sound(with eccentricities intact). Allen's singing may be an acquired taste for some but is nevertheless an effective emotional tool in the same manner as Nick Cave's for example.

You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors. It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage.

The picture on the cover is the only one you will see. More importantly, the author discusses small unit tactics in great detail but while the scenarios take place during the war in the East, one never even remotely gets the feeling of the War in the East. There is no advance on Moscow or Stalingrad, no Battle of Kursk, no pursuit of the German Wehrmacht in the Ukraine or White Russia. No division is ever mentioned and neither is any German or Russian Tank. The scenarios just as well could have come from any other war since then. This book is solely about small unit tactics and might be useful for an actual tank commander, but for anyone interested in World War II, this is not the book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable poetry for escapism","review":"I'm normally not big on poetry but I highly recommend Down For The Count by G.

The sound quality is excellent overall, although not really atmospheric--there is simply too much spotlighting, although part of that may stem from the interpretation, which seems a bit Technicolor in nature. This is not what most of us think of when we think of Impressionism; the overall sense here is more of Romanticism.

If you buy this, hopefully you have better luck.Update: Nowadays, most grocery stores sell pre-loaded, pressurized, non-refillable spray canisters of olive or canola oil such asPam Olive Oil Cooking Spray.

I wasn't expecting much ,two decades, and some awful albums, after their prime.This punk/hyperspeed metal hybrid is as intense and aggresive as their best material.The production is another story. The bass and drums were either not recorded very well or were shortchanged in the mix.There are also a couple of spots where the guitar is either 100% to the left or to the right,which sounds a bit odd to me. Fortunately, this can be compensated for somewhat, by simply turning up the volume.Discharge is best at high volume anyway.If the recording was as good as the material I would have had no hesitation giving this disc 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"discharge, by discharge","review":"Nobody does punk like Discharge, they're loud, fast, and aggressive.

Seriously. Not to say that what he went on to do wasn't just as good. It's just a typical shining example of big money record companies not promoting a record, plain and simple. The problem is that if the public doesn't hear the song IT DOESNT SELL. I was so overjoyed when I found it was available I couldn't believe it. I bought the original cassette when it first came out and lost it to an ex girlfriend and having been searching for over 20 years to find it here domestically in the US. Tough job...but I finally got it in May of this year as a present to myself.

The $29.99 + shipping price tag was prohibitive, but in the end it was well worth every cent.This is, imho, Cetera's finest work. It has a much more raw sound and feel of his later more polished A/C super-saccharine ballads. This is Cetera when he still liked to cut loose and rock. The album is just plain fun from start to finish with not a bad track to be found.Stand out tracks include the opening rocker Livin' In the Limelight (with Toto's Steve Lukather on guitar), On the Line (which was the side 2 opener on the LP-- the piano on this track is pure fun and a joy to listen to), Practical Man, and the album's closer Ivy Covered Walls.Now that this gem, is (long overdue) available in the US at a much more affordable price it's an even greater buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kylie's Song is already Out of My Head","review":"'I Can't Get you Out of My Head' has a good beat and ok vocals, but this Brit reads mediocrity all over.

She continues to whine \\"I just can't get you out of my head, boy your love is all I think about\\" twice, and then Lalala's again. After doing ANOTHER \\"I just can't get you out of my head, boy your love is all I think about\\", she finally gets to the actual song. Not much better.

That goes for both their technical skills and their songwriting. Their songs aren't empty background tracks so the band members can take turns doing solos - their songs are fantastic.Anyways, I've seen all of their concert DVD's, and although I have a soft spot for Scenes from New York, I think this DVD is better. The sound is simply amazing. Hats off to whoever ran the sound board at that show, as I think it's the best sounding live recording I've ever listened to. I'm not a huge fan of the \\"backup orchestra\\" bit in most cases, but it really added a lot to this DVD.

What happened with Portnoy's drums they sound like $500 Pearl Custom drumkit; sound muffled and cheap. The music is performed by superb musicians why can't transfer their performance in DTS sound done by a professional (just like on Budokan Live DVD).

I had always been suspicious of Reo Fortune's portrayal of the Dobu people. My visit to the Dobu confirmed those suspicions. In fact, the Dobu people I spoke with said that had Fortune wanted to do a proper study of the Dobu culture he should have lived on Dobu Island. They told me that Tewara was on the fringes of Dobu Culture.Dr. Kuehling did locate on Dobu Island. As a result she no doubt got a better picture of normative Dobu culture than Fortune. From my brief encounter with the Dobu people, I would say that her portrayal of Dobu is much more accurate than Fortune's account.For anyone interested in ethnography in general or the Dobu people in particular, I would highly recommend this book.Bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived broken","review":"Arrived broken.

It's not atypical of his work, so prepare to be depressed a la Blood Heat or Eternity Weeps. And if you liked that feeling, you'll like Sword of Forever.As if in repentance for being so damn harsh to Benny and Jason's marriage, Mortimore sees Bernice wedded again.

Zinman's First, unfortunately, lacks the artistry of his 5th (and 4th, too). Listening to his commentary on the piece (disc 2), one wonders how the insight he articulated evaporated in the execution.

It is a lesson in politics, something that will make you think. If you like Science Fiction shows like Doctor Who, Twilight Zone, and Outer Limits, this one will take you somewhere similar. It is especially good if you are a Doctor Who Fan because Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant do an outstanding job, and there role together is quite different than that of Doctor Who. It demonstrates how good these actors really are, in something different and interesting. After viewing this video, I continued to think about it long after. Something like this could really happen.

Pretty sure even junk food candy bars have less sugar than that. These are NOT protein bars, they're energy bars. If you're going mountain climbing or something and plan to burn that 30g of sugar in 1-2 hours, than these would be a nice snack. Otherwise it's just way too much sugar to eat at once. A normal person only needs 100g of sugar a day, and only 40% of that should be from unnatural sources (not from fruits, veggies, milk, etc). This almost fills up your daily quota in one serving.

The flavor of lemon is very strong, and it's similar to lemon custard in lemon bar cookies. However, real lemon custard is light and moist, and protein bars are definitely not that! The first time I tried one, the combination of the flavor and texture seemed odd, but tolerable. When I had another one a few days later, I almost gagged and couldn't finish it.

Now I get excited every year that a young child is on our gift list so that I can pass the magic along to another family. In this book Opus, the lovable penguin from the comics pages, longs to fly. After a near tragic accident on Christmas Eve, he discovers that his wings are just what is needed to save Christmas. He receives and unexpected reward at the end of the book to satisfy the desire of children of all ages for a happy ending while still not compromising the message of the book \\"be happy with who your are\\". This is one of those books that can delight adults who have space on their bookshelves for that special children's magic as well as delighting children who still love to sit with adults for storytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro-Lite HR-15 Halogen Work Light","review":"This is a very nice work lamp.

She is a graphic designer and she was lyrical about it. Now I am the one who reads it the most. The nice thing about \\"The Journals of Dan Eldon\\" is that every time you pick it up, it says something different, you see new things. That's because he was such an allround and grown-up artist already. It is a book that makes you want to live your life as intense and open and adventurous as possible. It is very sad he died at such a young age and it is a great loss to the world of art, but with these journals, his death has been given a meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Journey Is the Destination : The Journals of Dan Eldon","review":"If you Know the works of Peter Beard it's easy to understand the source of inspiration of Dan Eldon diaries, but for such a young artist as Dan it's easy to see a lot of talent in his work.

Eldon's story seemed like a classic non-fiction read about someone who did great things in a very short time. Unfortunately, instead of getting a compilation of Eldon's writing on where he travelled, what he experienced, and why he did what he did, I got a scrapbook of scribbles, pictures, and notes. Yes, the preview did say this was a collage of sorts, but I just expected so much more. In a nutshell, if you want a rather different book to put on a coffee table, this is it. But if you are expecting to READ about a true adventurer and try to better understand a photo journalist's experiences, you are better off reading a book like \\"Free Spirit in a Troubled World\\" by John Phillips."},{"rating":"2","title":"a visual diary","review":"knowing how dan was killed in somalia and that he left such a visual journal was enough to want to look at this book. it a a tremendous body of work saved by the photographer. you fell his youthfulness in the scrapbook materials he saved--a lot with his girlfriend--as we all did when we were young"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Profound","review":"I bought this book upon it's release in 1997. I can remember allowing the contents of this memoir to captivate me for hours on end. I lent my copy to a friend shortly thereafter and subsequently forgot about it. I recently ordered a replacement and I must say, this book is even more compelling than I ever remembered. Dan Eldon was a profound visionary, an articulate statesman and a devoted caretaker. As a Reuters photo-journalist, he traveled the world and served as a dipomatic embassador to many, yet his life was taken prematurely in a stoning riot in Somalia. He experienced more in his brief 21 years than most of us will over an entire lifetime. A MUST HAVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant collages and superb social commentary.","review":"As an artist, writer, and traveler, I was immediately interested in Dan Eldon's journals. His innovative use of photography, collage, and drawing leads the viewer to pour over each page, finding new details in every corner. The introduction written by Dan's mother Kathy, is a heart breaking story of an arist who gave himself to helping others and expressing his deepest feelings regarding war, love and life.

I meandered along, enjoying the brief and naive sections plagiarized from the narrator's sluttish daughter Alyona, but muddling through Anna's daily life of suffering. Occasionally the anti-social antics of her grandson Tima livened up the scene. However, something pulled me forward, and, toward the book's close, as Anna stood in a surreal industrial landscape holding her senile mother, the whole series of events leading to this moment washed over me. The combination of stream-of-consciousness and deliberate straightforward narrative, the will of a woman to survive in a hostile environment, and the concerns of four generations of Russians fell together into a dirty ice crystal of great beauty. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"an alphabet's worth of praise:","review":"AmusingBrilliantCleverDelightfulEndearingFunGreatHumorousInsightfulJoke-filledKeenLovableMarvelousNimble-wittedOpenPerceptiveQuirkyRespectableSmartTerrificUnbeatableWell-written,XcellentYouthfulZesty"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome first project!","review":"Luxury is a band we almost lost a few years ago in an accident after playing at the Cornerstone Festival.

This modern day psalmist has an anointing to usher his listeners into the presence of God.With songs like \\"Jesus Be a Fence\\", this album will have you shouting and praising in your car.

(works fine on both PC and Mac, BTW.) I used a three foot USB cable and mounted the transceiver on the top shelf (about 6 feet.) The remote works from anywhere in the house, even outside. I clip the Airclick to the Sennheiser wireless headphones and I'm set to iTune all over the place. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"Don't let the range thing turn you away. It's better than my cell phone. As a student this remote is perfect when giving presentations. It not only controls PowerPoint, but Keynote, iTunes, DVD player, and a few more. It took 1 minute to install. The only problem I experienced was trying to open AirClick, it wouldn't, so I looked at Griffin's support and it doesn't open a window. What it does is puts an icon up by your time and battery meter. Duh, I felt dumb. That's why i'm in school. Nice product, just add a pointer.Sherm, Chicago"},{"rating":"2","title":"Airclick Remote Control is a great gadget!","review":"I'm a teacher and I play iTunes music in my classes, but my computer is way on the other side of the room so I used to do a lot of running back and forth. Airclick makes the music a lot easier (and my 8th graders think it's cool). It works great, although it took me awhile to realize that there's a slight time gap between the command and the action. My one complaint is the clip on the back. It is not reliable, not strong enough, and the remote has landed on the floor lots of times. Griffin definitely needs to either use a better clip or get rid of it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine but prevents Macs from sleeping","review":"As others have written, my iMac G5 won't sleep when this device is connected. It is a real pain to use as I need to connect/disconnect it every time. At least it works when connected to the USB port on my mac keyboard, so I don't have to reach behind the computer.Update : After contacting Griffin tech support, they mailed me a new unit which works fine.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable product","review":"Got this in the mail and tried it out on my Mac Book. The remote is very cheaply built and feels as if it will disentegrate in your hand at any moment. Poor button feedback so it is hard to tell if you have adequately pushed the button. It didn't work porperly out of the box with Keynote. Soooooo I downloaded the updated driver and it still stunk. The remote had unpredictable behavior when advancing or rewinding slides. Sometimes it would just trigger a blank screen without any build, other times it would jump to the end (and no, I wasn't holding the button down for 0.5 sec to go to the end of the show). I had it boxed back up and returned to Amazon within 10 minutes of opening it. Avoid this product, it doesn't work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"Very poor product. To small in ones hand. Buttons to close to one another. Has a lag between pressing button the the slide moving foward. Have bought another brand. Buy Easy Presenter by Keyspan intead. Also has a laser pointer built in."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAC KEYNOTE & AIRCLICK","review":"I thought it would be neat to use Airclick to advance my Keynote presentation. However It kept taking me to the last slide. After many atempts I felt insecure talking to a thousand people with a wireless switch that kept taking me to the last slide of the show when I was not there yet. It did not work for me ..
