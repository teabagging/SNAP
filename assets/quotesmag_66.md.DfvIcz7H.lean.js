After 3 months, I started noticing problems. First off, the auto-fire has no real applications. Second, in slow mode all the controller does is hit the the start button reapeatedly. Also, as it says in other reviews, when using the analog stick, you cannot stand in one place. One of my favorite game series, The Turok Games, are almost impossible to play with the SharkPad. The controller is designed to fit your hands better, but it's off the mark there too. The feel is unnatural and uncomfortable. In my household, the SharkPad is known as the \\"bad one\\" while playing N64 games. I would definiately recommend the Nintendo brand controller (and all other Nintendo products. Anything not produced by Nintendo is also not licensed by them, this means that it will not perform as well). Because of this product, I no longer purchase InterAct products due to the lack in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"not only does not work, is dangerous.","review":"I bought this because it was cheap and looks cool with its transparent design. but it came with a badly frayed cord wrapped loosely in electrical tape.

The voices of these consumate singers in their prime puts most modern renditions to shame. The highlights for me are the oft neglected 'That's what I want for Christmas', sung by Nancy Wilson, and the sultry Eartha Kitt's 'Santa Baby'. Eartha's earthy rendition make's Madonna sound 'like a virgin'. I have only one gripe...the embarassing 'Christmas time is here', sung by Rosemary Clooney. It was recorded in 1994 when Rosemary was way past her prime. But there are 13 pearls on this album and only one piece of grit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding collection, wonderful choices","review":"Despite the somewhat cheesy \\"Lifetime Intimate Portraits\\" branding, this collection of Christmas songs sung by various female vocalists is outstanding. The pacing is wonderful, moving smoothly from more upbest to slower and back again, and some of the choices (e.g., Papa Noel, sung by Brenda Lee) are refreshingly unusual without causing \\"What the heck is THAT?\\" shock. My only gripe would be the choice of the ubiquitous \\"Santa Baby\\" done by Eartha Kitt - it seems to go on forever, and haven't we heard it enough yet? The liner notes are great, also.

It has a very nice feel to it and has functioned very well.Recently, while using the drill the plastic cooling fan blade inside the drill shattered into three pieces. A replacement for this part (part 11 on the Makita exploded parts drawing) is not available for sale separately and presumably must be replaced by installing an entirely new armature assembly that has a part cost approximately 2/3 the value of a new drill.I removed all the broken bits and put the drill together again without a replacement plastic fan blade.

I too was stumped as to how to remove it. I finally decided I had nothing to lose by taking the drill apart.

A new replacement chuck screws back on the same way.This is a great drill and I'm very pleased with it's performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought Makita made quality tools at one time","review":"I had this make and model for about 5 years. The drill developed some problems soon after I bought it, most notably a trigger defect that made running it a hassle.

A new chuck cost almost as much as new drill so I opted to buy a new one of a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet and smooth","review":"Very quiet and smnooth running drill.

This is a drill, not a Driver.It gets a little tough to use Driving Screws into tight pilot holes, because its got too much power and no clutch so you can't dial it back much.I find that I prefer it to rip through drilling pilot holes, then use my battery powered Hitachi to drive the Screws in. Switching between the two makes jobs 3 or 4 times shorter.That being said, if you don't have a separate driver, you can certainly get by driving screws in with this guy, you just have to be more careful not to strip the head of the screw."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"the book came in the expected time, the book was in a very good shape and the CD and website were inside.I needed the book for one of my courses and it's a good book for people in the management field or any one intrested in this area.it has 12 chapters, going throw all the stages of the devoloping a business.if are a busiess managere its a good book to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Software included with book","review":"I have not read the book, but I wanted to post a review to let those know that post#1 is wrong.

This book is very well structured, organized, and well written. However, it is only a fundamentals overview of IT project management: experienced project managers might find it a good review, but this book would likely fall short of providing you with all the tools necessary to practically implement good project management. Fortunately, the book is riddled with references to provide you with sources of further study. Also, this book only briefly touches on concepts specific to software development.

She just rants, I never loved you anyway.

There is not one fast dance song like her first single. It is just a really bad album. I mean yea she has a nice voice, but every song sounds the same. I think its just a waste of your money.

This is not to say that the music on this album was not an important part of the 70's because it was. But in attempts to capture the essence of the entire decade one should never leave out Bohemian Rhapsody,The Wall...remember Abba? David Bowie? The Kinks?

NBC has poured millions of dollars into an ad campaign for a cheesy, poorly written and acted TV movie that takes a decade and paints it with the broadest, most obvious strokes possible, thus trivializing important events and hyping unimportant ones. This soundtrack, the fiftieth repackaging of mostly bland '70s rock hits that initially annoyed many of the same people who eat them up now, is just part of the ad campaign.

Written with sufficient surrealism to easily accomodate a supporting character that happens to be a talking dog, there just isn't anything here to engage the reader's interest.The main character, Todd Kent, is an early incarnation of Roy Dillon, the young L.A. con artist Thompson so masterfully brought to life in The Grifters. But that's where any similarity between the two novels begins and ends.The Golden Gizmo is a real clunker. Sometimes even great writers like Jim Thompson will step up to the plate and strike out. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mission Improbable","review":"This is almost a decent novel. If it didn't come from the author of that masterpiece, \\"The Grifters,\\" I might have given it an extra star or two.What's really painful is that there's a lot of good stuff here. The characters, as always, are fascinating. And only Jim Thompson could make a talking dog a convincing player in a noir thriller!

Whatever they may be, they're deeply compromised by the technical failure of the finished production. A narrow soundstage, the dryness of the strings and a near-complete loss of Andsnes' justly celebrated tonal palette compare poorly with the promotional video, a fine rehearsal session with decidedly more generous audio qualities. I'll keep the disc - it's interesting on other levels - but won't reach for it except perhaps as an example of expert performance denatured in its journey from concert hall to finished disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please","review":"I found this video to be boring.

This is a great example of how bellydancing is too subjective that a no talent woman can call herself a belly dancer. Amira Mor dances more like a bad stripper than a true belly dance artist. Her costumes are in terrible taste her music is boring and she lacks the feeling, style, tehnicial understanding, class and beauty that belly dancing is based upon. Amira Mor should pay people to watch her DVD's or videos because they are painful and embarrassing to watch. My advice is to stick with the real belly dancers."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD...VERY BAD!","review":"Amira Mor belly dances like a stripper with no feeling, timing or technique. This just brings the art to the depths of hypocrisy. Amira Mor dances as if it were a Go-Go show instead of Oriental belly dancing. The two are not the same. It is sad to see this art so poorly represented by a classless and tasteless person with no talent. It sets a bad presedent for what the real art is and is not. This is NOT belly dancing, it is a stripper that thinks because she can gyrate her hips (out of time to the music I must add) that she is a professional belly dancer...NOT!Save your money and buy from a professional belly dancer, NOT Amira Mor and her embarassing DVD's.The video quality was also very poor and the editing was choppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE, THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC BELLY DANCING AT ALL!","review":"This video is a joke. She obviously tries to cover up her lack of talent, technique, authenticity, feeling, and artistic ability with inappropriate costuming and the sad over use of props. It is obvious to those who know the difference that Amira Mor does not understand how to belly dance properly. Her performance was very contrived. The music is also recorded poorly (the musical element in Arabic dance is very delicate and crucial) and it is over edited, incomplete and short. She is over weight and the heavy legs does not look good at all. The skimpy costume lacks the class, elegance and beauty that Oriental belly dance is based upon. It is just another way for her to detract from having no skill. A real professional dancer she is not, she could use some serious training. It is very painful for the Middle Eastern-American community to see our dance portrayed in such a tasteless way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belly dance cheesecake","review":"This is not a video for serious dancers.

It shows Amira Mor dancing in various places. This performance contains a veil dance, wings of Isis dance, zills, and my favorite part the sword. I own all of Amira Mor's DVD's and I love each and every one of them because they will teach you floor moves, that are not performed as much by others. However I do have some problems with each one. That is why I will not give them the full five stars but four. The problem I have with this one is that while she dances to one song, the editing jumps from one dance to another. One minute you will see her dancing with zills the next, a veil. I did not like that. It done this through out the DVD. I think if they just stuck with one choreography for each song, I would have gave this DVD five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amira Mor cannot Bellydance.","review":"Bellydancing is not about making love to the camera, covering up a lack of real talent by acting like a stripper. Bellydancing is all about about ART. Unfortunately, there is no art present with Amira Mor. What Amira does on her video any untrained lady can easily do, there is no art to be found.I ordered this video in the hopes of watching authentic, professional Middle Eastern bellydancing. Instead what I got was a video of a woman acting in poor taste devoid of any real bellydancing technique, training or understanding of my culture and of the this very delicate art form.The editing was choppy, and it contains so much fluff and no beautiful bellydancing. I am very dissapointed with Amira Mor, her lack of talent, dance skill and video production.Do yourselves a big favor and order professionall videos and DVD by real bellydancers...this is all gingerbread and no substance.Thank you,Mdm.

I was disapointed in the ORIGINAL mode which let you pick 3 items and then took you over to ARCADE mode. Thats Sega's idea of \\"NEW\\"? Without the lightgun, you are lost and are stuck with the joystick which is hard to aim and is unreliable. The two player mode was okay with hardly any slowdown.

It does so, however, by ignoring everything else that a game should offer. Other reviews understate the necessity of the laser gun. The aimer simply moves to slowly to allow for any reasonable chance of success. There is no free will, or choice in this game. The only way gameplay affects storyline is to open doors that lead to diversions from the VERY scripted plot. The acting is a complete joke, leaving this reviewer wondering what was lost in the translation. Most disappointing, however, is the notion of credits. You cannot extend play for longer than nine credits, great in the true-to-the-arcade-game translation except that in the arcade no-one is going to limit you to nine plays. This creates a hopeless expectation of perfection to actually finish the game and dooms players to playing the first screens over and over again. not much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Theis is the best action kinda game I kan beet this game (on very hard) in less then 45 min. it took me awhyle. well i highly recamed this game NUFF SAID"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can it get any worse?","review":"This has to be the worst game I have played for Dreamcast.

Her books are very carefully plotted and her character development is excellent. In this book we get to see Judy in action. Her careful attentiveness to detail, and her detailed notetaking help her solve this perplexing murder of a schoolgirl. Typical of Ms. McGown there are plenty of twists and we dont' discover the real murder until the very end.

There are innumerable transcription/editing/grammatical/spelling errors such as to render it a most irksome read. Furthermore, since there are no contextural gaps, lines or asterisks between self-contained episodes within chapters, it becomes as much of an investigative challenge to keep characters and circumstances in some kind of perspective as it is to follow the somewhat juvenile and laborious plot. This is not in keeping with anticipated McGowan standards.

You look at the cover and it really looks intriguing and like a page turner. But to be blunt, except for a few parts, it is BORING, and Left Behind is still better! The difference is that Left Behind just gets into it. This looks as if it has trouble making up its mind.Now, I read the whole thing, but I wasn't impressed, and despite myself, I got Exodus, which I will read at some point in time.

It was confusing & a bit hard to follow as he switched from the political action to actual combat. Which in my opinion should have been 2 separate books. What there was of marines in combat was quite good but in many instances not enough was said about a particular marine or specific battle. Having read 2 other books on the Battles for Fallujah, they were much better.

The maps and outline of people involved were useful references to go back to while reading.

Stories of their endless dedication to our country and to one another in the face of great adversity.West brings not only brings the battle field but also the sorrowful politics that puts these brave Marines in harms way thru indecision by politics.Semper Fi !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding bravery","review":"This is a gripping account of the battles for Fallujah. What is most striking is the lengths to which the Marines went to insure that only bad guys were killed. To stand outside a house, knowing that there are enemies inside, and knowing that you could simply call up a tank to level the place, yet then going room to room to make sure there are no innocents inside is true bravery. Gen. West does an outstanding job of putting the reader in the battles, and even provides an insight into the strategic decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book yet on the 2nd Iraq war","review":"I've read just about every book on military operations in the 2nd Iraq War (by Dec 2005). This includes McCoy's Marines, Generation Kill, Ambush Alley, The March Up, etc. This is the best by far! The book provides an in-depth look at one situation rather that a broad description of events in many areas. It provides the political and cultural context (US & Iraqi) in which to better understand what was done and what was not. This book really shows the incredible courage and professionalism of this generation of Marines, soldiers and sailors (corpsmen). Hard to put down. A classic in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well","review":"This was the first Iraq book that I read and it inspired me read more. However, I served with a few of the people interviewed to write the book and was told that Bing West is a mean old man! Ha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely did his homework","review":"This is one of the better books I've read on military history. It goes into detail explaining the story leading up to the battles that took place in Fallujah. The politics and personalities that made everything go into motion are described here, and give a great explanation of the developments leading into the historical battle. A must read for history fans or those that want to know what was going on in that region in 2004. Bing West has much to be proud of here."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"An Awesome book on the capture of Fallujah, shows why the US Marines are still the elite of military services. Bing also details the complexity of today's military having to fight a war with one eye on the enemy, and one eye on the civilian leadership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bing West Puts the Reader Into the Fight","review":"As a US Army Soldier I value Bing West's ability to document battle from the grunt's level. His understanding of the individual Marine and his leaders, gained through his own service to our country from the Vietnam War to present, lends perspective to his writing that is without equal. His account of the Battle of Fallujah is a must read for anyone who hopes to understand the intractable and savage nature of the enemies America faces in Iraq, Afghanistan, and--now--Pakistan. This book gives a detailed account of the fighting at the squad and platoon level, where all wars are ultimately won or lost. Even experienced combat troops will gain a fuller understanding of the role American fighting doctrine and equipment play in this battle. Most important, however, the reader will marvel at the tenacity and dedication of our Marines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid account of the circumstances surrounding and the house-by-house battle for Falluja","review":"Gritty, solid journalism paints the backdrop of the battle from an international scale with the biased mendacious Arab press, the hand wringing dithering Europeans and the U.S.'s own collection of burrocratic bumblers and idiots all contributing to insuring that the problem of Falluja was dealt with in the least optimal manner.The author then brings into crisp focus the lives of the military personnel that were on the ground. Those individuals that had to deal with the treacherous local politicians and undependable Iraqi forces and who finally had to clear Falluja house by house of jihadies that thanks to the indecisiveness of the powers that be had six months to dig in, supply and prepare.I am in awe if the young men that fought this fanatical pestilential scum, sometimes room by room and sometimes to the death."},{"rating":"1","title":"what kind of business you running","review":"So when I bought this DVD online and the rating was for like new I expected some superficial scratches or maybe the box to be broken.

You can pass this one by and choose a book/pamplet with better designs and ideas. If you don't already know how to make pop-ups, you will need a book with better instructions.

Very little useful information in it at all. \\"We expect you to already know this\\", \\"Read this book to learn about this\\", and from what they do explain it is poorly described.

The authors are professional mountain guides but more than that, alpine climbing seems to be an integral part of who they are. I picked up a lot of very helpful information that covers everything from training, to equipment and boot selection, to alpine travel and avalanche knowledge. It is very suited to the Sierra Nevada range, where I do most of my climbing. This is the best book I have found on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my brother in law at his request.

The book arrived in perfect condition and very quickly also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw Organic Cacao Powder","review":"I have purchased cacao from wilderness family in the past years, and gave them a great review. However, with my last purchase a few weeks ago, I was very disappointed. When I recieved my cacao, it WAS NOT from wilderness family naturals. It was from a company I had never heard of-Organic Herbal Essence. It did not have the certified organic logo on it. When I contacted the seller, they said they \\"shared\\" a listing with wilderness family naturals. I have been buying from Amazon for years, and have never heard of this practice before. If it was stated up front that this was the company selling the product that would be different. I just thought I should mention this so that any other potential buyers would know what to expect when ordering this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Powder","review":"I like to use the powder in a raw milk shake that I make with frozen bananas and almond milk.

Thanks for a super purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book on the Leadershp Principles of Jesus","review":"There are a number of good books in print which present lessons on leadership derived from the life and teachings of Jesus. Unfortunately, this is NOT one of them. The author spends so much time writing about himself and HIS understanding of the truth that Jesus gets pushed to the background.The book contains some good concepts (it would be hard to avoid them given the topic!) but overall, in my opinion, the book is too author-centered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible! Clearly follows Jesus's model of leadership.","review":"This is a great book for those looking for a guide on servant-leadership. The example of Jesus's leadership through the New Testament is clearly shown. It is divided into daily studies with a common goal for the each week. I have really enjoyed going through this book as I prepare for marriage and full-time overseas missions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus on Leadership","review":"This is the MOST MOTIVATIONAL BOOK on the market. If you're not a Christian and want a cut to the chase lesson in what makes a successful man - READ THIS BOOK!

Usually, a full-size circular saw is too cumbersome, and the flimsy blade of a jigsaw makes it hard to maintain a consistent line.This little monster cuts through ANYTHING, and the carbide blade stays sharp and comes back for more. It's easy to get a clean, straight cut on everything from 1/2\\" plywood to delicate formica. Even a bevelled edge comes out nice.The only downside is a short life-span on the battery's charge. But all in all a handy and dependable saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like this one at all","review":"I'm a contractor. Makita is my favorite tools. I had their 9v cordless drill for 10 years now. But I'm not happy with this tool at all. I bought for trim work, but it hasn't worked very well for anything but maybe drywall.

On some numbers we enter the room, but the excessive echo is still there. On \\"No One Cares\\" he's closer up but his voice seems weaker, with a metallic sheen but no overtones. In both albums Gordon Jenkins' strings fluctuate between grandiose and inappropriate (on \\"Lonely Town,\\" both.)I share another reviewer's hope that some day the original tapes or acetates will come into the hands of someone like Mosaic Records, though it will be after my time. Welcome to the promised land!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank at his best!","review":"Frank at his best. First class box set of all the capital releases except for the two lps colours and the christmas album.

A worthy addition to any mystery fan's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"This book had the potential of a great mystery. The lead character of Mo was quite interesting, funny and smart, however the story failed to capitalize on that. The small town was not well utilized and most of the characters seemed incompletely developed. Although the end was not predictable , when you read you realize that you are not intrigued enough to care what happens at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing!!","review":"The plot is fair, at best, but the writing, especially the dialog, is enough to drive a person crazy! Obviously there was no editor involved in the publishing process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call the grammar police! There has been another crime committed!","review":"Another book ruined by ineptitude. When the reader's focus has to be trying to determine who is saying what, there is no way to get into the story. The real mystery is who is responsible for this affront to the English language, and all rules of grammar?I don't like to be critical of an author's ability to spin a story, and that is what I SHOULD be reviewing. But it is impossible to honestly review a story line with this many distractions. I don't know where the process is falling apart, but releasing a product in this condition does no favors for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder She Wrote, Except!","review":"This would be a typical story for the Angela Lansbury TV series \\"Murder She Wrote\\" except for an embarrassingly out-of-place intimate, description of sexual intercourse between a man and his wife that starts the story off.

If the story had been written by a novice you might think he was trying to prove he had taken high school sex ed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run-on dialog is REALLY annoying","review":"I am 28% of the way through this book. So far it is decidedly unspectacular. However, I am getting so annoyed with several people's dialog being slammed into a single paragraph that I had to come leave a review. It's really disconcerting for 2 people, alternating in dialog in a discussion, to be depicted by just putting end quotation marks and starting the next dialog a space later. I don't know if it's the transition to Kindle format that has been bobbled, or if the author doesn't understand proper convention.But it's so annoying I'm about ready to bail out on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific read","review":"Sometimes you find a well written exciting book accidentally and reading it is like a gift that you give to yourself. Murder Over Easy is an exciting ride from an experienced writer. In his bio I saw that he was even on Oprah. Marshall Cook is like a cross between Sue Grafton and Elmore Leonard: great stories, great dialogue. This is a book so good that I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"Maybe I'm just old school but putting characters comments on the same lines as others is entirely too confusing. I read about 28% of this book and had to leave it unread. I read for pleasure, not to try and figure out who says what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding?","review":"First of all, I must agree with the previous reviewer who was talking about the love-making scene being very textbook. Uh, yeah. And if the main character is the female \\"Mo\\" then why is that part told mostly from the guy's point of view and how good it was for him?Also, what happened to starting a new paragraph when a new person talks?! I can't follow the dialogue enough to figure out who is saying what.The descriptions of things don't add anything to the story line or plot. It just seems pretty pointless. I couldn't even make it through the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could be a good book if the formatting was readable","review":"I downloaded this for free for my Kindle so I can't complain too much. I imagine this could be a good book. However, at 7% into the book I've given up trying to read it. The storyline seems good but between spelling errors and bad formatting I've spent most of my time trying to figure out which character is speaking and what they are actually trying to say.If they offer an updated version of the book with the formatting corrected I'll try again but for now I'm giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this book really boring and I thought the dialogue was horrible at times. The relationship between the main character and her husband seemed strange and forced most times. There sex scenes seemed cold and unfeeling nothing like what you would imagine a loving couple would be like. I just really couldn't get into the book I thought the way it was written destroyed the whole story. I got this while it was free which is a good thing. Not worth in my opinion any more than .99 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very mysterious","review":"This book was not much of a brain-twister. The mystery was easy to solve.

I purchased this book because I thought it was a great price for the size of the novel, but when I read it, I loved it so much that I went back to the store and had them to order the author's first book as well. The first book was excellent too....very touching and heartwarming, but I think this one was my favorite. I thought that the idea of a loving couple having to deal with an outside child and his b**** of a mother was an outstanding angle for a Christian novel. One of the previous reviewers called the story \\"predictable\\", but for me, it wasn't at all. I was drinking a soda at the time I read the twist in the plot and I almost choked! Not only did I like the story, but I like the authors writing style. The dialog was so engaging and it made the book an easy read. It almost had the feel of a made-for-tv movie (starring Terrance Howard and Nia Long)! I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read it a few years ago and recently just had the urge to go back and revisit some of my favorite parts. The love between Nicole and Bryan completely changed my thoughts on how I should be loved by my future husband and how I should love in return. On the contrary,because this is a fiction piece, it has me questioning whether or not a love like this can truly exist between a man and a woman. However, despite my small lack in faith, the book was solid just like the love that was held within the characters.If you are a helpless christian romantic you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL WRITTEN STORY","review":"I just want to say that this book is a wonderful story.

I don't think this is a particularly energy-intensive use. Batteries that I've bought for this purpose before have lasted for a couple weeks of continuous usage (more if I remember to turn the candle off). These batteries produced a feeble light, as though they were already nearly depleted when I began to use them, and lasted exactly 90 minutes before they stopped working entirely. I realize these were cheap and that you do get what you pay for, but it's also true that it's just plain illegal to sell an item that can't be used for the purpose for which it's advertised.

Unfortunately, it has all too often become a cruel one, not one that is helpful to the child's growth. All too often parents, grasping for the \\"brass ring\\" of a designer label college become overzealous and overly ambitious, beginning the college process way too early and pushing their children so hard that it harms their child and their relationship with their child. As someone who has spent 20 years in college admission and now 4 in college counseling in a highly compeitive school, this book has become the most powerful tool I've found in prodding parents of the need to stay sane and use a more balanced approach in working with their children. I hope to do a reading group with parents in my school using it as the text next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We bought this tarp because we had bought a smaller one before.

In addition to that being the wrong size the tarp was joined and had a patch on it. It also had some holes and where the tarp was folded the creases were faded.It looked good in the package and since we did not need to use it immediately, it was only when it was opened to be used we discovered that it was a rejected or reconditioned tarp and not a new one.

I got the size 1-2 but got sausage rolls on my thighs from how tight it was. I don't feel like it did much for my trouble areas which is right in the \\"muffin top\\" area by my lower back.

Granted, he's British and I'm American, and there are always differences in our respective spellings and uses of the English language. I'm fine with those differences. I've read other British-authored material, and done quite well with it, but the errors I'm talking about are just plain comma splices, stray quotation marks, unnecessary capital letters, sentence fragments, missing apostrophes, etc. I'll probably stay with it, because I'm quite interested in the subject, and I expect he will present some information I can learn. I am a writer, too, and it pains me to try to read this book. Unfortunately this book, self-published through iUniverse, is a great example of books that give self-publishing a bad reputation. An editor could have made this into something enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much to Recommend","review":"If you're looking for music similar to Devo or to Mothersbaugh's Rushmore stuff, skip this.

At first, I got down on the book but the more I keyed in the examples and did the homework projects, the more I learned - even if things didn't go 100 per-cent as advertised. I find VB a very complicated and volatile subject. Some of the examples may not work but for varied reasons. One of the problems I kept running into was fixed by downloading Visual Studio SP3 from Microsoft. Others seemed to be inherent in VB - not the book. Keep reading and doing - it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I have a degree in mathematics; I am a teacher; I have been teaching all of my adult life.

This is an awful, awful, awful book!!!The authors jump around from subject to subject never really tying up or clearing up loose ends they have started.

This is probably a typical case of two instructors / professors being given a book contract to write a much needed \\"ADVANCED Visual Basic\\" textbook for colleges, universities, and tech schools to teach from. Unfortunately, not all VB programmers can write or explain what they know. I found lots of code typos and errors. Better books are: \\"Visual Basic 6.0 Advanced Topics\\" by Ekedahl, \\"Murach's Visual Basic 6.0: Beginner to Database Pro\\" by Koop, Prince, & Murach, \\"Pure Visual Basic\\" by Fox, \\"Visual Basic 6.0 Unleashed\\" by Thayer, et al., \\"Mastering Visual Basic 6\\" by Petroutsos, and \\"Visual Basic 6 Black Box\\" by Holzner.

Search \\"Disney Blam\\" on YouTube to experience this travesty for yourself.- \\"Re-Micks\\" These are Mickey Mouse shorts mixed up to modern music. (Hannah Montana, Jonas Brothers). Great toons, terrible songs.- \\"Short Versions\\" These are just the shorts cut down and re dubbed to about three minutes long instead of 8. The interesting thing about these is that we get to hear Brett Iwane as Mickey, as Wayne Allwine passed away last year.In conclusion DO NOT BUY. Go for the Walt Disney Treasures sets instead.

Disney, Charels Nichlos, Jack Hannah and the other staff who worked on these cartoons would vomit if they saw this garbage today. My suggestion to you people out there who love these cartoons, don't go for these DVD's. Go for other cartoon collections such as the Disney Treasures and classic cartoon favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"My daughter loves Mickey Mouse, so I bought this for her. The box says '74 minutes' but the actual material (shorts) seemed to be around 30 minutes total with a lot of filler. Apparantly they count the 'edited' versions and extras as part of the total. It's also a pain to hand-pick the episodes - it defaults to playing the edited version after the cartoon. The few cartoons that it contained were good, but at $15, I wish I could take it back to the store because it was truly a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy it New","review":"I love Disney! Their animation department is tops and I love that they've started making new shorts (How to Install your HD TV) and started playing around with the old ones again (a la DTV in the 80s and 90s).In all respects the shorts on this DVD are top notch, they look better than they did when I was a kid. In that way the review would be a 5 out of 5 stars, however why must Disney now only see the Dollar Signs? Why not put more shorts out on one DVD instead of splitting them up on two? Disney has turned into a greedy money hungry corporation that looks for ways to rip off the average consumer instead of giving us our moneys worth. It would've been so easy to put the 'have a laugh' shorts all on one DVD, that would be worth the $12 I paid for it, instead of making me pay $24 for a handful of shorts.So in summary don't pay full price for these or you're gonna feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kurupt?","review":"Honestly, this album is whack, I don't know why the other reviewers seem to like it, but if you've been a fan of DPG long enough, AND has actually listened to Space Oddyssey- which I consider a classic, you would agree with me that with the expection of Homeboys, this album suffers bad production, untalented rappers featuring, not to mention Kurupt's subpar lyrical performance.Hopefully his reunion with Daz brings better music than this"},{"rating":"2","title":"good album too bad deathrow's glory days are behind them","review":"god album after this kurupt left tha row once again this wass deathrow's lasdt stand anyway suge knight lost crooked i, spider loc and signing petey pablo did'nt mean jack anyway kurupt, roscoe, and the row's last few troops give it their all. good thing kurupt and dpg is reunited but you qwanna hear the outtakes listen to the ep version on youtube where kurupt diss snoop, badazz, daz, and soopafly on no vaseline2 there's a track featuring kokane too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushed Back Again.Huh?","review":"Honestly...I aint tryin' to knock Tha Row, but they aint had it together since Pac got got,y'all.

I know that it sounds crazy to suggest this film to viewers, but unfortunately these people exist. It takes place in Germany and the killer has the cop wrapped around his psychological finger and really gets into his head.The ending is a really great example of the \\"surprise ending\\" and it really will shock you as to how a normal person can be manipulated by an evil killer.I would warn that this movie is very violent,explicit,and graphic.

I am usually not entertained by the derangements of the human mind, yet I couldn't look away or pause the film.This is definately not for the weak of heart, people who react badly to blood or for minors (with or without a parent or guardian).Before purchasing it, I thought it was a film concerning AIDS in the gay community, but this wasn't a musical comedy with fabulous wardrobes.It was life at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"I love psychological thrillers, but this is is not one of them.

He inspires his people, but makes terrible mistakes that must be payed for with lots of blood later on. This destroys him little by little. Forstchen manages to make him very human, very far from a legend, and closer to what people really are. This book is transitional. Not as spectacular as those before, it still is very good and sets the stage for more to come. Also, a new major character is developed: the tank commander Timokin.

Lise Bourbeau's book is a dictionary of dis-eases with an explanation of mental, emotional, and spiritual blocks related to each illness. She explains how to 'let go' on every level and guides you through self forgiveness along the path to complete and permanent healing. Self love is the key, I felt revitalised and transformed, I highly recommend this uplifting read.

This is a movie that will always keep your eyes on the screen; i especially liked Geneviève Bujold...she has such an intruiging presence. The end of the world is such a common topic and is always speculated about, yet the movie is never boring or predictable, no matter how much you think you know about what you think is going to happen, you don't. And that's how life is. It also brings to question if we were able to prepare for the last night on earth, how would we spend it? Would we hurry to fullfill every sexual fantasy we ever imagined or would we prefer to wait for the end alone or would we take our own lives before the earth took us? The only thing that I somewhat disliked about \\"Last Night\\" was the lack of music, i can think of so many songs that would fit this movie fantastically!"},{"rating":"2","title":"suprisingly good low-budget movie","review":"I didn't expect much, but was surprised.

The expressive desolation of empty buildings and empty streets disappear with pan-and-scan.In other words, get a second-run theater to bring the film back one week, but don't buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world ends without scientific jargon...","review":"In an era when we are constantly bombarded with big-budget badly researched apocalyptic movies, along comes a very simple, thought-provoking story. Delivered with breathtakingly open performances, this movie focuses on the raw emotions of a group of people preparing for the end. With very little melodrama, relationships and rituals are conducted against a backdrop of inevitability. Some moments are a little uncomfortable, some quirky, but the over-riding impression of the story is one of serenity in the face of chaos. The final scenes are amongst the most beautiful of any movie and as the end comes to the characters and the movie, the audience is left with the same sense of acceptance; there is no thought of being cheated out of a heroic rescue, simply it is the end. An excellent story with outstanding acting - a true pleasure to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAST but not least","review":"Directors such as Don McKellar make me proud to say, I AMCANADIAN! This film, Last Night, is wonderful little masterpiece just waiting to become a cult hit. And boy, does it deserve it! With a wonderful cast, including, Don himself, Sandra Oh and Sarah Polley, a great screen-play and almost flawless direction, I must say, I was blown away. I've always been of fan of Don's and his television show Twitch City, and I was not let down after seeing this film. Many whom are reading this article probably have just seen his new indie, waydowntown, and want to know if this is worth buying/watching, my answer is YES!

I'm not saying the writer/director is talentless; I'm just saying, it coulda' been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching!","review":"Although LAST NIGHT came out during the time that everyone and their mothers were doing movies about the end of the world, LAST NIGHT took a totally different twist. While everyone in every other movie was concerned about how to stop the world from ending, Don McKellar focuses more on the characters and how they live their lives up to that final moment, whether they spend their last night with their families, alone, or even doing the nasty! LAST NIGHT is an excellent Canadian film and McKellar is a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"... And I Feel Fine!","review":"Don McKellar's \\"Last Night\\" was a wonderful find. Its interlocking stories about the last day of the world avoids the overblown hysteria and razzmatazz that other films about an impending apocalypse emphasize (\\"Strange Days\\" comes to mind). Rather, McKellar focuses on the human element--the need to be with loved ones and the overwhelming sense of resignation that eventually settles in. \\"Last Night\\" is touching and funny, blessed with strong yet understated performances from McKellar, Sandra Oh, David Cronenberg and the rest of the cast. The ending, with its moving and effective use of the song \\"Guantanamera\\", packs a wallop. This is a small film that should not be ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasting notes and nothing else!","review":"I would not recommend this book unless you are a frequent auction buyer.It does not say anything about the viticulture or th vinification of the classic wines-just Hallidays tasting notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good drill","review":"We bought the first one about 5 or 6 years ago and never had a problem.

The kids love the novelty of having rectangular \\"snack cakes\\" even though I just use my usual muffin (or cupcake) recipes with this pan.However, the quality of this pan is quite another matter.

I just read the whole book in about twenty minutes, and that was taking my time! To be fair, I did learn quite a bit about majolica, but that's only because I knew nothing to begin with. This is a very simple book. It includes a few short \\"chapters\\" that give only a few paragraphs each on general concepts--marks, condition, paiting, care, etc. It's biggest selling point is that it includes more than one hundred pages with one or two good quality photos on each. The biggest problem with the book besides its brevity is the fact that it does not contain the price guide it advertises. The author gives the price for each piece pictured, and that's it. What's worse, as far as I can tell or figure out, the prices don't follow the criteria the author outlines for value. He'll list one piece for $100 and then another for $250 that (by his standards) is less valuable. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Art","review":"This book is tastefully done.

One of the main reasons I decided to purchase this product was because the heart rate monitor strap was so naturally comfortable. As I've gotten older it has become more and more important to me to know my heart rate as I exercise. Without this product I would be lost. I love it. It comes with my highest recommendations.

I wonder where O'Malleys is/was in town. Little Joe's Bar?? The Pontiac Theater and Berkeley Hotel both were destroyed by fire when I was a kid, but reading Requiem, I can clearly see how central they were to the lives of visitors and locals.

The patterns are rather dull. Some of the yarns are so bulky they look downright silly. And the sweaters are all very square-shaped with dull drop-sleeves. I just hoped there would be a bit more variety and challenge.But I'll give it four starts because for a beginner, I'm sure it's nice to find easy patterns that won't intimidate.

And the patterns are adorable!I admit I have not yet knit any patterns from this book because most of the patterns (if not all of them) are knitted in chunky yarns or two-strands of yarn together with large needles. In my experience larger yarns and needles make bigger holes for the wind to rip through, and here in the mountains that is not a good thing. So I've been sticking to closer-knit fabrics.BUT!!!

This isn't the India that Hollywood normally presents, but having been to India twice in the last two years, this is the India I met and the reason I went back the second time and will go again. \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" depicts the India I met--an India of crowds, chaos, and kindness.

It is great to see how another culture interacts with older people; such warmth, courtesy and forbearance even when they aren't particularly treated well by those who are visiting their country.

I sympathize somewhat, since I'm chronologically in the same zip code, but short of their being in need of the money, I see no reason for them to participate in projects like this.

It starts off well but as soon as the young man shows up, it all goes south. Apparently very few movie makers want to do a movie exclusively about older people (one example of how to do it well, The Bucket List) because here we have a silly side tale of romance and parental disapproval suddenly appearing. As if that weren't bad enough, it quickly begins to build romantic connections among the elders too, even a gay one (to make it up-to-date, I suppose). Then, to keep from offending anyone, they kill off the gay man so they don't have to take that storyline anywhere meaningful. It was like watching a bad episode of Three's Company with wrinkles.

The overall message of the film is likewise subpar--something like elderly hedonism, where everything turns out your way.

The book is a bit more cynical, sad and honest. This film touches on that sadness but develops the characters in rather more gentle and beautiful ways. I like them both for different reasons. Perhaps the filmmakers loved the book and took the faithfully rendered characters out to play a little, to enjoy life a little more.

One never does, divorces her husband and goes back to India while her husband relishes visiting all the old beautiful temples.

It's hard not to love anything that has a cast like this: Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, to name a few. There are three of my favorites anyway. Penelope Wilton, who's also on the wonderful Downton Abbey with Maggie Smith, does a fantastic job playing the disgruntled wife forced into a retirement environment she clearly thinks is beneath her."},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of taste","review":"What I was told was British humor left me cold. the setting was beautuful, but with all the great actors, I expected better."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARVELOUS BEST SEEN IN LONG TIME","review":"Wonderful movie went back and watched a second time.

I'm looking forward to seeing it again and again. The first time was in a theatre, so each additional private viewing brings that experience back again. Then I can savor it. You'll forget it's a movie and simply think you're secretly eavesdropping on other people's lives.

And if it's not all right, it's not yet the end.","review":"It seems almost geriatric but The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a quiet charmer, almost like vintage wine. It gets better as time goes. The cast is absolutely delightful and Judi Dench and Maggie Smith carry the movie expertly while Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Dav Patel and the supporting cast all chip in to make this sleeper hit something more than a few old folks looking for a place to retire. There's humour and more importantly, plenty of heart, that life takes on different turns, sometimes bad but mostly right. \\"Everything will be all right in the end. And if it's not all right, it's not yet the end.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the decade!","review":"Great story, great acting, great cinematography--everything but the violence and profanity!If you like the best actors of BBC, you'll love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic Hotel","review":"One of the all-time greats!

It was a refreshing change from the high tech, high sexed stuff that the theaters are full of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful movie!","review":"What a wonderful storyline, and particularly timely given the number of boomers coming of that certain age! Who wouldn't want to spend their \\"golden years\\" in the shadow of the British Raj--a time period as romantic for Westerners as it was volatile for India.Some of my favorite actors were in this movie and it lived up to the reputations they each had built over their years of stage and screen. The story will make you despair, and laugh and cry, and wonder what your elder years will be like. But the realism and simplicity with which the story was told will make you feel really good.Just remember.....If everything is not right, please wait a while, because everything will be all right in the end. If it is not all right, it is not the end.---Gotta love that!!!Namaste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very unexpected delight","review":"Watched it initially because I love Judy Dench and Maggie Smith.

Of course Maggie Smith. Romance. Problem solving of those living an adventurers life is always fun to see. The economic situation, with new tricks being learned while personal philosophies are evolving holds the interest of this viewer. I wrapped myself in the film's warmth."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun movie for girlfriend movie night","review":"watched this with my husband who is British and we enjoyed it. it is about overcoming fear and prejudice and finding happiness. it is a bit subtle and quieter than I thought it would be and nothing vulgar. more for adults than for teens or young adults"},{"rating":"2","title":"charming little film","review":"Judi Dench is at her best in this charming little film.

This is an \\"everybody\\" movie.It's funny, honest, visually beautiful, and peaks into so many universal aspects of life that any adult will be able to appreciate it. Other than the main Indian boy, the acting is top notch. If you are feeling a bit depressed, unmotivated, or stuck, this might be a good movie to watch. It's very hopeful and uplifting. I highly recommend it if you can do without explosions, sex, violence, blood, and cursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Movie About Finding Happiness","review":"This movie has some great stars.

I LOVED THE BEGINNING AND I LOVED THE END. I WOULD RECOMMEND. I LOVE BRITISH FILMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bollywood/Hollywood Stew","review":"It was interesting to see a film blend a few localities in India with that Bollywood touch, such as the westernized exuberance of our young hotel part owner/manager. That storyline was then interwoven with Hollywood style characters, mostly British retirees, seeking a place to reinvigorate their lives. The overall concept had potential for some creative interweaving of cultures but unfortunately the subplots for each of the retirees as well as for our hotel manager came out as artificial as a Hollywood tele soap opera. A formula box of cliché/stereotyped characters. The hotel manager's love for his girl friend who works as an English speaking phone telemarketing rep; the untouchable servant; the various dynamics amongst the British; all not only were written like a \\"cheap paperback novel\\" but the acting for each character came out \\"too acting like\\". Very contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cast - Bad Story","review":"Great cast and pretty well acted. But the story was not much to write home about. Guess I'm a traditionalist and when the tale involves a gay man reconnecting with his lover, a wife dumping her husband, an old swinger struggling to pick up a babe for a one night stand and so forth all set in a run down Indian hotel my interest fades pretty quickly. Whatever happened to honorable people even in old age determining to do the right thing? Not in this movie. Wish I had my $3.99 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film Not Worthy of the Cast","review":"With a host of actors associated with great performances over the years this movie proved to be a surprising disappointment.

Guess again. I fell asleep 1/2 into the movie and when I woke up, I hadn't missed anything. It was boring when fell asleep and was boring when I woke up. The kid from Slumdog millionaire really proved that being directed well brings out good performances, which was true for Slumdog; not so much for this movie. The idea was cute but skip the movie. The trailer has all the highlights and anything good in the movie.

What it is --- a well founded story and platform for some the best actors and actresses of our times to demonstrate their craft and draw the audience into the world they created.

It is a great movie about getting older. I think the target audience would be 50+. It is a little predictable but still the decisions made in the film are what we must all face eventually. Do you do your life with daring or do you just become sheep in an \\"adult living facility\\". I'm afraid India would be my last pick for a retirement home, however. It might be slightly above Bangladesh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Show","review":"I gave \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" 5 stars because I liked the picture. I recommend it to Judy Dench fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and touching film","review":"I love the impression that you get of India in this film - the sounds and colors, the rush of people, and you can almost smell it. The ensemble cast is a bunch of venerable pro's - I will watch Judi Dench or Maggie Smith in just about anything and I certainly wasn't disappointed with their performances here. I believe the film got mixed reviews but not from me. It's a life-affirming story about the capacity to change and evolve, even when you are elderly and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed this film.","review":"I knew this would be worth watching by just looking at the cast.

Maybe. The actors were familiar for the most part but the accents were very strong and difficult to understand. In full disclosure, I have difficultly with foreign accents. I gave the movie to my parents, who are in their 80's ,to watch -they are major Judi Dench fans. I wish I had rented it for a bargain price -I paid way to much.

It has some of my favorite actors and I love films which take place in India...so vibrant and beautiful. But the plot is beyond cliche' and so ridiculously sentimental, I found myself rolling my eyes again and again at the stupid lines actors such as the wonderful Dame Judy Dench and Maggie Smith had to say. If you want a mindless ride through India, don't mind the stereotypical characters, and silly predictable plot, then you'll like this film. If not, then rent it...don't make the mistake I did when I bought the film on Amazon Instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiled througout this movie","review":"While I can understand that a young audience might not have an appreciation for this movie, I loved it!

So many movies tend to make a joke of the elderly--sadly--so it was high time for this story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"With such great actors I expected it to be a humorous fun adventure to India. It was dull and rather depressing. I bought it as a gift (unseen) for my father-in-law who just entered an assisted living home. I finally got around to watching it and was so disappointed and worried it would depress my father-in-law. I advised him NOT to watch it. It may appeal to some, but if you are looking for light humorous fun then I would suggest you skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good actors doesn't mean good writing","review":"What are these Amazon reviewers thinking? There may be fine actors but the writing is beyond bad, it is all so canned. Goes to show that it takes much more than good actors to make a great production.

On watching it closely, I realized how many \\"issues\\" were brought to the fore. Just the idea that such a service could be \\"outsourced\\" is food for thought. What is wrong with our \\"developed\\" countries that such an essential service could even be considered for outsourcing? And then there were the intertwined lives of the many characters -- and how issues between and among them were resolved.

Anyfilm that features Maggie Smith and Judy Dench, is a winner. To me this would be the adventure of a lifetime;one of those vacations for laid back personalities who are able to handle the most adverse conditions, comingalong in a very unexpected way. This is definitely not a uxury vacation in any tangible respect. However, thismovie is rich in the development of unique personal relationships. The pace of the movie is like a leisurelyelephant walk thru a jungle path. Personally, I wish that I had the guts to take such a vacation.

They end up in a ramshackle hotel with its own story. All the characters adapt with varying degrees of success and outcomes.I thought I would only tolerate the movie.

The cast is superb, the dialog well written, the story.....though certainly not profound.....is good theater. Sometmes funny, sometimes sad, both simple and complex.

Most of the audience seemed to be over sixty. I am in my 70s. The reactions I heard were all about relating to the characters and the dialogue. Most of the dialogue was more original than Maggie Smith's comment about green bananas, which I've heard dozens of times before. Having visited northeastern India and felt its overwhelming splendor and squalor, I was reminded of much of what I saw there. India itself seemed to be one of the characters, and was ably supported by both young and old Indian characters but also stood on its own with the visuals and the cacophony. The Hindu funeral made me wish I could have one too when my time comes. This is a movie I will see again and again just for the pleasure of seeing people and places that make me feel that it's really OK to be 70 and \\"out there.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise!","review":"This is a exceptional movie. Well acted, directed, etc. and interesting location. Sometimes when you have this much acting talent in a movie it can fall flat, but not this time (the younger actors were very good as well - a nice balance). There was nothing that I didn't like about this movie and kudos for creating a story about older folks that didn't show them infirm or demented. These folks started new adventures, brought closure to lifelong desires and found a soul mate while all the time both entertaining and educating us that getting older is not necessarily the end of a full life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"There are plenty of detailed reviews here, so I will just be brief. This is a feel-good movie with a stellar cast set among the cacophony that is India. I smiled, and laughed through the whole thing and cannot wait to see it again.

As I said in my title- Charming film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"After recently reading the book, and seeing that a movie had been made from it, I was very excited to see it. What a disappointment!! This movie barely follows the story line of the original, and in fact, appears to be a story from some other book - maybe \\"Life in India for Westerners who are old.\\" Even if I hadn't read the book, I found that the two hours this movie spent to tell the tale was weak and left many ends untied - as one other Amazon reviewer pointed out, \\"how they got hooked into going to the hotel was all very fuzzy. Suddenly they are all together on a plane for India\\". If I was the author of this book, I'd be rather upset with the guy who wrote the screenplay. What was he thinking??

It was a very touching movie, one that I can relate to, and I plan to view it several more times before sharing it with some of my other friends. I look forward to more films in this same genre.

These seniors all respond to an add to live at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The hotel does not quite live up to the advertisements. Each senior, or senior couple, discovers something about themselves and about dealing with aging. Juxtapose against the stories of the older folks is the the story of the young Indian man who is running the hotel. Excellent cast, and screenplay is good. Although not a \\"deep\\" movie, it is light and fun,"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Big Chill\\" for seniors!","review":"Great movie, great story line, and wonderfully acted.

Tom Wilkinson in particularly good in his role. The performances are at turns thoughtful and entertaining. Dev Patel adds a great light-hearted feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good British story in an exotic setting","review":"Some of my favorite British actors appear in this film. There are some very delightful and some surprising twists, others not so surprising but very satisfying none the less. I wish they would have used the backdrop of India more, in a cinematic-art-photography way, but it was very well done. Maybe they did, and I just wanted panoramic landscapes instead of crowded streets. At just over 2hours I thought it might drag, but was in fact very well paced all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not see","review":"Ordered on my TIVO but could not view movie but was still charged.

Instead I was turned off completely after the first few minutes. One never got a good grasp of who these people were to begin with, and how they got hooked into going to the hotel was all very fuzzy. Suddenly they are all together on a plane for India. The background noise is loud and ugly and one simply wishes for it to cease. Their arrival is chaotic in a bad sense, the movie doesn't take long enough to make the few points it has to make, and the Indian proprietor hops and jumps around for no particular reason. Smith and Dench and the rest are fine actors but the script doesn't give them any way to show this. I finally decided it was a total loss and dumped the CD into the trash. Great actors, bad script and terrible direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting plot","review":"There should be a warning that the movie's plot revolves around homosexuality. Not a movie our family was ready to see. Plot is this: married couple is perpetually unhappy. However the happy gay couple tragically is kept apart by heterosexual societal norms and finally death. Message? Families suck, gay love is beautiful but crushed by evil traditional societies. Would give it 0 stars if we could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Boring","review":"I anticipated this movie very much. With all the great actors, I couldn't wait to see it.

I also wanted to move into the hotel and become friends with all the amazing inhabitants."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Exotic Movie","review":"Judi Densch and Maggie Smith seem to be attracted to making movies and shows about ordinary people and ordinary people can relate to these.

A winner - Oscar material for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Exotic Marigod Hotel Movie","review":"This is just a fun movie. Not the best probably from a critics standpoint, but both my wife and I enjoyed the movie. If you are looking for a really fun movie night, and you are over 55 years old, I recommend this movie.

Not quite the luxury accommodations that were expected, but they try to make the best of it. They all befriend each other, and also learn to appreciate the locals and the culture. This was a well-scripted movie filled with clever dialogue that kept the audience laughing throughout. Most of the cast is likeable and they all have individual problems and stories that you see them working through. Peppered with a veteran cast of actors, this is film is well-acted, well-written, and is a very entertaining film that is geared toward an adult audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Exotic Marigold Hotel","review":"Great movie.

I saw it twice and enjoyed it both times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful acting, good story","review":"This movie provides a thoughtful perspective on aging and the new possibilities that arise later in life. Each of the elderly English characters (with amazing performances) chooses a low-cost retirement in India, surrendering a familiar vision of their lives for the practical necessities of life in a (cheaper) foreign place. The world they enter feels chaotic, boisterous and gorgeously colored, while presenting novel opportunities and temptations. Set in the almost dreamlike hotel, and in its young manager's (Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire and Newsroom) dreamlike ambitions, each character's path unwinds to an unexpected result. A tidy, conventional and (for me) satisfying character-driven drama, with the rare, unhurried pace of maturity and the rich performances of a superb cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY entertaining!","review":"Terrific acting and a very entertaining movie. India plays a large role in the movie almost as a character in itself, which just ads to the flavor and enjoyment of this film. This is a feel good, easy watch that is perfect for a Friday night at home or as an enjoyable escape on a long airplane flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"great movie would recommend, actors well played their part, scenery fantastic, hoping for a sequel , blu ray are great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Asian Dragon Korean Mink Blanket","review":"I love how soft this blanket is.

Songs like \\"Dear John\\", \\"I am Your Robot\\", \\"Ball and Chain\\", \\"Spiteful Child\\", and \\"Where Have All The Good Times Gone\\" are just great songs. I like it because of the great melodies and hooks. It doesn't have any fluff, or slow crap that plagued Elton in his later years. This is 90% Rock, 10% Nice Slow Songs, and 100% great material. \\"Jump Up!\\" is a must for any Rock 'n Roll Fan's Musical Collection. I have all of Elton's music, and when ever I am in the mood for Elton John, I frequently find myself turning \\"Jump Up!\\" on.

I lost intrest in the book extremely fast; I only kept reading on the false hope that I would find something intresting. To my suprise and disappointment I couldn't find anything intresting.

Many of the most unusual jobs were related to the movie and television industry and thus only available in LA, or perhaps New York. Others you could probably only find if you lived in a very (and I do mean very) large city. As for the rest of the jobs, the majority of them can be seen in the want ad columns everyday.Almost all of her source information recommended checking in the yellow pages under the desired field. When there were actual phone numbers again they were usually for Los Angeles or other large cities.While there were a few ideas I found interesting I think this book would have been better titled: '50 run of the mills jobs that you've already seen in the want ads, 24 interesting ideas, 20 more interesting ideas if you live in a very large city, and 60 really cool ideas if you happen to live in Los Angeles.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly little trifle","review":"This is a silly little book. The ideas are a poorly written patchwork with little real guidance. It is the equivalent of many of the \\"spam\\" mail scams that we constantly receive offering \\"work at home opportunities\\"I believe the writer takes advantage of people looking for solid advice. It is difficult enough for people trying to survive, be it as an actor, musician or whatever without shelling out money for such a mis-guided and simple minded product.Apparently from what I read the author quit the entertainment industry and becam a Cantor (which was not listed as one of the 154 ways to make money), so apparently the advice in the book did not work for her!Save your hard earned money, don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info.

Ms. Hughes has successfully captured the essence of college life. That essence boils down to one thing: CHOICES. Anyone who has lived can relate to and learn from this novel. It teaches the female about determination and not exepting less than your worth. It shows the male how to be a male. It also purports that its cool to not conform.What set this novel apart from others in the genre was the \\"writing within the writing\\". Ms. Hughes was able to pull this off as if there were actually two authors on this one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"I really liked this book. It was quite captivating. Anyone who has lived on a college campus can identify with the main character of this novel. I recommend that everyone read it.

Great for high school or college age students who are faced with choices to make about careers or giving in to peer pressure. Also recommended for any parent of a young adult.

A must to have.","review":"I've been doing yoga for 2 years and bought this book 1.5 years ago. It has been a big help to me with finding new asanas to do and how to do them. It also discusses other aspects of Yoga - what yoga means, the various levels, what meditation means and how to meditate. The photos are excellent and show you step by step how to do both beginner asanas as well as advanced postures.I highly recommend this book not only for a beginner, but also for someone who is familiar with practicing yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Yoga book I've seen","review":"This is the best, most appealing Yoga book I've ever seen. It's complete but minimalist, telling only what you need to hear and showing only what you need to see without a lot of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Flash, No Substance","review":"This book has several very attractive pictures of very flexible people performing asanas. If you like to go to local yoga classes to watch others practice, then this is the book for you. This book is very impractical for most readers though. There is a lot of ground covered, and none of it is done with any degree of thoroughness. This book gets points only for presentation. Check out the book by Erich Schiffman for a complete yoga book you can use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga is NOT just a workout!!","review":"I really liked this book simply because it covers the most basic but important Asanas. I also like the array of different topics covered e.g Preparatory excercises, Shatkarma, Vegetarian Diet, Dhyana etc. The only minor(?) flaw that I find when I compare this book with the one I have ( sorry, it's in my native language from Swami Kripalvananda AKA \\"Kripalu\\") that this book does not advise on which \\"Chakra\\" to concentrate on while doing a particular Asana, a spiritual aspect of Yoga that distinguishes Yoga from a workout. Those who are only looking to gain \\"physical\\" benefits, this book is very good. It covers almost all aspects of Yoga written with a beginner in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for beginners","review":"This is a great book for beginners also, like me. It presents a great introduction do Yoga philosophy, and all aspects related to Yoga, like meditation, eating, breathing. The asanas are presented with very beautiful illustrations, clear and easy to follow. And the price is another great attraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic and well illustrated","review":"I have read dozens of books on Yoga and have practiced it for several years.

I found this book as enjoyable as the other one. The characters,once again,were real and believable. I detest the father for he is an evil,selfish man. I adored the romance of Ash and Rosalind along with their individual personalities. It is characters like these that makes the McClairen's Isle books such a good read. I can hardly wait for the final book \\"Ravishing One\\" to arrive in my mailbox. As soon as it comes you can bet that I'll be reading it probably in one sitting! Smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"gothic suprize","review":"I love lush, romantic stories. The reviews, description, etc., on the cover convinced me that this book would be all of the above. Lo and behold, instead of romance, I entered a gothic, murky world of unpleasant, depressing characters. Yes, the author is good at storytelling, but the 2 star rating reflects what I believe was deceptive advertising. Too much torment, too much deep agony for my tastes. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Intense Hero","review":"I found this book very enjoyable. The author doesn't write as though she is talking to children. Ash was just a touch too moody for me but still quite likable. I will definitely read the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, not too \\"trashy\\"","review":"I was looking for some light reading and this book fit the bill. The story of Ash and Rhiannon kept me turning pages. The intimate scenes were well done; a romance not a trashy novel. I still have some questions to be answered by the sequels, which I am looking forward to reading. I'm glad that I discovered Ms. Brockway's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brief review of The Passionate One","review":"As a diehard Connie Brockway fan I was more than a little disappointed with this latest effort. As usual her hero Ash was suitably tortured and smouldery however our heroine Rhiannon seemed rather lacklustre compared to other Brockway heroines eg Desdemona in As You Desire. There seemed little of the soul wrenching connection I associate with her love stories. In a way this novel came across as much more formulaic with less thought to the rounding out of her characters especially in Rhiannons case. Here's hoping she is saving herself for the next in the trilogy The Reckless One."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate Weight","review":"Just bought this. Every time you weigh the baby, you get different numbers. The variation is large enough that it makes it useless to track the weight of your baby. The baby was of course moving but no more than one would expect for a baby who is lying on a scale. My doctor's weighing scale is much better. This is a complete waste of money if your are using it for a baby. I also tried to weigh an object and found an 80 gram variation based on where I put the object on the scale. Unacceptable.Too bad because Graco generally makes good products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and disappointed","review":"The scale we received was defective. Our heart sank when we put our baby on it--supposedly he had lost 3 of 11 pounds! Then I compared weighing a gallon of water and it was not only several pounds off, but it had a different reading every time I put the water on it (in the exact same place). The batteries shipped with the scale were dented so I also tried it with brand new batteries. Though a minor inconvenience, the display shows pounds with a decimal fraction or (optionally) total ounces, but not the typical measurement of pounds and ounces together. I'm not sure how this product is related to \\"Graco\\" because I couldn't find anything indicating it was made or sold by Graco.Too bad--it looked like a good deal at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"caution","review":"This item is attractive looking but the one I received didn't work. It quickly weighed 4 pints of water as 4.6 pounds. Not accurate, but close enough for checking on gain/loss which is what we are concerned about. But the baby was another matter. The scale took much more time to reach \\"hold\\" and give a weight. It gave wildly different weights as we tested it over two days. The last weight we got at the medical office was 11 pounds 8 ounces. The sale gave the following weights: 11.4, 9.6, 10.38, 11.2. This is obviously of no help. Of course, the baby moved his arms and legs, but did not squirm and was not in distress. And babies do move a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bebe sounds digital scale","review":"I purchased this scale to weigh my baby. I found it to be inaccurate- 4-6 oz variations from the scale at the doctor' office. It also gives a wide range of readings with repeat weighs. The variations of repeat weighs are from 1 oz to 8 oz depending on how the baby is positioned or if the baby is moving. It also takes too long to tare/zero. Overall, not the best pick for a baby scale. I completly agree with the last review."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby scale used for puppies","review":"This baby scale works very good for puppies. This digital scale is more accurate enabling a true weight for the puppies."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"this product is an absolute rip off. it gives completely different readings even for a stationary object, much less a wiggling baby! we bought this to keep up with our baby's growth and compare her weight to the pediatricians recommendations.

What a wonderful blend of Southern Fried Rock, jazz and blues. Taking a hint from Jethro Tull and adding the flute gave them their distinct sound.--- It is painful to listen to the audio on this disc. Who did this? Katel? Sounds like it was remastered using two tin cans and a string! I have a great sound system, but not even that could make this disc sound good. If I was the engineer that remastered this concert, I would not put my name in the credits.

However, the production value of the DVD is atrocious. It seems they had no idea as to the arrangement of the songs as indicated by the camera cuts. The sound is poor. It feels as if a few mics were placed near the PA, which is a poorly conceived idea. This was an MTV production in their early years. I don't think they had a clue! Its too bad because it would be nice to have a visual documentation of a terrific band who could still deliver these great songs live!

I would highly reccomend this violin to a beginning student. The violins have a pretty and professional appearance as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for money","review":"This violin arrived as advertised online. The case is not as nice as some I have seen and does not have the backpack straps but does have \\"legs\\" on side that enable one to sit the case on the floor without the actual case touching the floor. A single strap is included. Finish is nice and sounds good once tuned. For a student violin, we are very happy with this product. This is after returning several lesser made violins from another website. This exact violin was selling in our local music store for $40 more. Worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Amateurish Documentary","review":"This is a short documentary which contains very little information about Snowies and is very amateur in its filmmaking - both audio and video.

I think that I will return to this book again and again. In chapter 3 alone, there are over 30 activities to do with your child, with clear explanation of what to do as well as how it helps your child. The author's narrative throughout the book is not preachy and he acknowledges his own bias, but presents clear, factual support. This was definitely not money wasted (especially since at the bookstores you pay retail!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parent Educator Likes This Book on Raising Smart Children","review":"As a parent educator and trainer of Head Start staff, I really agree with this book called Raise a Smarter Child by Kindergarten. It is so important that parents, child care providers and extended family use this window of time to connect and activate the critical thinking parts of the brain.Often parents think they need sophisticated games or flash card to increase their child's intelligence. The best tool is the love and presence of consistent care. Little games, activities and playing with our babies help them to build confidence and curiosity.Read, Sing and Talk to your babies. It will help them attach and connect to you, the most important person in the world to them. How you model kindness and appreciation is how they will learn and practice these life-skills.

The book is amply illustrated, and the pictures are enough to set you salivating. I like it when I can see what it will look like, and also how it could be presented.The organization of the book is good, and the recipes are clearly written. Also of benefit is that the text is large enough to read at a distance in the kitchen, a boon for those aging baby-boomer eyes.I have a lot of cookbooks, and this one has become a well-used favourite.

I started piano years ago, and then quit. When I wanted to pick it up again, I ordered this book and it has been great. It teaches you chords early on which makes the sound so much richer.

They assume they know what kind of music I want to learn to play and only teach me enough skills so that I can muster up a lackluster rendition of some stodgy old \\"favourite\\". My old piano teacher made me buy this book; I hated it as much as I hated her rapping me on the knuckles.

I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Much","review":"I agree with alot of the points as far as the services being more reverent and respectful,but the idea of the presence of drums and electric guitars being almost considered evil in themselves is a bit much.I think that if their use in worship makes one feel sensual and carnal in any way, the problem lies within that persons spirit not the use of any type of instrument.I would also like to say that if one based praise and worship totally on the principles in this book,you would effectively wipe out 100 years of a wonderful African-American gospel music tradition in this country. There are many scriptures that refer to loud instruments being played to worship God,the stringed instrument and the drum among them.I love the Hymns and I love Gospel and Southern Gospel,but I also love blues and rock,most of all I love My Lord And Saviour Jesus Christ. Jesus will help you discern what is appropriate and what is not, look to the Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logically self-defeating and bigoted","review":"The author is blind leading the blind. Just as we find many KJV fanatics who believe that only the KJV is the Word of God, while forgetting about non-English speakers and therefore turning God into their own extreme bigoted selves, here we have a radical contemporary trying to tell us he's actually a somber conservative. In this I mean of course that the very music he considers ultra-conservative, was once considered by the Church to be radically contemporary and demonic music in its own right. The first thing this bigot should have bought was a dictionary, for the mere definition of contemporary could have saved this book from being written at all.His arguments are no better than the racist.

This book is merely preaching to the choir... those mad about changing musical styles and tastes within the church. Many praise songs are right out of the Psalms which destroys the argument of superior theology in the hymns. The argument that a back beat is wrong sounds racist to me. So Lucarini is saying the only style that's acceptable is music from our European ancestors... and the black Christian church is not spirit filled and unable to discern proper musical style... Give me a break! Every statement in the book has some grain of truth to it but no more than one small grain per statement. This book embarasses the church.

This one leaves you feeling good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is an unbelievable story. I loved all 400+ pages.","review":"This book was superb. I can't say enough good things about it.

My parents were not very strict!) mainly because of her detailed love scenes and hot, Native American hunks with flowing black hair. As far as steamy love scenes go, Nan Ryan can't be beat! I must say some of the parts of this book really got me going, while other parts were pretty weak. I found the plot really unrealistic and it took some very odd turns as if Nan tried to squish two totally different stories together trying to make one long story. The ending was cheeseball and the characters came off contrived. Luv Ya Nan but, I think you ran out of good ideas on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I like the deflector but it does not cut down much, if any, on the wind noise; at least not to my expectations.

I did confirm that my lighter was still active even when the car was off so that was not the problem. In fact, I know something was happening because when I came down later that day (after I had plugged the battery maintainer into lighter of my car) the GPS screen on my car was open (it rotates up when the car turns on) and illuminated. I figured that it meant that the solar charger was working. Unfortunately, the next day when I went to start my car all it did was click.

Not really worth my time to package it and ship it out.It gets super hot in the sun due to the black frame and closed environment of the case, especially if you use it inside your car.

Liked the LED light that showed product was operating and the two sets of connectors. Therein lies the problem. The alligater clips positive polarity is the male probe on the connector and in the effort to not short out the solar collector connected the battery first before connecting the plug. Accidentally dropped the plug and the probe hit ground producing a wake up spark. Recommend manufacter reverse the polarity on the plug having the positive on the male probe at the solar collector side will not cause any problems since there is no return path with negative being the female side. Liked the concept so much opted to buy the 5 watt model to get more oomph of a trickle charger. By the way the 5 watt model has the same design flaw and does not have the LED light but is just what I wanted to keep the battery on the spare car charged without having to run it (waste gas) to do what the solar charger is doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This is the second time we have purchased this solar charger, the first was for our boat battery, since the boat sits most of the winter months, the charger helps keep the battery charged so it will start up right away after a long period of in activity.

Came on one more time after i jostled the cord at the joint where it attaches to the unit. since they state that you need to check the voltage to see if it is working properly (since the LED light is THAT undependable) I had to then purchase a voltmeter to even see if the piece of crap was even working.

I picked it up, it started working, sat it down, it quite. Twisted it, it worked, then it didn't, then it did. The old intermitant (sp) connection problem. Basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it. Long story short, I fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components.

The suction cups held it, but somehow the jarring force cracked it. Now it only blinks intermittently and a voltage meter test confirms that it doesn't charge reliably now.

I was hoping this panel would delay my having to do this, but after trying this device it seemed to not only not work, but it may have drained my battery. Plugging into the 12v socket was not an option for me because apparently Japanese cars don't send power to or from the battery when there is no key in the ignition. I had to use the alligator clamps and maybe the connection wasn't right, but it was difficult to connect it right unless the clamps were pointing straight up (getting in the way of the hood when closed).

The only real flaw in this book is the author's somewhat annoying habit of using language suitable to a certain character, but doing so when we're not inside that character's head. It sounds like an editorial aside and is a wee bit distracting. Nevertheless, it's an extremely enjoyable book. Read the first chapter, and then see if you can put the book down.

Jefferson. As much as I loved his The Life and Times of Bobby Z, I enjoyed California Fire and Life more. Winslow has a unique comic voice that blends well with the fast pace of the plot. Although I thought some of the plot coincidences near the end of the book were a stretch, Winslow's characterization and pseudo-courtroom drama more than made up for that minor flaw. Of the 42 novels I've read, reviewed and ranked this year, California Fire and Life ranks second only to Harris' Hannibal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot stuff","review":"Part murder mystery and part text book on arson, this compelling book pulls you in and holds you.

He should have just played it straight.Read the book -- avoid the audio cassette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Vacation Read","review":"The two biggest complaints about the book are the existence of stock characters and less than believable plot twists.I found the characters strong. Perhaps they were not multifaceted or three dimensional, but it wasn't like the protagonists had no negative attributes or you had no sympathy for what the chief antagonist, Nicky, must have gone through in life.I am confused by what other reviewers found unbelievable in various plot twists. Biggest plot twists are premised on the fact that organizations, legal or illegal, seek to safeguard their assets in a variety of ways, legal and illegal. Good people make poor choices. None of these are shocking.I tried and failed to read this book traveling on Amtrak with my children, but that was more because of their behavior. I then read it thoroughly in about 4 days. Good read, interesting information, challenging focus. I strongly recommend you read this all at once as there are a lot of twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"A Don Winslow book where the hero is not a drug dealer or a hit man, Jack Wade is an arson investigator and very good at the job.He gets sent to investigate the apparent death by smoke of a wealthy woman whose body is found in the burnt out wing of her mansion.Wade is an investigator of the old school , he follows his instincts and in doing so unearths a web of corruption that reaches right through his community.We have corrupt cop and Russian gangsters, everyone is beautiful and Californian cool, a complete page turner.

Winslow was an investigator in a prior incarnation and he knows his stuff.An excellent read"},{"rating":"1","title":"The first half is good...","review":"The first half of the book was great. The main character is engaging and the details of fire investigation are really fascinating. Somewhere around the start of the second half, though, the story becomes one ad hoc scene after another... the author seems to plot each chapter as a dramatic movie scene, then forces his characters to act out the scene whether or not it fits their previous style or characteristics (or the previous plot). By the end, I was quite upset I'd ever started reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"What a disappointment!

In about 50 minutes of stand-up, Rodney goes from loveable loser, to a-hole, to sexual pervert, to jerk, to loser that is a jerk, to sarcastic twit, and finally to comic genius. Rodney was indeed the man, as his crazy jokes could indeed happen to anybody. I mean, who can't help but laugh at jokes about \\"Rodney's wife\\" being \\"easy\\", or even about Rodney seeing a naked guy jogging outside his house and when Rodney asks him why, the guy answers, \\"because you came home early\\".I don't know how to classify Rodney Dangerfield, but I do know that he is one of the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"45 Minutes of Non-Stop, Rapid-Fire, Laugh-Out-Loud GENIUS","review":"This is Rodney at his absolute peak, recorded around the time he did Caddyshack.

Both the fantasy and technology aspects of the book were truly captivating and made for an excellent read. i heartily reccomend this book to fans of either genra although this is more of a fantasy than a sci fi novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glowing recommendation","review":"Perhaps it is because I had just read Socrates for a philsophy class, but I found The Caverns of Socrates to be one of the best fantasy novels I had ever read.The author skillfully blends fantasy, computers and adventure into one exciting non-stop read. I think a book is good when I don't want to stop reading it. I couldn't get this one out of my head.Being a role-player, I also enjoyed that aspect of the story as it underscored the camraderie that exists among gamers. Look for the scene in the cave where the character must solve a puzzle or die. If you like fantasy, you will love this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read with a great premise","review":"I truly enjoyed this book( and others by this author) because he has the ability to sieze your attention and keep it, by force, if necessary.

It was the first McKiernan book I read and it started out okay, I was remined of an old book by Piers Anthony of the SAME plot.

The characters are way too perfect. All they do is grin and laugh at stupid jokes and they are flawless. The whole thing is just so implausible that it makes you want to scream.

All in the first couple of hundred pages. The book isnot long, so I suppose something must happen eventually.I always look forward to this author's books and snap themup as soon as I find them, but this one is just not worththe money to buy it or the time to read it.

Number 1, it can make the game you are using much more fun. 2, It DOES NOT have to take all the fun out of the game, you CAN choose the codes you use. (I myself think codes like invincibility are cheap, but Gameshark has other codes.) 3, Use codes ONLY from Gameshark's official site. 4, If a code sounds suspicious, DON'T USE IT! Only the suspicious codes can destroy your game. 5, the code creator only works sometimes. Also, the codes made by the code creator can mess up your game. Overall, Gameshark is a good buy, but remember my advice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Consuming","review":"Unlike the Game Genie, which comes with a code book, the Gameshark does not come with a book. In order to find out what games the Gameshark is preloaded for, you have to load up the Gameboy with the Gameshark and a game.

I had to start all over again and it took me 22 hours to get back where i was in the game. I was completely wrong when i bought this game, and you will be too if you buy it.

Their are plenty of codes available for most gameboy games, but I have more fun hacking my own. I have a bit of advice for all who use the gameshark pro.Before using the gameshark, back-up the games you are playing with a memory card, then if you make any mistakes or somehow delete a game you can return your game to where it was before using the gameshark. I read the review about the fellow who somehow deleted his game using the gameshark and spent 22 hours getting back to where he was, if he had used a memory card he would have saved himself 21hrs & 55mins of frustration.The gameshark pro is one item every gameboy user should have, it makes all the games more interesting to play.

I was right; this is actually quite a good mix. But what I really liked about it is that the standout tracks really helped me realize where to go from here. This was a good CD to get me into the genre, and the track listing told me what to get next, namely Deepsky and John Digweed, to name a few. \\"Cosmic Dancer\\" and \\"Heaven Scent\\" remain two of my favorite tracks to this day, and I wouldn't have the CD collection I have now if it weren't for this disc. So I guess in the end, if you're just getting into trance music, this is a good place to start.

I didn't know what was in the package, but when I opened it, there were three 1.5-inch dollhouse throw pillows. I realize that they cost only $1.99, but this was a last-item price, so I figured they must be on sale to get rid of them...especially since it cost $6.60 to ship something that could have been shipped in a small letter or invitation envelope for 43 cents or whatever stamps are costing these days.

I found this book to be very poorly written, non-explanatory and extremely dull and boring! You can see on the cover that the original photograph of the couple was in color, but why he chose to make all the photographs in the book in black and white, other than to save money (cheap, cheap, cheap!), I'll never know.

On the contrary, his tale deals with people too self-absorbed and cowardly to act in any way other than that which satisfies their own immediate desires. They realize they are in the middle of a national tragedy, and they want to be brave and selfless, but it's not in them. This is a situation that probably occured all over this country in the days following the attacks, but of course was never reported.

I am pleasantly surprised to see Traci Lords create such a believable, over-controlling Mother character, kudos on her acting interlaced with the dark humor that permeates the movie. Lords might have a future in major films with better roles. Actress McCord, playing an outcast teen, was a running character in the surgical series Nip/Tuck. Ironically, this movie's gruesome plot is similar to Nip/Tuck's dark humor, bizarre bodily themes and sick fantasy flashes. McCord reminds me of Charlize Theron, when Theron went from mostly gorgeous blonde roles to playing serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 'Monster'.

Anyone comparing the CD to Hound Dog's own work has to first specify whether the comparison is to 'Dog on LP or 'Dog live. Live, nobody could do his songs the way Hound Dog Taylor did them. In part, this has something to do with the fact that few people could consume the amount of alcohol 'Dog did between sets and still hold onto the guitar. But in the studio, 'Dog's output was decidedly inconsistent. If we're comparing this to almost any of 'Dog's studio recordings, it holds up really well.Highlights to me are Luther Allison's romp through \\"Give Me Back My Wig\\" and Elvin Bishop's amusing (and accurate) tales of playing in 'Dog's band. But there is not a real stiff cut here. All concerned show an genuine affection for 'Dog's underappreciated work.

While yes the courses are very attractive, they take about 20 minutes to finish, and you have check points to get to, and it took me about 7 times to finish the first course. Also you can't race the next track, unless you finish the first one. But the thing I hated the most was the fact that the superpipe mode where you do tricks, was nearly impossible to do anything cool looking, and landing was near impossible, and the announcer always says the same thing, which had me at times yelling at him to shut up.

The gymnastic contortions of Maynard Ferguson's trumpet on 'Hot Canary' have been long sought and the crowning glory has to be 'Blues in Burlesque', Stan's tongue in cheek tribute to traditional jazz blues. These tracks in particular don't appear to have been re-issued anywhere else and are a joyous find for a true Kenton fan.

Dave Hole also plays acoustic guitar very well and although he doesn't have what you would call a great voice , I really enjoy his vocals a lot .

Axis and Allies is renowned as one of the greatest strategy board games of all time. Using true military strategy and the luck of the die, one can relive World War II as the leader of the Germans, Japanese, Americans, British, or Soviets. The beauty of the board game is the fine detail of the many pieces used to represent real military units. The advantage of the video game is that it doesn't take thirty minutes to set up. If you like the board game, you must get the video game. Never heard of Axis and Allies? It's risk with realistic military strategy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ease of use and playability don't outweigh COUNTLESS bugs","review":"It's too bad that such a great fun board game can't translate to CD-ROM without being full of bugs and glitches (and that's from playing against the computer, not even counting internet play). Still, there are good things to say about the game: it's easier to play than the board version, there are many rules variations to make it almost infinitely challenging, map graphics are true to the original and the spirit of the game is in no way compromised, plus you don't have to do any of the laborious set-up chores and general minutiae of the board version.Hasbro has already put out one patch. Here's to hoping they can release another for this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I think this a fairly good implementation of one of the all time great WWII board games. It's takes good strategy, military tactics, economics and some luck to win consistently. Playing against the AI is a little too easy. I hope that they decide to upgrade the game to use the revised rule set and fix the bugs and problems with the AI. To make the AI more challenging, have it play Axis, set Russia Restricted, Axis Advantage and put more German infantry in Eastern Europe and Africa. Better yet, find a human opponent to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Computer Translation of an Excellent Board Game","review":"Even after applying the latest patch for this game (there have been three of them so far), I still experience frustrating bugs while playing against the computer.

I found the AI on the computer version to be very weak. I had to give the other side major bonuses, and pick the weakest country and give my self the poorest allies in order to get an even slightly challenging game out of it. The interface was also pretty weak, though the graphics were okay. Selecting and moving units around the board was the most cumbersome part of the game, especially with transports. Each time you want to move a group of transports and have them do the same thing, you have to handle each of them individually. There should have been a grouping function.Granted this is an older version, of the game. I would have probably not bought it if it was clear on the advertizement that this was for DirectX 5.0. That would have been a dead giveaway.

Shoen, who built one of America's great success stories, only to have it all taken away from him by one of his sons, in a bitter dispute that ended with the murder of Mr. Shoen's innocent daughter-in-law.While _Birthright_ is non-fiction, it reads like a page-turning novel. Though Watkins' style occasionally leaves something to be desired, the story that comes through is a tragic family saga worthy of comparison to _The Godfather_.Of course, truth is often stranger than fiction, and in this case, it is less pleasant. Few Hollywood villains are as flagrantly despicable as Edward J. \\"Joe\\" Shoen, the son who turned against his father and runs U-Haul to this day. You may have trouble believing that a human being could behave this way. But it's all here, and, unfortunately for the late L.S.

I've recently read about a dozen books on this subject, and listened to two audio tapes and watched one video. I'm nearly done w/ Rom's book, and it is really incredible. Rom has a breezy, friend-to-friend style of writing. He understands the hard truth about some things that other authors seem oblivious to (or perhaps in denial of). There were several insights that really made me nod my head; things I've been beginning to suspect-- DESPITE CONTRARY WISDOM from some women I've asked. Key points are communicated quite clearly. This is the first Amazon review I've written, and I am a big-time Amazon user. Thanks again, Rom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good message, bad instruction","review":"The author has a good message but he doesn't instruct the reader sufficiently to apply his advice. He describes the ideal man but doesn't give enough details on how to become that man.I think the book is decent, but it will be disappointing if you expect instructions on how to be a better man. Instead of instructions on how to be a better man, the author gives you a description of a better man."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be Weak and Get Taken Advantage Of","review":"Contrary to what my impressions of the book were when reading the description, this book is not about how to pick up on, seduce, or otherwise attract women. Major themes of this book include waiting around for a woman to be attracted to you and magically knowing when she does, not approaching women unless you get this feeling, and constant examples of the author's perceptions of the types of men in the world. Although the stories presented about these types are funny at times, they serve no purpose other to make the book longer than it really is. The author wants all men to find the woman of their dreams and be happy, which he claims he has done. That's not to say that all men don't eventually want this. It just seems at times the author wrote this book in order to impress his wife than actually help all men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for starting your transformation","review":"I enjoyed this book as it was an easy read. It is a meat and potatos book; there's no fat. If you're where I was a few months ago, your have resorted to looking for a book (of all things) that can help you with woman. No doubt you finally got burned so bad that it chnaged your direction in life and you are now a student looking for a teacher. I'd recomend you start here with Rom's book. Read through it and if you find it a painfull eye opener then GOOD because that is a sign that you are open to change and are on your way. Congratulate your self for finally starting this journey that in 12-18 months will produce a whole new you. After you have read Rom's book. Purchase and read all of the books by R. Don Steele. Their titles are a bit much and they are strongly worded but, for the most part, I found them factual and, again, a painfull read for me. Have fun on you new journey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"Rom tells it like it is these days. Especially with the statement, \\"Women chose the Men\\". Some men already know this and it is an eye-opener to some men don't know it. I even discovered that some women don't know this fact. Rom also describes the four categories of men and what it takes to be chosen. Overall \\"Nice Guys and Players\\" is an instructive and informative book.

It seemed to me that the \\"author\\" quickly wrote this book to make some quick cash (he obviously has had some success, as he duped me into buying it).

Save your money, fellas."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it....","review":"...but this book is a COMPLETE WASTE of money. The things written in here are the biggest crock...I've ever heard. Examples: In pretty much the first chapter it says that \\"the girl picks the guy\\", and that if she doesn't look at you and like you right away, then there's no hope. Also, it says nice guys can't get girls because they're usually ugly...It doesn't give you tips for anything, just to try and keep yourself clean-shaven and what not.

TINY SMALL!!","review":"When ordering, I didn't realize how small this is. I cannot see my whole face in it, no matter what. If I had a back seat, then, maybe I could from there. I don't, though. Although I've used the light a few times instead of turning on the overhead light, it doesn't really illuminate my face enough to use the mirror. Just enough to find my phone in the dark so that the screen gives me a brighter light.It's pretty thick, as well. It would not clip onto the hinge side of the visor in my CRX. Instead, it clips on the outside edge so that, when the visor is straight down, the mirror is on the end near the floor, not the ceiling. I find myself, still, turning the rear view toward me instead of using this tiny visor mirror. Not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"The quality is ok, but it did not fit the visor on my 2011 Chevy Cruze :( Also, the light could be a bit brighter,seems dim for a lighted mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work","review":"Fits great on visor of 1998 Nissan 240.

His music instills a fever that no water can extinguish. Luther left us early but his music remains a mainstay of what I would call the Blues at its' Utmost. This man is what the Blues is all about. Soul wrenching tunes that turn you on, and defintely up, to what is really happening in the world of BLUES. His guitar playing leaves nothing to be desired. If it does then you're in another world. Each tune is masterfully performed and holds every conisseur of Blues by the THROAT. If you're not afan of Luther then you are definitely not a fan of the BLUES. Listen to me when I say add this album to your collection. If you don't you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Redeeming in this book","review":"This is the first time that I have offered an opinion on a book but since it was such a disappointing experience to read it this is a form of catharsis for me. I am amazed at the favorable reviews and at the same time, bewildered. The characters and the plot weren't engaging at all. The word \\"trite\\" comes to mind but since I cannot leave a book unfinished, I endured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performances but............","review":"Well, the previous review has it right that these are great performances by Robert Palmer and his ace band, but the sound quality is simply awful and almost unlistenable to me (although I am an audio quality snob). It sounds like the recording was made on a cheap tape recorder from out in the audience and Robert himself sounds like he is singing into a tin can. It sounds like an old bootleg recording from the 70s. Bear in mind, I have been a huge Robert Palmer fan since Sneakin' Sally and can still bop around my living room when that tune is on - I just can't help it. But this release is disappointing. The studio tracks are pretty well recorded and aren't bad - but this one is only for real diehards and those who want to complete a collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pixie Three were a lot of fun!","review":"Ok, you had to be there but I did like this girl group. Good singing and catchy tunes. Their big hit was \\"Birthday Party\\" in 1963 but there were more fun records however sales were weak. Alas, my favorite song by this group, \\"Cold Cold Winter\\" is not here. It was the flip side of 442 Glenwood Avenue and got air play so should be here.Other than Lesley Gore, this kind of music pretty much vanished in 1964 after the British Invasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my money, even if it was required.","review":"If you are attempting to truly learn how to apply statistics to your data, please do not waste your time with this book. Pay the money for an actual statistics book written by a statistician and save yourself time, frustration and the money you would spend buying another stats book anyway after you became too frustrated with this book. It is poorly written, difficult to follow and riddled with mathematical errors. Additionally, she provides long descriptions of how to execute sample questions with MSTAT, but no explanation of how to complete a sample problem by hand, and little detail on the explanation of your output in the software means. Example problems do not have to be anthropological to understand how they apply to our field, they just have to be well written. Just save your money, and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on it","review":"Besides the abundance of spelling and grammatical errors that make this book look like it was written by a 5 year old, it is filled with false facts and outdated science.

Save your money and skip this book...trust me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am 45 years old, I am a successful business woman, and really want to find a loving relationship now. I was hoping this book could give me some tips on how to really make this happen. While the author seems like a nice person, she really didn't have much practical advice. The book is filled with generic platitudes such as \\"Go for the real thing,\\" \\"Know and like yourself,\\" \\"Work on your self-esteem\\" and \\"Maintain your sense of self.\\" I was really looking for a practical, go-get-it approach, with specific \\"how to\\" tips, so this book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Luv Aiden!","review":"I love aiden and i love there music ecspeicaly the last sunrise and die romantic!its the coolest and so are there music videos!if u like fftl or atreyu ul like this band.Emo and screamo are the coolest music ever!dont listen to bad reviews this band is awsum!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"Total My Chemical Romance knock off band.

I first found Aiden on pureovlume, and was awestruck. I Set My Freinds On Fire and Goodbye Were Falling Fast were amazing songs. I then went to go see them at a show a month before the cd came out. After seeing them i could not wait to buy this cd. When I did, Nightmare Anatomy far exceeded my expectaions. This is by far one of the best CD's I have ever listened to in my entire life. Nightmare Anatomy is full of fast upbeat songs filled with catchy lyrics. there is not a single song on this cd that you won't be getting into the beat or bobbin your head to. I highly recommend this cd to pretty much anybody. 5 FLIPPIN STARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh, C'Mon!!!","review":"This is exactly what is wrong with music now....Utter crap like this making my ears bleed...

Please.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aiden ~Nightmare Anatomy~","review":"Aiden's second full length album, their first for Victory Records, travels down a pretty worn out path. Aiden takes the up-tempo punk sound of AFI and early Thrice and adds a vocalist who sounds like a more punk version of the singer from Avenged Sevenfold. The problem with all of these comparisons is the following; the band isn't as moody as AFI, as brooding or dark as Thrice or as rock as Avenged Sevenfold, they fall short on every front. In fact, their vocalist pretty much falls flat all over the album. He just about kills the feel of every song on this disc due to his inability to emote any feelings because of his lack of range. The music, while not original, could be saved by a marginal vocalist. Too bad they don't have one.For Fans of: AFI, Thrice and My Chemical Romance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Frown","review":"I got Nightmare Anatomy the day it came out becasue \\"Our Gangs Dark Oath\\" is a great album and Knife Blood Nightmare was one of my favorite songs, but when the song came on it sounded like some ska kid with a tape recorder made it. Some of the songs I will give credit where it is needed: The Last Sunrise and See You In Hell... are both good songs. Most of the other songs get a thumbs down by me. And can 'Die Romantic' get anymore generic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you thought My Chemical Romance Couldn't get anyworse..","review":"Their new album, Aiden Nightmare Anatomy is like a huge turd in the toilet that is scremo music. Some how the singer got even more off key, the drummer lost the beat even more, they found even lamer ways to wear ties, make up and girl pants!At least Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge had a good producer. this is sloppy as all hell! What were they thinking with this mess? The singer sounds like hes got cotton balls in his mouth at all times and doesn't have any sort of concept of what pitch is! I can't understand why 13 year old girls think these putzes are so cool.Oh wait... Aiden is the band name? this is a different band?! They have the never to think the sound anything like the misfits rather then a total MCR tribute band?! THATS EVEN WORSE!!

(dont take that wrong, i like The Misfits!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me!?!?","review":"This band is such cliched eyelyner emo garbage I don't know where to even start...First of all they sound like a cheap second rate imitation of my chemical romance. MCR are not my cup of tea to begin with but they at least know how to somewhat write songs and sound good for what they are. If you are into that sort of thing go for the real source. I cant wait for this emo, eyeliner fad to be over with, it's wasting valuable space and air for real bands. If you want to hear something real, I suggest checking out Drive Like Jehu the self titled album, or anything by the Damned, Christ on a crutch or even Garden Variety \\"knocking on the skill level\\" which to me is true Emo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepackaged for this generation of mallrats","review":"To be honest I hated this band before I even heard their album. It seems like every rag I read, these posers had their mascara caked faces plastered on every other full page ad that those shameless con artists at Victory whored out.Just for sh%ts and giggles I decided to preview some of the tracks and it was exactly what I expected. Souless, heartless, glossy shlock. Which equates to a ton of records being sold to eyeliner wearing 16 year old boys and their girlfriends who outweigh them by 20 pounds.Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"I picked up this CD because this is a local NW band. WOW! was the first thing I said after about 20 minutes of this garbage album. I just couldent believe that people like this band. Although I wasn't expecting a master piece.... I mean you have to keep in mind that it is goth/punk/pop/screamo music, obviously the musicians in these bands are not going to be the most talented...but they can make some fun noise. However, this band was just awful. Don't take my word for it, if you want to save yourself some money, go to their myspace account and listen to one of their crappy songs. You will hear what I mean. But of course if you are a 16-year-old high school girl who doesn't know anything, you'll probably view this band as your God. As many of our misguided teens have. Listen to this music and turn it off and really be honest with yourself, think objectively...yeah...its trash. I agree with the guy above me, I am disappointed. I don't like that these guys are representing my hometown."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band rules","review":"They know how to play at a live show and they know how to rock the fans, leaving them wanting more. If you're going to sell this item 'used and new' you might as well get your money's worth (unless, of course, the disc is scratched). The album explains the horrors of their lives and tells kids going throught the same thing that they're not alone and that they shouldn't be. If you ever talk to wiL Francis(the frontman) i envy you. But if you do you will see his kind heart and even though bad memories drain from it in what some people would call horrific screamo songs, there is a meaning to it. And you should give it a chance. If not, go listen to Brittney Spears and consider yourself emo because you cry over the fact that she shaved her head. If you like Aiden, you're my new best friend. I say thank you on their behalf because if you went to one of their shows they, too, would thank you. From the bottom of their hearts because they only want to be doing what they're doing now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroying Seattle's Fine Reputation","review":"This band is awful... The They are naive \\"musicians\\" who are stuck in the hackneyed genre of punk/emo/screamo. A few days ago I went a 30 Seconds to Mars Concert, and opening for 30 Seconds to Mars were a number of other bands, one of them being Aiden. I was very excited to see how this band was, because most of the people around me were praising the band, making them even more alluring. Soon enough I was privy to the exalted band that was Aiden, but they certainly were not all they had been built up to be. Constant, blaring power chords, off-key screaming and \\"singing,\\" and constant cursing seemed to be what this band was all about. Their songs were terrible, and the band got off time on many occasions. Aiden is just another typical screamo band that is ONLY out there to make money. Sorry for anyone who adores this band, but this is NOT music... Pick up a guitar and take lessons for three months and you could be in this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute tripe","review":"Hey all scene kids, guess what? Its a new band called Aiden, and they bring you talentless generic crap that every other emo band does! My friend is convinced that these guys are \\"punk\\", but i can assure you, this is no punk band. Last I checked, real punk bands dont cake their faces with layers of make-up and sport emo trendy haircuts with girl pants. They are nothing more than Misfit-Wannabes. The drums are generic, the singer has that really annoying cliche wannabe punk voice that youre all too familiar with. And the guitars, good? Hah, i think not. If you want to listen to any bands with better lyrics, Vocals, and guitarwork, check out: Nevermore, Iced Earth, Death, Children of Bodom, Blind Guardian, or any other real metal band. Trust me, you will be FAR more satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightmare Anatomy....4 1/2 stars","review":"I bought Nightmare Anatomy by Aiden after hearing their song 'The Last Sunrise.' I had no idea who the band was but after hearing that song that I couldn't get out of my head I decided to purchase their CD and I couldn't be more happy. Usually on an album you get maybe 3-5 good songs, every song on this CD is a hit! Every song is wonderfully composed and the lead singer, (Will? Is that his name?) sings with alot of passion. Aiden's music sounds like My Chemical Romance (which I'm a HUGE fan of) and AFI mixed together. I highly recommend his CD to fans of rock/punk rock/gothic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a band","review":"Alright, the first song i heard was Knife Blood Nightmare back when I stumbled onto the band through myspace in July, and all i can say is WOW. For an extremely young band, Aiden sure knows what they are doing right and wrong.

With music like this, who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment...","review":"I first heard the song Knife Blood Nightmare on a Victory Records sampler, and I was hooked. I had this song on repeat. Constantly. The next song I heard was Goodbye We're Falling Fast. I heard a rough mix, and still, I thought it was great.

I will not venture so far as to say that this is THE book of Enoch, but it is an interesting read alone. However, I can't say it is Holy Scripture of course, and neither can the experts.

I hate to write a bad review, I am usually a great audience for all artistic endeavors as I alway go, or read with excitement at the outset. Unfortunately, this is one book, I have to be honest, don't waste your money. Also, not for nothing, but the author obviously doesn't know what the word transliteration means, he apparently is in good company which is also extremely disappointing.

That is at least how it sounds. It starts out almost inaudibly with a solo bit that sounds fairly distant then ... BOOM the orchestra fires up and the bass particularly is loud by comparison. Once I got used to the sonic level I noticed that the orchestra is substantially more distant than the vocal soloists. That's all the criticism I can offer however. THese compositions are excellent baroque oratorios and the musical detail is nicely captured. The singers -- particularly the soprano soloists -- are beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I had no idea putting in screws could be this much fun. I'm doing a lot of renovation and this thing is absolutely amazing. There's no way I could do what I'm doing without it.Mind does jam once in a while. The way the screws get positioned prior to driving seems to work about 95% of the time which means that about every 20th screw the screw gets torqued sideways and I have to dig it out of the mechanism with my fingers. I can't seem to identify any technique that makes a difference here but maybe I need to drive another 1000 screws or so to get the hang of it. That said, and even with the downtime to fix hung screws, it is wicked fast.One not so good thing, in my opinion, is that it only comes with a phillips bit; a lot of the flooring screws I use are Robinson bits (square drive) and you need to order a separate bit for that ($7 as I remember but hard to find)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun, a good racing game","review":"Sure, the game has its problems - that display in the cockpit always shows zeroes (not real information like other games). As well as the lack of a tachometer with numbers (you end up using your ears - still effective). But the game more than makes up for those problems. It has very good controls and a great deal of customizability (a VMU or other memory card is a must). Also the graphics are very good - high quality and very smooth. It has an excellent variety of tracks and drivers as well. Easily the best reality based racing game for a console that I have played. Definitely worth buying for anyone who wants realistic, open wheel racing without a PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOT OF FUN","review":"This game was a lot of fun and especially if you're a CART fan. Not many CART games have been made at all so I was very excited to get this game. Many people don't appreciate this game as much because they are not true CART fans and do not have a favorite driver or a rival driver. The games graphics and sounds are amazing! The animation is great too! The only improving thing they could do for this is to make spin-outs and better AI. Your car seems to go faster than everyone else's. If you crash you should be out of the race. It should'nt be so easy to crash too! But overall this is a great game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad AI ruins this game","review":"This game could have been great. All the tracks are fantastic, the graphics are great, the cockpit view is superb. So why only 2 stars? The computers AI is horrible. The cars take 1 or 2 paths around the track and rarely pass. Sounds realistic, right? Well, if the car in front stops, then all the cars will stop. Literally. Stop, dead in the track. I passed 22 cars at once because they were stopped going into 1st turn, backed up all the way down the straight. Also, there are no crashes, you just sort of bump off your opponent, bump off the wall. If you hit the grass, your speed instantly drops to 40 mph, no matter how fast you're going. You never spin out. This game could have been great, but the unrealistic (lack of) racing on the computer's part coupled with the silly physics of no crashes and no spinouts ruins this title for me. It is good for a rent, but I'd recommend not buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Juxtaposition of Styles","review":"With Art Tatum on piano and Ben Webster on sax, you know this is going to be a delight, and Red Callender on bass and Bill Douglass on drums provide solid support on this recording, originally made in 1956. Tatum has a complex, playful style, while Webster blows sparely in terms of notes but richly in terms of feeling. The end result is an endlessly fascinating juxtaposition of styles that somehow sound made for each other even though they seem so different. The sound is somewhat that way, too, with Tatum's piano sounding a little dry but Webster's tenor sounding big and warm with a halo of artificial reverb. Again, a strange juxtaposition, but again, it works. Wonderful music making!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"If you're storing a matter of life and death - someone's heart, perhaps, or that prized weekend catch that you'll cook for the boss at lunch - go ahead and spend two or three times as much.If you need space for more than two folks, such as for a back office or secretarial area or multiple interns, go for something two or three times as big.But Avanti seems to be consistently rated higher than Haier (its closest competitor in this price and size range), while Koolatron (which makes comparably priced units of odder design and smaller size) gets routinely rebuked.To hold lunch, some water, and a few snacks for my office of one, this will do just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy for a Good Price","review":"I really think that this product is a good buy.

Before long though, the family begins to come apart, and adding insult to injury, the oldest son, Sonny - becomes possessed by demonic forces that originated from the basement. Soon after, Sonny rituallistically slaughters all of his family members, and in the end he is unaware of what he has just done.AMITYVILLE II : THE POSSESSION will leave you with chills, nightmares, and a desire to never, never go down to the basement alone again....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly Underrated Creepfest","review":"Despite its many detractors, \\"Amityville II\\" is not your typical bargain basement horror flick. For starters, the movie makes no claims it is \\"based on a true story\\", it only suggests the events of the 1975 DeFeo murders, so this should not be viewed as a documentary. The movie is filled with evocative imagery: tilting camerawork, POV shots, and the house itself is shot to guarantee maximum creepiness. The scene where the family is murdered will forever be etched in my memory; it is gruesome, disturbing and unforgettable in its raw intensity. Isn't that the hope of any good horror movie? The theme music by Lalo Shifrin (returning from the first film) remains spine tingling, even today, and the film as a whole puts today's horror flicks (including the dreary remake of the original), in which the emphasis is on quik cuts and flashiness than atmosphere and suspense, to shame.

This movie was about as scary as buttered toast! The father of the family was as obnoxious as they come. I couldn't wait to see him get toasted! As for the kids seeing paintbrushes float in mid air and paint on the walls, they should have been scarred for life. Then there's the incest! Ah yes!

I think I'll skip the 3rd installment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could go lower than 1, I would.","review":"\\"Amityville 2: The Possession\\" is the worst horror film ever made, and the worst horror sequel. Only \\"Cujo\\" and \\"Leprechaun\\" come close. This film is supposedly based on the real-life murder of one big family who moved into the cursed Long Island house. However, in this movie, the family is portrayed in such a negative and ugly light that we the viewers are glad that they get killed by the possessed teenage son. Burt Young overacts to the nth degree as the evil patriarch of the family, beating and yelling at his youngest children, and the possessed son seduces his teenage sister in one particularly exploitative sequence. The finale is a painful rip-off of \\"The Exorcist\\" [in fact, the whole movie is!]. The first \\"Amityville\\" film was okay, but this \\"prequel\\" is simply painful. I will NEVER watch the rest of the series, since the sequels may be even worse than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A horror- masterpiece!","review":"This film has a very special and original horror-plot even if its a cind of classical story. A big old house with deep and horrible secrets shows its anger by filling a families minds with pure madness and evil. The attic,where some children were killed and the basement widh a secret room where satanistic rituales were hold many years ago really gived the movie some intensive,deep, hair-rising and psychological scenes that you only can compare with your most scary nightmares.

Named Sonny here, the young man is obviously possessed, much to the consternation of the local priest. The family is troubled to begin with (physical and emotional abuse, incest, and so on) and before long Sonny snaps and murders his family with a shotgun. Still with me? Okay. The rest of the film details how the priest tries to release Sonny from his demonic possession. The second half shamelessly rips off \\"The Exorcist\\", most likely to pad the running time after the murders. Passable entertainment, and after this all the other sequels go downhill."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Creepy and Disgusting as the First.","review":"Amityville II which I am sure takes away more from actual events, is just as Creepy and Disgusting as the First, and this Time no James Brolin!(of course and thank God!)

I have heard time and again people liking this movie more than the original and it took a LOT for me to even sit through this mess ONCE. The acting was atrocious! The pacing tried so hard it became comical to constantly have some sort of supernatural event happening ALL THE TIME. This movie is almost like a parody of the first, I think of it as an Amityville For Dummies. My one star is for the soundtrack; an interesting re-imagining of the original.In particular the \\"wife\\" and \\"daughter\\" chosen as \\"actors\\" just have to be either untrained or purposely put there for comic relief, it's that BAD. The part with the incest is play out so poorly and is so hammy it's embarrasing, not because of the incest, that I can stand, but for the acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel on par with the original","review":"This movie tells the story of the family who originally lived in 112 Ocean Ave. It focuses on the demonic possession of one of the children, and the murders that this would trigger. The boys life soon falls in the hands of one priest, and faith will be put to the test.This is a underrated film, frankly just as creepy and well-done as the original. The first half has an atmosphere that just chills me, and the story is disturbing on different levels. If you liked AMITYVILLE you will appreciate THE POSSESSION.

Unlike the Lutz's as played by James Brolin and Margot Kidder this family has nothing going for it. The father is a lout who smacks the kids around. The mother is a passive aggressive weeper and their oldest kid, Sonny is simmering with rage. In other words, these unpleasant people really don't need a demon they're doing a pretty good job of spreading the misery around by themselves. By the time Sonny turns green and starts shooting the family you're really, really ready for him to get on with it so this wretched flick can finally end.Bottom line: it's nowhere near as good or as fun as the original and as other reviewers have pointed out, it's mostly a rip off of the Exorcist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amityville Bore II.","review":"Viewed: 7/05Rate: 27/05: Great, more bore comes from the sequel of The Amityville Bore. There is no surprise in Amityville II: The Possession. Once again, it has a tedious, lethargic pace. A few get-\`em scares are sprinkled through Amityville II: The Possession. Furthermore it is a predictable movie, given the fact that the beginning of Amityville II: The Possession gave away the hint. Ahh, it has the theme of incest, and there is the husband, beating up his wife and children and demanding sex from his wife. That sounds like a great backdrop of character development of Alberto DeSalvo the Boston Strangler. Burt Young shouldn't have been in this picture. This time, Amityville II: The Possession is thirteen minutes shorter and is slightly better than the original, but once again, it goes nowhere. The makers have done admirably by ripping off The Exorcist."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST AMITYVILLE","review":"I could not believe AMITYVILLE 2 POSSESSION was even made I felt that the relatives of the victims of those murders should've sued the film company who made this film for potraying the family like they did.

After received I was simply not impressed. Many of the photo's focal point was illy placed in the binding. A lot of photos were blown up to the point of distortion. None were that breath-taking. You'd be better off buying a book with photos by Oliver Tollmi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"In my opinion, Wide Angle does not hold up the National Geographic standards. The photographs are less than impressive and not the usual vivid images normally seen in NG books. Many of the photos are pooly laid out with the focal point in the binding of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, Not what I expected","review":"My mistake, I did not check the actual dimensions of this volume, being a big fan of National Geo's photo volumes, I ordered the book expecting a large coffee table volume, but as it turned out, what I received was less than half the size of my other volumes. The book is approx 6in x 6in vs an expected 12in x 12in. It is what I ordered, but in such a small size that you can not really appreciate the photos. If you're considering ordering this, carefully review the product details to be sure its what you actually want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Driving Screws Effortlessly","review":"I have been a carpenter for more than fifteen years now and have never come across a tool like this one. I was installing a fire place mantle that involved using four inch screws. After stripping the heads off a half dozen or so I knew there had to be an easier way. A fellow co-worker walked over smirking and said to me \\"just try this\\", handing me a cordless Makita impact driver kit. By this time I was willing to try anything. I placed a four inch screw on the tip of the lightweight driver and was amazed at the power of this cordless drill. I was still skeptical because the wood I screwed into was a soft pine. Then there it was a three inch piece of solid oak. I placed a screw on the tip once again and was astonished. It went into the oak just as easy as the pine. I was sold. This definately is the greatest tool I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Smith sold millions of cookbooks for a reason.","review":"I learned how to cook from this great man.

Gives you something to do while waiting for Sunday and Monday night football. BUY THIS NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, but can anyone answer this question:","review":"In every football video game I've played, you can see exactly how good each player is. Normally the video game will rate all the players on a scale of 1-100 so you can see just how good a players skills are in arm strength, accuracy, hands, speed, etc. I've always found these essential to when a bunch of us get together and draft our own teams to play with. But I can't find these \\"attributes\\" anywhere. For some reason, NFL 2K only seems to give players an \\"overall\\" rating. Do the ratings I'm looking for not exist? If not, I hope Sega incorporates them into NFL '01"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looks, awful gameplay","review":"Don't pay a penny for this, folks. Move on to an EA game. There is very little in the way of actual physics calculations between players in this game, every interaction is merely a scripted animation. RBs are stopped in full stride by shoestring tackles. WRs run their routes at half speed while the DBs shadow them *IN FRONT* of their routes. Offensive line programming is horrible. Guards and tackles blow assignments on EVERY play, doubling up on a DT and allowing LBs to come free and tackle the RB at the handoff. There is no player momentum, a flaw I've noticed in a number of Sega Sports games, meaning any player can stop in mid-stride and immediately run full stride in the opposite direction. Sit back and watch the computer play: 3and out, 3 and out, 3 and out... This was an incomplete game that should not have been released. So what if it looks pretty? It plays like crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUGS IN NFL 2K","review":"Best football game ever no doubt! Graphics are amazing. But, there are multiple glitches in the game. Like the ref saying it's 3 & 8 when the text on the screen says 2 & 4. Can't seem to call a time out with player two. Had some audio difficulties first time I played like a guy getting hit over and over. GOT ON MY NERVES! But, over all it's a super game. Can't wait until EA Sports releases Madden on this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Game","review":"I have NFL2k and it rocks.

(but no franchise mode)","review":"This is far and away the best looking football game out there. I, like many, grew up on Madden and I have to say that EA better get on this system because they will lose a lot of customers just because of the graphics. HOWEVER, the Madden games have one major edge over NFL2K: the newly instated franchise mode. This has to be the greatest made in any football game and it is the only major chink in NFL2K's armor. If NFL2K+1 has a franchise mode, watch out Madden. You may need to retire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game, but needs some work.","review":"This game is a lot of fun, and it looks better than any footbal game I've seen, but there are a few problems with it. If you don't exit every screen after playing a game you will lose your saved info, even if it said it was saving it to your vmu. Sometimes you can't call a time out when in the middle of a game, which can really cost you. Overall it's worth buying, but Sega should fix these problems before they make the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Football Game ever made","review":"This is the best game in the whole world.

Yes they are beautiful, very beautiful in fact, but unlike most games that look this good, it plays even better (like most DC games).Like some reviewers have stated, you will be come a student of football while playing this game. For the first time ever you will actually have to think out your strategy. Running the same play over and over causes the CPU to learn and adjust to you cheapies out there. No more money plays!There is a slight learning curve, but once you're beyond the excellent training mode you'll be fine.Overall this is the game that will make people buy the DC. Graphics, gameplay, replay value it's all here. 9.9.99 is almost upon us, prepare for the onslaught of the Dreamcast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and funnest game made (so far)","review":"Amazing... just plain amazing, the first time I seen the game my jaw dropped. I sold my playstation just for it. The graphics are amazing. Gameplay is awe-inspiring (heard that somewhere, sounds cool). Has 3 different challenge modes, rookie, pro, all-pro. Rookie everything is easy. You can bomb it everytime and get it. Pro is challenging, more pick offs. All pro is all most impossible. Every pass you throw is intercepted. Playable for any age. Only one thing sucks about it, the only way to call a timeout in 2player mode is with the analog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every thing but the commentary","review":"Ok i dont want to beat around the bush so lets get down tobusiness. If you are a sports fan this is the game for you.I love thegame play. The best rated overall team is the Jets. If you are looking for a go to guy go to Wayne Chrebet! The only thing that sucks about the game is the commentaters. They have absolutely nothing good to say. Example: One time I took a pass interference penalty in the end zone, and one of the dudes said \\"Oh what a dumb penalty to take.\\" I held 'em 3 times and then the dude said \\"see I told you They were smart to take the interference.\\" I mean Golly Gee. Oh welly just drown them out and have a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics...","review":"NFL 2K has probably the best graphics ever on a video football game... but the realism leaves much to be desired. Scoring is way too easy... running is very unrealistic. Playcalling is highly simplistic. If you love eye candy, then this game is for you. If you need a hardcore football game, however, that stresses realistic teams, players, plays, etc, then you need Madden 2000 (especially for the CPU)."},{"rating":"2","title":"real fun game ever","review":"great graphic and animation make is game special. Rookie level is so easy that you can throw hailmary with your eyes shut. Pro level is more like real. although occasional flase announcement and limited play make players bore quickly, this game is really fun game to play and you won't want to play any NFL games on sony playstation."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 year old player","review":"This game is one of the best sports games I have ever played. But it takes up to much space on the VMU"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Easy!","review":"This game is awesome!

If you have a dreamcast, get this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"This game is the best ever. The grayphs are the best and it is very realistic. It has great fetuares such as calling plays on you VMU sono one eles can see if you are play with 2-4 players and you can even see their breath in cold weather. The only down falls this game has is it's almost impossible to get a bigger run play longer than 15yds and it has NO FRANCHISE MODE. But in the end this game outruns Madden 2000 & 2001. So Overerall if you wan't a good solid sports game buy this if you wan't those little downfalls fixed buy NFL2K1 it has no downfalls (Maby only 1) or if you just wan't somthing chepper than NFL2K1 this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"BESTFOOTBALL GAME EVER","review":"Once I played NFL2K, I sold my playstation and Madden 2000. This game is on a whole differnt level than Madden. I will definately buy the Playstation2 when it comes out, and see what Madden2001 is like, but for now it is NFL2K all the way. I didnt give it a five because of a few things. #1 the running game, it is so hard to run the ball. If they just had a button that would allow you to cut left or righ(like madden) it would make running the ball alot easier. I play with JAX, and Fred Taylor, and INDY and Edgerrin James and I still never average more than 2 yds a carry, no matter what defenses are ran. Also there are too man outrageous hits, the ones where you pick the man up and throw him down, this is not realistic, how often does this happen in a real game. This game is still the best football game ever, Madden2000 on the playstation cant even touch it. Hopefully you can run the ball better in NFL2K1. I cant wait to get it. This is still the best football game ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sports Game to Date","review":"This is simply hands down the best Sports Video game to date. Yes there are some games out there that have more options, but none come close visually. If you like smooth game play and sweet graphic's, than this game was made for you. The only thing bad to say about this game is that season mode takes up one full VMU, some people think that there is a lack of plays, but that is nonsense. If you don't think there is anough plays here, Sega has gone out of their way to allow you to create your own plays. I have played many PC Football games, I have played many of football games on all different platforms and NFL2K wins Hands Down. This Game will set the new standard for Sports games, ( Way to go Sega )."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what at home football should be!!","review":"From the graphics to the play by play this game is great from beginning to end.

Much of his research was carried out in a village near Ubud where my Villas are. There are still old people in the village who remember him.His book is beautifully written and tells stories of his adventures and life in the village and his encounters with the local Balinese.

I am sure this movie would have been interesting had it not been for the language. I watched a few minutes, but could not get past Cher's cursing, cursing and more cursing (not just bywards but God's name). Maybe most aren't offended, but I am sorry I paid money to hear God cursed.

Disadvantages: thereare no worked examples. I hope that one day that Schaums comesout with a general relativity text in its \\"Outline Series\\" be-cause worked examples are scarce in just about every generalrelativity text. Since there is a Schaums outline on Tensorcalculus, I would recommend working on at least the first 8chapters of that book before buying D'Invernos text.

It combines scientific insight and thoughtful reflection into a funny, moving and incredibly smart read. The reporting on hilarious and bizarre species, plankton in ballast water, exploding snake populations, bacteria on its way to Mars, reframes the world into a roiling crowd of serendipitous explorers and opportunists, making you understand that aliens are alive, well, and reshaping the world we live in, ready or not. But better, the author is able to see himself through the same lens, reflecting on all of us as opportunists and explorers.

But if you are looking for a fun and a quality game for a reasonable price get NBA 2K"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this game","review":"When Dreamcast 1st came out I thought it would be another system like Playstation but I was wrong. I went to the store and saw a Dreamcast I decided to play it. It was amazing! I went and got my Dad and brother we thought it was the best game ever created. It was awsome! From then on I told everyone to get Dreamcast and NBA 2k. It is the best basketball game ever created!!! I can't wait till NBA 2k1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Basketball gameever made for a console, period.","review":"NBA 2K is the best basketball game made for a console, ever. It has up to date rosters including the rookies for the 1999-2000 season. The graphics are amazing, at the same time they do not take away from the gameplay, which is also excellent. Many of the gameplay features are improved over past NBA video games including a better free throw shooting system, dunks and layups that are actually blocked {that is what happens in the NBA sometimes}, and a better \\"post up\\" system in which it is actually possible to score. The game also has tremendious replay value. You can do a fantasy draft and put all of your favorite players on one team, you can also create life like players, or create your own team. The possibilities are endless.If you like basketball, or you like sports video games NBA 2k is definitly for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"NBA 2K is not the best basketball game for the DC. NBA 2K1 is better. 2K1, ..., you can play network games; has more players including classic players; better moves and controls; no more not catching a pass or passing the ball to someone out of bounds; no more crazy camera angle changes that sometimes cause you a turnover b/c you walked backcourt, etc. But NBA 2K is a great game. It's better than EA sports or anyother Bball games out there. The graphic is excellent, controls are easy to use and simple, and playing against the computer is a good challenge. It's quite addictive because it takes a little time to become good. So, most likely, you will lose to the computer at first, even with the best team. Don't get discouraged, you will become better and so will your players (really). ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL GAME","review":"At first I found this game hard to play but I realized that I was using the wrong button. For moving you should use the joystick and not the control pad. I also found it easy to win after I figured this out with my friend. Now I play it all the time. It was the first Sega Dreamcast game I got back in February and I still love to play it. It is really fun, enjoyable, and easy to use. It is funner when playing against the computer then against a friend. Also, if you have a VMU Memory Pack, it says stats, how many fouls each player on your team has, and words when a slam dunk or three pointer is made. The only problem is that it takes up 198 blocks of memory. My memory pack only has 200 blocks, making this a problem. Overall this is a very good game and I reccomend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks great, but...","review":"It won't completely load up! At least my copy wouldn't, and from what I have heard, I'm not alone. Sega really seems to have soiled themselves on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"i cant recommend this one.","review":"I have said this before and I will say it again, graphics do NOT make the game, its the gameplay that really counts. The only basketball game that i can really recommend at this stage in the game NBA Live '2000, because it's full of features. This one just doesn't cut the mustard in my book, besides this one doesn't include Jordan, what a waist, just dont even waist 50$ one this, maybe a rent, but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SEASON GAME HANDS DOWN","review":"This game has it all. The gameplay is great. The graphics are awsome. And the seaso is outstanding. The player detail is award winning. All the tatoos and facial hair. All the goggles elbow pads and headpands. After a season, awards are givin for rookie of the year, leading point scorer, and many more awards. On the down side, close passes are usualy shot into the upper decks for no reason. Another thing I found that was disapointing was that dunks are never missed ecept for a block. I have seen plenty of wide open players miss easy dunks befor. (encluding Michael Jordan) I wish that every once and a while a dunk would bounce out. Over all, this game is the best game ever. If you love up to date rosters, and a great season mode, I fully recomend nba2k."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great w/ just one, no two flaws...!","review":"The Graphics are outstanding, you can actually see the the facial expressions on the characters changing while they are dunking the ball. Which you really do not get to see alot because it is tough too get inside under the hoop to dunk, the computer will not let you get by easily, but with a little practice you will get the hang of it, and soon enough you'll be able to break through the defense a little easier. The other flaw that i think is a huge flaw is that that game needs one whole VMU (200 blocks) which you will have to get unless you are only going to be using the 2 player mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most addicting b-ball game ever!","review":"This game is phenomenal! When I bought my DC I of course purchased NFL 2K and thought that game was fantastic. But when I bought NBA 2K, I was simply blown away! The graphics are great but to me, the game play is what makes it. It is fairly tough when you start out and I would sometimes get blown out by a good team like the Lakers. But once you get the hang of the inside game and can play defense (and for once you can really play defense on a basketball game!) it becomes a different matter. Now I routinely blow out the best teams on All-Pro (the only real flaw to the game IMHO). If you like basketball games, get NBA 2K right now. You will regret it (because you'll be playing it so stinking much!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my dear Lord! The graphics, man! The graphics!","review":"This is game is absolutely unbelievable!

You fell like you are coaching and/or playing the game, its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This game rocks! The graphics and playability of this game is definitely worth the cost. The realism is what I enjoy most about the game. The only items that are not truly realistic are the blocking and stealing capabilities... it is relatively easy to do both. However, it is just as easy for the computer (or your human opponent) to block and steal the ball from you. This 'fairness' makes this minor shortcoming forgivable.Get this game! If you like NFL 2K, you'll like this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"NBA2K IS ONE OF THE BEST","review":"I'd have to say this game is fantastic and has great graphics. The only faults I could give to this game is the blocked shots. I mean Shaq is not going to be blocked 12 times in a game. Other then that though it has great sound and the trades are extremly realistic. If you like basketball or even sports games in general then go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NBA 2K is SWEET!","review":"NBA2K has the best graphics I have ever seen all you have to do is look at the players face to tell who it is. You can do some pretty awesome dunks whether you're doing a 360 degrees dunk, or a alley-oop back jam it feels like a your really there. This game is so detailed the courts look perfect the fans actually stand up and try to distract your opponent while he's shooting free throws. Speaking of freethrows that's the bad thing about the game ,you have to line up the arrows perfectly to make it. It's really hard. overall this game is SWEET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flash Drive","review":"I really like my U3 Travel Drive. I use it everyday at work.

I am using it right now with Firefox, RoboForm, Thunderbird, Migo and Trillian all running off the U3 Drive. I have seen the reboot message and have ignored it and everything works fine.

Absolutely nothing. In order to store anything on the drive, you must use the software ON THE FLASH DRIVE, but all the software is PC based. What the hell? So I go over to the Memorex website to do a little troubleshooting, and what do I find there? NO MENTION OF THE MAC WHATSOEVER IN THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS!!

Cooper instead weaved a historical account of Neutral Milk from Mangum's days as a youngster till his last public performance. Both books have their moments, and both books took on an artists pretentiousness in different ways. Catanzarite embraced the themes and disregarded the artist, whereas Cooper discussed how the themes were threaded into the artist's DNA."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in the 33 1/3 series","review":"This book is awesome because...a) It presents a meticulous history of the band's historyb) The recording process of the album is discussed in full, and broken down song by songc) Nearly all of the people involved with the album and the band contribute commentary, so, you get a VERY multifaceted portrait of very REAL peopled) After reading it, you will want to listen to the album several times over to pick out the subtle innuendo laced throughout...which the book talks about in depth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"Billed as the ultimate indie-geek dissertation on one of the seminal albums of the '90s, Kim Cooper's book is actually much more. The first portion offers an insightful overview of the Elephant 6 collective, from its childhood origins to its communal lifestyle and creative process. Casual fans will be inspired to delve deeper, and even hardcore NMH devotees will find plenty here they never knew or even considered.One minor criticism: The chapter on the actual recording process seems thrown together and lacks the narrative flow of the rest of the book. There is too much tech-speak here and not enough anecdotes.Overall, though, this is a well-researched and loving testament to a timeless album.

This is a great, watchable overview of the vikings in their journeys to North America. Lots of reinactments - the ususal omnimax scenic photography. The film does NOT go into detail of the vikings influence in the east - if you are interested in that, I'd recommend the NOVA viking video.Also - the NOVA film (2 hours) goes into greater detail on all their topics -but it is a dryer more 'academic' film.Overall - great intro film if you find yourself intrigued by the Vikings :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to our study of the Vikings.","review":"I rented this dvd to show to my 9 and 7 year olds to supplement our study of the Vikings.

Did someone at the record company mislabel this? This sounds more like Cannibal Corpse to me. This band appears to have some serious musical abilities but the \\"music\\" seems out of place right next to unintelligable thrashing and grunting fits. If you are into mathcore/noisecore with interesting musical dynamics might I suggest the latest Dillinger Escape Plan album - Miss Machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting a lot more...","review":"First of all, quoting Morbid Angel when talking about this band is very stupid. This isn't even remarkably close to being technical extreme death metal.Secondly, what happened to this band, for Christ sake? The singer is singing in a so ridiculous affected voice that it makes me laugh so hard. \\"It's raining... IT'S RAINING!!!!\\" Hahaha... Jesus, that falsetto is so funny. It sounds like The Darkness singer.The vocals are a joke. The metalcore scene is becoming a joke because of bands who once were agressive and original, and that now are becoming Dillinger Escape Plan's new sound rip-offs.There's no originality in clean vocals when the singer can't sing. It sounds dumb and mellow. Every 2 minutes, there's a breakdown. I'm sure their fan base will grow larger now. As for me, I really liked this band from their previous releases.Listen to Glass Casket's new album for heaviness. Please, metalcore scene, stop this trend."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathe in, breathe out, then listen","review":"having had this album for quite a while before its release date(don't worry i did buy it today anyway), i can honestly say it is one of the best albums i own. if you haven't heard between the buried and me before, disregard victory's absurd promotion comparing it to the likes of soad and mars volta. first timers might find it hard to comprehend and appreciate their music. expect a lot of time changes and lots of heavy to soft and back to heavy within a matter of seconds. people familiar with the band, dont fret, it's still good old btbam. the new lineup gives them a more polished sound than on previous records. paul's guitar playing has gotten much better since the last album and the addition of dusty waring(from glass casket) totally upped the shred. blake(also from glass casket) tears it up on the drums flawlessly. the whole album is a treat. it's the same btbam, just heavier, softer, and more focused. the rate they're going, they can only get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd","review":"I love this band and this album. Love the expiramenting, especially the appearance of some fusion jazz. This is what metal should be doing. Something different. BTBAM deliver this in a big way. Playing heavy and technical metal, with breakdowns, solos, death and grindish vocals, odd time signatures, complex structure, and lots of expiramentation. I love this CD. It's a good buy for fans of Evelynn, Glass Casket, and Animosity. Definately worth the ten bucks i paid for it. Buy now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLABELED","review":"It's an excellent album, and I do love this band.However... as this review is about an Amazon purchase, I do feel a need to comment.The title implies that it is a cd album which also includes a 'bonus DVD.' There was NO DVD included in this case. In fact, there is no place within for one, and there was no mention of a DVD on any of the outside shrinkwrap. So, this leads me to believe that for some reason Amazon has it mislabelled.At first I thought they sent me the wrong item, as in perhaps they sent just the cd and not the cd/DVD combo. But no, even the packing slip mentions 'bonus DVD' after the title, and a search on Amazon for a different version of Alaska brings up only the mp3 download version of this album.So, if you're buying this because you're excited you may get to see BTBM recorded live, or videos or something, don't bother. If you're okay with the fact that this is just a single cd, then buy it (it does say 2 cds included in the description)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if Rush made hardcore metal?","review":"Have you ever asked yourself the question, \\"what if Rush made hardcore metal?\\" Well, it might sound a little something like this album. That the best way to describe \\"Alaska\\". It's progressive metal mixed with the kind of chaotic metal you might hear from a Botch or Norma Jean album. The musicians are very talented and their music is technical with a lot of variety to it. And they are not bound to one predetermined genre of metal, mixing up tempo, speed, and intensity. They are also one of the few hardcore metal bands that can incorporate keyboards into their songs without sounding out of place. I loved this album the very first time I heard it and I can hear more and more complexity with each subsequent listen. I reserve 5-star ratings for albums that are truly a cut above the rest, and this is one of the few albums in 2005 that deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD RULES","review":".....Although i dont have, it i have listened to every song. everyone says these guys are metal, but they are just really heavy hardcore. all you metal people out there shouldnt get mad at me for pointing out the truth. if you dont have this cd, buy it now, go, or i will beat you with a fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Progressive Metal Band","review":"These guys are the real deal, these guys are seriously intense.

This is not for the faint of heart, even though there are some more mellow, melodic moments, they peppered with some of the most abrasive, trudging metal you will ever hear.

However, before buying, I suggesting checking which model you'll be getting. Different model fits different tire width. The latest model fits up to 3.0\\" tire width, which is not what I received when I ordered from Amazon. This is maybe why they're selling at a discount. Of course, Amazon's service is top notch and they did it right.The product is great but it's getting four stars because the maker didn't update their product labeling when they updated their product.

The thing I thought I'd find most helpful was the dictionary on culinary terms in the end of the book. But at the restaurants I visited, I still managed to communicate sufficiently in english to understand what the food contained and what I'd like to order, still I was aided a couple of times by being able to look up a word.

I got a demo to play of Dynamite Cop. It was an extreamely fun and addictive game. It is much like Die Hard Trilogy. However, the graphics are a little fuzzy and I don't believe that they are at Dreamcast's full capasity of 128 bit graphics. Each character you can fight with has their own unique fighting style, and each has a different background. There are a variety of weapons that you can find in the game, however some of them are a little bit unrealistic. For instance, on the second mission, you find this anti-missle rocket launcher, and when you shoot it, it creates this explosion that looks almost nuclear and it doesn't kill the enemies on impact everytime eather. In addition, you're not even hurt by it. Over all, I think it looks cool, and I can't wait to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!","review":"This game is awsome!!!!!!

They're meant to be easy to pick up and able to hold onto your attention for a little while. But when they're brought to home consoles, they get old fast. And Dynamite Cop gets old very fast. You punch the bad guys with a variety of weapons for about fifteen minutes, then the game ends. That's it.

I would rather have had the author just tell us about his Mormon experiences and leave off the part about how he had now discovered that the \\"truth\\" lay in Jesus Christ. I couldn't help but wonder when Jesus might get a little old for him, or rather when some of the practices of fundamentalist Christians might start looking a bit bizarre.

I'll summarize my conclusion very bluntly: James Spencer's writing is nearly as reliable as the \\"National Inquirer,\\" but far more malicious. He is not to be trusted. There are plenty of serious books on Mormonism, but none of them bears the name of Jim Spencer. Nor, for that matter, does any of them bear the name of his associates Ed Decker and Bill Schnoebelen.

I even called Merrell to ask about the shoe. The customer service person said going to a larger size would not likely help. By the time I found a pair large enough for my feet to slip into them the shoes would likely be much too big.

They're bulky, so I'm disinclined to take them with me to events, or just to the corner diner. Therefore, whether film or digital, the great Kodak moments pass by without a record of them. In my view, the things that kept cameras bulky were the film roll and the zoom lens. Digital photography was supposed to take care of the bulk of film, but cameras were still an inch or two thick, essentially, small bricks. This camera is the first device that meets all my needs. It's small, decent quality, and has a zoom lens -- and it fits in my shirt pocket and my front jeans pocket -- that means that in the last two weeks, I have taken more pictures than I have in the past year owning an Olympus C-2020 Zoom digital camera.

It swings perfectly and although I read the reviews saying that you need to put it on high before it swings much I did not have the problem.

I think it is because I was using energiser batteries which are well-known for their 'potential energy' stored and my girl is still small. I hope it stays this way as it is great for now! :) For the swing function there is an accompanying sound generated which I found to sound like the galloping of horses which sounded great for me, not irritating at all! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, needs revamping","review":"I love the portability of this swing. It comes apart very easily and I was able to fit the main part the car seat sits on in my suitcase without trouble.One reason I did not give this swing 5 stars was because of the control switches. They are in an inconvenient spot--under where the car seat edge overhangs. Also, I feel that the controls should have been buttons rather than dials/switches. Even though they go off automatically after half an hour, they remain in the ON position. If you want to restart one function the other automatically restarts too, which can be a pain in the butt.The second reason being that this frame fits the SnugRide and the bigger SafeSeat. The Snugride can be a little wobbly on it since there is extra room. While that is annoying and a bit disconcerting, it's not really a major problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We puchased this for our third baby and it has been awsome. Being the third, she spends quite a bit of time getting siblings around and it's great to not worry about waking her to put her in the car seat. If I know we're going to be leaving soon, I just buckle her in and grab her on our way out. It's also great if she falls asleep right as we're getting home, we put her in the swing and she'll finish taking a full nap. It took a few times to get the swing control right, but as long as blankets and things are out of the way, it's not a problem. The clicking from the swinging motion seems to be just the right amount of white noise amongst the chaos of her 2 brothers.

Maybe when my daughter gains weight I will try it again and maybe her weight will make the fast speed slow down. But, I'm not happy with it. ALSO, IMPORTANT TO NOTE...you can't adjust the straps while the seat is clicked into the swing...it is a safety thing...any time it is \\"clicked in\\" like in the carseat base, the straps are locked. So, if you use this to hold the carseat like we were planning too...as you come in the door and want to swing your baby...just know that you can't loosen or tighten the straps while it is clicked in.

Secondly, the vibration and sound controls are located under the seat, when the seat is on its perch. This means that you tilt the swing upward to select controls, either interrupting the swinging or possibly waking the baby if all you want is vibration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godd substitute for a swing","review":"I completely hated the idea of getting yet another piece of baby stuff that we would use for a few months, take up too much space, and create trash for the environment. that said, a crying baby needs something sometimes - since we already have the carseat, this swing was great; it's minimal additional stuff and can fold up and be put under the crib. it doesn't have the gizmos like mobiles and stuff, but does the job. i have to say that it is a bit short, so if you wanted a full size, it's not going to do the trick. you have to put it on the table or someting firm.the vibration and music box takes 4 AA batteries and is pretty lame, but no less so than most of the other swings i've seen. i wish someone would make al these swings power plug in/battery optional. this takes 4 C batteries; lasts a while but still."},{"rating":"1","title":"graco car seat swing adapter","review":"It is easy to set up, but it would be a more useful product if it could take additional car seats.

Although the swing has met expectations in terms of being space saving, it does not work as well as I had hoped. I may have received a dud, but I find that I often have to push the swing to get it going. It either does not start swinging properly or slows randomly during use.

The rocker was the perfect speed and height, but had an EXTREMELY loud clicking noise and woke the baby every time I tried to use it. It also looked like it was barely rocking after I put my 1 month old 11lb LO in and it'd stop shortly after my DS gained more weight.The vibration setting was great though it wears the batteries down after only a short amount of time each time I try to use it.Basically, I use this to store the car seat in when I get home and just reach over and hand rock it every now and then when my DS stirs in his sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"great compact swing","review":"This is a great compact swing and was easy to assemble. I didn't realize it also had a vibrating feature, which was a nice surprise and I often use it without the swinging feature.

We are tight on space, and I loved the fact that the swing would accommodate our infant's Graco car seat, and included songs, vibration and portability. However, once our 14 pound baby and car seat were snapped into the frame, the swing came to a stand still. It would swing on it's own, sans baby and seat, but once the baby was added, it seemed that it was just too much for the motor to handle. I think it would swing a newborn, but we didn't get it until she was a bit older, as our last swing's motor died. I was so excited to try this.. but a swing that won't swing is not much use to me. It's getting repackaged up and will be returned to sender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"When I first saw this product I thought it was a great idea. However, after trying to use it a few times I realized that it needs a better motor and design. The swing makes a very loud clicking sound when it's on and it's very distracting. Also, I found that it wouldn't swing at all on the lower settings and the faster settings swing WAY too fast. I was very disappointed in this swing and you should think twice before ordering it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but kid hates it!","review":"I was excited to find this thinking I would save space and I could travel with it.

I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing for the money","review":"This swing is a great idea for those who don't want to invest in buying a big expensive swing. It folds up very compactly when not in use. It's very easy to snap in your graco carseat so if your baby falls asleep in the carseat you can just put her/him in the swing. The swing motion itself is not that strong or vigorous and the sound machine quality is a little soft. However it does have a vibrating feature which is nice. Overall this is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dayco No Slack Pulley - False Advertising!!! MADE in CHINA!!!","review":"Box says Made in USA, but the bearing says CHINA.

However, he brings the London Symphony to places that they have never reached before on this cd. He brings the fire and intensity that are required for Mahler right from the beginning of the Trauermarsch to the very end of the Finale. The London Symphony performs magnificently and the superb quality of the recording on this cd captures every gut wrenching moment. If you prefer the sound of Solti or Bernstein you should still pick up this recording and see that there are other brilliant conductors that can still legitimately conduct Mahler. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, comfy, but cupholders dont hold any cups!","review":"Looks good, fits well, comfortable... Would be perfect excecpt the cup holders suck!

I was attempting different types of disciplinary actions yet it never worked for him, or rather me. Then, having read the book, I see him in a most different light. Learning to accept him as just another boy, and I am sure his teachers had told me that he is just another boy, yet I did not comprehend the idea, until reading this book. Accepting this fact, I now approach my son differently, and he sees me differently, and we enjoy each other's company to a higher level than before. I am thoroughly grateful that I was able to find such a great book that helps me understand and bond closer to my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Fascinating read!","review":"My boys are just starting school this fall, so I wanted to read about how to best help them in their educational experience. The author does a great job in giving specific, practical advice in how to help your son succeed in school, starting from toddler years in the home, all the way through high school, and even college. This is definitely a worthwhile read for any parents who wish to help make school a positive experience for their sons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther Is The Man","review":"Another strong Chicago blues album from Allison and band. This is a great album that features some killer guitar and Allison's trademark vocals. I believe Allison won a W.C. Handy award for song of the year with \\"Cherry Red Wine\\" from this album, and it is a great track. I have since heard it recorded by several other artists including Johnny Lang, but none of them hold up to the original. Allsion also branches into some slide and steel guitar on this album which adds some nice variety. Other standout tracks include \\"All The Kings Horses\\", \\"Walking Papers\\", \\"What's Going On In My Home\\", \\"Big City\\", and \\"Move From The Hood\\". As on previous albums Allison maintains a kind of 70's funk vibe to some of his stuff, which works quite well. This was the album that put Allison back on the blues map in the U.S. as he went from playing clubs to theaters after this one came out. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love luther","review":"This is a great album. He didn't ever make back blues music. He plays with such passion.

The daycare where my baby goes uses them and has as many as six babies sleeping peacefully in minutes several times a day. For this to work, however, the bouncer needs to recline and to actually bounce. This one doesn't do either. I also found it fairly useless for holding my young baby because she slumped over--which bothered me if not her. It was useful for a month or so for feeding her before she could sit up and for entertaining her while I took a shower when she could almost sit up. (You are supposed to stop using it once they can sit up on their own.) It doesn't need to fold to do those things. I recommend buying one that reclines or better yet, adjusts.

Even with these limitations, this was a very useful tool. I only work with drywall as a DIYer, but the time and efficiency savings from having a specialized tool were worth it for me. This category of tool was one of the things which really differentiated Makita when they started importing to the US, and they continue to do a good job with it in my opinion.

Art's lyrics are once again phenominal. Every song on the record has a deep meaning that you have to look into the song to understand. \\"Blackjack\\", \\"How To Win Friends And Influence People\\", and \\"New York Times\\" all pertain to 9/11 and the acoustic \\"Chrysanthemum\\" tells of two Oregon girls that were slaughterd. The song has no need to be any longer than 1:37 as the point is made quickly. \\"A Beautiful Life\\" and \\"Science Fiction\\" have orchestral parts while the rock is still in Everclear's system on the entire album.

From songs like the rockin' \\"Blackjack\\" to poppin' \\"Volvo Driving Soccer Mom\\" to slower and calmer \\"Science Fiction,\\" this is a great album, and, though, not everyone will like, I think that most people out there will have the urge to check out this album.

Now that Alexakis has purged more of his personal demons through \\"Songs from an American Movie, Part 1, the band came storming back with the underappreciated, \\"Songs... Part 2.

Start with Sparkle & Fade then go to So much for the afterglow. The only other one you really need to listen to after that is there first one...World of noise.

Doom has somehow been transported to a world that Reed Richards' son managed to create somehow, and random things happen, most of them revolving around various factions trying to kill the good doctor.

At about this time, she starts to recieve threatening phone calls, telling her that she's to be a murder victim, but recieves only token attention from police and friends.

You would have to unclip the canvas each time. I bought extenders to size this better and a 8x8 should work pretty well for a 5\\" project.

The plastic is light weight so it is easy to hold on to for an extended time, and is not heavy to carry in my tote bag. The frame holds the tension tight so you get even stitches.

I use it when doing cross stitch with high Aida so I can see a small area at a time to work on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too small.","review":"I like the idea of these frames, but the 6x6 frame is really very small. I think the 6inch measurement must be the diagonal length. It is hard to use on anything larger than the frame as the fabric folds over underneath making it hard to stitch as you constantly have to be moving it out of the way. I would like to buy one of the larger frames as the frame itself is nice and lightweight. The snaps also do not rotate very easily to slide your work over, and you have to completely take it apart in order to move the fabric even a couple of centimeters.

However, they are much too thin, break easily and the workmanship to weld the clip in the back to the barrette is shoddy to say the least. I never got to wear it as it fell apart immediately upon trying to clasp it the first time.

The rest of it is overkill : (("},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks Erin","review":"Strong Body Fit Body is my fourth DVD workout from Erin. I have only used her video's and enjoy her workouts. She is calm but energetic. I prefer Strong Body, Ageless Body over Strong Body, Fit Body. I prefer weightlifting over cardio and for me Fit Body plays more into cardio. Fit Body also seems to focus more on the legs. Although I prefer Ageless Body I will be using/replacing/incorporating some of the exercises from Fit Body into Ageless to give myself a better workout. I would definitely buy another workout from Erin and I hope she makes another video for more variations and/or intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Workout.

A good workout that does not take a lot of time but hits all muscle groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Weight Training and Workout DVD!","review":"I love Erin O'Brien's new Strong Body, Fit Body workout DVD. Just like her previous workout DVD, Strong Body, Ageless Body, this one focuses on improving upper body strength using hand weights. You don't need anything but a towel, water, and 5 to 6 pound weights. This workout is a lot tougher than her previous DVD, but worth every 46 minutes. It's such a fun workout! She ends the workout with a longer full body stretch, which is a great improvement over her last DVD. What I like most about this DVD is that she incorporates the hand weights in every routine, plus jumps and lunges that don't hurt your knees. The core and cardio part is well balanced throughout the workout. This DVD is broken up into several 7 minutes routines that you can play alone or all together. Thanks Erin for giving us such an amazing, well rounded, full body workout routine!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Game was fun- don't expect any support","review":"Despite the fun I had with this game, the support has been so awful that they lost almost all of the stars. I downloaded the game and they never sent me a cd rom. Since then I have lost the game to a computer virus. I have e-mailed to enquire why I never received a cd. I sent that e-mail almost 2 months ago. I have since sent three more e-mails. I have still not heard from them-and at this point I really do not expect to. It seems to me that the money I spent is as good as gone. Be warned!

Overall, an entertaining book for any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in this book","review":"I'm 60 years old so that may have a lot to do with how I felt about this book. If I were say a young teenager it may have been an eye opening book but I've heard all this before mainly from the 1960's and 70's. I guess I should have been warned by the fact that we were told that we could read the book in one hour but I was fooled by the claim that it would turn my world inside out. To end it's been my experience that the practices described in the book, although excellent, usually get lost in the grind of everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time and money!","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book as it received such glowing reviews.

Although Freke presents this material as novel, original, and mind-blowing... it is none of those things. Freke's thoughts on existence and consciousness are the same things you likely came up with and mulled over as a pre-teen. In the end, the entire book seems to be nothing but a pointlessly empty build-up for Freke to implore us to \\"give peace a chance\\".This book is pithy meta-physical mumbo-jumbo with little to no substance. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Reading this tiny book was probably the biggest waste of time in my life. What a load of garbage. There is nothing enlightening, interesting or remarkable in this book. The author just spews a weak regurgitation of the same metaphysical mumbo-jumbo that you probably pondered and discarded as puerile nonsense as a pre-teen. This load of crap was merely a smokescreen for the author to meekly implore us with the oh-so-enlightening request to \\"all just get along\\".If I could give this book zero stars I would. The author wasted a half-hour of my life with this pretentious piece of trash and if I ever saw him on the street I would punch him in the throat for it.The people giving this \\"book\\" 4 or 5 stars are either joking or pretending they \\"got\\" some meaningful message out of this to avoid feeling awkward for not \\"getting it\\".

However let me sum his book up and save you the purchase price:WE ARE ALL ASLEEP IN THE ILLUSION THAT WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT WE HAVE A BODY AND A MIND AND HAVE THOUGHTS. HOWEVER WE CAN WAKE UP BY REALIZING THAT WE ARE NOT HUMAN WE ARE SIMPLY THE AWARENESS THAT PERCEIVES THE ILLUSION OF US BEING A HUMAN WITH A BODY.THE UNIVERSE IS NOT EXTERNAL, OUR TRUE UNIVERSE IS WHAT THE MIND CREATES FOR OUR AWARENESS THROUGH OUR SENSES.ALL OF OUR REALITY HAPPENS INSIDE OF OUR AWARENESS NOT OUTSIDE.YOUR THOUGHTS,BODY,MIND,BRAIN,SENSES,AND NAME ARE NOT YOU, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT WITNESSES ALL THESE THINGS. WAKE UP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"Timothy Freke presents a series of lighthearted yet poignant philosophical ideas about the nature of reality. He says that we're all living in a dream, and we can wake from this dream by just choosing to change our focus in life. Without value judgements, he challenges us to consider an alternate reality - one that is more real and meaningful than what we think we are experiencing. I appreciated his direct approach, his economy with words, and his humor. The humor seemed a little condescending at times, but it was included to remind us of the central theme without getting bogged down in overly serious philosophical rumination. There is a lot of meaning packed into this tiny book that, as the title suggests, can be read in an hour. This book also happens to be very elegant in design, which makes it a great gift now that I have read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Companion","review":"This is a great companion to Freke's book with Peter Gandy, The Laughing Jesus, Religious Lies and Gnostic Wisdom. The book may not change your life singlehandedly but it can surely deepen one's spiritual understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"This book has a pretty neat little idea about life. I was a little skeptical about it changing my life in one hour session of reading. Right when I got it I actually read it. I come to find out it only took me about half an hour to read it, at my slow pace, and I live my life looking at things this way anyways.I think the ideas would be very beneficial to someone who is not awakened yet, therefor, this book would be good to show friends who are not awakened or give as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh. Nothing new here for readers of other spiritual books.","review":"If I had never read a single book about self realization / enlightenment / reality, this might have been a nice introduction. However, I have, and this book was a rehash. The ideas weren't even presented in a particularly coherent way.

Just for the heck of it I let a friend read it, who hasn't read this stuff before and NO it did not turn her world inside out.

Therefore, if you are running Windows 2000 or XP, or plan to upgrade soon then you are out of luck as far as enjoying this marvelous game. I recently upgraded to XP and now I wish I hadn't. Only the oline version works on a newer OS, but you have to buy electronic cards. This really ..., especially for those of us who started out playing the original game and spent hundreds of dollars on the cards already.In closing, the game is awesome and if you have Windows 95/98 and plan to stick with that OS for a while then definitely add this to your gaming collection.

Instead my experience with this movie started out as a mild amusement for an unusual couple leading the sessions. This amusement quickly developed into an annoyance before evolving into full-blown disgust. Think of Meet the Parents with Robert De Niro having an interest in Ben Stiller's sexual fantasies before revealing his fetish for milking anything with nipples. Over the top comedy usually works better when there is an actual light at the end of the tunnel. It also helps when you care enough about the characters to actually see how things play out rather than wishing you didn't witness the freak show in the first place. This is a film that would seem most appreciated by a teenage audience who giggle at any sexual reference imaginable, while the rest of the crowd is left waiting for the punch line that never arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny, just weird humor","review":"I didn't really find this movie too funny. Yes there were supposedly hilarious predicaments between the two couples. The reason I wanted to even see it was because Jane Lynch was in it and I find her to be funny.

Before the takeover, our seminaries were world-class institutions educating and empowering men AND women to serve our Lord according to their own conscience as led by the Holy Spirit. Now our seminaries are a laughing stock and nothing but glorified bible colleges. All employees must affirm their allegience to the \\"Baptist Faith and Message\\", a creed that is amended at the convention leader's every whim and is placed above the Bible and Christ as our guide for faith and practice.

Last thing Thompson wrote before he died. The first chapter just tugs you right in. Forget about putting it down. The protagonist is great.

Ok- so here's the question...I read the New Black Mask Quarterly #1 in 1985 which included the First few chapters of Rip Off. However it said that Thompson died before he could arrange the typescript. That's the problem. You can really tell that Jim Thompson couldn't go back to put his finishing touches on the story.

Great writers know what books to release and what books to throw in the trunk, and this is one of the latter. This book is written in a comic style, but it's not funny in the slightest.

Much like most of the other reviewers, I count Santiago as one of my favorite books and have read it several times. The sequel however, I didn't even finish. Here's why...the main character is a thief and has been one for as long as he can remember. During one of his exploits he finds the entire works of Black Orpheus, reads them in two days, and discovers who Santiago is...what?! Then he decides that he can continue where Black Orpheus left off and start writing poems about the Inner Frontier. I know this is Resnick's book and he can do whatever he wants, but I think he waited too long to write the sequel and lost the passion (and ablity to develop a story) that he had when he wrote the original. If you are looking for a sequel that will enchant you like the first one, I'm sad to say you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty flat","review":"I loved the original and count it as one of my favorite books (and Resnick as one of my favorite writers). This sequel falls flat and the characters are relatively forgetable.

His ability to generate quick likable characters is evident, a skill he shares with the venerable Mr. Vance.His inability to create memorable interesting cultures in a few sentences, or maintain interest past 200 pages (both skills Jack Vance excelled at) sadly outweighs this however, and eventually drags this book down below the 3 star level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Album","review":"I bought this album years ago. Ramsden and Lodder are British jazz musicians. Ramsden is a saxophonist and there are similarities here with Garbarek's work for ECM in the 1970s. It's chamber jazz, slow, melodic and beautiful.I found the track Extra was on a sampler, and I liked it so much I bought the rest of the album. I would recommend this to anyone who likes ECM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"I just received this in the mail today and the pendent's quality was not what I expected at all. It appears too much glue was used during manufacturer, leaving glue visible between the silver border and the stone, on the edges on the stone itself, and all around the backing. Glue is clearly visible when looked at from both the sides and straight on, and was the very first thing I noticed when taking it out of the package.The twisted silver border is far larger and more prominent then it appears in the product image making the stone appear much smaller. Not a good thing when the entire pendent is smaller then a dime. The stone itself is a nice mint green with a very light the marbling effect that is only noticeable when viewed from very close up. The pendent also came with a good quality silver chain. Very disappointing since the product image is so lovely, but I will be seeking a refund from Silver Speck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"I bought this shirt two years ago, It still has bright firm colors, the printing is like new, It has been washed and dried a lot!

The storyline was alright I guess, but I've seen too many times before. None of the characters were memorable, likeable, or all that interesting. It was just a lot of senseless violence that didn't seem to really have a purpose in the end.The biggest let down here was the artwork - both the penciling and coloring. Based on the other reviews, I seem to be alone here. Half of the time I could barely tell what I was looking at. The characters were all drawn unnecessarily grotesque. There were also a few too many full paged panels, and I felt that it took away from the effectiveness of using a full page.By far, this is my least favorite of Frank Miller's work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Boiled","review":"Interesting story concept, but the vast majority of this is just pictures and action that takes way to long for such a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Hell of a Ride","review":"The artwork alone will blow you away.Loosely based on the same story that inspired \\"Blade Runner,\\" this book is an irreverant thrill-ride from start to finish. Every page is a masterwork of illustration, and the detail is beyond belief.It's classic Miller, with over-the-top violence, coupled with a disenfranchized cynicism that writers often imitate but can't duplicate. In this book, he masters the use of understatement, recognizing exactly when to step aside and let the art speak for itself.You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and No Chain","review":"I had to return this pendant because the quality was very poor. The photo makes it appear to be made of thick and heavy silver, but it is actually thin and cheap. I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it.

The creative evolution in this Soundtrack as well as others in this \\"Blockbuster\\" Movie category are very Adolescent in their respective artistic genres. The music of Gladiator is nonetheless enjoyable, but I find it truly deceitful to the originators of this style ripoff to call the Composers- Masters! or to call the Soundtrack a masterpiece?This is truly adolescence in the sense that music if it is considered a \\"Masterpiece\\" should be original, fresh, and doing something new.

This cd rambles on and on...the 2 or 3 main musical themes in this soundtrack just keep taking turns. I thought my player was on repeat, its hard to tell most of the tracks from each other.

The music is so fresh and new to a world where composing new music is somewhat hard. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard should be congratulated for this wonderful soundtrack.All the tracks have a 'Roman' feel to it that makes it very unique. There are great action tracks (most notably, Battle) and some very sad tracks. Vocals blend into some of the tracks making it sound like no other soundtrack. A very nice thing is that there is no break between tracks; they all play into each other. You may think that the music would be chopped up if you skipped to a middle track, but it's not. Everything can stand alone by itself.One other thing I noticed is the main theme of Pirates of the Carribean is in track three. Klaut Bedelt did do some composing in this soundtrack and composed the Pirates soundtrack.Gladiator is definately deserving of your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Hans Zimmer did a brilliant job to bring together the best for this amazing film, still since 2000 it has been one of my favorite albums.

Not only does this soundtrack direcly lift passages from Holst's The Planets: Mars, the Bringer of War, it also uses passages from Wagner's opera The Ring of the Niebelung (with a few notes changed here and there to make it different, but it's still recognizeable-- track 13 is where it's used). If it weren't for that, this would have been a perfectly good soundtrack. Why can't people in Hollywood write their own music anymore? Grrr!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too original","review":"I may be the only person on the planet who thinks Zimmer ripped of Gustav Holst's Mars and his scoring partner ripped off Yanni. The sound quality is stupendous, but if the Planets wasn't a public domain work, Zimmer would have his rear end sued for copyright infringement. Overwrought. One or two cuts will do ya. For folks who'll never listen to classical music, go ahead.

Would that Poledouris had been signed to score the entire film. Then we would have something to listen to.Hans \\"the Hack\\" Zimmer serves up his usual mishmash of recycled sounds, this time drawing from Holst's \\"Mars,\\" yes, North's \\"Spartacus,\\" and even Vangelis' march theme from Ridley Scott's own \\"1492\\" among others. I guess \\"Gladiator\\" is what results when film scores are written by a committee.And who does Lisa Gerrard think she is, Miriam Stockley? Fuggedaboudit!These people should be barred from scoring films for at least a year, if not for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous sentimental fluff. Get Conan the Barbarian instead","review":"When the trailers for Gladiator were shown, some of them sounded like they ripped off music from Conan the Barbarian. Unfortunately, the trailer music never made it into Gladiator.This movie needed a bigger chariot. Both the soundtrack (and movie) disappointed. Both were ponderous, languid and lacking one critical element: ENOUGH THUNDER. This was another one of those movies where they try to make the hero both incredibly sensitive (almost 'new age') and macho at the same time. It's a credit to Russell Crowe that, he at least, carried his end of the load."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holst and Wagner resurface in Hollywood 2000","review":"The very first time I heard the music, it was instantly recognizable - from the melody, chord progression and intensity. This was Holst and Wagner in their latest reincarnations. All of us know that Hollywood in the past had always looked to these European Composers for their Biblical and Roman spectacles,having not had their Hovhanesses and Philip Glasses.The Arabic interludes are also nothing much to write about, if you happen to be an ardent follower of North African, Rai or for that matter, Sufi music.Altogether a disappointing score - as much as the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"forgettable\\" soundtrack.","review":"I don't like the music of Hans Zimmer. I can't believe Ridley Scott has choosen this guy to score an important film like Gladiator. That was really a job for Bruce Broughton or David Arnold and not for a little New Age musician.

The best part of it was the incorperation of spanish, roman, and northern Sahara music, which makes the score very cultural and realist, as opposed to the grand 'ol Hollywood Epic score.

It's culture, it's landscape and of course, it's history. When Gladiator came out, I was amazed and I have loved it ever since. I have the DVD & VHS.

LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best soundtracks...","review":"It goes from the amazing \\"The Battle\\", full of excitement and vigor, to the lonely \\"Elysium\\", with its haunting vocals and loneliness. Then from \\"The Might of Rome\\" that makes the hair on your neck stand up, back to \\"Sorrow\\" full of a sadness and grief. This soundtrack is rivoting. Each song varies but stays within the theme. The Middle Eastern flair and amazing vocals, that Gerrard brought adds that much more to the wonderful composing of Zimmer. It's an inspiring CD and one you won't be upset you purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"listen to this sdtk and you won't forget the movie","review":"i personally think this is a great soundtrack. contain lots of great music; the tpye which you don't often hear nowadays. helps me to remember 'the gladiator' which is one of my fav. movies of the year. the last track by lisa gerrard is especially rousing, rounds off the movie with a sort of modern touch. giving the 'gladiator' wonderful combination of age-old antiquity and cotemporary/nwe age feel. not very good for late-night listening though, the tracks for the battle and and fight scenes may keep your adrenaline pumping all night long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seamless Triumph","review":"I am one of the few here who owns this CD, but have never seen the movie. I bought this disc from a city street hawker; it was a complete unknown, but since others had recommended the movie to me, I took a chance on the soundtrack. I love this music. It can be background, foreground, or inspirational music; each track adds a flavor that all add up to a very filling whole. I think it is one of Zimmer's masterstrokes to have each track run into the next, making the whole disc almost one piece, instead of 17. My personal favorite track is, surprising to many, 14: I am a Gregorian Chant buff and the quoting of the \\"Dies Irae\\" is, in my mind, chilling and haunting. This film, on the basis of its soundtrack alone, is definitely on my \\"to-see\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I loved the movie, and I love the soundtrack. Even if you haven't seen the movie the soundtrack is awesome. The sounds that you get out of it is not on any other CD I have heard, I love it. It goes from one song to another, seamlessly.

I will buy from Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite all-time soundtrack","review":"This is Hans Zimmer's masterpiece and will probably go down as his greatest soundtrack. The music really evokes the fury of battle and the majesty of ancient Rome. Whenever I listen to it, it evokes images from the movie. If you own one Hans Zimmer soundtrack, get Gladiator."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best and most moving scores!","review":"Gladiator was and amazing film with a good range of emotions. The score is no less it is very haunting and will be played repeatedly by its listeners. It has a lot of surprises in it because I didn't expect so much emotion from a score for a movie called Gladiator. Although, it does have one of the best battle themes I've heard in a while. \\"The might of Rome\\" evokes the greatness of that time in a magnificent way. the last three tracks \\"Elysium, Honor Him, and Now We Are Free\\" are amazingly moving and make you think of honor and love. \\"Earth and Sorrow\\" are the most deeply moving pieces because they bring through emotions with subtley and grace. overall this score is phenomenoal in every way and is very inpressive work from Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. I think it needed a remorseful love theme for Maximius and Lucilla, but one cannot have everything. Maybe...if it got another volume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Score","review":"This is one of Zimmer's best. Honestly, the integration of voices with the power of the orchestral background was something I found to be extremely powerful, especially in the specific scenes of the film.Ultimately, this soundtrack grabs the lister. A little brutal at times, the score can be a bit loud to the ear (it is not all relaxing!). However, this is Zimmer at his best. His experimentation with new themes is excellent in this broad-scoped score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanz Zimmer Does it again.","review":"If you like other Hanz Zimmer soundtracks like Crimson Tide, this should be a welcome CD to your collection. This is one tiny step up from most of his other work. On one end, you have the heroic and patrioc action music that he is so very good at. But on the other hand he serves up some more quiet tunes, like he did on The Thin Red Line.4 Stars because some of the stuff seemed recycled. But at least it seemed recycled of his good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music fitting a Roman Epic.","review":"This has to be the score of the year!Zimmers use of MARS: THE BRINGER OF WAR is perfect for the score and film.Ranging from quiet and haunting to loud and discordant music, the score for Gladiator is definately worth purchasing.I really can't say much about each track as it spoils the movie!All in all, it's worth adding it to your own collection like I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator OST - Inspirational","review":"Just as Bach dominated the Baroque era and Mozart the Classical surely now with the release of the Gladiator Soundtrack, Hans Zimmer can be credited alongside such greats as Williams and Horner as one of the architects of this century's musical genre - the motion picture soundtrack. For this work, Zimmer eschews his typical form of fusilades of synthesised instruments and heavy beat in favour of full and sweeping orchestral melodies. That said, the music is far from lacking the passion and force of writing synonymous with the composer. Interlaced are the ethereal vocals of co-writer Lisa Gerrard and delicate and haunting instrumental solos. All in all a breath-taking album which brilliantly echos the epic scale of the movie for which it was written. This is a highly polished score showing a maturity of writing which makes it arguably Zimmer's best work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent soundtrack","review":"Having seen the movie, I was anxious to get the soundtrack. In spite of the quotations from Holst and perhaps Wagner, there is still much originality in this music. Many of the pieces are quite powerful and moving. I especially like \\"The Battle\\", \\"Patricide\\", \\"The Might of Rome\\", \\"Slaves to Rome\\", \\"Barbarian Horde\\", \\"Am I not Merciful?\\", and \\"Elysium\\". The rest of the pieces serve to tie together the album and to provide some additional ambience, and are good in their own right.The peformance is excellent and well recorded. The album conveys quite a bit of the emotion of the screenplay itself and evokes the grandeur and tragedy of the story and of the Roman times (at least a small part of the Roman times). I highly recommend this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best film scores in years","review":"As a classical musician I rate this music up there with best of the Romantics. If you take the blatant lifts from the Planets,Gotterdammerung, the familiarities to Sibelius and even Ravel's Bolero with a smile and listen to what Zimmer cleverly does with them it is a sheer joy to listen to. Lisa Gerrard's haunting vocal writing compliments perfectly. Film music is now essentially the \\"new\\" classical music of today and gives us that glorious rich orchestral palette that we all love - it at least keeps classical music alive and I am pleased that this soundtrack has proved so popular. I recently saw the film on video and could hardly concentrate on it as I was only interested in the sound track which was drowned out by the action and dialogue! The music stands on its own, buy this CD, I hope Hans Zimmer writes an orchestral suite of it so that one day I can go into a concert hall and hear it played live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet as a biscuit","review":"I saw the movie. I bought the c.d. My only complaint is that it isn't long enough! I enjoy listening to the entire c.d. on \\"repeat\\" constantly. The songs carry the listener through the entire film (really-you can picture every scene-isn't that the purpose?). If you value the music in a film as much as the content of the film, this one won't disappoint you. I knew as I was watching the movie that I would like the soundtrack. Lisa Gerrard's work is absolutely wonderful, ethereal and a wonderful compliment to Hans Zimmer's music. As a collector of favorite movie soundtracks, I must rate this one high on my list. Try it, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've read the reviews before buying single track","review":"I heard the beautiful track \\"Elysium\\" on Pandora and immediately went to Amazon to download the track. Unfortunately, and like others have mentioned, tracks are abruptly cut off at the end--extremely annoying.I guess that's one way to force listeners to buy the entire CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly derivative","review":"I couldn't agree more with Amazon's review. Half the time I thought I was listening to Holst or Wagner. Only the last track redeems an unoriginal and imitative score."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's at it again","review":"HAns Zimmer (who i believe should have won the oscar for this score) is a musical genius when it comes to putting music to the scenes to convey the emotions of the film.

Fiove stars and much applause for this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Awesome","review":"So many different great theme s in this soundtrack,never get tired of listening to it.Love the \\"Now We Are Free \\" song sooo beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but not too original","review":"This score gets maximum points for drama and execution - it's uplifting, very emotional and extremely well done. I think it's Lisa Gerrard's touch that really sets it apart from most other film scores today. Still, that doesn't make it truly original. Zimmer's parts are strongly reminiscent of the Planets (not just the obvious Mars passage, but the whole thing), and Gerrard's parts are not that different from most Dead Can Dance albums. In fact, the final track sounds almost exactly like a Latin version of \\"Song for the Siren\\" from the first This Mortal Coil album. I really recommend this soundtrack for DCD fans who want more of Lisa's voice, and it's great music to play while you write."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"This is the best soundtrack I have ever heard.

The emotion of such a great movie is finely captured in this soundtrack. Lisa Gerrard's mysterious yet beautiful voice perfectly captures and portrays the emotions of the film. For lovers of the movie, and even just regular fans, this CD is well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful musical score. . .","review":"After watching the movie, I had to own a copy of the Gladiator Soundtrack. The music on this CD is wonderful and awe inspiring. Several tracks, “The Battle�?and the “Barbarian Horde�?are exhilarating and will pull you into the battles from the movie. And then you move into the more beautiful, heart-rending music of “The Wheat�?and “Elysium.”Both Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard did an excellent job composing and arranging this CD. If you enjoy soundtracks, heartfelt and epic music, then this is a CD for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Score","review":"The music on this album is great! Part classical, part modern. Classical enthusiasts will love this as well as opera enthusiasts. The music is fluid and melodic. I'd give this album a 10 out of 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Movie Soundtracks ever!","review":"This has always been one of my favorite movie soundtracks-- it's very stirring, powerful and appropriate to the tone, action, and period of the movie itself. I love Hans Zimmer's other stuff as well-- his work on the first \\"Pirates of the Carribean\\", and both of the \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" movies were also really exciting and lively soundtracks and I'd highly recommend all of them; not all movie soundtracks are good enough to listen to separate from the film itself, but Zimmer's stuff is so good and so evocative of the scenes that they represent, that they can be listened to for pure enjoyment all by themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SONGS ARE CUT OFF! Get the CD instead!","review":"The amazing music of the soundtrack deserves 5 stars, but the MP3 download version does not! Each track cuts out with a staticky sound right before the song is over. Bad encoding. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. GET THE CD INSTEAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, Unique","review":"I must admit, I thought Hans Zimmer and his crew at Media Ventures were a rather strange choice for an epic about ancient Rome. Zimmer's pop-influenced, synthensizer-driven style of scoring just didn't seem like it would fit, at least not in my mind. Well, I have to admit I was blindsided by this one. Zimmer's two huge action cues on this album are riveting, and his brief, punctuating heroic themes are impressively forceful. While I'm not sure, I'd say there are more orchestral elements than usual thrown in with the synths, and the overall sound is nothing less than epic. Lisa Gerrard's sections of the score are much quieter, but her soothing vocal contributions (particularly in \\"Elysium\\") are gorgeous and no less moving. Kudos to Zimmer, Gerrard, and company for crafting a score that is appropriate for the film, yet sounds vastly different from the traditional score for a Roman epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"When I heard Lisa Gerrard's voice at the beginning of the movie, I was instantly joyous. I knew right then, only a few minutes into the movie that this soundtrack would be a must buy. By turns beautiful, haunting, and rousing, this CD does not disappoint. If you are a Lisa Gerrard fan, like me, I should think you will enjoy it. It is also, in my opinion, Zimmer's best work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Really a interesting find.","review":"I always check out soundtracks when they come out unless it's something that strikes me as a write-off. For some reason I thought Gladiator would be just another Hollywood fluff film with another fluff soundtrack. Boy was I wrong. I'd say that if you like the Insider soundtrack or are a fan of Dead Can Dance this is a great buy. If you are a soundtrack fan then this is a very nice addition to an ever growing collection. Worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant","review":"This is my first Zimmer's soundtrack, and I am utterly impressed by his mastery here. Nevermind the fact that I thought the movie was amazing (epic with a lot of subtle moments). This music doesn't need the movie to be great. It reminds me a lot of 20th century composers (Schostakovich is the first to come to mind) thanks to its heavy use of dark-sounding intervals like tritones (this is definitely not just a bunch of smooth relaxing classical music). But then female vocal parts are the sad melody personified. This stuff is for ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Jobs Zimmer & cie","review":"I am not a big fan of Hans Zimmer, I know that HIS music is very good, but he works very hard for this score;Gladiator... The mystic voice by Lisa Gerrard add a touch of magical in this music. It's ceternely the best score for Hans Zimmer's career. Ttrack 4(Earth), 16 and 17 are the Highlight of this album... One of the best score in this year !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, although not all of it is Zimmer's","review":"Track 14 (Am I Not Merciful) is almost straight out of Gorecki's Third Symphony, first movement. Other than that, I appreciate its ghostly atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator","review":"Very inspiring, spiritual, moving. Where has Lisa Gerrard been hiding? She has the ability to evoke raw spiritual emotion from deep within, as in track #17 - Now we are free."},{"rating":"2","title":"soundtracks from the ethereal world","review":"imagine my suprise when, viewing a dead can dance discography, i spotted the cover of the gladiator soundtrack mixed in with other dcd titles. immediately i realized why the evocative music of gladiator had always stirred some faint memory within me. zimmer and gerard, for those who didn't know, are the core of the goth group dead can dance. so this review is less a review of the actual cd, but a personal memo of my own delight at seeing one of my favorite groups so publicly extolled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was pretty let down by this soundtrack. The score was plain and boring. Hans Zimmer usually writes wonderfully worthy music. The theme was weak and held no convincing emotion. It wasn't until track 17 when I started to enjoy it. That's probably the only track that stood out. Lisa Gerrard is a fine singer. However, she gets irritating after a while because the melodies are so arid and flat. The movie was missing here. If you have the movie do not bother getting the soundtrack. It's a real let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price its great!","review":"Being a first time home buyer, I had the hardest time finding the right product at stores as I did not have a filter to compare it to, just measurements of the tray.

I would have given 5 stars, but box was damaged during shipping, and the filters being fragile were also a bit damaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"great price, does the job.","review":"This is the filter that came with the co-op.

However, I must agree with several other reviewers: The grammar and punctuation in this book are absolutely ATROCIOUS. EXTREMELY detracting when one must constantly correct the author's grammar.Also-- I believe that Jean Lafitte's name is spelled \\"Lafitte\\" and not \\"Laffite\\" although I could be wrong (I've just always seen it spelled with two \\"t\\"'s). The Author might check that out...Hopefully, the author will have her next book checked for grammatical and spelling problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this book because I enjoy reading time travel books. This book is fun to read but it could have used a little more editing. I didn't think the story flowed as smoothly as most books of this genre. But did anyone check the spelling and punctuation before this book was printed? While you might see a word or two misspelled in books these days, this one had more errors than you can count. I found this distracting and annoying. For the money this book cost you'd think they could have hired a proofreader. This is the worst printing job I've ever seen. The publisher should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst!","review":"This has got to be the absolute worst book I have read this year. The backs of cereal boxes showed more depth and drama. I had the hardest time getting into the flow of the story, as there was a marked lack of correct punctuation. This book hit the wall, after I skimmed that last half and saw that it didn't get any better. A must-miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When's the sequel?","review":"I read the book straight through, stealing every minute I could to move from page to page.

Lots of love your son david."},{"rating":"1","title":"a churlish, angry book that is brazen in its sympathies","review":"Many people have been inspired by the magical treatment of Earl Long in the now-legendary book The Earl of Louisiana. Some authors have thrived in the tradition of the wary reporter trying to explain a larger than life Louisiana legend, such as John McGuiness sucessfully did with his mid-1980s book, The Last Hayride. Nancy Lemann, however, is no Liebling as she unsuccessfully tries to give us a personal glimpse of Edwin Edwards during his 1980s trials for racketeering. A more gifted writer, a more charitable person, might have given us a book we could care about, but Lemann's obvious hatred for the governor stains and sinks this book. Her repeatedly snide remarks concerning Cajuns are nothing les than racist as she tries to give us a world of political deal-making that she obviously recoils from. I have repeatedly seen this sad book in the bins at the Salvation Army, and it's no wonder why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality; Knock-Off","review":"The picture in the description shows the original POW-MIA flag, which is what I wanted. Unfortunately, the product is a poorly printed knock-off. The words \\"You Are Not Forgotten\\" run together and are barely legible. The guard standing in the tower in the background is a square instead of being a guard holding a rifle. The flag's material is good quality but the printed picture and words are horrible.

I am returning the product and purchasing the flag from a different retailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad","review":"i ordered this flag and when i got it it was not this flag at all. so i e-mailed them they told me to return it and they would send a new one. the second one was the same as the first so I returned it again and got it somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"pow-mia flag","review":"The impact of this flag should not be ignored; the few who should be acknowledged beneath its symbol should be remembered, as a product; this flag is suspiciously a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crooked","review":"This is a very lightweight flag which I was expecting. You get what you pay for, this would not stand up to anything outside, but I was expecting that (I purchased it for indoor use).***Unfortunately, this was crooked by almost 5 or 6 inches. This made it completely unusable, so I am forced to give the product a bad review.Disclaimer: Customer service was excellent by 3x5flags, and I got a refund immediately. So I actually gave the the seller a good review but this review is simply about the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"POW/MIA Flag","review":"When ordering, did not say if it was only one side.

When he doesn't, it comes in woefully underrepresented, like his interpretation of \\"The Rose.\\" If you're going to dole out import money, go for someone who can define \\"nuance.\\" I've heard that Mr. Leyton is wonderful as Valjean, but I seriously wonder if he was ready to produce a solo album and dive into a pool with the likes of men like Warlow and Ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am afraid I must disagree with the enthusiastic review given by my fellow N.C.Triangle resident. Although some of the selections were good (Music of the Night, The Rose, Against All Odds and Last Night of the World), I found the other selections to be overwrought and somewhat \\"over the top\\".

It comes with two different software applications that work totally different and it's not clear which one you should follow. Maximum PC said the same thing in their review. If they could get someone to write a decent manual, it may be worth it. Also, when I returned it, Amazon was going to charge me a $100 restocking fee, even though it was sent back exactly as it came. I complained and they backed off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well written, intense autobiorgaphy.","review":"The moment I opened this book I was immersed within it. Eugenia Ginzberg is a superb writer who uses her skill to deeply communicate the horror that the political prisoners in the Stalin years experienced. The story reflects the extremes of the human spirit: evil and love. It's not possible to read this book without being emotionally effected. It gave me a deeper appreciation for many of the freedoms, rights, and simple pleasures I have in my life. The book ends rather abruptly, though it apparently picks up in another book, \\"Within the Whirlwind.\\" I will be getting my hands on that because I really want to know what happened to Ms. Ginzberg.

Many of the musicians were heard on 5th Dimention, Carpenters, Partridge Family albums. They are high caliber, and so are the songs.

The sound quality is just superb. FM reception is quite good. I haven't used the voice recorder, so I can't comment on that. The software that accompanies the product is rock solid. Battery life seems to be about 10 hrs.I do have my gripes:* A device of this quality deserves better than ear buds.* I found the belt clip case to be very awkward. Just inserting the stereo in the case can change the settings.* The operating controls/menu system is fairly involved.But when all is said and done, this is without a doubt the most bang for audio buck I've ever encountered. If you want true, cutting-edge sound quality in a ridiculously small package, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery life is disappointing","review":"the reason i purchased an mp3 player was because i run all the time. i like to listen to music when i run. i've always used a discman. that worked fine but it seemed that after every couple of runs i had to replace the batteries because the anti-skip . i went through a lot of batteries real fast.so i purchased the iaudio.. as advertised it does have awesome sound quality but it also goes through batteries like crazy. i was informed by a friend that to save battery life i had to deactivate the backlight and turn the volume on low. well what's the point of having all these features if i can't even use them,, so now i'm back where i started,,,, buying batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work 14 months later","review":"It worked great up to a few weeks ago.

The voice recording sounds wonderful. It can handle music quality much higher than cd quality. It sounds really good even with the little earbuds! It is tiny, about half the size of a deck of cards. The only thing I dont like about it is the fact the only way to put mp3s on it is to use the software they give you. DO NOT LOSE THE KEY for that software or you WILL NOT be able to put more songs on the player. It even lets you change the font of the text in the display. This thing is great. I have barely begun to describe everything it offers. I highly recomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mp3 just what I needed","review":"Extremely easy set up and use. All I have to do is click and drag songs from my music and drop into player file. I can change songs quickly and easily. Sound quality is great and it is plenty loud enough to hear while I'm running on the treadmill. It does have a user defined volume level if you want to set your own. FM radio is a good feature, reception is ok but not great. The earphones that came with it were too large for my ears(I'm petite)so I had to use my own. That was the only negative thing about my purchase. I would highly recommend this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot convert encrypted WMA files","review":"Most music websites download files in an encrypted WMA format.

Other cheese slicers I've tried had wires that stretched and coudln't be tightened, or the wire broke and I was out $15-20. I think this product slices better and more consistently sized slices.

This one only lasted a month! First, the wiring loosened, then the plastic just snapped in two.

Hopefully it will last somewhat longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within 2 weeks of purchase","review":"This cheese cutter broke with normal use about 2 weeks after purchase. The plastic needs to be more sturdy. Actually I didn't like the way the plastic bent the first time I tried it with some medium cheddar. I started to use 2 hands to apply pressure on both sides of the cutter. I think it broke when my Wife was using it, or maybe it fell off the counter.If the handle was more sturdy so I could use it one handed it would be great for me. However my Wife didn't like it as much as the usual handheld wire cheese slicer. We're going to go back to that, though I might buy another one of these just to have on hand. I liked it until it broke,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient, but rather puny","review":"Yes, it's great to just grab a simple cheese slicer from the drawer and go to town on a block of cheese when you crave that midnight snack, but this one can't handle the major league stuff.

I got precisely what I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheese slicer","review":"I've used this product in the past for cutting bricks of soft cheeses and it's fantastic.

I seem to recall it became over heated in the dishwasher, which allowed a wire to come loose. We were lost without it because it does such a good job slicing through cheese, whether it is soft or hard. I shopped for another every time there was an opportunity, to no avail.

His long career with the Maytals included the sounds of early ska, rock steady, and classic reggae. As has been pointed out by others, one of his greatest contributions to Jamaican music was his infusion of the sound of American soul and R&B. His voice is gruff though sublime.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godfather of Reggae","review":"Bob Marley may be the king but Toots was the originator. He was one of the first musicians to use the word Reggae to describe this popular Jamaican musical style. My only complaint with this compilation is that it omits the song, \\"Premature\\" from the LP, Reggae Got Soul (Lyrics: \\"Let the girl go home, let her go back home ...\\"). It's a great tune and one of his biggest international hits.

I particularly liked the relationship between Jack and Frank, and Celia's character.I did find Celia to be a bit of a Mary Sue. She is entirely selfless, honest, and good which gets a bit old after awhile. Her interferance between Frank & his father was a tad sappy.

I never opened the sent product as I had found the kit at my drugstore, at a lower cost, I might add, just after your product was on it's way. There was no way to stop your shipment, so I am stuck for close to $35.00 for both purchases (one from my local drugstore and one from you). Live and learn.

I don't know how everybody else thought they were great - maybe compared to cheaper roller covers. We have smooth walls, and used top, top quality paint. We did get one coat coverage, but that was because of the paint itself, rather than the roller covers. The covers would start out smooth and beautiful, but within minutes would mat and clump terribly, leaving a less-than-smooth paint finish. They did not shed at all, however, so if your walls are semi-smooth, these covers will probably do just fine. We ended up going to the store and buying some single, more expensive covers that we perfect start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best","review":"This is the best roller cover on the market.

The only song remotely reminiscent of Saigon Kick is the title track(the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of one), there is no variety in this, just power chords and catchy lyrics that sound like they are trying to make money off something that bands like Green Day and Blink 182 have already done.

Interested readers should instead get the book 'Maximising Manhood', by the British endocrinologist Malcolm Carruthers, which addresses the issue of the male menopause and treatment, and discusses the risks (low) and benefits (wonderful).By the way, if you had mumps as an adolescent and a vasectomy later, there is a good chance of exacerbated symptoms of the andropause.

Absolving anyone--women OR men--of their behavior simply because their hormone levels fluctuate with age and other factors shows disregard for common civility and decency.

It transports the reader to the book's epoch in history and provides all the information needed to make the story alive and real. The background to the Mutiny , all of the leading protaganists male and female and their heroism and duplicity are brought into focus as the survivors of Cawnpore are guaranteed safe passage only to be massacred by the Ghat on the river when they were at their most vulnerable. Similarily the murder and disposal of innocents at the Bibighar. Both these acts , and in addition the siege itself and the retribution of the British including many Scottish regiments, highlight a clash of Northern Victorian with Eastern culture sufficient to show the reader the extremes of barbarity, cruelty and compassion of both. A superb story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, Harrowing Reading","review":"This is without a doubt the best book ever written on the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857.

One complaint however, was that Ward does not give enough backgound information on one of the main group of actors in this story, the sepoys themselves! As one reader above said, its not an easy book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raising Kids for True Greatness","review":"The book is excellent. Anything by Tim Kimmel is full of godly wisdom and very helpful to parents and grandparents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for parents or non-parents...","review":"I recently got married to a wonderful woman who has a son from a previous marriage. Since we didn't get the usual 'honeymoon' period that most newlyweds get, I knew I had some learning to do for this new role of 'daddy.' I heard the author speaking about his book on the radio. I checked it out on Amazon and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot. This book really paid off. Not only does he define greatness in terms of service as opposed to accomplishments for oneself, he gives real-life examples of how to accomplish this. Although he slyly titled the book to be of importance to adults with children, this book should be mandatory reading for anyone who thinks they have greatness defined. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Kimmel's call to refocus our direction to greatnes is great!","review":"Dr. Kimmel's articulation exceeds my ability to so clearly define what is missing in our parenting direction to point from success to True Greatness and from behavior to character. His book validates my heart in what I have seen in 30 years of teaching, counseling and shepherding. It is a great read for those who are shaping lives, preparenting, parenting or grandparenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAVA IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING","review":"Yep, that's right...a volcanic eruption in NYC is the premise for this hokey but mildly diverting disaster flick. Seems like nasty doctor Michael Ironside is trying to develop a source of geothermal energy and doing so he starts a volcanic rift under the Big Apple. Dedicated tunnel worker Costas Mandylor is the first to discover the lava flow but of course no one believes him. Enter Alexandra Paul as his geologist ex-wife who is called in to find out what's going on. The FBI is certain it's the work of terrorists, while a high city official is secretly funding Ironside's experiment.The movie is nowhere as intense as the earlier VOLCANO, as it's pending doom never seems large scale enough for a good disaster movie, and the effects aren't that impressive.Diverting entertainment for fans of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"THAT ONE STAR REALLY MEANS NEGATIVE 1","review":"JESUS HELP ME!

Listening to this CD is like being a part of an intimate audience at the Longview. I have never been there, but I felt like I was as I sat there, listening to the diversity of selections prefaced by Ian's personal commentary about each one. I enjoy all of Ian's western/cowboy songs, but in this album, I heard a humorous side of Ian Tyson in some of his comments and the selection \\"Sorta Together\\" that I didn't know existed until now. The guitar and violin riffs are rich and vibrant, drawing the listener into the Longview audience. My personal favorites among the selections are \\"Desert Motel,\\" \\"Sorta Together,\\" \\"Smuggler's Cove,\\" Somewhere in the Rubies,\\" \\"M.C. Horses,\\" and the traditional \\"Mexican\\" sound of Horsethief Moon.\\" But as a Texan who longs for the hills of Wyoming and Montana, \\"Bob Fudge\\" is my new favorite! For me, this is Ian at his best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars is too few","review":"From the first track to the last it's Ian at his best.

The smoothest voice you can imagine. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in Longview","review":"Ian Tyson as much a part of Canadian music as anyone could be and it was neat to be transported back to the energy of his live performances. Having lived in Alberta for twenty years we made every attempt we could to hear this man live. His songs are varied and unique and tell a story that opens up the imagination to a way of life which is fast disappearing. I liked the fact that this CD was recorded in Longview and enjoyed the contributions of the musicians as well. Myron Szott continues to show his fiddling artistry on this CD.

The single key shortcuts are nice and the colors work to simplify. The adjustable plug in light is a nice touch, as well. But, get the job/shuttle to work has been an exercise in frustration. From what I've gather while surfing the internet is this problem is widespread. At my first attempt to reach tech support, I gave up to find a real phone extension for them and contacted sales who transferred me to a recording. I then tried email. No response. Tech support is now the 'leave a message and we'll get back to you someday' variety. Totally and completely unacceptable for a keyboard costing $130.

True, but I find their songs to have deeper meaning. The lyrics are well written and the music is powerful. It is at the top of that dramatic alternative rock genre. I'd expect to see it on many shows in long dramatic sequences for years to come. Their earlier cd, SATELLITES is also good. Both have great music with powerful messages.I bought the entire cd on i-tunes but later decided to order the cd here from amazon, I was disappointed that the artwork was COMPLETELY different. Oh, well, they're a band worth supporting with this second purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad. Not bad at all.","review":"Think early Coldplay with less piano, or think Snow Patrol, what their 'Eyes Open' album should have been, and Vega4 lands somewhere in the middle.

I can't wear them in the summer, they're just too warm. The fit is good, but 12 inches is too high. If I were actually going to try and wear these boots on a regular basis I would have them re-soled.

Nicholas Gonner (1835-1892) became the publisher of the 'Luxemburger Gazette' in 1872. He published 'Die Luxemburger in der Neuen Welt' in German, in 1889 in Dubuque, Iowa. In 1987 the book has been re-published in Luxembourg, translated into English as 'Luxembourgers in the New World', with numerous new chapters added. The editors Jean Ensch, Jean-Claude Muller and Robert E. Owen have compiled a second volume. The second volume contains all the known names of emigrants from Luxembourg and all Luxembourg towns that have appeared in the 'Luxemburger Gazette' between 1871 and 1918. The listing includes the date and page number of the publication in which a given name appeared. For instance, the name: Reuland, Jacob appeared in the following issues: March 22, 1887, page 5, April 25, 1893, page 5, February 25, 1908, page 5, May 25, 1909, page 5, July 20, 1909, page 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"This single is awesome!!!","review":"Not only do I love the song 'Mellow Day' (which is on the new album BUSK), but 'Sink Into Your Skin' is also another amazing song that I just can't get out of my head! I love the fact that there are two songs on this single that are not on her new album. I do have her other albums (Lola Cuki, Weather Changer Girl, and now BUSK) and I can say with confidence that she just gets better and better. Her voice is dreamy and the music takes you to another place in time. She's been compared to many other bands like the Cocteau Twins and the Cranberries, but I think you should listen to the sound samples here and see for yourself. If you're a fan of beautiful melodies and dreamy guitars and sounds, then she's the girl for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is one of the worst rip offs on DVD.

There were just way too many things left out of the movie.The film did have an exceptional cast, and the acting was terrific. I was somewhat suprised at how well Matt Dillon play Jan Erlone. The setting was pretty good too. The scenery was put together nicely, as it did look like the 1940's.Unfortunately, the editing from the novel made the film seem quite choppy. Having read the book, you got into the minds of the characters, especially that of Bigger's. The movie skipped over too many things, not allowing you to do this, which was a fairly big letdown.Not reading the book might leave you with a different impression of the film, because, once again, the acting is wonderful. But, having read the book, I couldn't enjoy the movie. Way too many important scenes were taken out of it. It is really not a good adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick delivery, good condition","review":"Very pleased with this service.

Once we started playing it, within 10 minutes she hated it. After doing Mario Cart since Christmas, this game just wasn't fun at all. I don't know what I expected, but this is just a mixed bag of games that just aren't fun for little kids or adults. It was only 20 bucks instead of the usual 50, so I'm not out that much. Maybe it will grow on us, but for now we aren't playing it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Hard","review":"This could be a fun game. And I don't agree with the reviewers who find the mini games to be stupid, from what I was able to play of it, a lot of the mini games were a lot of fun (yes, even spinning the cow). That said, I am a fairly hard-core adult gamer and I could not finish this game on story mode. I got stuck in one mini game that I just cannot win even though I've tried about 50 times. As others have said, this is game gets ridiculously hard and then it becomes monotonous and extremely frustrating. I was only able to complete about 6% of the story mode before becoming helplessly stuck and just tossed this thing in the bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game play, lousy ending","review":"What a fun game to play-assuming you don't mind performing various acts of mayhem and destruction on the unfortunate rabbits! Sadly though, my family and I, particularly my 5yr old, were terrible disapointed at the ending, which compeletely lacked any attempt at resolving the game and giving any closure to the story as presented in the game. That said, as long as you don't get too wrapped up in why you're playing the game, the individual mini games are a blast and have great repeatability."},{"rating":"1","title":"mini games are too hard","review":"I agree with other reviews that some of the mini games are ridiculously hard, even impossible to complete. For example, \\"deliver the package\\" where you have to move remote and nunchuck as fast as you can to make Rayman run. My kids could not do it neither did me or my husband. Both of us in a great athletic shape but we end up with a muscle cramps and a great frustration. At first we thought that their is a something wrong with our wii system , may be communication with a remote? Especially if the game tells you all the time that you are standing too far from the TV. My son had to stand 2 meters in front of the TV and still the game would not respond property. All the other games we own work just fine. After reading other negative reviews I see now it must be the flow of the game.

I owned the original Nintendo a long time ago and a Sega a sytem over 13 years ago. I got into a Wii because I saw how much fun you could have no matter what your age and skill. Living in Alaska there is only so much you can do at -40F or colder and playing wii and the games is a way to get rid of cabin fever. I got Raving Rbbids after I got the RR TV Party and my 7 yo daughter and I play both of them all the time. I picked it up after a friend on FB said they loved it. My only wish is that you could have access to more of the shooting plunger games without completing levels.Overall I LOVE the RABBIDS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm... It is a unique game.","review":"Well, lets put it this way, this game is the only one like it. It has the most character and humor I have seen in a game. The gameplay is family friendly and does have a multiplayer function which adds to its value. I enjoyed playing the games but after a while the games got boring and repedative. Even the rabbits grow tired of watching the arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laught Out Loud Funny!!!","review":"My husband asked why I brought home such a childish looking game but once I started playing he came into the room to see what I was laughing at. The minigames are made for the Wii remote and nunchuk. I get more of a workout from this than I do from Wii Sports. It is set up in days (chapters). With 5 minigames per day. I guess you can miss one and still finish the day (per another poster). Once you finish the day's activities, you are awarded a song or an article of clothing.I am stuck on Day 3 and that is why I have chosen to give it four stars. The bunny brain marble game is waaaaay too hard for me; I cannot get it to the end, much less get it there in under 30 seconds! Not only that I cannot seem to win the pig race at the end of that day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop playing this game","review":"My whole family loves this game since it has levels from the down right simple for the younger crowd to the tough to conquer for the advanced skills of the most practiced gamers. Love the rabbits and all the funny stuff included in the game. Even the people in the room watching us play got a big kick out of it. You can always go back to previous levels that you really enjoyed without losing your top skill level or creating a new profile. Great fun and great laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rayman is a riot!","review":"We were looking for a game the whole family could play and enjoy.Rayman fits the bill perfectly!What a riot to play. It can really wear you out and is so fun. Adults and kids all love it! Unlike a lot of other games, this one is fun to watch someone else play. Normally, I don't find that entertaining, but this one is quite entertaining, especially if you are watching someone who puts their whole body and face into the movements!!!I recommend this game for everyone. It shows off the movement of the wiimotes and is a fun party game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rabbids Overrun Christmas Dinner","review":"After trying Raving Rabbids for 35 minutes at the Nintendo World store in Rockefeller Center on Christmas Eve day, my wife and I had to have a copy. Fortunately the store had a supply of Wii consoles; unfortunately they sold out of Raving Rabbids and extra remotes. Undeterred we found a copy and have been racing, chasing, and bashing Rabbids the last 4 days.

I would highly recommend this game to start off anyone's Wii collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"This is such a fun game. It is down right silly which makes it even more fun.

We had seen the commercials and thought they were hysterical. Rabbits screaming with bulging eyes, who wouldn't love that? The game however, a little boring. a little hard to navigate & really not much to do. We were expecting a Spyro-type game and this not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes a challenge for younger kids","review":"Rayman Raving Rabbids is a fun game. Lots of laughs. The game is very creative. There are some tasks that are harder for younger kids when they have to shake the nunchuck to run or reload. Our 6 year was frustrated a few times. If you can play this in multi-player mode we haven't figured it out yet or gotten to a level that allows multi-player. It would be even funnier if several people could play at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Flying Cows, Batman!","review":"I can't remember ever laughing so hard while playing a video game.

You really couldn't be disappointed by this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously fun","review":"When I first saw the outstanding reviews for this game, I kept thinking \\"What's the deal? It's just a bunch of mini-games.\\". After playing it for a few hours, however, I now understand.The mini-games are fun, utilizing the Wii-mote to its full extent, but the rabbids are really what make the game so great. Whether they're using the outhouse (with realistic sound effects), hitting each other with shovels or dancing La Bamba, they will make you laugh out loud. Most of the games are fairly simple, but they do progressively get harder as the game goes on.Overally, it's a great launch title, and would be a great game to play with a bunch of friends or family. Even playing alone, you will have a great time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Crazy","review":"I bought this as a gift for my teenage brother.

They love everthing about this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Wii Game So Far!","review":"I love this game!! I will start by saying that I am not a huge video gamer, I never had a game system growing up and the only games I ever really played were Mario Brothers and Tetris at friend's houses. But Rayman is a must own for people that have a short attention span, or don't want to get into a game that takes an entire month of their life to get through or you need to spend hours looking up play hints online.There are lots of mini games and so much variety that you can never get bored. You can play in Score Mode, each mini game at a time, or you can play in Story Mode, where you have to beat each mini game to move on to the next level and unlock more games.From games like flinging a cow or pig wrangling, to slapping bunnies that are singing out of tune and pulling worms out of a bunny's rotting teeth it is the most fun you will have with your Wii! You MUST own this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game for single-player or multi-player","review":"This game is great, I absolutely love it. I'm really not a video game person, and I was addicted to this one. The mini-game concept makes it easy to stop playing whenever you want. It is also really great for parties, every one can take turns playing a mini-game in single-player mode, or compete with each other in multi-player mode. It is fun and light-hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun for Kids of Old Ages","review":"Bought this as a party game for my wife and friends (30+ Crowd). Although the game doesn't have as many multi player options as I might like, it is still a load of fun with a group. We have found it to be a decent exercise game as well (try the bomb run game). Humor is a great addition; we find ourselves laughing quite a bit at the bunnies and at each other.You do have to beat the single player to get multiplayer access, but we have found the single player works fine with groups as well. Just pass the controller around.Especially now that this is usually value priced (Don't make me a lier amazon) it is a must have you non-stiffys that can have a good time without their 42nd level PattyWarrior and his +2 Chain Sword."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you were stuck, you were stuck","review":"this game has a lot of fun mini games. the problem is you have to follow the 'story mode' and win a set of those games in order to unlock other games. So if you got stuck at one, you were stuck forever. I am not a gamer, and my 4-yr old does't have good control either. I helped him on a few games so he can have more game choices, but I really have problem, and no patient, repeatly trying to win one of the mini-game (the pig racing on beach). So after a week, both of us stop playing this game.I would have give it 4 star if they didn't put in such restrictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive!","review":"this game is very fun at first. it is like a funny cartoon. but the mini-games start to get EXTREMELY repetitive and old. at first the mini-games seem exciting and fun. but as you so through the game they start to repeat the same mini-games over and over. a lot of the games are hard, frustrating, and/or annoying and if you dont like a game you have to play it over and over to beat it and move on to the next one. i beat this game in 2 very long tiring days. no mini-game is so fun that i would want to play it again. i havent played the game since i beat it and dont plan too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugs you should know about","review":"I like this game a lot but there are some bugs that you should know about. First, the game does not run in 480p even when the Wii is set to 480p and you use the Nintendo Wii Component Cable. Second, the game does not run in widescreen even when you have the Wii configured to use widescreen. I'm using a 40\\" Sony Bravia LCD and the game is stretched and blurry. The manual incorrectly states there is a Video Menu option but this is not the case and according to the UBI website this reference should have been taken out of the manual before it was printed. The UBI website also incorrectly states that the 480p and Widescreen options are taken from the Wii configuration. This simple isn't true. Can you say, bug?!?Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game. It's just the pictures you see on the web for the game are misleading. It's not widescreen, it's not 480p, and the graphics are not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"better the most mini games","review":"I really like this one - the mini games all flow together in a nice story. the games themselve are easy, hard, challenging - overall nice mix. Overall fun attempt at humor through out. It's hard to get frustrated at some of the games that are hard when they are just so fun!Glad I bought this one - great for $20!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rayman vs. Bunnies","review":"I never played a Rayman game before,but when when I played this game I was hooked. The mini games are fun and offer replayability. I love the bunnies they are really funny. Rayman can where different costumes throughout the game. There are lot's of catchy songs too. My favorite mini games are the dancing ones. There are also these first person shooter mini games,but don't worry mom and dad you don't use guns you use plungers and shoot bunnies. The reason i'm giving it four stars is because of the difficulty. Now, it's not to hard but some of the mini games left me screaming at my tv. Over all the game is pretty good. Check it out it's the only game that made me laugh and scream."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Game, but a little tougher than the others","review":"This was UbiSoft's first Rabbid game and I thought I had played it before, but once I started playing it, I realized I hadn't. It's tougher than the second game and might be a challenge for little ones (and a few of us older ones) as a lot of the mini-games require tight time constraints. The games are considerably different than the second Rabbids game and the music selections are interesting. A few of the music games are almost unrecognizable and way harder than the second game. The second game in comparison is a piece of cake. I would recommend this game for older kids or adults, or kids/adults who game a lot. It requires a lot of practice and patience to get through the levels, but as time goes on, it becomes more fun. I suggest trying Rabbids 2 before buying this one. Four thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rayman's Raving Rabbids","review":"Fun for all skill levels in the family! The variety of games keeps each level progression challenging. It has sports, music/dancing, racing, and just plain goofy (like cow-tossing or Rabbid wacking)! The graphics are clear and the soundtrack is entertaining. The Rabbids are hysterical, slightly annoying and comically creative - it is a game we all enjoy playing and it makes us laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite wii game EVER!","review":"For very little money I have had hours and hours of fun with this clever and challenging game. The graphics are super, and did they ever make me laugh! The best part was knowing that I was working toward a goal. I had a great sense of accomplishment when I reached that window! Thanks Issy and D-man for getting me hooked and turning me into a Raving fanatic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rayman Raving Rabbits","review":"This game is cool! I beat the game, but I still play it constantly. The game is full of twisted, but hilareous, minigames that I still laugh out loud about. You can give Rayman several outfits ranging from a Grandma, to a Gangster. For everyone that has a Wii, THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give that 50 dollars to a charity....","review":"Bought it for my boyfriend. It took him 4 hours to beat the game. So we stared at the credits screen, hoping it was one of those games that continue after the credits. No, all you get are bonuses (so far it seems they are just videos/ads). To get the bonuses, though, you have to go back and play the 10 minigames again, and again, to have enough points. Oh, great!Not worth 50 dollars, or whatever you pay for it.Like most other people said, you use basically the same motions on the minigames... and there are only 10 types of minigames."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the dancing game!!!!!","review":"this game is basically a bunch of mini-games combined... some of the games are not too bad but some are just plain stupid... i think its terrible how u actually have to beat the games in story mode first before u can play them... the dancing game is terrible also... it wasn't too bad the first two times... but they you have to keep playing them... i'm on the third or fourth one and i'm just stuck because its hard to do the motions sometimes when you have 7-8 rabbits coming out all at once... i've been at this dance game for about half an hour and i'm stuck cuz i can't beat it... now i can't play the rest of the 82 percent of the game because i'm stuck at one part... this sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring game on the Nintendo Wii","review":"I simply cannot explain in words how boring this game is. The first person shooter aspect of this game is all rail based. You cannot choose where to move and it is very annoying.The dancing portions of this game are worthless and pointless. The gestures you make with the wii-remote are tedious.If you are looking for a fun game that is worth your time and money, look somewhere else.Might I also add this game now has made me feel an urge to kill every rabbit I see."},{"rating":"1","title":"wii games","review":"I would be able to give you details of how good the games were if they were compatable with my wii. Unfortunately unknown to be and a good many other people American games only fit American machines. So no I'm not very happy at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun platformer. May Be Too Hard For Younger Players.","review":"Rayman Raving Rabbids is a very well done platform game made up of dozens of mini games. It is a great showcase for the Wii remote, and is tons of fun. Echoing what another reviewer said here: after the first of 12 or so levels, the game gets pretty hard, and my youngest (6yrs old) has a hard time with the difficulty of the games. Some of this has to do with the new control system that, while innovative, is something new - and requires a fair amount of fine motor skills. My 11 year olds loves all the games and has no problems. The graphics and art design are nice, and the atmosphere created while playing is very fun and light hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Silly Very Fun","review":"This is a silly game. It has dancing rabbits, toilet plungers and a cow toss. I mean come on a game with a cow toss is not going to be serious. It is very easy to play and very funny. There are a ton of mini games so you shouldn't get bored too quicklyThis is a perfect game if you have young gammers, or inexpierenced older gamers. It is easy to manipulate the controlers and play the game. Plus it is great with a bunch of people who will laugh out loud at how silly the game is.It is lots of fun and I reccomend it to someone who wants a game that *everyone* can play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Shallow Minigames","review":"This has more shock value than anything and is funny at first. The crazy rabbits are funny to see for the first time and are laugh in a group setting. But as an adult, I find the mini games to be very shallow and get old quickly. I played through the game once in single-player just to play through everything and had a few interesting moments on the side. But I think there are far better minigame collections out there if you want some minigames with any depth. For example, how long will it be fun to slam bathroom doors on crazy rabbits that scream when the bathroom stall doors open? Funny for shock value once, but I look for a little more in a game than shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK!","review":"I bought this game for my mom and nephews to play but when I received the game I immediately saw that it had little scratches on the edge and knew it wasn't going to work. When I put it in the Wii I found out I was right, it doesn't work. So thank you goHastings for a waste of my time and money, I now know not to buy anything from you ever again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, finished so fast..........","review":"I can't help to say this game is GREAT!! buy there are some annoying undoable minigames. This game is a great buy,but only if you play 3 minutes a day. In other word it's like warioware. WAAAYYY to short and WAAAYY too annoying.Not a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the excitement?","review":"There is so much hype here about this game - like it's a next reincarnation of Budda, or, at the very least, Halo, Wii style. But in reality, this is the game with zero story line, awkward controls and plenty of layman jokes, if that is your style. I guess, Wii developers watched the success of Wii Sports and decided that slapping together bunch of mini-games is all that gamers would ever want.Maybe if you are 5 year old kid, pimpled teenager who laughs at toilet humor or bored to death housewife, you will enjoy this game. For the rest of us, pass it like a plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"This is my first Wii game and I'm enjoying it immensely! Some of the challenges are a bit too hard for my amateur skills, but so far I've been able to pass at least 3 of the 4 tests to gain entry into the 'boss' on each arena level. I've noticed that the controller motion isn't always intuitive -- for example when you close potty stall doors, you put your hand in front of the bunny on the stall instead of on the door, which may have moved far beyond the bunny by this time. But once you adjust for those quirks, you can be pretty successful. I think the story is clever, the graphics are great, the little touches like climbing up the wall using the prizes you've won in the arena are very funny. You have to be in the mood for some goofy gaming to enjoy this, but I find it very refreshing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raving Fun!","review":"Well, I just received the Wii earlier this month January and I really like the system. Raving Rabbids wasn't the first game I bought, but it interested me from the commercials. I didn't know if I wanted to buy it at first, but I'm glad I did, this game is tons of fun. There isn't much of a storyline, but that isn't what this game is about. It's about utilizing most of the functions of the wiimote and nunchucks; they utlized every aspect of the functions. Some of the games are very easy, but also some of the games can be very challenging and fun. The only thing about the wii is the graphics could be a little better for a next generation game system, but that doesn't matter with the wii, its's a great system. I see there is a version for the PC, I don't know why it's better on the wii, because of the wiimotes. I highly recommend this game, I guarantee you'll have a great time playing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely fun mini games","review":"Overall this is a very fun game. Initially I was disappointed that Wario Ware was not a launch title, but this game gives you everything Wario Ware does and more. There are a variety of fun and challenging mini-games. THe first person shooter games are hilarious. Definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raving Rabbids","review":"So much crazy psycho laugh out loud fun. Rabbids will have moments where I am just sitting on the couch laughing. I only gave it 4 stars because some of the other Rabbids were more enjoyable to play. Like the TV one."},{"rating":"1","title":"World Wide Distributor doesn't actually carry the S video cord","review":"Title says it all - they picture and describe a S video cable, but they'll send you an RCA cable and claim it's the same thing.

I started using them back when I added an external 2x CD-ROM drive to my fire-breathing 25Mhz 386 machine (and that was a LONG time ago!). They have held up well through the years.They're easy to assemble, sturdy, stackable, and made in the USA. The handling of the CD's is excellent: the top springs hold the jewel cases in place, yet allow you to easily slide the CD's left and right for sorting and grouping.Bad points? ...well, they're plastic. Although attractive, they might look a bit out of place in a really elegantly finished room. But, if you want CD storage that's both functional and economical, the Allsop CD Organizer is hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Testament Video Review","review":"This CD is a very inspiring CD, with a collection of songs that help a person to feel motivated to seek the LORD JESUS CHRIST for counsil.

If there is a DVD movie from which this soundtrack has been created, I would like to buy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wanted the \\"good\\" ones I remembered from the TV program. Mr Magoo used to go through all kinds of antics, leaving mayem in his wake and then say \\"By George, Mr.Magoo, you've done it again\\" This set is re telling classic stories and basically destroying them. The one on Don Quixote De La Mancha managed to destroy any moral message in it and Dolcenaya and how he lifted her up is not even in there. So, I give it a thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Balladeer","review":"After nearly four decades in the music business, Tom Jones is still popular due to his incredible voice and of course, a variety of intelligent collaborations with younger artists. This compilation traces his career from the sixties in classic songs like It's Not Unusual, What's New Pussycat, the country-tinged Green Green Grass of Home and the melodramatic Delilah, through the seventies in hits like She's A Lady and Daughter Of Darkness, into the eighties with the brilliant Kiss and up to the present with Sex Bomb and the Full Monty Medley. There will always be a place for a big balladeer, and I'd rather have Tom Jones than most of the modern ones. Tom certainly outlived his 60s rival Engelbert Humperdinck! His choice of material has always been great and his voice is perfectly suited to a surprising variety of styles. Besides, there' the nostalgia factor - I grew up to songs like Help Yourself and She's A Lady. This wonderful anthology deserves five stars, through and through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dick Powell, master of tone","review":"I bought this CD some time ago and if it was an album it would have been worn out. Dick isn't the fanciest harp player out there...no tricks or acrobatic licks, but his tone and phrasing is masterful. I've played professionally for years and still learn something every time I listen to this CD. Pay particular attention to his version of \\"Walking Blues\\". The intro solo is one for the ages and it just gets better. He ranks with the great blues harp players and also plays B-3 Hammond.

While the current age of music seems to be stuck in a valley, rather than traversing a peak, this disc reassures us that there may be hope yet, for the future of music. Although the Golden Age of music has, most certainly passed, maybe thre is still another due to emerge. For your own sake, give this one a chance! Most of you will know what I mean when I say that, chances are, this disc will not be a favorite certainly the first, second, and perhaps even the third time you hear it. It will, however, become one of those classic favorites that will never get too old for proper appreciation, much like Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" and Dave Matthews unforgettable first album. This is now threatening to turn into a full-scaled rant, so here, it must end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detestable","review":"Turin Brakes are one of the least personable and characterised and most downright boring bands I have ever come across. One album of their detestable 'new acoustic' sound should be enough for even the most enthusiastic, but somehow they've slipped the cliched, tired-sounding 'Pain Killer' into the top 5 and for everyone who didn't discover them last time round we have an album of the same thing all over again. Barely progressing at all in terms of musical complexity, its one of those albums for those who heard this acoustic stuff was sophisticated and wants it for background muzak. The one half-decent cut is 'Long Distance', but even this is far from interesting. Much acoustic music is beautiful: this is not; it simply sounds like a sonic version of boredom. Steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing to worry about.","review":"Joey Ramone's last recording shows a man who hadn't forgotten his roots, but was willing to build on them. With only one song over 4 minutes long, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME stays true to the spirit of the Ramones sound; however, Joey stretches the concept with some new ideas. While songs like the moronic (I mean that in a good way) \\"Mr. Punchy\\" with its genial mindlessness and the relentless \\"I Got Knocked Down\\" could have fit on a Ramones recording, songs like \\"Maria Bartiromo\\" with its comic focus on the business reporter's ability to make stock reports better by using \\"Those eyes that make everything OK,\\" and the wild cover of \\"What a Wonderful World,\\" make this really Joey's show; not just an attempt to keep the Ramones alive. While it's a shame Joey didn't have the opportunity to follow this up; the anthem \\"Don't Worry about Me,\\" is a fitting end to this CD and Joey's career. While the subject matter is a typical tale of unrequited love, the chorus just makes me smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"i am so glad they released this cd","review":"this is a wonderful release.. full of fun and surprisingly longish (compared to his ramone stuff) songs.. great harmonies.. and that wonderful sense of humor.. and.. oh.. did i mention.. this thing rocks? it is a shame he will never get to tour on this.. i bet some of these would have sounded awesome live..if you are even a slight fan of the ramones.. or.. just a fan of rock.. not the stuff they are calling rock today.. i'm talking old 70s rock.. where the riffs were great.. and the singer actually enjoyed what he was doing.. because he knew what he was doing.. and.. he was GOOD at it.. you owe it to yourself.. trust me.. to get this cd.. you will love itgreat cd.. great songs.. only wish it was longer.. then.."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOEY RAMONE'S LEGACY WILL LAST FOREVER","review":"I'll admit that I had low expectations from Joey's solo album. Wow, was I surprised! This album is a great, straight-ahead rock album, with no ballads and no filler. The musicianship, production, and songwriting are very good. Joey's singing is absolutely beautiful, the best he's done since the Ramones' 1983 album \\"Subterranean Jungle.\\" Several of the songs stand out, and I find myself listening to them over and over - \\"I Got Knocked Down (But I'll Get Up),\\" and \\"Don't Worry About Me,\\" \\"What a Wonderful World, \\"Maria Bartiromo,\\" and \\"Mr. Punchy\\" are also great.

That's really a good thing; the lyrics are more involved and personal. The music is more varied than the straight ahead 1-2-3-4 the Ramones are known for. It all boils down to Joey's singing and it's supreme.His version of Iggy & The Stooges \\"1969\\" is as good as the original.The only flaw is the guitar. Without Johnny Ramones blitzkreig assault, there really needs to be some killer guitar solos to fill the gaps. They're just not here. Andy Shernoff from the Dictators should have recruited \\"Ross The Boss\\" instead of Daniel Rey.A very minor point however and this disc deserves repeated listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant stuff","review":"Another winner from the immensely talented & grossly underratedMs. Bloom IMO. This one is based on her 'reaction' to JacksonPollack, drawing inspiration from his 'paint splattering' by 'sound splattering/surrounding.' But this is not cacophony, if you're worried. It's highly concentrated, intense, often introspective & meaningful interplay among the great ensemble (surely one of jazz's best at the moment), all towering soloist performers/composers in their own right. A bit 'brighter' than say, The RED QUARTETS, & a bit less lyrical than parts of THE NEARNESS, but reflexive, exploratory & brilliant interaction. And JIB's use, but not OVERuse of electronics is brilliant IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birth of the Federation Needs to BE REBORN","review":"What a disappointment! I anticipated beaming onto other ships and mind melds...maybe even a holodeck- at the least great animation...but no. The battle scenes are realistic, fast, and clear, but that is where it ends. Colonization is a still graphic,the races also are not animated. The game is long- the research doesn't seem to make any difference in what you can build- it is very slow moving and uninteresting. It seems like a remake on a lesser level of MOO2.

It feels a lot more like Star Wars: Rebellion than the classic Master games. The ability to choose which race you play is excellent--each race has its look and feel as well as game mechanics. Unfortunately, it gets boring fast. You must micromanage each and every system, ship, tech advance, other races, pretty much everything. Also, once you get a bit ahead, the computer-controlled races have no chance.

I found the need to purchase a second bowl when watermelon came in season.I love the Pyrex containers that have lids. I have a bunch of them. I like being able to cook in Pyrex and then storing leftovers in them in the refrigerator or freezer. They make my life easier.

Laid-back acoustics give way to sparse poetry and an still under-packaged subtlety that had me listening over and over. Their sound is consistent, with new attempts at adding some studio beats to refreshingly rock-solid musicianship. \\"Self Help\\" and \\"Little Brother\\" may not be the released singles, but the (once again) more subtle lyrics Turin Brakes occasionally hits on begin to tell their own stories in these tracks.

True, the star is no Bela Lugosi--but the Spanish Renfield rivals Dwight Frye without ever imitating him.

I ended up skimming the rest of the chapters, past all the 'rolicking' to find some actual literature.I doubt the author has ever read Jane Austin. Reading this book almost put me off Jane Austin altogether. I hope the author doesnt ever do another Jane Austin sequel again. If you are looking for straight porn then hey!! this book is for you!

I really did not know what to expect.While the book does not stay completely true to Austen's style of writing and her characters are not exactly as we found them in her book, the story that Berdoll provides is an interesting interpretation of how things might have turned out for the Darcys. It's best to keep in mind that sequels, like this, are purely for entertainment.Yes, the sex was a little excessive but the overall storyline was engaging and it provided a little more insight as to what these characters might have been like.While this book is certainly not in the same category as Pride And Prejudice, it is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"mis marketed","review":"I bought Mr Darcy takes a wife and though it a great read, very enjoyable.

But if you are a Jane Austen fan and love the story of Darcy and Elizabeth but always wondered what went on in thier heads or behind closed doors. Well then this is the book for you. It takes Jane Austen's classic and gives you so much more. Not only does it have intrigue and gossip but it has loads more of Darcy and Elizabeth which let's face it is really why we read Pride and Prejudice, just to see if they really will get together. I have read other \\"sequels\\" and while they were good this one really gives you everything and sooo much more. If you love thier romance then this book is a MUST have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fairly good continuation of Pride and Prejudice","review":"The author writes a good story, but often goes back and forth in time and repeats parts of the story over.

From the pillow incident in the beginning of this first book to the pillow incident at the end of the second book (Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights And Days At Pemberley), this is an interesting read as a continuation of the smoldering Darcy-Bennet relationship. Others have elaborated mightily on these books so I am only adding my voice into the hubbub.The one caution I would offer is this .. Do NOT read the original publication of this book under the title \\"Bar Sinister\\". It is full of typesetting errors. It was self-published by the author and the typesetting is scandalous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR","review":"and step away from the \\"Purchase\\" button.

How can this book be in the literature section? This is not literature, this is soft-core porn. GRR...I was deceieved. Dear Lord, every sentence was a description of some deviant sex-act.Pride and prejudice is more than a romance novel, it is an examination of human character and society.

Viola! All the characters were made into soap stars and all the exaggerated, unbelievable drama that that entails. Try \\"Excessively Diverted\\" by Juliette Shapiro instead.

At first, I thought the book must be a parody but after some investigation I discovered it was a \\"serious\\" attempt to further the story of Elizabeth and Darcy.

Did the author never read Charlotte Bronte, whom she quotes at the beginning, regarding lack of passion? Passion does not mean stupid sex scenes; good writing uses emotions to portray passion.Did I finish it? Only by skimming here and there and fully getting the story line. I try to give an author every chance to draw me in to their work. However, this book was a waste of time.I don't condone book burning but this one is making me rethink my position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Jane Austen-- rolling over in her grave!","review":"Poor Jane Austen is probably rolling over in her grave because of this book! Imagine the deep crimson of her blush!The explicit and verbose text is more than necessary, and deviates from Miss Austen's light and witty writing style. Some occurances are amusing, but overall the story line is melodramatic and inplausible.The characters either change very little (Jane is still exceedingly good, Lydia and Mrs. Bennet remain half-wits, Wickham is evil, Lady Catherine is condescending etc.) or they change so much that they are hardly recognizable (Bingley and Georgiana characters are changed most dramatically)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A prodigious letdown!","review":"This book was given to me as a gift from my sister-both of us avid Austin fans. I will admit that halfway through this nauseating pseudo-sequel I was unable to finish. This was given to me on my sickbed-unfortunately I found this book adding insult to injury. I use the word pseudo universally-completely inept use of period language, an abhorrent imitation of any and all things Austin! The only possible productive use of this so called \\"work\\" is the recycling bin. I hope Jane never finds out about this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blechhhhhh!!","review":"OK, how many synonyms can you think of for sex organs? Because that is what the author seems obsessed with. I found this book to be very mundane reading, not in sync with Pride and Prejudice. It's like the characters in Pride and Prejudice have shown up in a lame sex guide. I'm not offended by it, I just found it to be too far from Jane Austen's work to be acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"offends the senses and sensibilities","review":"I'm not a purist but honestly- Lizzie beaten and nearly violated, Darcy a murderer, an adulterous Bingley, Georgiana knocked up- it was all too much. Horrifying! This author seems to hate these characters and invents any number of tragedies to fuel the weak plot. I also hated the euphemisms, tired expressions, asides, and parenthetical comments (if I don't know the main points of P&P, I wouldn't be reading the book anyway.) I guess the only saving point is that this Lizzie and Darcy are purely the author's invention and don't resemble the originals at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO NOT ELIZABETH AND DARCY way too much sex","review":"This book is not a continuation of P&P. It has the same characters but instead of reading like P&P it is like the run of the mill romance novel. From page 3 your realize that the author is so off base with the characters and if you can detach yourself from P&P it is a \\"tolerable\\" read lol. I am midway through and am going to finish it but I definitely had to look at the characters as being completely different people than the Bennets, Darcy's, Bingley's etc. The amount of sex fills every third page. In one scene Elizabeth mounts Darcy in their carriage. It is like come on now! One would hope they would have a healthy sex life but the explicit details cheapen the characters, their love and this novel. SO you are forwarned it is not the same people as in P&P and if you can get past that point I guess you can give it a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to swallow","review":"Hard to swallow.And I'm not alluding to one of her enormous pile of euphemisms for sexual body parts.To be fair, I didn't read the whole thing. But, to borrow one of the author's own weird word choices, I was \\"bumfuzzled\\" by reading as much as I did. Note that this is NOT a word that came from Regency English vocabulary. It's a rare one from the U.S. South, and somewhat slangy. (It actually means \\"confused.\\")Perhaps this book is intended to be a parody. That's the only way I could accept it as legitimate. The vocabulary over-use and abuse is so prevalent and the soft-porn such a big part of the writing, I'm not sure how else it can be taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.A. and P&P Used and Abused Extremely Ill","review":"I give this book one star not for its sexual content (that doesn't bother me), poor grammar (I'm no scholar myself), or even its story (not that I enjoyed it), but because the author shamelessly uses Jane Austen's beloved Pride and Prejudice and its characters as a marketing tool for her book.The characters and their actions are so unlike the originals that it turned me off and set me against the story altogether.I can only imagine the author was not confident enough in her work that it could \\"stand\\" on its own without J.A. or P&P; as a \\"crutch.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"New characters disturbing","review":"The early part of this novel coasts on the characters created by Jane Austen. The sex scenes are exaggerated and the language is stilted but sometimes clever. I enjoyed it as a parody of Austen's work. But once the author introduces new elements, the characters are crude and poorly drawn while the plot incidents are increasingly vulgar and violent. One of the new characters is a maid at Pemberley who becomes a prostitute and drinks herself to death. Another is a brutal rapist. A third is a French aristocrat who endures sexual indenture before she escapes the guillotine in a repulsively explicit scene. Darcy himself murders three highwaymen in a fit of rage. None of these characters or incidents follow the sensitivity or genius of JA. Unless you enjoy grand guignol fare, like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you should leave this book alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"My bookclub chose this book, so I am slogging through. I'm about half-way through now and trying to decide whether or not to continue. I agree with the previous reviewers who said the word choice is cringe-inducing, the grammar is off, the plot is not suspenseful, and the characters are boring (of course, things will always turn out well for the well-endowed, handsome, rich hero and his beautiful, charming wife -- blech). There was more romantic tension in P&P, which treated the subject delicately, than in this novel, which pounds you over the head with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's supposed to be a parody, right?","review":"That's the only feasible explanation for this dreadful work. It reminds me of nothing so much as one of those improv shows where the audience calls out styles and the performers end up doing a Western in the style of Chekhov or science fiction as a teen drama. In this case, the author attempts to do Jane Austen in the manner of a bodice ripper, and does justice to neither. The problem is that the author isn't comfortable in either style, so everything sounds stilted and unnatural. If she's not overusing words--when was the last time YOU read/heard \\"howbeit\\"?--she's misusing them. I'm not in the least surprised that this was originally self-published, but I am surprised that a reputable publishing house took it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"not elizabeth, not darcy, definitely not austen","review":"I don't mind the soft-core elements; I don't expect berdoll to \\"nail\\" austen; I do expect readable prose.

The reviews on Amazon were 50/50 so I took a chance.I am not a purist but the over-use of all the \\"heretofores\\" and \\"Henceforths\\" or the colourful descriptions the author uses to describe body parts were laughable. Plus the numerous and mostly not needed bracketed side thoughts (it's like using brackets in place of a comma or a period) were annoying to me.With that said, even the worst attempt at proper Regency era writing should be bearable if there were a story to capture my attention. It did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't do it!","review":"I'm a huge P&P fan and was really excited about reading this book. I read previous reader reviews and was perfectly prepared for the attempted 19th century language and all of the steamy scenes between Elizabeth and Darcy. I was really expecting to enjoy this book, but to put it bluntly - it's boring! There are too many side stories, the book moves VERY slowly and it's just not worth the effort. I'm a big proponent of finishing books even if you're not in love with them, but I had to give this one up. Sorry Linda! I was rooting for your book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I'm generally a fan of 'sequels' and continuations of Ms Austen's work, but this novel is just simply disgusting. It takes away all that is good and fun of Pride and Prejudice and really, feels nothing at all like the Regency period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that would make Jane Austen proud!","review":"At first, I was a little leery of reading a sequel to one of the best classics by a different author. However, I could NOT put this book down. Linda Berdoll keeps the Austenian language alive, with a few modern twists here and there. I simply adored the sexuality and intimacy she gave Darcy and Elizabeth. If you are looking for the best attempt to continue the story and legacy that is Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, then Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife is the book you want. After you read it, you'll immediately buy the next sequel that continues the story by Linda Berdoll, Darcy and Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Not true to the characters, over the top with fake Austen dialog...Read \\"A Civil Campaign\\" By Lois McMaster Bujold if you want some modern day rollicking romance/politicking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I was looking for","review":"I have to say I agree entirely with Linda Berdoll's statement - I watched the BBC miniseries myself and thought it the definitive depiction of Pride and Prejudice. I was so much in need of getting more out of that story that I've read all kinds of retellings and sequels but they were all superficial and lacking. This story, however, truly encompasses all of the passion and love you have come to expect from these characters. I honestly read this book and its sequel seeing the same characters I'd seen in reading Jane Austen's original. But I think some people were disappointed with this book because of its intense intimacy. I on the other hand found it to be consistent with what you would expect from the love the Darcys shared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad for words","review":"This book was just so bad I couldn't finish it.I own over 1000 books ranging from the classics (including P&P;) to downright fluff and chick lit. This book is at the absolute bottom of my list. I've only written one review before, it was for an apallingly poorly written book. This book is even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw the book into the trash - NEGATIVE STARS","review":"I am sorry I paid for this garbage. It was offensive and I threw it into the trash can before finishing it. I would not even give it away! Wish I could rate it five negative stars.The sex scenes were just gross and totally out of what even this permissive age should tolerate. I am too embarrassed even to post some of the most offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent and Inaccurate","review":"The authors knowledge of the movies made of Jane Austens books is vast, but I am highly suspect of her having actually read the books. Read this novel only if you are intrested in seeing the layers of Elizabeth Bennets complex character peeled away only to reveal someone out of a trashy romance novel. The information is inaccurate, starting with Lydia's annual sum of 100 pounds not 50. I read all of Jane Austens novels with ease, the language was not a distraction. This book reads like it was written with an 18th century thesaurus and dictionary at hand trying to cram in as many things as possible in order to appear authentic. At one point there is a narrative sentence that reads, \\" Mr. Wickham was in high dudgeon\\". It was so random, just out there in the middle of the page, screaming, \\"do you remember this from the movie?\\" Writing menus as a chef, I feel I am more qualified to write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sorry i paid for this","review":"But serves me right, listening to random people on the internet rave about a book.So, SPOILER: are you really looking forward to Elizabeth Bennet-Darcy having a miscarriage, then giving birth to a stillborn baby, Mr Darcy commiting triple homicide, Mr Darcy going deaf while fighting the war against Napoleon (!), Georgiana marrying a nearly-blind Col Fitzwilliam (ahem, Napoleon's doing again), Wickham being Mr Darcy's bastard brother, all wrapped in the most repetitious faux-regency language? Cause it's some 600 pages of Civil-War X-rated adventure-romance crap. Say with me: \\"howbeit, betwixt, howbeit, betwixt\\". If it sounds like your style, go for it.My only consolation is, the characters are so *far* from Austen's, there's no chance any sane person will buy this story as being \\"the continuation of P&P;\\". Grrrr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanfic put into binding","review":"I read this book from the local library, on the misguided presumption that it would be a fun romp through a familiar world.A bit too familiar, however, and I ended up skimming through to the bitter end. The prose is annoying, about on the level of a teenager trying to mimic Austen. The sex is worse, approaching the silliness of romance novels without the visceral thrill of ripping bodices. Although, I think that a bodice may have literally been ripped somewhere in there.There is one silver lining to this mess: fanfic writers take heart, Landmark Press is the place to send your manuscripts. Sure, Star Trek, Harry Potter and Boston Legal are all copyrighted, but just change some names and suddenly you have a 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea sequel that will fit in nicely between the shocking 3(!) sequels Berdoll has churned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I am an avid reader, and this is the second time I ever write a review. I have to say that this time I could not resist it. Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite books, and I admire Jane Austin (and her characters) for their sense of class. ''Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife'' however is a cheap porn book that discredits what Jane Austin did and utterly misrepresents the characters. 60% of the content is about sex (cheap sex) and is about Mr. Darcy and Lizzy coupling please forgive me like rabbits (in bed, in the bathtub, in riding boots, without riding boots, and so on).If you are looking for a cheap porn, it could be OK but I believe there are better ones out there. If you are looking for a classy continuation of a great book, certainly look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEWARE!","review":"I, too, looked forward to this book. I had read The Bar Sinister and simply loved it so I thought \\"Aha! Linda Berdoll has written another sequel!\\" Beware! It's the SAME BOOK. Is this legal? Can a writer simply change the title and sell it again? There were no reviews out to warn me. Now you have plenty. If you have not read the Bar Sinister then buy this one. The title and the cover are more intriging, the story is great. I loved the look into the marraige of the Darcy's. Quite passionate as I envisioned them. Also, it explains more why Old Mr. Darcy was so good to the evil-Wickham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice = Romance; Mr. Darcy Takes....= Passion","review":"I loved this book! I found it after watching the BBC/A&E movie version of the Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (you must see the movie - Collin Firth IS the best Darcy imaginable). I so wanted to see the sexual tension between these two amazing characters realized - and this book does it...and does it, and does it. The author is a Texan who was a fan of the book and movie. Her story line and character adaptaptions are a little over-the-top; a more americanized and modern story line in my opinion. I was sad when I was finished reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to Austen","review":"I was sorely disappointed in the base depiction of characters from a classic. Why ruin a good story when there are lots of other cheap novels to write sequels to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I bought this book as a birthday present to myself thinking it would be a wonderful sequel to Pride & Prejudice only to find out how disappointing it was. I was absolutely shocked that this book seems to be so obsessed with sex and although nothing was extremely graphic (at least the part that I read) it is absolutely uncalled for! I believe that Jane Austen would highly disapprove of this book. I disliked it so much that I couldn't even finish it. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book is so bad that it is hard to describe. It does no justice to Austen and her characters. In places, I thought I was reading bad Victorian porn. Truly a hideous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best sequal","review":"I absolutely loved this book. And I already have Berdoll's second sequal on preorder. I totally recommend reading this book if you're hooked on the life of the Darcy family. The writing is humorous and very Jane Austin-like. LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So I'm not Crazy!","review":"Amazon.com recommended this book to me as one I might enjoy based on previous purchases. I was excited to see another P & P sequel and went ahead and bought it. As I was reading this one though I kept thinking I had read it before. The plot was so familiar. I even went so far as to look through my bookshelf, seeing if I owned this book. As far as I knew, I didn't. Interesting to learn that in fact I DO own it, as \\"The Bar Sinister.\\" It's a good book and I enjoyed it - but if I had known I already had it, I certainly wouldn't have purchased it again.I think a little blurb such as \\"Previously published as The Bar Sinister\\" would be a kindness and prevent people from feeling dissapointed.That said, I did enjoy the book very much and eagerly await the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Darcy takes a wife","review":"I was quite annoyed with this book. It was a huge departure from the story of Pride and Prejudice. I expexted this story to follow the gentle narrative of the original, instead, it was a bodice-ripping fest. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Jane Austen","review":"Book long almost 500 pages the original Pride and Prejudice was not this long. Had to reread some pages because I had trouble understanding what was happening I guess because of the way they spoke then. I also thought there was to much sex. I know Darcy and Elizabeth loved each other but almost every chapter has them having sex different ways. Not sure I want to read the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite P&P Sequel","review":"I have read dozens of sequels to Pride and Prejudice and this is my personal favorite. I have read it many times. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this","review":"This book was not bad for a P&P; sequel; in case you couldn't tell by the other reviews, there is LOTS of graphic sex in it. And wouldn't you know, Mr. Darcy has the biggest male appendage in England. I guess the book would have been very different if he was abnormally small...Like I said, not bad. I enjoyed it. But I cannot believe that dear, dear Bingley could EVER cheat on sweet, sweet Jane."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first rule of good writing...","review":"...is \\"Keep It Simple, Stupid!\\" something Jane Austen instinctively understood. There are no overused or unnecessary words in her prose. Her descriptions are always eloquent and elegant, with nothing wasted. Linda Berdoll would have done well to follow her example. I kept thinking of a line from the film \\"Amadeus\\", \\"Too many notes.\\" This book had too many words. I never plowed through so many useless words in my life. I really suspect some of them don't exist. Though the main bulk of the story wasn't bad, the plot got lost along the way, probably in all the sex scenes. Again, even that was way too much! She could have cut out half the verbiage and still told just as much story. There are many good Austen sequels out there, so do yourself a favor and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the crap???","review":"I don't know why this sadist writer would take on a sequel to a love story. I've read the other reviews here and while they are accurate, I overlooked all those faults. What I could not overlook was the daytime soap opera plot. It's completely ridiculous since there was nothing 'soapy' about Austen's works. So Jane and Lydia can squeeze out babies with seeming ease but Elizabeth has to suffer through abduction, attempted rape, miscarriage AND stillbirth. Utterly sadistic and gratuitous. I got this book to read a great love story and instead I got Days of Our Lives: The Regency Years. I can only hope this writer doesn't suffer violence for publishing this garbage. Or maybe she should suffer as much as she made Lizzy suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Is Simply No Redeeming Quality in this Book","review":"You're probably wondering if this book could really be that bad. The answer is yes. It mistakes Austen's lack of description of physical intercourse as meaning that her books lack emotional tension. I would argue that nothing could be farther from the truth. However, even if I were to grant the author her presumption (which she or her editor chose to justify with a quotation from Charlotte Bronte), the preferred remedy would not be to substitute distasteful descriptions not only of the Darcy's wedding night, but of various rapes and other intercourse by other characters.I am not a stranger to romantic fiction. This book had sections that would have seemed coarse if written on a bathroom wall. And as other reviewers have mentioned, it did little to advance the story of Pride & Prejudice since the characters behavied in ways that seemed so contrary to their personalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down..","review":".. and can't wait to read Nights and Days! I'm no Jane Austen expert.. but after having watched the 2005 version of the movie with Kiera Knightly I wanted to see if there were any good sequels about, seeing as I couldn't get my mind off of Mr. Darcy!! This book did not disappoint! It had all the juicy parts you wanted to know about being married to Mr Darcy.. yes, there were sex scenes, so if you're under the age of 18 I wouldn't recommend it... but if you're looking for a juicy P&P sequel with a happy ending (but with drama, mystery and comedy too) then this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Folks, let me admit right off that I didn't make it past the first page, but that was enough. The opening paragraph relates the fact that Elizabeth- our beloved Elizabeth Darcy nee Bennett!- needs to sit upon a cushion, because she is sore from all of the vigorous sex she has been engaging in. Hey, I'm not a prude, but I don't want soft porn populated by characters who are beloved for their very emotional restraint. It's a travesty. Don't give this dreadful author your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought it was fantastic!","review":"i find myself reading this book over and over again, even with other unread books around. i absolutely loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pemberley Polluted","review":"\\"Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\\" Apparently, they are. This is by far THE WORST book I have ever read. I might have been able to express interest in the story line had my better sensibilities not been outraged over the treatment of Jane Austen's original characters. In my mind, Linda Berdoll has DEFILED the characters of both Mr. Darcy and Bingley. The sex between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy can only be described as pornographic. It is disgusting rather than romantic. Bingley, who in the original is so enamored of Jane, has an adulterous affair. It doesn't even make sense. Not only has Berdoll butchered Austen's endearing characters, but she has also butchered the English language. I'm not sure whose style she is trying to imitate, but it is certainly not Austen's. I love to re-read and pass on my books, but this book is destined only for my trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic turned soap opera?","review":"This work can quite easily be explained with just a few mere phrases. Gratuitous, ridiculous, unrealistic sex, more gratuitous ridiculous, unrealistic sex, and then even more gratuitous, ridiculous, unrealistic sex. Oh, and if you can retrieve your eyeballs from where they've rolled to the back of your head after getting through that part, you have to suffer through the most bizarre, twisted, Days-of-our-Lives, soap opera-ish story line (and I use the term \\"story line\\" very advisedly). The characters are ridiculous, the story is ridiculous, the sex is ridiculous. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane's rolling in her grave over this book","review":"I love P & P and was hoping for a continuation. I was also hoping I found it in this book. Wrong! I've owned it for over 2 years and have yet to finish it. In fact, I picked it up the other day and told myself that before I could start another book I had to finish this one (so I can put it on Amazon to sell). I didn't expect erotica disguised as a continuation of a classic novel. I have no problem with erotica. I just didn't need or expect to read about Lizzy & Darcy's intimacy and with such graphic detail. Yeah, he's well endowed and she's got big boobs and learns to go down on him. I wanted a love story, not to learn about what he learned from whores in his days as a single man and in turn teaches her. Shame on you, Linda, for taking a beautiful, classic love story and cheapening it to a dime-store novel. It should come with a yellow highlighter for those willing to read it through to the end. Might just sell it without finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible","review":"I never write reviews but I felt I just had to for this one. I couldn't even finish reading it was so bad! It reads like a horrible bodice ripper. Now I have read my share of romance books and I was willing to just read this as one, but I just could not take it. I have no problem with sex scenes. I actually enjoy them most of the time but honestley-There is constant reference to the size of Darcy's member, how Elizabeth is to small etc etc etc. They are having sex every other page and it was just boring and tedious. On top of that Darcy and Elizabeth's characters are profoundly different. Basically this book was a very big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Puhleeeezee!","review":"I completely agree with M. Mortenson's review. If you're looking for a period romance book with lots of sex and with the plot hidden on a few scant pages, then this is the book for you. I cannot transport Jane Austen's characters of Elizabeth and Darcy into this story no matter how hard I try.What a complete waste of money and paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Darcy Takes A Wife","review":"I thought at first that I would like this book,but there is just to much sex involved.It's taking me way to long to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Darcy Takes a Wife","review":"If you are looking for a P&P sequel, save your money and do not buy this book. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book and I love reading sequels to it. I bought the book when it was titled The Bar Sinister and was very disappointed. Ms Berdoll doesn't remain true to Jane Austen's characters, writing style, or the era in which they lived and the sex in the book is unbelievable. It reads much more like a modern day romance novel and Jane Austen would be horrified. It could be a very good beach read (if you are looking for something trashy) but it doesn't begin to do justice to Pride and Prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad Jane Austen is not around to read this","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. As a Jane Austen fan I was highly offended to see the beloved characters of Darcy and Lizzie used in a poorly disguised romance novel. That is what this book truly is, and if it had been billed as such and used different characters it would have been fine. Not wonderful, but not bad to read if that's what you're in the mood for and you don't have anything else around.My sister commented that it would have been more appropriately titled: Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife Over and Over and Over...."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!!!!","review":"I lost count of the many references to the male sex organ in this book. This is nothing but a cheesy romance gone bad. True to the characters...I don't think so...Mr. Bingley cheats on Jane and has an illegitimate child...please!!! And Darcy and Elizabeth...author didn't really know their characters at all. If I was writing my first book, I don't think I would attempt a sequel to a classic. I was very disappointed in this book. Waste of time and money. Please don't make a sequel mini-series out of this one...like they did with \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" Spare us.Some things are better left alone. Don't mess with a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and fun to read!","review":"This P&P sequel is, by far, one of the most creative ones available. Although true Austen fans might find certain passages of the book to be vulgar (with some explicit details of the sexual liaisons), Linda Berdoll was quite creative in describing the passion between Darcy and Elizabeth. It was fun and amusing to read! The passages about Darcy using an \\"escort service\\" to satisfy his needs were creative... As for the scene in which Darcy actually kills some robbers to protect Elizabeth, I would surmise that murder was less likely of the Darcy character. Nevertheless, it is because of these interesting subplots that make this particular P&P sequel unconventional, creative... and stirs up some controversy and Passion !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I was interested in reading this because I was absolutely in love with the 1995 BBC production featuring Colin Firth. The book starts off slow, but as it grows interesting, the pages fly by. While the author does detour into the lives of people who really have no basis to the story, it really is entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Just Doesn't Get Any Better than This","review":"For those readers who are looking for a sedate little read to accompany their tea and crumpets - you're looking at the wrong book! This story grabs you right out of the starting gate and never lets loose. It's, in turn, romantic, epic, poignant and hilarious. Their is plenty of sex, but of the tastefully erotic sort. You won't want it to end. I can't wait for Berdoll's next installment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The worst book ever written\\"","review":"I am a Pride and Prejudice fanatic, love anything Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I wanted to adore this book. I read all the reviews, good and bad, and decided I would read it with an open mind because I wanted to love it. I gave it a fair shot.As I read this book my eyes were rolling so often I thought they might roll right out of my head! It was horrible! I frequently said out loud \\"this is the worst book ever written\\". I think I said it out loud to wipe out the rude, crude and lewd images of our genteel Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth being slummed by Berdoll.Jane Austen wrote a classy novel about a young couple who have been loved by generations for nearly 200 years. Hopefully THIS Darcy and Elizabeth will quickly fade away. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"The Keira Knightley P&P movie renewed my interest in Jane Austen's marvelous work, so I went shopping and found this sequel, plus its follow-on, to take on a cruise. Try as I might, I couldn't make it through the first few chapters. The author's excuse for focusing on sex, albeit in a hideously distasteful manner, was that if Ms. Austen had married... I left them both on the ship because I cannot bring myself to throw a book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boiling Mad!","review":"I eagerly awaited the arrival of a new P & P sequel, especially from this author whose previous endeavor 'Bar Sinister' I enjoyed. I open the book last night to discover that the book isn't just LIKE Bar Sinister, it IS Bar Sinister.The publisher should have warned us, and told amazon about the change of title. In the meantime, I am returning it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book","review":"What's not to like? You get Lizzie, Darcy and all the assorted P&P characters. You get a story as to what happens after they say \\"I Do\\" and that story is full of action, adventure, regency sensibilities, romance and hot sex. The author puts you in a frame of mind of Austen with her prose and vocabulary and moves the plot along nicely. My only negetive comment is that some chapters seemed fraught with extraneous information that although pertenent to the story were a bit too wordy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the sap","review":"Being a hopeless romantic, this book was perfect for me. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that I'm such a Jane Austen fan and this strays from her type. I was always curious as to how the story might play out if it had a sequel, and this was a great filler. I've recommended to many other Pride & Prejudice fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conflicted!","review":"Having but recently discovered the subgenre of P&P variations, I'm very much enjoying reading all of them that I can lay my hands upon. I was conflicted about how to rate this one, really conflicted. I read it and for the first half of it enjoyed it immensely--as the \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" (or perhaps the \\"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\\") of P&P variations, which is to say it was so exquisitely bad that I came to the conclusion it was intended to be a SPOOF of P&P variations. I laughed so hard my sides hurt. Sadly, after reading the second half, I concluded it was merely very bad writing, period, but gave it two stars in tribute to my initial enjoyment of the ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun beach read...","review":"I'm sure Jane Austen would roll in her grave, but I really liked this. A nice mix of high-brow 19th century language and bawdy supermarket paperback romance novel. All in all - good fun.Darcy is described just as I always imagined - verile, strong, commanding, but in complete adoration of Lizzy. Elizabeth begins the novel as a just plucked flower and grows to be a force of nature, her strength and vulnerability sometimes bringing me to tears. I both longed to be her and thanked heavens I wasn't her, but through it all she rose to every occasion.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys their saucy read with a bit of safistication."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Light District of Pemberley Hall????","review":"I can't ever recall being so heartsick about a book since Anna went under the train outside Moscow. Like many other Austen fans I looked forward to a scenario that would show Mr. Darcy mellowing with the influence of Elizabeth and Elizabeth becoming just a bit less judgemental watching Mr. Darcy's capacity to be truly compassionate. Instead, Ms. Berdoll has given us trash. If your greatest concern was whether or not our young couple slept together, this is your book - unfortunately even that subject is not handled sensitively. It is romping l980s pornography in Regence England. Duh. I want my money back or better yet a pound of flesh. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruining of \\"the best english novel ever written\\"","review":"This piece of trash is no better than some cheap romance novel. I have never been so disgusted in my life. I love all of Jane Austen's works, and was sorely disappointed with this filth. How on earth did someone let a hick from Texas write a sequel to an 18th century masterpiece? It was obvious that the woman didn't even read the novel and only watched the movie. It pained me to read it, and I desire my money back. What a waste of three hours. If any educated person desires a fulfiling, and challenging novel, do not look here for enlightened thinking. The complete lack of elegant and well organized prose is nothing like Jane Austen's educated writings. If one loves the writing of Jane Austen, for its undercurrents of satire and wit, then do not look here to quench your literary thirst."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyably raunchy","review":"I know this is not the kind of book Jane Austin would have written but I had a great time reading it.I haven't read a book in a long time that I tried to read any minute I could spare.Thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife\\" - The Library term is 'trash'.","review":"As a lover of English literature, I found this book offensive.

Jane Austen must be spinning in her grave!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen would be ashamed","review":"I don't think anything more needs to be said.

It should be against the law to turn classic literature into romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"I loved this sequel! It made me laugh and cry. And at some points I was angry. It is not Jane Austen, but it is true to the characters and is very exciting. Although I have seen a few reviews that dislike it, I love that Darcy is very ....verile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wost Jane Austen \\"fan fic\\" I've ever read.","review":"I couldn't even finish this book, which takes a lot for me. I got about a third of the way through, skipped a couple hundred pages to see if it got any better, but only discovered it got worse and gave up. A love scene should not make you cringe and that is what many of the love scenes in this book had me doing. There were points where I actually said \\"Ugh!\\" outloud in reaction to what I read. The book is also very poorly written and I found all too often that I couldn't understand a word of what I was reading. I can't believe I wasted my money on this book, when I can read better fan fic on the internet for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?!?","review":"Ok...this book is definetely NOT for those who adore Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice...for starters, although the author DID research P&P, she obviously did NOT pay attention to details such as the first name of Col. Fitzwilliam. There are some funny scenes in this book worth reading, but overall, quite a dull read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth","review":"Although they have the same names, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy mentioned in this book are in no way, shape or form to Pride & Prejudice's Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy! In fact, all the characters are totally unrecognizable. These two are constantly sending mixed signals instead of telling the other what they're thinking (as Elizabeth would certainly do). It's a very frustating book, and futhermore, the writer (this is her first book, and hopefully her last) tries to sound smart and funny. The jokes are stupid and predictable, and she continually uses large and difficult words (about 5 on each page) that I've never seen or heard of before. I got tired of looking them up in the dictionary. I finally had to give the book up 1/3 way through because I couldn't stand it anymore. The author obviously didn't understand how the characters thought and acted in P&P and made up her own version of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book assassinates Jane Austen's beautifully written characters and turns her wonderful story into ridiculous garbage. I agree with one of the earlier reviewers who expressed a desire to erase the whole book from memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Wowsers, this book is atrocious. Suffice it to say, the author likely has never read Jane Austen. She probably watched the BBC version of P&P;, fell in love with Darcy, decided to write some fan fiction, and ended up with this book. At least it would explain the author's misplelling of Ms Bennet's name and her confusing the characters and story line.It would also explain why the writing is so bad. No wit, nothing of interest... just modern day sentences that have less-used synonyms swapped out here and there. And a pathetic storyline and dialogue. really. I stopped after the first few chapters.I had read the reviews of this book and I knew not to expect much, especially compared to Austen's original... but oh em gee. This book is garbage even compared to my 15 year old brother's novel about a futuristic world war III with mutants and tons and tons of 15-year-old-boy-esque gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"A sad portrayal of the timeless characters of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. The book was poorly written, and the way the author describes the couple makes the reader feel like they are reading a soap opera instead of a classic piece of literature. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!!","review":"Do not waste your money on this book. One would need a huge dictionary to get through it. I only managed a couple of chapters before abandoning ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Substitute For Jane","review":"I read this book the first time and was dismayed and disappointed by it's story line and direction Ms.Berdoll took the characters. I read it a second time with an open mind hoping that I would find it more fulfilling the second time around. I was disappointed. This is a juvenile attempt at an addition to a classic. It didn't follow Ms.Austen's ideas of the characters, and a poor version of what I'm guessing was the authors attempt at erotica with her sex scenes. Either keep true to the characters or let well enough alone and stop with the original. Love Jane Austen, hated this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera and Sex","review":"I was disappointed in the style of this book. The author used soap-opera type plot devices and excessive sexual antics rather than character development to continue the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Berdoll Takes Artistic License","review":"In \\"Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife\\", the \\"sequel\\" to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", the saga continues with all your favorite characters from Jane Austen's original novel. The story begins after the engagement, but before the wedding of Elizabeth Bennett to FitzWilliam Darcy and Jane Bennett to Charles Bingley. While the novel follows the style of the original, be prepared for constant and specific descriptions (ad nauseum) of Mr. Darcy's member and his connubial relations with Elizabeth. Elizabeth can't seem to go five minutes without her husband. There are also bastard sons galore peppered throughout this story. The characters are certainly darker and less virtuous than in the original and one can only wonder if Miss Austen would be horrified. The author's projection of Miss Austen's story is interesting, almost gossipy in places. But remember that this is a speculation of how the story might end should Miss Austen have written it so."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is fun!","review":"Surprised myself by really enjoying this book!It often seems to be about to go down the path of a corny romance novel, but it doesn't!It keeps up with an enhanced version of Jane Austen's original characters while introducing new ones to keep the story progressing. I ended up very impressed and wanting to know more of what happens next. I was so impressed, in fact, that I also picked up the next one, Elizabeth and Darcy. It's not as much fun as this one, but still very good, and I did not regret it at all. Reviews say that it's all sex, but it's not ALL sex. But, the passionate scenes are good!Darcy is still awesome! Actually, he's even more honorable in these sequels than the original. And at the same time, more flawed, which is refreshing and makes him all the more real to the reader.Good show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Howbeit for some interesting ideas, this adaptation pains me betwixt the ears.","review":"Berdoll has some interesting ideas, but the liberties that she takes with the characters are just too hard for me to accept. Plus, where was her editor? The liberal sprinklings of \\"Howbeit\\" and \\"betwixt\\" made me feel as if I ought to start playing a drinking game while reading this book.I also feel that the descriptions of the seedier side of Regency England were too jarring - Austen tended to write what she knew - it's rather unlikely she would have ventured into the ragamuffin world of prostitutes and stable-boys, or even write from the perspective of the servants or the poor.Still, I am not sure I could write any better. Everybody's a critic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to put down...easier to walk away from!","review":"This is a truly awful book! I like a good racy novel as well as the next woman, but this is downright tasteless and silly. I never like to put down a book and walk away, but this time I will make an exception. The time it would take to finish this novel are hours in my life I will never get back. The publisher should be ashamed to put their imprint on this piece of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A continuation of Pride and Prejudice???","review":"I gave this book one star only because I couldn't give it less. Jane Austin must be turning over in her grave. To recommend this book to people who enjoyed Pride and Prejudice is ridiculous!

If you like Jane Austin, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Library Notice","review":"from pony_express:\\"Thank heaven I checked this out of the library.\\"Had I only been as lucky - having read all of Jane Austen's novels many times I never once wanted to know about the sexual life of her characters, nor did Jane Austen feel that it was neccessary I know.If you want to read this sequel, make use of your library and save your money -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Great characters are hard to create. When commenting on her own books, Jane Austen once said that the best authors are those who write what they know. In Austen's case, she was familiar with the drawing rooms and gardens of early 18th Century England. Consequently, her lovely characters, with their restrained dialogue and propriety, take the reader into their world. In her book, Ms. Berdoll did not succeed in poking fun at Austen's work, rather she simply showed the world how little she herself understood England in the 18th Century. Perhaps Ms. Berdoll should take Austen's advice and written only about what she knows---Texas in the 21st Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but trash","review":"The story line is this: sex, argument, sex, sex,sex,sex, argument, sex,sex,sex, sex, disagreement, sex,sex, sex, visit with disgraceful family, sex, sex, sex, unbelievable disaster, sex, sex, sex, visit with sister who admits passionless marriage(why do all the sequels assume this?) sex, sex, sex.This was basically literary porn. I hated it and wish I could forget every word I read. some books you can even skip the sex scenes and get a story but here there was no story. You don't have to write sex scenes to get passion in a book... I think this author would do well to take lessons from Jane Austen on just how to do that. This book was nothing but trash and that is exactly where I put it. If you want a good story don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not jane austen","review":"i found this book to be about nothing except sex! the characters weren't even similar to jane austens except in name only. as far as charles bingley having an affair you could tell from reading p&p that mr bingley was devoted to jane bennett!!and as for mr darcy's sister climbing aboard a man that is too silly for words even if that man was her cousin who is 10 -15 years older than her.someone she grew up with like a brother. in p&p she was shy, reserved, and shaken up over the wickham affair, it's hard to believe that she could do that!! the book is well written, but the characters personalities are far different to the ones jane austen wrote about. it is a good story in itself, but i found it hard to relate the characters from this book to jane austen's, and found the ending silly. after reading over 400 pages to find it ends with wickham singing in the desert was enough to pull my hair out.all in all a good read, but no continuation of P&P!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Being a Jane Austen fan and an avid reader in general, I looked forward to reading this sequel. However, I was only 50 or so pages into it when I closed the book and returned it to the library. I was completely put off by the constant, overly descriptive, animal-like sex between the Darcys; I was annoyed by the dramatics (a man hiding in the woods lusting after Elizabeth?); I scoffed at the extreme portrayals of each character (Elizabeth is COMPLETELY sex-crazed, Jane is COMPLETELY prudish, Darcy thinks ONLY of Elizabeth). Finally, the language, in trying to be true to Austen, simply came off as complicated and tedious. This novel is coarse and undignified, nothing more than a cheap romance novel.If you want more in the Pride & Prejudice vein, I recommend Pamela Aidan's books. They are interesting, better written, and have insightful character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should never have been published.","review":"The whole book reads as if the ridiculous character of Lydia Bennett were to write a book. The ego on this person to have believed she was capable of writing a sequel to anything written by Jane Austen. This \\"novel\\" is a complete joke. The author apparently never read or comprehended the original Pride & Prejudice, and had not a clue what the characters were about."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the kind of book that gives pornography a bad name","review":"If the writer wanted to create a bodice-ripping pastiche, why pick on poor Jane Austen? Why not Mrs. Gaskell or Wilkie Collins, someone whose prose was bad to begin with, where sexy updates could only be an improvement? Although, to be sure, the sexy updates would have to be a great deal less dreary than this sad attempt at erotica."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to Austen","review":"I bought this book thinking it might be an enjoyable Austen style read. What I got was a trashy romance novel that destroyed the characters Austen had created. Berdoll turned Mr. Darcy in to someone in the ranks of Wickham or lower. She shattered the classy world of Austen and replaced it with a brothel! If you want a read that is true to Austen's style I would highly recomend Sanditon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the frecking heck???","review":"This is possibly one of the most disgusting travesty of literature I have ever read. Berdoll takes the immortal work of Jane Austen-with all her wit, and folds and gentle cynicsm, and turns the book into a badly phrased, sex romp, with descirptions that scream \\"look at me! I'm trying to sound as fake as possible, but still make you think that your in the time of Jane Austen!\\" I'm rather liberal in many senses, but (and think what you will of this), i think there are some things- some CLASSICS that just NEVER should be touched. I admire the obvious sencerity that this author has as she consturced this ridiculous work, but these books are just awful. Even if she wasn't adapting a classic, you are still left with a poorly constructed trashy novel, with oddly unreaslistic characters which are hard to sympathize with, which is little more then brain candy- it might taste good but it'll make you brain rot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid! (with a brittish accent)","review":"I thought other people's negative reviews were just from Jane Austen purists so they would be hard to please. I was wrong. From the first two chapters, I couldn't stand it anymore and I returned it back to the store. I really hope that a better author would write a continuation just to negate this one to save the characters...yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad","review":"I love Jane Austen's novels, but this author is no Jane Austen.. As a Georgette Heyer devotee, too, and an English major who concentrated in 18th and 19th century women's literature, I am not daunted by archaic language, but this novel reads as if the author tried to make every statement as convoluted, complex and arcain as possible, even using words out of context just to make a sentance as \\"18th centuryesque\\" as possible.Really, I'd rather have a tooth pulled than read in graphic detail about the size of Darcy's unit or the soreness of Lizzie's girly bits. I mean, come on already! The love between them is depicted as more laughable cinemax-style soft core than passionate and heart wrenching.Really, there's nothing of Austen's original Pride and Prejudice here, just an abomination with characters bearing the same names."},{"rating":"1","title":"no true continuation at all","review":"This book takes the great character study of Pride and Prejudice, with all its true romance and angst and resolution and turns it into a very very bad soap opera.Instead of romance, we have clinically explicit erotica. Instead of tension based on misjudged character, we have attempted rape and murder.Neither Darcy nor Elizabeth are true to their original portrayals, and the writing tries too hard to mimic period writing.Got this from the library; wish I hadn't. Fanfic is better.(*)>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Darcy's Disaster","review":"I love the novel Pride and Prejudice and have read it so many times I can recite passages by heart. I also love the film versions, particularly the BBC version from years ago and the more recent A & E version, so I was intrigued by the idea of reading a continuing story.I could not have been more disappointed!This novel has absolutely no connection to Pride and Prejudice other than the names of the characters and the Darcy's home. It was a combination of a trashy romance novel and a snapshot of history, but with no plausible story. Nothing to care about, no real character development, no real story, no plot development - it was a vain attempt to use the names of Jane Austen's characters in a series of unrelated disasters that just seemed ridiculous.I considered this purchase to be a waste of money and I'm disappointed in myself for buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tree died for this?","review":"I think I will try to find the poor grove of trees that were destroyed in order to create the paper on which this miserable tome was printed. And then I'll have to find out if charges can be filed for violating every known cliche and euphemism for romance writing.Berdoll has written a wretched piece of fiction which is little more than soft porn posing as historic fiction. It's not that the subject matter is so offending; rather, it is that it is written so dreadfully! I should think that a writer who attempts to continue a piece originally written in the Regency period wouldn't be using language usually associated with hackneyed Victorian romances. Perhaps she was attempting to write erotica -- I'm not sure because even the love scenes were plodding enumerations of function rather than feeling.Do not purchase this book unless you really enjoy tedious and trashy pulp fiction, in which case I wish you all happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen is Rolling in Her Grave","review":"This book was so awful I could not even bear to finish it. The pathetic attempt to use the language of Austen's era comes off sounding like someone sat with an old English dictionary and just randomly chose sophisticated sounding words to use. Utterly ridulous book that taints the beauty of the original novel. I would not buy this book! Just read Austen's original novels or re-read them - anything is better than this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers, Be Ye Warned","review":"Possibly the worst book I have ever read, this is a bloated and grotesque representative of awful fanzine writing whose publication is as much a mystery as the construction of Stonehenge. I almost abandoned this enterprise on a number of occasions, but then it became a point of honor to complete it. Its only merit (and I use that term loosely) is that is serves as an example of how not to write, but 465 pages of such illustration (yes, I kept checking) is unforgivable. Ghastly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, overly long, waste of print and paper","review":"I picked up this book looking for some light fare to read while on maternity leave. Since others in this space have more than adequately enumerated this book's many, many shortcomings, I'll only say that I agree that this is a waste of money and will be a real disappointment not only to Jane Austen fans, but to all readers who enjoy a believable romance or a tightly conceived and written plot.

Still, my heart was set on finding something that gave me a different perspective on my favorite story. This novel really hit the spot for me. While the writing may be too stylized and campy and the cast of other characters sometimes takes over the novel, I absolutely ADORED every scene between literature's favorite couple, Darcy and Lizzy. They were intimate, funny and made me think about them in a whole new light. As this was clearly meant to be a romance novel, the sex scenes were rather expected, and they did indeed sizzle. Overall, I couldn't put this book down and highly recommend it for anyone daring enough to dive into something new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"This book left me speechless and not in a good way.

I know s e x wasn't invented in the 1960's.However, the book was badly written IMO. Key conflict points came out of nowhere, with no foundation laid for them. Traumatic turns of events like the revelations about Jane and Bingley need to be laid out gradually, with hints dropped for the reader to pick up on so that when the truth is revealed, it doesn't feel like an assault on the reader.I see the author has taken to posting replies to the negative reviews. Very unprofessional, also IMO. Haven't you heard that one of the reasons readers read is to get to know the author better? You're not making me eager to read another book from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Me Wanting More!!!","review":"I loved Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife: Pride and Prejudice Continues! I will admit, it was a bit of a slow read because it's written in the old, \\"flowery\\" English similar to Jane Austen's era, but nonetheless, I found it stimulating and difficult to put down. If you've read the book's synopsis and/or any of the reviews, I obviously don't have to explain what the book is about. I loved every steamy love scene between Darcy and Lizzy! This book was full of mystery, humor & romance and if you've ever been in any kind of family relationship, you'll find moments you can relate to. The story did drag a bit towards the end when Darcy has to leave (don't want to give anything away here) for a while, but I was still riveted! I cannot wait to read the next book in this series! Keep up the GREAT work, Ms. Berdoll!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing under either title","review":"This book was originally before under the title \\"The Bar Sinister.\\" It is quite disappointing under any name. Darcy has a complete change of character to a libidinous libertine with a wild past. The plot is dark, and contradicts the last few paragraphs of Austen's novel with its description of a slightly looser Darcy and a happy marriage. I have yet to see a \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" sequel (I've read them all) in which Darcy does not have a complete character change, but this is the most extreme and the most disappointing version of the married Darcy and Elizabeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"MR DARCY TAKES A WIFE WOW!!

Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sequel","review":"I'm not sure why people seem to dislike this book so much. I've read both of berdoll's sequels multiple times. They're humorous and well-written. It's a pretty good effort to write like Austen. No one can get it perfect, but she did have the advantage of writing about her own time period, so cut these authors a little slack. I actually think Austen would enjoy the slightly scandelous sequel. Lizzy is still independent but shows an expected naivety about sex that I would expect from an unmarried woman in her time. I think her continuation of lydia's storyline was spot on. There were a few things I didn't care for regarding mr. Bingley, but there had to be some new storyline or it would be too fluffy. She does a nice job showing both the pleasant and not so pleasant parts of lizzy's new life as mistress of pemberley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read if you respect the characters","review":"I enjoy Austen fan fiction. Heck, I even enjoy a good bodice ripper from time to time. And I was enjoying this combo for the first 22% of the book - even if they did have more sex than porn stars. There were even a few moments of genuine humor that made me smile. However, Darcy says something so crude before the ball at Pemberley that made me put the book aside. It's one thing to continue the Darcy's lives, including a few love scenes, but really? Was the vulgarity necessary?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put this down","review":"I waded into this sequel as an avowed Pride and Prejudice fan from high school--when even the boys in my class enjoyed the intrigue of the book! Ms. Berdoll gives you everything you want to know about how Lizzy and Darcy fared after the wedding. I really like that she shows that it's not all perfect from the get-go and, like real marriages, communication is the key to happiness with each other. Of course, having a rich, handsome husband who dotes on you in and out of the bedroom doesn't hurt a marriage either!I devoured this book in only a couple sittings.

It was so bad that I couldn't get past the first fifty pages and it's quite possibly the worst book I've ever attempted to read!

I am an avid believer in finishing books you start and I didn't even make it through 100 pgs before putting it on the shelf. This book turns Darcy and Lizzy into merely sexual fiends and downplays the romance and love that Jane Austen embued. It was raunchy enough to make me uncomfortable and there were things done that any true lover of Pride and Prejudice would never care to think of their beloved Darcy doing.

I am not sure that all the additional information of trivial characters is to my liking but it is tollerable. WOW ! what can I say. Elizabeth and Darcy enjoy each other often and I do enjoy reading about the romance and physical attatchment they have. How Mr. Darcy is strong and commanding, confident and yet always careful to love and be affectionate with Elizabeth. The abduction scence is powerful as is the fall out of it.

The graphic sexual descriptions left nothing to the imagination, and the characters' inability to control themselves makes them seem moronic and juvenie, not passionate. I could have passed on the description of how the blood-spattered sheet from Darcy and Elizabeth's wedding night ended up displayed in a local inn. (This is supposed to be romantic?)

It's definitely a knee-slapper! The plot is contrived and silly, and the author apparently thinks that starting every other sentence with the word \\"Pray\\" makes her sound like Austen. The prose is completely overwrought, the author substitutes endless parenthetical descriptions for actual exposition, and though I do tip my hat to her never ending well of euphamisms for the sex act and organs, the boot-knocking got to be a bit much after a while. I agree with others--this is essentially very smutty fanfiction. A fun diversion, perhaps, but could never seriously considered in the same league as the original work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"If you are a true Jane Austen fan, this is a must avoid. It seems to be nothing but a cheap, pornographic romance novel trying to disguise itself as literature. It would satisfy the intellect of an adolescent 15yr. old boy reading it in the bushes and snickering with his friends. I only got to about page 25,had enough, and removed it from my Kindle. The author states that since Jane Austen was never married she could not know or understand sex or the intimacy of true love. I'm not sure the author does either.I am thankful that Amazon has the sample option for it's books and that I didn't waste any money on this.There are better sequels to P & P out there. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful and Contrived","review":"Flat characterizations very, very loosely based on Austen's novel, and lots of very silly, contrived bedroom scenes. I can't even be bothered to write a proper review for this one. Suffice to say it is dull, out of character, and very ridiculous. The only thing it has in common with P&P is the character names. Quite unworthy to be called a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy romance novel","review":"Why ruin a perfectly good story? You know, sequels are never as interesting as the original. This story and its characters belonged to Jane Austen, who knew and understood life in that time period expecially everyday life for women. She lived it! She didn't have the privilege to use \\"sex fillers\\" in a book . It would have bee considered totally inappropriate, and would have never been published."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of God, no more Latin","review":"I'm pretty young to be reading this book, I guess - I'm 16. But I loved Pride and Prejudice, and I was sorely missing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy that when I saw this book, I picked it up and consequently could not put it down. Sometimes I felt as though Berdoll had her thesaurus and Latin translator in hand as she wrote this book, which made me frown more often than not as I read it. The language did not take too much away from the story itself, however.Be warned - the book is light reading. It is emotional to the point of television drama. If you're looking for something intellectually stimulating and to pick your brain apart with, then this is not for you. It is PURE entertainment. That is not to say I did not enjoy it. I did, immensely. But I do wish that Berdoll would stop trying to appear to have a large vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"(sigh)","review":"Where do I start? I really wanted to like this book.... really. But my oh my. I don't recognize this iteration of Lizzie from Lizzie in P&P.; And I'm only on page 154.Am very sorry that I started this book. It made me doubt why I loved the original characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Drama Than Austen Would Have Ever Used--but good","review":"I'm a little shocked that anyone would describe this book as 'sophmoric' since I found it more along the lines of \\"Gone With The Wind\\". Take Austen's style and add sex and high drama. All intimacy is handled under enough flowery vocabulary to assure the reader has to check twice to understand what really happened!! It was quite a ride and certainly a romp by the time I got through this book but I have to say it made me laugh outloud in various places. It was also extremely poignant and sad. This story will be hard to stomach for any true Austen-ite but it's a good read. Her attention to detail is phenomenal and she breathes more life into the characters than I found in Austen's book. (sacrilige, I know!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft core porn -- and irritating stylistic flourishes","review":"I give up. I've slogged through most of Mr. Darcy Takes A Wife (and those ghastly Pamela Aidan travesties, full of typos and grammatical errors) and I'm stopping now. This is just the limit. Cheesy softcore porn, embellished with annoying stylistic affections such as \\"compleat.\\" And bad Latin (it's \\"virgo intacta\\"). At least Berdoll used a (slightly) better copy editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While I enjoyed being able to read more about the love between Mr. Darcy and Lizzy, I didn't enjoy the extremely dark paths that they were faced with on occasion. Very verbose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash","review":"This book was an absolutely embarrassing read! The characters were mutilated and only cared to gratify their sexual urges. The dialogue was comically pathetic, some characters sounded like misplaced pirates that unrealistically were weaved into the plot. (Well if you can call a plot).I thought it was amusing that the writer had researched the original work for four years prior to writing this pile of cow plop, because the book felt like it was churned out in a few weeks. Oh it was horrible.The only reason I am giving one star was because they did not have the option to give it a big fat turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked and Grieved","review":"I am shocked, shocked and grieved, that anyone thinks this book is anything like what Jane Austen would have written. No Romance.No Humor. I read the first three chapters and became some what ill, skim read up to chapter 30, and stopped. I then remembered what a friend once told me.\\"Life is to short to read a bad book.\\" This book is so bad I think it is a waste of paper. Ms.Austen is dizzy from spinning. I am so glad I checked it out from a library and spent no money on this book. I will not even look at her(?) next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun escape","review":"I was expecting the usual stilted English novel with the unmarried girl hoping a rich suitor would happen along and accept her sweet little blushing self into his sprawling estate. This novel was none of that. It was a fun, fast moving, fictional (remember?) read. I had a hard time putting it down. I wasn't looking for a Jane Austen actual continuation. There are a ton of those on the market. You don't have to be a literature expert to enjoy this book. Think of it as a stand alone book....witty, twisting and turning and most fun. Enjoy it. I love literature of any kind and all types of novels. So many times I have read an English classic and thought of what it would be like if the woman in the book would just speak up and let her all knowing husband that she has a brain and a sense of humor. Elizabeth, in this novel does that. Also I don't waste my time critiquing the language. I can get over that. Worth the read if you can get over yourself as a Jane Austen \\"expert.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sex scenes, but other then that meh","review":"Got it at a used book store. It was an ok book, no need to read it again. If you are looking to take a book to the beach, this might be good for for this, but I doubt anyone will read it more then once."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read 40 pages of this tripe. . .","review":". . .and then I gave up. Yikes! I can't remember the last time I read something so bad. Any story that you make up in your own mind about Darcy & Elizabeth's married life will be 100% better than this. Linda Berdoll is probably laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross.","review":"I see disasters like this book all the time on the Internet. It's called fanfiction. Do no waste your money on this book when you can surf the net (for free) for smutfics written just as badly by teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd read the reviews before I picked up the book","review":"I saw this book at the used bookstore a week or so ago and as a Pride & Prejudice fan, thought it would be fun to read. Oh how I wish that I had read these reviews before buying because it is a dreadful book. Dull, slow, cheap trash, just one of the worst books I've ever tried to read . I'm usually one who finishes a book no matter how terrible, but I'm not so sure I can keep dragging through this one. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a folly...indeed!!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Yet as I will read anything related to Pride and Prejudice and I cannot get enough,I finished it. Although many a mind wanders as what their intimate life was like, this was much to rough and left nothing to the imagination. I think my imagination did a better job than this book has of their intimate relationship and was much more sensual. Hey maybe I'll write a sex-quel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raunchy and Redundant","review":"This silly romance novel bears no relationship to Jane Austen's work or her characters. Obviously, it is difficult for anyone to capture Austen's witty style and her keen sence for social drama. However the author of this ah, book lacks both sense and sensibility (pray there is no sequel to that).I recommend this book only to those who enjoy dull romance novels with plenty of sex, and no similarities (beyond their names) to Austen's fresh, original creations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virility in the description..well I guess that sets the tone","review":"I just felt this was way beyond what is in good taste. I felt like several others who said why waste the money or the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Jane Austen book","review":"Purchased this item to see how the author would carry on Jane Austen wonder work... What I got a reallllly bad soap opera, with lots of drama and sex, yes sex...not at all what I was expecting....Takes the characters and totally changes their personalities adds stories and characters that don't seem to fit and way too many story lines... didn't finish it couldn't keep up with the multiply changes and got a bit disgusted with all the ups and downs of Mr & Mrs Darcy... do not recommend it at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY AWEFUL!!!","review":"If I had a dollar for everytime the author used \\"betwixt\\" instead of between I'd be a millionaire.It was so annoying.I am totally disappointed in this book.In fact I didn't make it through chapter 3 before I put it down.The spirit of the characters were lost and as one reviewer said some of the behaviors and things said by Elizabeth and Darcy I couldn't imagine them saying it.And to have Bingley have an affair on Jane, I don't believe that would have ever had happened. If he was as much in love with her as the original story portrays he never would have ventured outside their marriage.In fact I was so confused when I first started this book. I thought the author was going to start off AFTER the marriage, but she didn't. She started the story prior to them getting married which threw me totally off and left me uninterested at the start.CAN I GET MY MONEY BACK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Being a sucker for Pride & Prejudice, I had high hopes about this book. But after I began reading, it quickly reminded me to ALWAYS check reviews. The book was absolutely disgusting, I felt like I had to take a shower. The Mr. Darcy portrayed makes Mr. Wickham seem like a gentlemen. I was so sickened by this book, that I stopped reading halfway and returned it back to the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Despicable Sequel","review":"So much of the romance of the original novel is that it leaves much to the imagination. This sequel certainly does not. This book is nothing more than literary porn disguised as a sequel to a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't know...","review":"First of all, I like P&P;, but love Persuasion. I purchased this book thinking it would be in a similar vein as P&P;, but continuing on with their new life together. The first thing I was assaulted with was Elizabeth feeling sore from her first married night. Right then, I put it down and didn't pick it up for months! If there's ever such a thing as too much information, that is it. (I've read tons of romance novels, not just Georgette Heyer, but the real bodice rippers so I'm no prude.)The writing is so-so, but there is an excessive use of large words that is just not needed. If the writing is good, large words aren't needed and just pisses of the reader. Jane Austen didn't write like that. Also, all the terms to refer to body parts was far too romance-novely for me. Just got to the period part and ICK. Not sure if I'll bother reading more.I've read the JA mysteries and thought they were fun. This, however, is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money...","review":"If you are even remotely interested in this book, check it out of the library. I began reading last night and echo the sentiments in others' disappointed reviews. I found myself skimming pages to find the plot...annoyed that I spent limited after-the-kids-are-in-bed reading time on a trash novel billed as a sequel with \\"rich character development\\". If you are an Austen fan, steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know whether to be throw up or cry","review":"This is terrible. I was so excited when I found this book; I never expected it to live up to P&P, but to call this a sequel is false advertising. The characters are not the same people. This is really soft-core porn wrapped up in a regency-era package. The plot is really nothing more than a vehicle to move you from one sexual encounter to the next. Additionally, the author's writing style is terrible. I've never read anything quite so pretentious and insipid. Don't waste you time or money, unless you want a few cheap thrills and a few moments that are downright gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted!!","review":"I found the content hard to muddle through and was quite disgusted with each liason between Darcy and Elizabeth. This is nothing more that soft porn. God forbid that my teenage daughters get a hold of this. Besides it was a bit much to assume that their marriage would continue to have such \\"coitus\\" after several years and two children (book 2). I felt like they were in the \\"honeymoon\\" stage of marriage through the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissappointment!","review":"I am a huge Jane Austen fan, and was so excited to come upon this book in the bookstore the other day hoping for a great read. This author turned a beautiful story based on moral, pride, and principles, and turned it into a dime-store trashy romance novel. I read several chapters before putting it down and taking it back to the bookstore. I had hoped that after 20 or so pages that there would be some real substance in the writing and just not a continuation of graphic details that maligned the characters of the original story...and I was wrong. Apparently this author knew that \\"sex\\" would sell, and maybe she has a different set of readers she is intending to write for that want this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same character names, no other relationship to Jane Austen's work","review":"This author should have given her characters new names, instead of stealing those from Jane Austen's work, because this novel is in no way a sequel to Pride and Prejudice.The whole style is so different from Jane Austen's, that it is bizarre to consider this a sequel. Anyone pretending to write a sequel to another author' work (without that author's permission) should at least make some attempts to learn what that author had stated about the future lives of those characters, and this author clearly has not. She ignores everything the author said about her characters, both in the original work, and later statements about future developments, and creates completely new personalities, with the old characters' names.This is just the sort of melodramatic type of story that Jane Austen would mock. She must be rolling over in her grave, to have her beloved creations co-opted in such a fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too trashy...","review":"The beginning of this novel reads like a trashy romance; the author spends too much time on the details of the Darcy's intimacy. The story overall is not true to the characters, making Elizabeth way too fragile, and Bingley way too clumsy and then too permiscuous. The story may have been interesting had it not been a sequel to P&P, using these characters. I would not recommend it if you are looking to continue the P&P story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome and oversexed","review":"I think the desire to continue the Darcy-Elizabeth romance, and yes, consummate it, is understandable. And since I bought the book, I obviously wanted to read something like this. But ultimately, this book left me flat and I stopped reading it. Sort of a bad bodice ripper with WAAAY too much sex. Not because it's offensive and I'm a prude, but the reason we cared so much about Elizabeth and Darcy was their wit, their chemistry...their longing and sparring. And somehow, reducing them to two energetic sex puppies is just a bit much. Not romantic, just trashy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Loved It!!!","review":"This is probably my favorite of all Pride and Prejudice sequels. Unlike many poor sequels, Berdoll recognizes the futility of creating an exact replica of Austen's masterpiece. Frankly, it simply can not be done. Instead, Berdoll takes these much loved characters into a different direction by exploring the passionate realm of their relationship. Moreover, her plot, while at times extremely far fetched (hence the 4 star rating), is vastly entertaining. I should warn all devout Austen fans that this book is not comepletely loyal to the original. So treat this book as an individual, not a sequel, and in the process, it will become a favorite read on its own merit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lizzy does Longbourne","review":"Wouldn't you like to revisit Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and the complex characters therein? Well, so would I but unfortunately I read \\"Mr. Darcy Takes A Wife.\\" The author of this downright smut-fest couldn't stop at misunderstanding one of the greatest romantic pairs in literature, Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, but instead goes further to the point of being disrespectful and cruel to them. Extensive passages detailing Mr. Darcy's \\"member\\" coupled with the tragedy unfairly and inexplicably befalling beloved characters takes the place of anything resembling plot, character development or dialog. Unless you are wholly unsatisfied with Austen's failure to have Lizzy ravaged every fifteen pages this is not the book for you. This is not only a terrible book but also an assault upon all of us who love Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clan of the... Pemberly?","review":"Contains spoilers.I figured it out. This book is like Ayla and Jondalar in waistcoats and petticoats. The passionate virgin, the gentle and skilled lover with large parts, the younger sister with a mind of her own, a knack for healing, the question if his seed is strong enough to take root in her womb... it's all there. With a slight lapse into Star Wars territory--I seem to recall that it is Leia and Han who first have the romantic exchange, \\"I love you.\\" \\"I know.\\"Betwixts and howbeits aside, I personally got tired of Lothario and melancholia. It's just another trashy romance novel, all in all. Not enough to get upset about... this book can't really alter anyone's long-term perceptions of favorite Austen characters. They just happen to all have the same names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"What a terrible book. If you want to write a bodice ripper, invent your own characters and use them, don't steal the wonderful Austen heroine Elizabeth and screw her (literally).Re-imagining these beloved characters in a way that revolts against everything Jane Austen originally wrote is wrong, and to call this book a true \\"sequel\\" is ridiculous. I'm definitely no prude, but the constant sex got old immediately, and the \\"dramatic\\" twists and turns betrays the characters that P&P; introduced one to.I love good erotica, good stories, and good writing, but this is none of the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness Jane Austen will never read this !!!","review":"This is not a continuation of Pride and Prejudice. This is a soft porn bodice ripper with characters of similar names to the Jane Austen classic. If Ms. Berdoll actually believes Mr. Darcy would be so disgusting to use a chamber pot in Lizzy's presence she needs to read Jane Austen. She lost me for good when the newlyweds had sex on a blanket outdoors IN JANUARY, in view of a servant. I could read no more, as I could not stand the idea of Jane Austen's characters being reduced to classless libertines. Don't waste money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like reading the word \\"betwixt\\" over and over....","review":"then you will enjoy this book very much. I was not only disappointed with the foolish and numerous plot twists but also found myself thoroughly irritated by the writing style. When an author decides to take on the challenge of righting a sequel to a classic, I believe it is his or her responsibility to, at the very least, make a serious effort at researching the period properly. The author had a few catch phrases that she used incessantly and often out of character. I came to believe that the author never even read P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Step AWAY from the thesaurus...","review":"I didn't mind the (plentiful, gratuitous, and yes, sometimes disturbing) sex, or the unbelievable characterizations of Lizzy and Darcy. What made me give up on this book not even halfway through was the painful abuse of the English language.One of the basic rules of good writing is to never use big inflated ten dollar words when simple ones will do. In this book, it seems the author had a decent novel going, then decided to go back through it and exchange every 3rd word with the biggest synonym she could find in her thesaurus, or that failing, just made something up. (\\"Howbeit\\"?)This might have even been enjoyable as a beach-read type romance novel, but it's WAY too long and the writing too convoluted for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eschew Obfuscation","review":"Avoid this book - perhaps try the Elizabeth Aston books instead.__________________Honestly! I have a decent vocabulary & am quite the fan of the \\"correct\\" word, but it seems Linda Berdoll is flaunting that she owns an OED! (see quotations in other reviews)But much more annoying than that are the parentheticals describing characters personalities. I'm pretty sure Jane Austen used the characters actions & conversation to allow the reader to form her own opinion, rather than ramming it down your throat._______________________________________________"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I don't think that the author's inability to imitate Austen's work is what infuriates \\"Austenites\\". The main problem is that the author doesn't understand the subtleties and humor of writing. She relied on sensationalism and voyueristic detail to tell the story and left nothing to the imagination. She obviously did not do enough research about the time period or P&P; itself before embarking on this embarassment, but her real problem is that she doesn't know how to write.I would love to read a spicy, well-written, multifaceted sequel to P&P...this; unfortunately is NOT it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets of Salsa","review":"Secrets of Salsa has provided an infusion of healthy, delicious, and colorful salsas in my family's life. These recipes, which had never previously been written down, came from Mexican women who have moved to the United States and were attending English classes. The vignettes about the women are delightful and the fact that all the proceeds directly benefit adult literacy add to the value of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good or better then I remembered it","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1984, when I was 38, and it made a huge impression on me and I finally bought this copy. I was not disappointed. Despite having just seen Avatar, and replete with CGI overdosing from films like Star Trek, the effects in Dreamscape, though dated, are extremely powerful and well done. The story is still modern, and the technology to achieve it seems just around the corner. The cast is wonderful and the pace well done. Dreamscape should be a sci-fi classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror/Sci Fi at its best.","review":"Dennis Quaid is an interesting protagonist in this story.

It seems like everyone and their dog has some claim to the name. Alpha Centauri was fun, but the red map was irritating. And the most recent version of Civilization from Activision \\"Call to Power\\" ran so slowly on my Pentium 233MMX, that is wasn't worth trying to play. (And that's with all the animation turned off.) Test of Time uses the old, reliable, comfortable Civ II engine, but adds new worlds and new technologies. It also runs quickly on older machines.

The biggest difference overall is that you now have multiple maps that are placed on top of each other. Think of layers on a cake. You can move from the top to the bottom. The graphics are a little prettier, but not a lot. The gameplay is identical to Civ 2. I'd recomened that you buy Civ 2 Gold Multiplayer Edition.

By praising God we elevate Him and this invites the presence of God to remove us from the oppression the enemy and his emissaries try to bring us down by negative thoughts, etc. If you are walking in defeat, there will be a chapter in here for many areas of life that can bogg us down. So many references to scripture that are pertinent to express the praise God is worthy of."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read","review":"Having read The Power of a Praying Woman, I decided to give this book a try. It is seriously the best book I've ever read. It has helped God and the Bible and Praise and Worship changed my life like no other book (except the Bible) has ever. Omartian teaches very clear ways to Praise God no matter what, and I have already seen the ways it has worked in my life and the blessing of God that have resulted from it.

Anyway, I've been recommending this book to EVERYONE I know, so do yourself a favor and get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and uplifting","review":"This book has a different approach to prayers.

There are only 4 games on this cartridge which are not very interesting or exciting. My daughter also has the Disney Princess and Dora Cartridges which are far superior in overall content and games. She really enjoyes the karoke game with the Disney Princess cartridge where she can sing along with Aerial and the Fairy Godmother. The games on the Princess and Dora are also more educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this as a gift for a friend's son","review":"He loved it, so I had to go back to Amazon and pick out some games and a case to keep them all together.

I think it is a nice addition to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Read","review":"Loved this book. Loved the intensity of Mr. Buford's experience and his writing. I feel like I learned a little of what he set out to know and it has changed the way I work in my own home kitchen. I love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I won't be opening a restaurant any time soon.","review":"Any romanticized idea I held about opening a restaurant came crashing to an end when I read this book. His period in Mario Batali's kitchen was entertaining and horrifying. The period he spent in Italy didn't move as quickly, but was equally entertaining. Somehow dinner at Olive Garden will never be good enough, even if I am 'family'."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a grandson-chef","review":"We ordered a copy of \\"Heat\\" to give to one of our grandsons who is working as a pasta chef during his interim year before going to university.

An absolutely must read for any amateur cook or would-be chef."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story, different book.","review":"I love to read narrative books on food. I also love to read cookbooks. But to me, this book is too similar to the more entertaining \\"Kitchen Confidential.\\" I have no problem with the actual writing of the book, Buford is a great an enthusiastic guide to the inner workings of a kitchen. But I am tired of reading about how hellish and stressful it is to work in a restaurant kitchen, and glorifying the macho boys club of the professional culinary world. Yes, we get it, it's not really all that glamorous to work in a restaurant day in and day out. If you have never read a book like this and are infatuated with Mario Batali, I say go ahead and read it, but if you have read \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" there's not much new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The book has three themes (interwoven throughout the book). Mario's kitchen, training in Italy, and a look into the history/evolution of cooking.When in Mario's kitchen, it's an entertaining read (Even if Mario B isn't a person I'd ever want to hang out with).The training in Italy is generally disappointing with very slow meandaring sections.Finally, the trips through history will only appeal to a VERY serious foodie.I was, perhaps mistakenly, looking for a fun read and never even chuckled. There must have been better stories to relate than what he's produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Mario Batali","review":"Interesting story about Batali and his restaurants, staff, and philosophy of food/cuisine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"This book is boring. I suspect that most of the people who loved it were reading their first \\"inside\\" look at restaurant kitchens, either that or liked the Mario Batale stuff. But the book just drags and the author injects no life at all into 80% of the narrative. Go read Bourdain's first book instead (and then drop all things Bourdain, also)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible, disjointed, mess","review":"What a mess of a book. I really wanted to like this one, and it comes with many high regards from the food world (and outside as well)... I have no idea why. It is a jumbled mess of disjointed accounts that would make far better individual newspaper or magazine shorts, which I would not be surprised if that was the original intention that somehow spawned into a book. From weak accounts of life inside Babbo which centered inexplicably on individuals with no importance rather than on the cooking/experiences to jumpy tales of the author's time in Italy which don't flow or develop into much of anything. I'm not sure how or why this book has managed such high ratings for what it is, there are much better accounts of kitchen life and even of kitchen life from an outsiders perspective. Pass on the hype, this is not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erratic, boring and without passion","review":"This book reads like a term paper written by an overly diligent student who's not really interested in his subject. The author erratically jumps from one topic to another to demonstrate that he has really done lots and lots of research.The result lacks insight, excitement and passion.Of course anybody seriously interested in the world of food and cuisine already knows how a professional kitchen ticks. Much better books about journalists' work experiences have been written - experiences in greater restaurants!: e.g. Andrew Todhunter's \\"A Meal Observed\\". This author worked serveral months at the legendary Taillevent in Paris (3 Michelin stars).Read the latter and forget HEAT! The cover whets one's appetite but what follows leaves the reader hungry. Very hungry in fact!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"i just really loved this book. i had dreams i was making pasta when i was rading this book, i was so engrossed in the topic. plus, mario batali got another fan through this book.great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL inside look into the restaurant industry","review":"This is a must-read for anyone considering a career in the restaurant industry and for anyone who even wonders what it's like to work in a restaurant. Wildly funny, endearingly honest and completely razor-sharp, Bill Buford paints a realistic picture of what it's like to work back-of-the-house. But one warning: This book will make you crave boat loads of authentic Italian food... even if you don't know exactly what authentic Italian cuisine is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat","review":"This book was purchased as a gift for my adult son, who also happens to be an excellent cook.

Reading this book is an absolute pleasure. It carries the right amount of sarcasm and humor, and Buford's mannerism in the book is hilarious. I first heard about it from a friend who thought the book was probably exaggerations of real events. However, after reading it, I can tell you from experience, that the events sound pretty accurate. I've worked in restuarants in Manhattan and needless to say, NYC kitchens very demanding, quite small and cramped, and the chefs are eccentric and peculiar; some would even say, chefs are manic, because you never know what you're going to get. I recommend the book highly to anyone who appreciates food or enjoy witty sarcasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Given as a gift","review":"I gave this as a gift to my husband who loves to cook and has taken a few lessons. I know he enjoyed it by his loud gaffaws while reading it. I feel he related to much of it and being someone who always wanted to go to a professional cooking school really found it interesting and entertaining. He finished it in three nights if that tells you anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat","review":"Heat by Bill Buford is a record the author's culinary career, starting from the lowest and least desirable rank in the kitchen to being an apprentice at the side of one of the most admirable chefs in New York. Bill spends three years focusing on mastering his art of cooking, to become somebody in the restaurant industry. They are not easy years, especially at the beginning when he is only a \\"kitchen bitch\\" and has to prove himself every time he wants to be moved one step in the kitchen hierarchy. Heat is written in a very humorous way and it makes you laugh all the way throughout the book. But you can also learn a lot about the food from elaborate descriptions of pasta making, meat preparation and etc. Most of all, the book makes you hungry for more of Bill Buford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book in perfect condition.","review":"This book arrived in pristine condition, like it had never been read. Surprising to get sucha great book for such a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and boring","review":"I usually love books like this and this one promised to be good because of the writer's journalism background and the interesting subject matter. Boy was I disappointed. He basically tells the same story over and over again. Buford struggles with making lamb chops, Buford struggles with making polenta, etc. There is no story arch, no real beginning or end. Just endless, identical stories. All of the other chefs seem to be stock players, with no true identity. I finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, wordy and snobbish","review":"This has to be the most boring book I have ever read and if I could give it zero stars I would. Maybe if you are a professional chef this is interesting, or if this level of food consumption is an everyday part of the world you live in, but for me some one who enjoys a well written book and a good adventure in my kitchen, I was bored. At first it was fun to hear some of the stories or his experiences and so on, but page after page on short ribs? Come on - I felt like I was reading a bad text book in college. As I continued to read I went from bored, to mad, to flat out pissed off that anyone bothered to publish this let alone charge $16 for it. As the book continued I began to see the author as just as self absorbed as the people he wrote about. While I admire their skills and culinary talents, there was a sense of superiority lurking. I'm not sure who I was more disgusted by, the author or the people he wrote about. Don't waste your money, you will be so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Save yourselves (and your money)! This is one of the most boring books I've ever come across. It should be retitled Ode to Mario Batali since that is the only thing the author can write about, wasting line upon line listing stupid quotes from Mario. This book makes watching grass exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat","review":"I was so disappointed with the language in this book. I had heard about it on the NPR \\"Splendid Table\\" show and looked forward to reading it. What a waste of good money. I can't get past the first 30 pages because of the filthy language. I was insulted to have squandered money on filth. If Mario Batali can't open his mouth with every other word beginning with \\"f\\", I certainly wouldn't want to eat his food as it must be as filthy as his language. Wish I could get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cooking","review":"Having been a cook in a chi chi Brooklyn eatery 25 years ago, this brought back memories of the intensity of a busy kitchen .. however Buford's visits to Italy, informative little snippets about the origins of some dishes (like Tortiloni and Ravioli), and some recipes makes your mouth water and fills in the missing pieces that you will never find in recipe or travel books. He exposes the craziness that makes a great chef and the author gets caught up in the maelstrom that makes him crazy and a good cook. I recommend this highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it!","review":"I absolutely adored this book. YES, I love to cook ... but never fantasized about the commercial kitchen realm. I still don't care to work in one, but now I know what it's like! Bill Buford is my favorite type of writer -- witty, with perspective, and he takes you into HIS world through HIS eyes. I can't recommend it highly enough. He had me consistently laughing out loud during a Florida beach vacation and I had to read several segments to my vacation buddies to explain my delight. I kept saying, \\"I never KNEW that!\\" Honestly, toward the end of the book when he worked for a butcher, I was pretty disgusted and sped read through a chapter, as I have eaten primarily vegetarian for 20+ years. But I wouldn't miss this reading experience for the world. Read it now! I came home ready to use my kitchen in new ways!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems!","review":"I didn't find any problems with this set which I bought (from Babbages)and all the games are really great!

The other guy who wrote that review seemed to have problems but I didn't so I say go ahead and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original games are great, but this release is not...","review":"While MW4 Vengeance, Black Knight and MechCommander2 are great games, I would have to advise against this repackaged product. I am not sure what Microsoft has done this time, but I've had problems with installing the MW4 and its expansion and the Mechcommander 2 will not install at all (it just hangs my PC until I end-task).I purchased Mech Collection to run on a second PC (I bought the original games for my other PC and wanted to remain \\"legal\\"). The original disks load fine on my PCs, it's just the Mech Collection disks that experience problems.Again, I am not sure what MS has done, but this release of these games came on substandard nonfunctioning CDs. If you are interested in these games, I'd suggest purchasing the original games seperately until MS acknowledges that there is a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Talent","review":"Not only is Patrick Lamb a masterful musician, he's a very sincere soul.

This one offers many great tips on decluttering. It is set up in such a way that you can start anywhere in the book - based on your needs and areas of interest. Definitely a book to recommend and/or share with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is for mathematically-challenged persons","review":"I had always been intimidated by mathematics at almost every level. This book was used as a text for a required entry level college course - and it changed my attitude to mathematics. It is more accurately described as 'the history and culture of math'. The book progresses through how humans began to develop and use math and how it developed in complexity because certain problems had to be solved; for example, commerce and science (very broadly), including astronomy. Although I am still not a 'mathophile', I did learn to appreciate math in a different way. The math problems to solve are always set in the context of how and why the problem needed to be solved. I wish this had been introduced to me in high school - before I developed my fear of math."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Asians, not only mathematicians or scientists should read this book","review":"Asians did not develop science or mathematics as Greeks did. People here in Korea are still talking about ancient things while Galilleo and Newton solved problem hundred years ago. When a friend of mine read this book he cried, because of his long term ignorance of wisdom western tradition made and written in this book. Zhu Si asked his student study nature, exactly the kind of works Galilleo did, but they repeated those teaching without doing experiment. Cofucians are still teaching what Zhu Si said."},{"rating":"2","title":"mathematics for the nonmathemathician by klien","review":"This is an excellent book for one who struggles with math. Kline has the magic to make something complicated seem quite logical and uncomplicated. I always struggled with math but this book broke through the cement and let thlight shine in. By cement I mean my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is amazing.The introduction is admittedly long but informative and the first few chapters detail the history and subsequent advancements of mathematics.The author seems to be a bit biased against religion but given their involvement in the destruction of knowledge throughout the ages, hardly surprising.This book is informative, interesting and deserving to be read by anyone who likes and even those who hate math."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps for the Retired Mathematician","review":"As a person with a background in Math and Physics, I found this Tome (over 600 pages), to be a great review of the basics of Mathematics, including the derivative and its application to motion problems in physics. There is also a lot of relevant and interesting history peppered throughout the book that is covered in greater detail than most other math history books. I cant imagine someone who doesnt like math, or does not have a math background reading this work. This would be a great textbook in one of the classes teachers take who are embarking on teaching mathematics in high school or up to the sophomore year in college. A \\"Math Appreciation\\" course? Other writers have done a much better job of making math seem digestable, but few have the depth of presentation, and sheer information contained in this volume. If you like math, this is a very enjoyable and informative read;otherwise I think you will put it down after thumbing through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexplicably Enjoyable","review":"This game is just a variation of Bejeweled and other \\"match three jewels\\" games. However the game play is beyond those other varients and I found myself wishing there was a 7 Wonders II lurking out there somewhere.There is nowhere to tell from the packaging or reviews here, what type of game this is. When I got my game and saw the picture of the columned jewels, I know I must have groaned in disappointment. I don't need another Bejeweled game. But the background story is fun and the game play is just different enough to keep your interest. I recomend this game highly.And I don't understand the other reviewers writing that there is no save function. Each level can be saved, but only at the end of the each level, there is no way to save until the level is finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential shows but this book doesn't quite meet the mark.","review":"I think the Good Sister is a writer for sure and posessing talent. This book however is lacking while it has intriguing and suspensful places - it focuses on frankly too much on the weight of one of the prime characters and fills in the usual stereotypical view. I believe Sister will produce better work as she goes along but this isn't a book I could feel good about reccomending."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're fat or love someone who is, avoid this book.","review":"I'm fat (212 pounds) and I found the author's attitude toward fat people, as revealed by her treatment of Angela Bowers, deeply offensive. Sister Carol Anne O'Marie was kinder to the rapist than to this abused fat woman! I found the author's evident hatred of fat people all the more sickening because I'm Catholic and she's a nun. This was my 5th Sister Helen mystery and it's going to be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me or was it stupid that Eric could never die ?","review":"Don't get me wrong this book was ok, more like one thumb up one thumb down, but it was just that Eric Leben the bad guy of the book just could never die. I hate books (and movies) like that where the killer keeps coming back to life even after he has been shot, slautered, and in Eric's case bitten by dozens of poisonous snakes. I really liked 'The Key to Midnight' by Koontz but this one was just unreal. This book was very good until about halfway into it where Eric kept coming back to life, I mean wasn't getting hit by a garbage truck enough? This book would have been M U C H better if Eric just didn't keep coming back from the dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Long... but SCARY!","review":"OK... KOONTZ HAS WRITTEN ABOUT GENETICS BEFORE (AND CONTINUES TO DO SO...HENCE, THE CHRISTOPHER SNOW BOOKS.) BUT, I PERSONALLY LIKE THIS BOOK EVEN BETTER THAN WATCHERS (TRANSLATION...IT'S SCARIER!) Eric Leben is a truly frightening villain... he wasn't well glued together before his death and self-imposed resurrection, but he becomes (literally) a monster upon his return. The \\"shadow fires\\" of the book's title are psychologically chilling. Leben is definitely one of Koontz's best villains...and that says a lot. He's certainly more interesting than Candy, the vilain of The Bad Place...which nonetheless remains my fav Koontz novel. Anyway, if u are looking to get chills, th is is the book for u. Just realize the book is a bit slow in places. it definitely could've been tighter. BUT the supporting characters in this book are great... especially THE STONE and the sadistic federal agent... Sharp, i believe his name was. so pick this one up... and prepare to be spooked. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"Many of my favorite Koontz novels were originally published under the psuedonym LEIGH NICHOLS. There is something so engaging and suspenseful and passionate about those earlier novels that I really think he was in the top of his form back then. SHADOWFIRES stands out as one of his best. Beautiful and intensely-likeable Rachel Leben has finally escaped the neglect and cruelty of her husband, brilliant genetecist Eric Leben. Or at least she thinks she has. But Eric's hate for her (mainly for leaving him which in turn humiliates him) becomes a force of nature. Nothing will stop him from destroying her. Not even death... I've read this book at least twice now and will probably read it again. It's a classic \\"chase novel\\" with a creepy blend of science and horror and suspense. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Scary, and Morose. Just how I like 'em!","review":"I had put off Shadowfires for as long as I could for no reason whatsoever. I just decided that I would pick up this creepy little book and have at it. Boy, am I glad I did! Having read several Koontz spook fests I am fairly used to his work but I was not ready for the fright fest in store for me! This book has one of the most terrifying monsters Koontz has ever created and it gets more horrifying with each visitation! I love how Koontz can take a human monster (scary enough) and twist it into something utterly ungodly like he does for Shadowfires. This book gave me goosebumps and had several chilling moments. I was very happy with my time spent having the crap scared out of me. This is a book for those who like horror and have need of a little terror in their lives now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite.","review":"I love dean koontz books, but have discovered there was a time when his endings were lacking. I found this book to drag out and difficult for me to keep picking up in order to finish it. Overall concept, very cool, like all his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like a cheap romance novel at times","review":"Story was mildly interesting, but it was written in such a way that it felt like a romance novel. I didn't need to waste my time reading about the main characters feelings for one another more than once. The writer seemed to feel that he needed to repeat himself to the reader. He repeated himself about the main characters feelings, the cops feelings, character physical descriptions, etc.... I found myself skimming the book and looking forward to it finally being over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing although it started out very well","review":"This book lost the plot half way through. The idea was excellent and the first half of the book was very good. It seems that Mr Koontz got bored with it halfway through and couldn't find an appropriate ending. THis could have been a great book like NIGHT CHILLS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This is the 4th Koontz that I have read, and needless to say, it was really boring. It kept me interested for about a quarter of the way through it then I had to make myself finish it and then still skipped pages and still didn't miss anything! It was way too long, very disapointing. Two out of four I have liked so far. The Funhouse and The voice in the night were excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me wonder why I keep reading Koontz...","review":"Maybe I'm jaded, but the more of Koontz I read, the more I wonder why I keep going back for more. This book is a really good example of why: it shows Koontz's ability to take what could have been a really creepy ghost story and turn it into a government conspiracy. To top it all off, the ending was almost identical to that of \\"Mr. Murder\\" -- just a bit more predictable. If you'd like to see a better version of this same story, try \\"Mr. Murder.\\" The one good thing I can say about \\"Shadowfires\\" is that I liked the characters...but sometimes characterization just isn't enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadowfires","review":"Shadowfires was the first Koontz book I ever read, and by far the best! It's gotten me hooked on reading Koontz's novels"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't find this book anywhere...","review":"I could not find this book for years. I was looking everywhere. When I finally came across it, I started reading right away. As soon as I read the first paragraph, I was hooked. This book keeps you \\"on the edge of your seat\\". I didn't put it down until the book was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Dead Don't Stay Buried","review":"I read this one when it came out under Koontz's \\"Leigh Nichols\\" pseudonym - I knew it was him before he admitted it, and this was the title I figured it out on.Government research scientist and all-around bad kind of control-freak guy Erik Leben gets his nasty self hit by a car while stalking his soon-to-be ex-wife. He gets squashed flatter than a June bug under a clutterboot, but for some reason his body just won't stay in the morgue. And death hasn't improved his nasty disposition, one little bit...This one combines a lot of Koontz's better story elements in a pretty gripping book. I won't say too much about it, because getting there is half the fun. He's done it better in subsequent books, but that doesn't make Shadowfires any less enjoyable a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth wasting your time reading","review":"I found this book to be almost unreadable. The story is a re-hash of countless better constructed and more interesting books and films. The characters are built as a composite of clichés and the 'secrets' that they reveal throughout drawn-out action are telegraphed from early on. Instead of focusing on any sort of psychological or emotional dynamic between the lead characters Koontz brings in an assorted grab-bag of scenery-chewers who clog up the book with histrionics and banal dialog. The only thing that kept me reading was the hope that at some point something truly interesting or unique would happen. It never did, and this will become one of the few books I've read I will happily toss in the trash rather that subject someone else to a tedious and worthless read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"Too bad I read \\"Relentless\\" first... This one is a repackaged/rebranded release of a pretty early work. Still kept me rapt all the way through, but I realized I was shaking my head at too much of the cheesy dialogue and it regularly challenged my own ability to suspend disbelief.Might be okay if you've read other greats of his (\\"Velocity,\\" \\"Seize the Night,\\" \\"The Good Guy,\\" \\"The Husband,\\" so many!)...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ach... Dean, you've done better work.","review":"This is a book that I started reading because I didn't happen to have any other Koontz to read (and I had already re-read Dark Rivers this month.)This book seems to have no voice other than to create tension and disgust. In the right amounts, this can be a very good thing for a horror book. This is not a horror book, this is one that through Dean Koontz' excellent descriptive language, thouroughly disgusted and scared me all the way through.The problem is that that is not what I wanted. I want suspense yes, and maybe a little disgust here and there, but this book went a little overboard for my taste.Not one I'd really reccomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"I tried the unabridged book on tape, featuring an utterly lackluster performance by Jonathan Marosz. Maybe I've read too much Dean Koontz, freak accident of science looses a monster with a special grudge. A resourceful man and equally plucky woman battle the evil while becoming soulmates. Characters exchange biographical information in unnaturally eloquent banter, providing exposition that would be much better conveyed by a third person narrator.The premise about genetic mutation was okay, and I liked the logic of his superheated cells devouring themselves at the end, but the clashes and chase scenes were dull and forgettable.If you're a new Koontz reader, maybe this is pretty good, but I have much fonder memories of \\"Hideaway\\" and \\"The Bad Place\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...such a silly read!","review":"I was really surprised to see a 4 star average on this novel, which I looked up out of curiosity to see how this book would be rated by the public! I came across a copy of this book at a cottage, and picked it up as an imagined \\"light summer read.\\". Wasn't I surprised when a few chapters in, the lead character's husband returned from the dead as a wild muderous zombie! That's right folks, and later in the book he turns into a scaly lizard-type creature. Ridiculous in the extreme. So strange that none of the other reviewers even mention how odd this is. The whole book was so hilariously implausible that I read on in astonishment, waiting for a punch line. It never came. I would give it no stars if I could.

I have never seen anyone playing this version game online, even though it is available at GameSpy. You are better off playing more traditional versions of the game.I bought it in the hopes of having some decent solitaire play. If that is what you are hoping for, then forget it. The AI, even at its highest level, will not give you any sort of test. It is just about as idiotic as can be.Diplomacy is such a great game. It is a shame that its PC version is so incredibly boring and unchallenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a long time fan of Diplomacy and have played by mail, face to face and by e-mail. So when I saw this game in a store one day I bought it on impulse. However it is disappointing. The computer player(s) is not gifted and it is easy to win. Add to this the unwieldy nature of the negotiation phase (often the computer player just walks away when you are talking to it) and I cannot recommend this for anyone other than novices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful, a huge disappointment","review":"Diplomacy's one of my favorite games ever, and so I bought the computer version on sight. What a bad move.First, the AI is dreadful. The computer couldn't fight its way out of a paper bag, much less take over Europe.Worse, the interface is completely unusable. The various players hurl diplomatic overtures so fast that you can't follow what's what.It's just a godawful mess. Avoid avoid avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game, poor negotiations","review":"All I have to add is that the other reviews (especially the Amazon one) is correct. The interface lags horribly, so it misses clicks, the computer doesn't wait around, and sometimes i never even see it's counter-offers before it leaves the negotiating table!The only redeeming aspect of this game is gunboat style, because it works fine without the negotiation part!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I recently underwent surgery and cannot take capsules or gelcaps anymore.

I bought the street hikers because I moved to the city and walk a lot, but I am disappointed with the te feel of the socks and that they do not stay up on my calf and they continually sag into my shoe. This never happened with my mid-hikers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturing defect","review":"Socks seem very nice but I immediately noticed that the sole had a silver dollar sized section of pulled and frayed threads just forward of the heel. I could have worn them but was afraid that the defective section would quickly turn into a hole.

This was way back in his protest period, so it's only natural that the two best performances (Hard Rain, John Brown) were both protest songs with very vivid imagery. I'd say the version of Hard Rain is better than even the studio original! Of course, I also like Don't Think Twice, though in this case perfer the classic original. The only weak song is Barbara Allen, it drags on way too long (even for Dylan) and the story is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early live Dylan with versions of Hard Rain and Don't Think Twice","review":"Bob Dylan/ Live at The Gaslight 1962: This CD gives us a nice selection of the songs Bob did at the Gaslight in 1962. These early versions of Hard Rain and Don't Think Twice made this an important CD to have. A solid performance that hints at the explosion of songs that Dylan was about to unleash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for Enthusiasts","review":"If you've got the Bob Bug (as I do) then this is an absolute treasure. Somebody captured Dylan at the Gaslight coffeehouse in Greenwich Village during 1962 with a portable tape recorder. Through the magic of digital technology, the tapes sound clear and balanced. The nuances of Dylan's vocals and guitar picking are a joy to hear so closely. At this point in time, Dylan had already seen the release of his debut LP come and go; he was working on the follow-up, \\"Freewheelin'\\", in fits and starts. So what you get here is an artist's work-in-progress on three originals and warm, intimate readings of folk standards delivered to a tiny audience in a small, dark room. The next \\"live\\" Dylan document is the Philharmonic Hall concert (Bootleg Series Vol. 6) of 1964. So, here it is ... pre-fame Dylan live in a coffeehouse on MacDougal Street in the Village. Short of a time machine, you'll never get as close to the real thing as this lil' round wafer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable, turned my head around","review":"Although some might consider this statement heresy, I have to admit that I have long been a major fan of Bob Dylan The Rocker and less enthusiastic about the early folk stuff. Perhaps I am just getting older and wiser but lately I have begun to appreciate pre-electric Bob and this set has much to do with it.Gaslight really is like a time machine to another time and place and proves a very rewarding journey. As others have said, Hard Rain and Cocaine are really special but the whole set is a gem.One other thing: I often get cynical about the dubious necessity of \\"Remastering\\" that the record companies employ to sell us the same records over and over again. However, the state of the art audio technology employed for this release, the Zeppelin live CD and DVD from a few years ago, Kurt Cobain's cassette demo's from the Nirvana box and other recent archival releases truly is a wonder. Live At The Gaslight 1962 shouldn't sound this good, but it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for pet owners","review":"This is a very useful book for dog owners, especially people who have never had pets before.

It took six months to finally receive the software to download so I could begin using the camera again. At first, Poloroid told me they would charge me $120 for software, but then relented and mailed it to me at no cost. I find this camera very awkward to use with the adapter, in fact I had to return camera within a month of purchase only to find out that the adapter was defective. When downloading pictures, they tend to all come out too light and must be enhanced before printing or saving to file. This would not be my first choice in cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I am searching for something positive to say about this camera, but I am at a loss for words. Negative things, however, are no problem. In short, the shutter lag is ridiculously long, the picture quality is only fair, the 4mb card only holds 6 pictures at the highest quality, the memory card is almost impossible to remove without strong fingernails or plyers, and the software is inferior to adobe. A friend has a kodak DC215 and it is a much better camera than this one. I returned mine and am going to buy the fuji finepix1400 or the kodak. Consumer reports didn't have much good to say about the poloroid, but liked the fuji and kodak. I must say I totally agree with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money- better to get a kadak dc215 or fuji","review":"One good thing about this camera ( and the only good thing!) is that it is easy to operate. The software is easy also, but inferior to photodeluxe, which is offered with many other cameras. One of the major bad points of this camera are that the printed picture quality is bad. A friend has a kodak dc215 and I printed a picture taken with my camera next to one taken with his and the kodak was much better. The other negative thing about this camera is that it takes the picture about 3 seconds after pressing the button. I would expect some delay, but this camera is ridiculous! So my advice: get a kodak dc215 or fujifilm finepix 1400. I'm returning my polaroid as I write this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera.. no drivers..","review":"Well, I love this camera.. it's great.. it's affordable.. takes great pictures.. but.. there's no drivers that support Windows ME or 2000!!! what the heck?

Finally, within a year of purchase, the screen died and the picture counter failed.Oh, and the rebate that was offered at the time of sale was a scam.

At that time, everyone in our extended family was healthy: The book seemed as if it was written \\"for someone else.\\" I read it, absorbed most of the content, and then set it in our library.About a month ago, as my father-in-law's condition was slowly worsening, my wife saw the book on the shelf and picked it up. Yesterday, my father-in-law passed away.This book was a god-send. It helped my wife prepare--even at a time when we thought we had a lots of time--and provided clear, compassionate, insightful guidance, right down to specifics of comforting her mother, how to navigate the details of final arrangements, and a lot more.Jim, my most sincere 'thank you' for your thoughtfulness in writing this, and for sharing what you have learned with the rest of us.I highly recommend this book, especially if (like me) you don't think you need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"I read this book when I was dealing with my mother's many problems. The book was a tremendous help. The author had good suggestions for people who don't live in the same city as their parents. So I followed his suggestion and hired a social worker/senior care consultant to check in on my mom, make sure she kept her doctors' appoinments and to sort out her medication. I had never heard of this type of service and it turned out to be a huge help. So I'm thankful to the author for this and for sharing his memoirs about his parents. I enjoyed reading about how he cared for his parents, especially when they lived in two different sections of the same building. Some of it was amusing, like the time they couldn't find his mom anywhere and they found her in the least likely place imaginable.

It helps EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, and you'll find yourself going back to it time and time again during the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Roles Reverse: A Guid to Parenting Your Parents","review":"A MUST read for anyone whose parents are nearing retirement or older. Jim Comer shares his own heart-warming and sometimes heart-breaking experiences caring for his parents. I can't express how important the information is in this book to help prepare you not only for the care your parents may need but, to make us all think about ourselve as we age. As he advises, don't wait for a crisis to force you into a situation for which you are unprepared - read his book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but chinsy","review":"So I absolutely adore the way this watch looks. Its so cute and stylish. But my mind changed when I got it in the mail. The band was super short and it would only fit on the last ridge. It was very cheaply made and poor quality. I couldn't imagine this watch could stand through much. It just felt chinsy and fragile. I returned it because it was tight and uncomfortable. I don't even have a big wrist, between 6 & 3/4 inches and 7 inches. I was really sad because it was so beautiful. Let's face it, this watch was only made for looks. But I didn't want to pay $80 for a super small crappy watch that doesn't fit. I expected more, this watch retails at $250!! what a rip off!

If you can only buy one Paco Peña CD then buy Fabulous Flamenco. But if you can buy two, then get this one!

Putting Adam Smith in a historical context can reveal much about what he really wanted to say. But Emma Rothschild's writing style is frustrating. Time and again I would read a sentence and then ask \\"what did she just say?\\" and realize that it was a banal generality or that she could have expressed herself more directly.

Rothchild's book isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a NW side Chicago girl I was excited to read this book. What a waste of my time and money. I still have not finished it, but I know this is a book going nowhere. The book is terribly repetitive, poorly written and glorifies low level street violence. Yes, its tough being the white kids in an urban landscape, but have you learned anything? What is obvious is the writter is still glamorizing the old days. I can imagine him, PBR or Old Mil in hand waxing prophetic about his days as a white gang-banger.

I was fascinated by the straight forwardness of it all. I have never lived where there gang's being a country girl. It had to be hard for the author to write this book, bringing back all the sad memories. The book made me really think about how hard gang life is. There was times when I cried and other time I laughed. I think the author did an excellent job writing about what goes on, and in opening society's eyes to the everyday struggles and pressures that our young men have to go through. I strongly recommend this book for everyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try again","review":"I live in Chicago and know these places, and it was fun knowing where he was talking about I over all thought the book was lacking. It may tell how he thought things were at the time but all I could think about was how this book just sounded like he was trying to justify everything. Justify the violence, the crime, and most importantly trying to justify being in a racist gang. He not only tries to justify it but there are undertones he wants you to feel the same way he does and he fails poorly. Its not the worst book I've read but I won't advise you to read it. What can you expect, after the success of Reymundo Sanchez's books the flood of crap books to fill this niche in ex gang members lives is to be expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dog choosing book","review":"I wish I could put another star on this book.

He can't take the indiscriminate pounding some very small children might mete out.' Shetland Sheepdog: snappy, annoying little breeds that be scared of cars if never exposed. Yeah, that's with all breeds. It never mentions their trainability-they're one of the smartest breeds. And they say that they are bad and poor if treated badly! 'Train them easily and gently and you can maintain their sweet temperaments.' The Golden Retriever review (not that I don't like them) talks about how they are the best family dog, are easy to care for, and are just the best, best, best dog ever!

Then, in two different ways and at two different times I saw \\"All Quite on the Potomac\\" spelled out across the screen. I wonder if this was prepared in China or some other non-English-speaking country. To misspell Jubal Early's name, and to misspell \\"All Quiet on the Potomac\\" twice was too much in a mere half hour of viewing. I took the DVD out and that's the end of it. Perhaps it was an attempt to cash in on the Burns series with a cheap knockoff.P.S. I just found out that three of the six episodes are missing. Apparently each cd was meant to be double-sided but there is only one side to each cd. The best word for this thing is simply \\"garbage\\".

The discs are in much better shape than I thought they would be and would rate the quality a 4 out of 5 and quantity a 5 out of 5.

Then my sister suggested I watch the mini series. I purchased it and even then it took me a couple of weeks before I watched it. This mini series ranks up there with the best of them. They have done a great job to keep the politics out of it and only casually mentions the important scandals and events. It focuses mainly on the life of the servants in the white house. That doesn't sound exciting but the story draws you in so you really care about the people involved. If you are thinking about buying this mini series do it.

It really does show that it might have been like working at the White House through the time of 1909 thru 1961. Contrast between the old and new guard is really shown. It does give you the feeling of what it would be like working at the White House and dealing with the different personalities of the First Family.THe best quote from the series is \\"We are the owners (meaning the staff that works there) and they (The first family) are the tenants\\".

I was sad as the author went into painstaking detail on lightsabers, and yet said only a paragraph about my favorite film of his, \\"Life as a House.\\" Overall the author used fair language, and for the most part Hayden Christensen deserved a better biographer.

The beeping sound, I think the other reviews were being polite saying it was faint. You must take the thermometer out of your mouth and put it to your ear with the rest of the room silent to hear any beeping at all. The tip is very flexible and does appear to be water proof.

I paid less than $10 with shipping, they were to me in a reasonable time, and they were pretty much exactly as described.Pros: The flip-up outer lenses are extremely handy, much easier than my full hood. The lenses are mounted behind a simple retaining ring that required no special tools to remove, thus allowing me to swap out with other lenses of the appropriate size.Cons: The clear inner lenses are cheap plastic and have an odd bevel along the edge that distorts your view.I simply removed the inner elements. I'll be replacing them at some point with the glass from a pair of UV photography filters (such asTiffen 52mm UV Protection Filter), since impact resistance is not a requirement.

Also it didn't fit snugly to my face no matter how tight I made it. After some slight modifications to make the nose area more comfortable I went to cut some steal. Well that's when I finally figured out what shade it was, must be a 10-11. I couldn't see anything. So overall I got what I paid for.

They were a real hit among partygoers, and they fit really well over my eyeglasses. The flip-up lenses were also really handy for bumbling around in the dark.My two very minor complaints:1. The strap has a tendency to pull out of its supports when it's under tension, but I got around that by sizing it to my head and then pinning it in place. Not really a big deal, but it's a bit of a pain to put the straps back in.2. The goggles have a tendency to fog up. I wasn't really expecting much in the way of ventilation for a $5 pair of welding goggles (looks like Amazon overstocked on Halloween because they're down to $2.50 a pair now) but it did affect my ability to wear them for a long period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks!","review":"Wonderful goggles, just perfect for welding and grinding with the flip up front!

The primary focus of Low's music is droning bass guitar that carries you along wave after wave of wonderously sad sounds.

Her last album delved into haunting old-country territory. \\"Escondida,\\" however, pulls in elements of several different genres to create a uniquely \\"Jolie\\" sound.To put the album's aura into musical terms, imagine a voice that lies somewhere between Cat Power and Billie Holliday, and a lyrical setting just off the back porch. There are several songs that break out of this description; \\"Sascha\\" reminds me of New York, reminiscent of the narrative stylings of a Dean Martin song. \\"Old-fashioned Morphine\\" absolutely effuses the back streets of 1920's Chicago, and \\"Mad Tom Bedlam\\" is a scat-inspired, interesting interpretation of an old English folk song.Definitely worth picking up, it's like buying five or six different albums, as Jolie Holland runs up and down the musical spectrum leaving trails of southern charm behind her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cascading, heartfelt, melismatic rhythms and arias.","review":"Jolie sings with style and panache.

My tastes run more towards Dar Williams, Tiff Merit, Emmylou Harriis, and Shawn Colvin for female singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid, original and refreshing","review":"If I have to compare her to someone, I'd say a mixture of Billie Holliday, Fiona Apple and Tom Waits. That being said, Jolie Holland is more herself than anything. Maybe I'd call her a Norah Jones for the more adventurous and Avant Garde listener. It really says something when an artist can impress my friends (many of whom are music-philes and avant garde music snobs) and my parents as well (more conservative tastes). Great voice and original songs. Can't recommend the disc enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"...if youre thinking of buying this record because of the Billie Holiday or Be Good Tanyas references. Sure, this album is kinda jazzy, but you'd be hard-pressed to draw any real comparisons to Billie Holiday beyond that. And yes, Jolie Holland was briefly a Tanya but the Be Good's *perfect* style of old-timey soul/folk is absent here. Instead you get spooky-sounding minimalism and half-baked compositions that manage to sound both consciously irritating and carelessly aloof at the same time. Also Jolie works a little too hard at unnaturally chewing her syllables, and it gets annoying pretty quickly. This album might yet grow on me, but if you're looking for the melodical sweetness and charm of the Be Goods or Billie, dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indie Girl Imitates Billie Holiday Imitating a Hillbilly","review":"I'm not sure what the young lady is trying to accomplish here...potentially compelling folk-blues material collapses under the weight of annoying , exaggerated Appalachian vocal affectations (\\"Give me that ol'-fashion mor-phyne...it's good enough for mae\\").

Even the threat of the Fleur-du-Mal is not enough at this point.What I liked about The Meq was the fact we were experiencing it through a newcomer's (Z) eyes; but here, Z is a little older, a little more wise, and there are parts where I find it difficult to sympathize with him.What Steve Cash is doing in three books could possibly be done in two.I want to like this book and will probably go back to it soon.

Attacks are broken up into zones (headbutts, punches, and kicks) and you get special abilities in those zones depending on what combat style you choose with your feats. You can get special \\"finishing\\" moves, such as elbow drops that deal large ammounts of damage when the opponent is prone. Over all, it allows for a complex and detailed hand-to-hand combat system that i would suggest for anyone who liked monks in DnD but found them bland.

After reading the fine print, I realized they were going to send me a reconditioned unit, and by now, there are better products on the market. Curiously enough, the unit still hasn't arrived. Additionally, you need to sign up for their service, which is pricey. If I have to have a reconditoned unit, I may as well have the top of the line reconditioned PDA.

If you are more interested in the theatrical aspects of musical theatre and seek that verve and spunk, those dramatic and exaggerated characterizations, then you will probably prefer the original 1953 and TV 1958 recordings with Rosalind Russell. If, on the other hand, you are more keen to hear contemporary sound quality with focus on Bernstein's music, then this 1999 album with Sir Simon Rattle, conductor, would be the better choice. Moreover, Kim Criswell, Audra McDonald, and the great Thomas Hampson are first rate vocalists and seem to be having fun. Bernstein wrote this music after that other Town show, On The Town, and this recording not only does justice to it but can serve to refresh the public's mind on how splendid was his Broadway writing before that blockbuster, West Side Story.

I turn it on and let it heat up while I put on my makeup and by the time I finish, it's ready to go. This straightener also has an automatic shut-off and the cord is very long.My only complaint about this straightener would be that the buttons to change the temperature are located in an inconvenient spot, so sometimes when I'm using it, I accidentally hit the buttons.

I was concerned to see that one reader, who said he was a real highlander, found it to be unauthentic. However, for my own part, I was struck by a couple of discrepancies in the beginning of the book. Namely, Claire breaks a couple of crystal glasses belonging to one of the leading male characters (I forget his name) and nothing is said about the financial loss to the character. Crystal is expensive, yet he seems not the least concerned -- nor is she. He only obesesses about the question in his mind as to whether she did it deliberately or by accident. Apparently all the characters must be independently wealthy, since Claire also engages this man to do some time-consuming historical research for her, and no one bothers their head about any monetary compensation for his efforts. True, he is crazy about Claire's daughter, but still you would think the question of money would at least be mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO Well Written!","review":"What a pleasure to read a well-written book with so much thought and research.

And when it was time, I went back to Scotland with the Fraser's with great dread in my heart. They knew what was coming and so did I. The only thing that made it more bearable for me was that there was yet another book to read, 'Voyager'. So I knew that no matter what happened, it wouldn't be the end of either Jamie or Claire!

If you enjoyed \\"Outlander\\" you are sure to enjoy the continuation of Jamie and Claire's story. All of the characters from the first novel are back, with more romance and political intrigue than ever.At nearly a thousand pages, this book is longer than \\"Outlander\\", but generally the pacing is good and the action comes fast, so you keep reading. I did feel like the third quarter of the book dragged a little bit, but all in all I really enjoyed the read.I would not recommend that a reader new to the \\"Outlander\\" series start with this book, since there is very little flashback to the first book, and you really need the background of the first book to understand what is going on in \\"Dragonfly.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The beauty continues","review":"Diana Gabaldon continues to keep me enthralled in her book. I found it very emotional, hysterically funny. She lets you know her characters..feel their emotions and feel their pain. I began the third of the series and these are books I will surely read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my God, I love it","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the books in the Outlander series. The audio version is very well done. The character voices are wonderfully done, and all I expected.The only concern I had before purchasing was nowhere on the description did it specify unabridged. There are annotated versions available, but I did not want one. I would have returned i were it so; as it is I am very happy with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pale Follow-up","review":"This book was a pale follow-up to the compelling \\"Outlander\\". Way too wordy, the editors could've easily shaved off 100 pages by taking out repetative or unnecessary descriptions (note to author: sometimes less is more). The main characters are just as engaging as in the first novel, but what really seemed to bother me was that nearly all of the secondary characters were described using variations of \\"plump\\", \\"round\\", etc, etc. Does the author really beleive that she needs to make her main characters that much more attractive by surrounding them with larger people? I found this quite offensive. The vast majority of the book is predictable and drags along at much too slow a pace. The saving grace was the short third act of the book wherein they return to Scotland and the action picks up. All in all though, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Sequel!","review":"I debated for a month or so after readingOutlander (20th Anniversary Edition): A Novelabout continuing with the series. The first book was truly outstanding and I didn't want to ruin it with a series that went downhill or was drug out for thousands of pages. I was so wrong! I loved \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\" almost as much as its predecessor. It was not as action packed, but I liked the pace of the plot. I loved reading about Jamie and Claire's time in Paris. The infamous Black Jack Randall (best villain EVER. Love to hate him!) returns with a surprise! Just a great story all around. Beware though, after the heartwrenching ending, you will be on toVoyager (Outlander)straight away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!","review":"I loved this book as much as the first one!

This one does not disappoint. Diana Gabaldon weaves an extraordinary tale that is addicting. I actually just finished the last book in the series, and restarted them again. Currently re-reading this book. So good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"While I loved the book, the audio version was disappointing","review":"There are so many backup characters , such as Master Raymond, and Mother Hildegard, that have been deleted in the audio version. These characters not only add richness to the initial book, but they are fairly important to the development of the later books! I know being \\"abridged\\" means editing some out, but I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I bought the cd because I wanted to experience the books in a new way; that is, hearing the accents, instead of just imagining them. Also, the majority of love scenes have been deleted as well. I'd have thought that they could leave in bits and pieces without snipping the entire sections! I love these books, but I won't buy the rest of the cd's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Things that make you go hmmmm...","review":"I just couldn't get into this book. I skimmed alot and still felt like I got the gist of the story. It could have been so much better....IF IT WASN'T SOOO LONG! Good grief, how many descriptions of shoes or flies or whatever is completely irrevelent to the story do we need? Claire is a \\"healer\\" but she pretty much dismisses the rape of a friend as something the girl just needs to snap out of??? Any WHY did it take 2-3 days to get to the castle from the stones the first few trips but the last trip took just a few hours? I can't figure Jamie out either....he cries constantly and doesn't seem to mind people knowing he was raped. I just don't think that is the way things were back then. And if I here one more \\"story\\" of how his loving father bent him over the fence and thrashed him I am going to be verra, verra sick, you ken? Don't think I can handle anymore of these books or I may find my own circle of stones so I can bash my head against them......"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY MOST FAVORITE STORIES EVER!!!!!!!!","review":"If you are purchasing this book first, pick up Outlander too, so that you can start the story at the beginning! Claire and Jamie are like family to me, I've re- re- re- read the now 5 books so many times they are falling apart. I still laugh and cry at times! This story and the characters are so compelling you want them to go on forever. I am anxiously awaiting the last (sigh) book, ( I finished The Fiery Cross in record time!).

An author of extraordinary vision and THE storyteller of our time.Thank you, Diana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book (the whole series) are simply the best","review":"I have read the whole Outlander series, and I must say they are the best books I have ever read. I am not much into cheesy romance novels, but these books are perfection. They are very deep, but do play on fantasy. I recommed these books to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor pacing difficult to get through not holding my attention","review":"i have to admit I'm not a romance reader. I downloaded Outlander thinking it was sci fi/fantasy. I kept reading because Gabaldon has a good ear for dialogue & the pacing of the novel was decent despite the fact that I find Claire a perfectly hateful character.Dragonfly follows up Outlander without the pacing and quite frankly without much interesting happening to the point where I cant make it past the first 90 pages of the book. Bored out of my mind and not wasting any more of my time. Wish I could get my money back because the interesting stuff drops off shortly after the sample section ends.I am officially done with the series and with Gabaldon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not follow the back jacket description","review":"While I LOVED the Outlander book, I was highly disappointed with the second book, \\"Dragonfly in Amber.\\" It was very misleading from the back jacket cover's description of what the book was supposed to be about, and I was therefore highly disappointed wtih the direction the book took. It was very difficult for me to get through. Where I raced through all 642 pages of the first book in less than a week, this book took me almost three months to finish.If you can manage to get through this book though, definitely read the third and fourth books. They are well worth the money and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRAGONFLY IN AMBER","review":"The book, second in this series by Diana Gabaldon, is good. I am rating the company I purchased it from, Blue Ridge Books. The book arrived in a timely manner but the condition of the book is less than what they described. The cover was torn apart and in very bad shape. However, the hardback cover and the book itself was in good condition but obviously old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad excuse for \\"historic novel\\"","review":"If you like Hustler you will love this book - if I wanted Pornography I would order it on Pay per View. Totally unnecessary porn as in Mister Raymond putting fingers into Claire's vagina in order to save her life! Randall buggering Jamie and Jamie letting him after Randall had already let Claire leave. Yeah I know he gave his word of honor but I don't believe any true Highlander would let himself be buggered for the sake of honor. If you are anything like me you will find yourself skipping pages at a time in order to avoid this trash.Boring to the point of fatigue through a lot of it. If you are having trouble sleeping this is the book for you.Maudlin enough at times to bring on nausea.Crisis after crisis after crisis and all they have to do after each crisis is bang each other's brains out and that makes everything all right.I'm sorry I had to give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten, Gets Boring ZZZZZZ","review":"It was too drawn out and puffed up. I did not like the way it opened 18 years \\"after\\" Outlander ended, but I went along hoping it would get better. I wish it had picked up right after outlander ended tho. And skipped that preposterous prologue."},{"rating":"1","title":"one word--boring","review":"I am so glad I didn't purchase this book because it'll be a waste of good money and time. For a book thats over 900 pages long, I feel like I'm reading a bad soap opera that drags on and on and on. For instance, part one of the book can be condensed into one chapter, if not a couple of pages, but it stretches to 80 some odd pages! Overall, this book is too focused on the background information to really emphasize the main characters of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I was really wondering when I started this book if it was indeed the second book in the Outlander series. I am surprised by the way it began, but thrilled with the way it progressed. Another fantastic book. Can't wait to begin the next one. I ordered the rest of the series and look forward to reading them all. I read the first two in only a week, and I work full time. It was well worth the sleep deprevation and the complaints from my husband :-)......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"You will love this book!!! I , too, loved the ending.....this book is about steadfastness in relationships between men and women and also about faithfulness between friends. Jamie and Claire have a relationship based on love and their love for one another is steadfast regardless of the circumstances. I can harldy wait to read Voyager!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written but Too Slow for Me","review":"I don't normally review books, but felt motivated to write a review for this book, simply because I was sooooo disappointed in it! I really wanted to like this book. I loved Outlander and was excited to have a new series to read that would last for a long time. I saved reading Dragonfly for a time when I needed a good pick me up; however, I just couldn't get into it. I found it sooo dull that I finally stopped reading it after about 200 pages. I rarely stop a book in the middle, and was reluctant to do so here. I kept reading hoping that it would get interesting any minute, but finally I got too bored and just gave up. Big bummer. I am still giving it 2 stars because it was obviously meticulously researched and was well written. It was just way too slow for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed, cried and couldn't put it down!","review":"I'm don't normally read romance but had happened upon a historical romance involving time travel that I had loved and recommended to a friend. She is turn recommended Diane Gabaldon's series. I've just finished Dragonfly in Amber and loved every moment. I don't think there was one page in this book or the last, Outlander, where my mind wandered. I highly recommend this book! This author is unbelievably gifted in her abilities to keep your interest along a finely woven, but often unexpected, story line. I can't wait to start Voyager!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"Hard cover book in good condition - for the low price, this is an excellent value. Mailed and received in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonfly in Amber","review":"Diana Gabaldon is a first class writer, I have read all she has written in published books. Kindle Books are usually very good, but this one had very many typo mistakes, I guess who ever produced it did not proof read it properly, the half spelled words and other mistakes were enough to annoy, but not spoil the book over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drgonfly in amber","review":"Highly entertaining and captivating book.

Those of you who would NEVER read a romance book----TRY GABALDON. I was told over a year ago to pick up Outlander and ignored the advice. Woe is me not to have found this author sooner. These are not picture perfect characters or settings, this is hardcore, real-life writing done at it's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be something wrong with me because I thought it was boring","review":"I don't get why this book is so popular. I liked OUTLANDER. Very readable. Fun. Unique love story, but this one is a real struggle.I gave up on it 640 pages in after 3 months of TRYING, trying TRYING to get through this book.It's slow to start. The first time I tried to read DRAGONFLY I only got about 40 pages in before giving up. You think Brianna is going to be a larger part of the story but she's not. The part in France is pretty good, but it takes about 200 pages to get there, and the fun abruptly ends and they head back to Scotland. Scotland is where it gets boring again.Also, the back suggests that there is a lot of hot sexy action, but there is none."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsure","review":"At a used bookstore, the owner and a lady were talking about this book. The owner told me to just read the 2nd one, because the book repeats so much. A 100 pages in, I knew I was missing a lot. I went to Books A Million and realized the store owner sold me the 3rd book in the series. So i bought Outlander and this 1nd book. Outlander was pretty good, I have read far better books. Now I am dragging through on this one, skipping pages. I know what happens from starting the 3rd book. The Randall raping of Jamie, is just plain disgusting and not what I expect in historical fiction/love story/novel, whatever this book is classified in. I will continue to skip pages and just finish this book, eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book has never made me CRY before!!","review":"Oh gosh, it is almost embarrassing to admit this, but I actually CRIED when I read this book! Real tears! Not just oh my gosh I am so sad, but actually felt the heart ache and shed the tears. Man, Diana is good! I love this series. I do agree with some of the other posts though that the author could leave out some of the immense details. I love details, but she goes off on bunny trails sometimes that really get me sleepy and anxious for her to continue the story. It actually somewhat reminds me of Dean Koontz style of writing. But dont let any of that lead you astray! Her books are fantastic, and will leave you wanting for more. I cant wait to read Voyager!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just kept reading and couldn't stop!!","review":"Okay, so \\"Outlander\\" was wonderful...I read it in about two days...I had bought \\"Dragonfly In Amber\\" and \\"Voyager\\" along with it so once I was finished with one I could start the next. Four days later and no sleep...I finished the three. I loved \\"outlander\\"...but this book grabbed me. I just could not put this down! Granted, there are some very graphic parts to these books, but, if you love the historical aspect and the descriptions of the times, you will fall in love.

A great read, I'd recommend it to all romance lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Gabaldon","review":"I now have all the books by Diana in the Claire/Jamie saga and now eagerly await the next one (she has promised another). This is the most wonderful love story set in such dangerous times and I would recommend everyone (ladies that is - this not being of particular interest to our unimaginative menfolk) to take the best chair in the house and settle down to live with Claire and Jamie through their good times and bad times. It can get a trifle raunchy as a 20th century woman goes back in time and teaches her man \\"how it's done in my old/future life\\" - wonderful stuff!!

Well I lasted about three days and had to download it so I could get my daily fix of claire and Jamie. I might need a support group to curb my adiction. I take my Kindle everywhere so if I have a few minutes I can read a page or two.I am not a romance novel reader I actually read alot of non fiction but there is something about these books that just sucked me in. Kudos to the author for being a great story teller. Just finishing this book and will not wait to download the third book.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonfly In Amber","review":"I am really enjoying the Outlander series.

Everything is beautiful about it, the history between scotland, england, and france, the romance between the two lovers from different worlds and time.

After devouring Outlander (book 1) I immediately purchased this book. I'm 12% through it and really losing interest, quick...There is a bit of a confusing person change (the author goes from saying \\"I\\" to saying \\"Claire\\" and then back again). And so far, I feel nothing for any of the other characters (except Jamie and Claire). Even Jamie (sadly) seems flatter.There is a lot less romance and a lot more sex in this book, which is completely unnecessary, if you ask me.I will finish this book, if I can.

Waiting would have been sheer torture!Beautifully written devotion, interesting, realistic historical aspect - very intriguing. Very glad to find authors who can explore married love and passion and are at the same time intellectual. - I love the Twilight Series and am glad to have discovered Gabaldon and am currently reading this book (and the entire series). Until these two series, frankly had given up on romantic fiction. Stephenie Meyer and Diana Gabaldon have done great work in creating strong, ethical people - with integrity.

If i have to read about another dinner party or chess match or deciphering of letters my brain might explode from the tedium. I absolutely loved outlander but this one was too slow for me.

Sometimes, the narrative takes unbelievable turns, yet the author has met each of his subjects, and, while his text is by necessity anecdotal, his is a refreshing treatment of a country in which everything has been penetrated by the ruling party. He recounts stories of men who dress as women, of the narcotraficantes, and of the chamber of deputies' section called The Bronx, where misbehaving is both common and a speciality. This is an excellent view of the informal economy and various means that are used to get around Mexico's reliclike system of social, economic, and political organization. Highly recommended. . . .\\"--Library Journal"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive Source for Inspiration","review":"Generously adorned throughout this book are beautiful photographs of classic Bungalow homes from across the nation.

This negates explaining anything which I suppose I could overlook if it was not for the \\"Let's sing to explain something\\" approach.Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but in my experience, dialoge explains and moves the story. The music and dance numbers comes when there is so much emotion, it cannot be put into words.

The ideal of a musical based on a Biblical hero with a modern score and little dialogue has been done before with great success. To attempt to repeat that formula by lesser artists was folly. The worst aspect of this musical is found it it's music and lyrics. The music is totally out of place and the lyrics are terrible at best. The choreography looks foolish. sometimes laughable and I am surprised by Bob Iscoves unimaginative direction. Living in Los Angeles, I too read the bad reviews and elected not to attend. But was this musical as bad as the reviews claimed? Oh yes and probably even worse on closer inspection. It brings to the stage not even one interesting moment. Painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good enough for camp !","review":"This is a terrible show. The lyrics are childish, often repeating the same line many times in a row. The mikes curved around the actors faces are terribly distracting and more in keeping with a rock concert than a biblical musical. The sets are unattractive and boring. Val Kilmer is horribly miscast and UNattractive to the point of being unwatchable. He should NEVER have been shown without a shirt as a young Moses. He was obviously a 40 year + man! It was also obvious that by the time he got to the last song that his not so great voice was giving out.This was not even good enough to qualify as a campy production and it was truly a painful experience to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"TEN COMMENDMENTS - THE MUSICAL","review":"I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING MYSELF TO SUFFER THROUGH ACT TWO YET - -I MAY VERY WELL NEVER SEE IT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Inspirational!","review":"I bought this DVD to see Adam Lambert as Joshua.

Vernon spends a great deal of time developing each character, but what could be a long process is compensated by tremendous detail. The reader really feels like she knows the characters, how they feel and how they will react to some pretty interesting situations. Action packed is a mere cliché in describing how the many-layered story unfolds after Vernon establishes that there is a dark, insidious force manipulating each and every event.

But the point is they are all together on one CD with excellent sound, adequate orchestral accompaniment, and (by the way) good notes about the composers and the complete texts with English (and French) translations.

This product lets you use it to enter codes into any game to modify it. Extra lives, extra equipment, unlimited this or that, and anything you want. With the Gameshark and its codes, you enter the codes once, and the Gameshark saves them so that you do not have to ever type them again. Plus the Gameshark comes with 1000s of codes for 100s of games already preloaded on it! If you get tired of entering codes, then there is something on the back of the shark that lets you hook it into your PC so you can type codes on your PC. The Gameshark includes with a video that shows you how to make your very own codes! Master hackers for games like WWF No Mercy and Star Wars Pod Racer have even made entire new levels and totally changed the game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad news","review":"I used my friend's game shark on one of my games.

Then when i went to play a game after turning on the gameshark without a game my nintendo would not work anymore.

The trashcan did open with the sensor, but if I had a bit of trash to put in there I needed to turn the can off and open the lid. When I finished I had to turn the can back on. Now the sensor and motor are not working. I think with the amount of money you pay for this it should work for more than a year.

The sensor may be better, but the circular base takes up quite a bit more space, and the wire ring used to hold the bag in place doesn't work nearly as well.So, if you are going to get a touchless trash can, go with the original one. You can tell the difference because the original has more of a rectangular footprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad product","review":"Bought this trash can with high hopes, but after 6 months the sensor on the lid went crazy.
