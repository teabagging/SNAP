The problem isn't the paper, per se, but that it's paper pages WITH FLAPS for the kids to open and close. My kids are gonna want to open those flaps, and since the pages/flaps are flimsy paper instead of cardboard, those flaps are going to stay on for only two or three readings--max.

Actually, in trying the StressAssist, I was looking for a cheaper version of Lumiday, or something with similar ingredients. No comparison!I concluded that the strongest ingredient in Lumiday (and not in the StressAssist) is St. John's Wort.Micro-doses (1/4 capsule) of St. John's Wort worked for me for a while.

If you are a fan of SNES-era RPGs, I would consider this a must-play, and almost certainly a must-own. If you are simply a fan of RPGs or the Final Fantasy series, I would recommend either of the two Nintendo-console remakes--Final Fantasy IV Advance for the GBA Advance or Final Fantasy IV DS for the NDS. Both games have superior translations as well as the readdition of items and spells which were removed from the game when it ported from the Super Famicom to the SNES. Their graphical styles are different, however, as well as their \\"bonus content\\" and difficulty (the GBA game feels easier than even the SNES version--largely due to the extra content--while the NDS game is harder than both).I heartily advise against the PSX version of the game, which has abominable load times and an unremarkable translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Games of All Time...","review":"This game is one of the greatest games ever.

And the graphics were great for their time, back in the good old days of SNES. The characters are great too, Cecil, Kain, Rosa, etc. This game just had a perfect balance of everything. If you liked other SNES games like Zelda, Secret of Mana, Mystic Quest, Illusion of Gaia etc. you will love this one.

Not because of the academic jargon -- there is little or none. Because he kept dropping in names of obscure punk rock groups or fan mags or ezines and expecting me to know all about them, he kept starting discussions in the middle, and most infuriating, he assumed that readers positively worshipped Elvis, so if he alluded to what happened in Tupelo in 1957, or Elvis' relationship with his cousins, we would nod and say \\"oh, sure.\\" Casual readers, beware -- in order to understand this book, you need to have read at least a dozen biographies of Elvis, watch all of his movies a dozen times, and have every word of every song he ever wrote memorized.

I have read both his previous two books, and although they were great, they do not compare to The Maker's Diet. The new book really tells it like it should be. I really believe anyone in search of a better self should read the Maker's Diet. It is not only about the way you eat but the way you live, and The Maker's Diet covers all the important aspects that matter in one's life.

It came out three years after it was initially announced, but still had a MAJOR bug in it that forced you to restart the game after getting about 80% of the way through. Anyone starting out on this game should consult an Equinox guru, before getting halfway through, to learn how to avoid this problem. (This bug is the only reason why the game doesn't get my fifth star.) Otherwise, Equinox is a huge, attractive, challenging, but not impossible 3-D dungeon romp.

The story is strictly storybook-standard fodder, non-violent and pleasing to simple minds. The graphics and music are not even worth mentioning, as they cannot rightfully be called Final Fantasy material.But considering the target market, it would be unfair to totally trash this game.

It takes under 10 hours to beat, and even a six year-old could probably beat it. That's pretty much the point of it.

I was a little disconcerted by the bit of clear plastic that extends from the end of the plug when the TOSLINK cable is inserted into the adapter (not to be confused with the protective plastic covering). It protrudes maybe an 1/8 of an inch and seems very fragile. I can't really tell if it is supposed to be there from the pictures provided by Amazon. Anyway, the adapter w/o the cable fit easily into my HTPC's optical out but required more force than I'm comfortable with when the TOSLINK cable was attached.

Now regular 3.5 mm analog audio devices (e.g. my apple earphones) fit very loosely and do not make a clicking sound when inserted.

Got the product for way less than I thought I was going to have to spend. Product arrived in a nice little bag with even a little protector on the tip.

I suspect the adapter did not fully reach the transceiver inside the jack.Then I had to chew away at the adapter because it was now impossible to remove.

I wonder if the producers of \\"Cars\\" received some money from the business.Also, I wonder if tales of adorable cars are really the wisest entertainment choices we can make for our kids. How much of a movie like this is entertainment, and how much is PR for the automobile economy?I thought \\"Finding Nemo\\" was a much better movie for kids, and it had a strong message about respect for marine life and care of the oceans (which are under duress due to warming waters).I gave \\"Cars\\" 2 stars instead of 1 because I haven't seen the whole film, and maybe there are some aspects of the film that I'd appreciate if I looked more closely at it.For a regular source of good media for children, I'd recommend \\"Mothering\\" magazine.

I doubt too many people have ever looked at their vehicle as something with a life of its own, unlike with their toys (or even bugs for that matter). I also can't avoid noticing the similarity to another movie, Doc Hollywood, which by the way, was truly mediocre.That said, the Pixar excelence is present here and there's is no denying they got the most out of this story.

It's so good, that viewing it can actually be tolerated by adults repeatedly! Our picks in movies have to be attitude-minimum, since my little one picks up on it and imitates. The 'tude in \\"Cars\\" characters is shown to be unacceptable behavior to other characters. The soundtrack is well-done, featuring a nice array of old, and remade and new songs. It's also free of sing-song tunes, which grate the nerves if you happen to want to watch movies with your children or just be in the same house while they watch!

It just isn't as well written a story, and I believe most will be disappointed to find very few actual racing scenes. And nowhere near as funny as their previous releases. One highlight though, is the message it brings. A reminder to all of us that, winning is not nearly as important, as how we treat others in the process of achieving our goals.

At first, the idea of cars talking was a little off-putting to me; but if you can accept the idea that cars can be animated, taking the place of people and all other living creatures in their world, then you can appreciate the hilarity of the jokes, double-entendres, and the universality of a story about a young punk \\"kid\\" who learns how to grow up and slow down, while at the same time bringing an old \\"man\\" out of hermitage and hiding. This is a story of growth and change, with a good dose of innocent comedy (supplied by the character Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) a touch of romance, and a bit of history. Non-Nascar fanatics like myself can still appreciate this new notch in Pixar's belt. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved by kids of all ages","review":"I have been forced to watch this movie at least 20 times and I still enjoy everything about it.

I am so in love with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite a masterpiece","review":"Cars is an enjoyable movie with a good message, but it just isn't as good as the Pixar films that came before and after it. I'll give my reasons for saying so here:1) So far, this is Pixar's longest movie--almost two hours-- but that's mostly because the plot spends a lot of time just hanging around, doing nothing.2)Unlike, say, WALL-E and The Incredibles, Cars is more of a kiddie movie with some added nostalgia elements for the parents watching. And3)Somehow, as Roger Ebert said, it lacks the extra push of other Pixar films.Don't get me wrong-- I certainly wouldn't call this movie bad. In fact, it's much better than most of the money-grubbing, short-attention-span, plascicky-looking CGI flicks out there.For parents: there's basically nothing offensive here, except maybe the whole \\"Piston Cup\\" scenario, but that would go over the heads of most young children anyway.I hope this helps!~~LJB"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"fantastic story, animation, soundtrack, etc. should have definately won the oscar over the penquin movie - has many more layers - friendship, not giving up, what's really important in life (not winning or money... fyi) and - just a very fun film overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"CARS","review":"Arrived quickly and in great condition--the kids have watched it over and over--what can I say?

As an adult writing this for other adults, this may be less a review, and more of a bewildered diatribe. I wish I could put my finger on it exactly what was missing here. It just didn't seem to have the magic of Toy Story 1 or 2, The Incredibles or Finding Nemo. I also loved A Bug's Life. However, Monsters Inc. kind of fell flat for me as well. The voice acting in Cars from Owen Wilson and Paul Newman was serviceable, to be sure. The animation was top notch as well. There is just something missing with the heart of the movie. I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one, but if you are looking for the the sweet, heartwarming type of movie as the ones I previously mentioned, look elsewhere. Children, however, will probably not miss the absent sense of wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extrordinary Movie!","review":"My husband is a car enthusiast. We missed this movie at the theatre. I knew he really wanted to see it, so I bought it for him as a stocking stuffer. He was delighted! The movie is extrordinary! It's not just for kids! There is much more to see in the movie that the movie itself, just keep you eyes open and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cars - widescreen edition","review":"Excellent family movie. Good graphics, well done, great for the whole family. Deals with arrogance, prejudice, keeping promises, and being nice while being an extremely funny movie that never gets old or cliched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"My wife and I purchased this movie so we would know what the heck the grandkids were talking about. However, the movie contains a couple of good life lessons (real important stuff) and as a car guy I really appreciated the car detail. I would recommend this movie, loads of harmless fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very entertaining. Wayyy too long.","review":"I've enjoyed every Pixar movie I've seen......except this one. It was not entertaining, and was almost never funny. The movie is 2 hours long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over after the first hour. My wife and I had to turn it off at the 1.5 hour mark. Overall, it doesn't seem good for either adults (because of the above mentioned) or for kids (because of the length). Pixar has so many other movies. See those"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun movie!","review":"As a grandma of little boys, Cars has a special place in our lives! It streamed wonderfully, with no interruptions or problems!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Just as described, works perfectly and looks as if it was brand new. My Son loves it, Thank You!-Jon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for the CG and the excitement - cool outlook and warm within","review":"Neither a car nor a sports fan, I can still experience the excitement and fuss over the race as depicted in the first 15 minutes of the film. The CG is so real that one can't tell the difference between the real thing in some of the scenes.What fascinates me is the last hour when McQueen (Owen Wilson) reached Radiator Springs and bonded with the local folk. The scene is breathtaking, the story of the former glory well captured and things got interesting when Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) started to flex his muscles. All these made the final race in California more sentimental and much anticipated than ever. The message is clear, whether it will be heeded is another matter, but it is very worth telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Blu Ray Title, but...","review":"My 4 year old son absolutely loves this movie. I have the DVD and I bought the Blu Ray version for my son for Christmas. I also have a Panasonic DMP-BD10-AK Blu Ray player that \\"upscales\\" standard DVDs as well. The \\"but\\" in my review is that it is very difficult to see the differences between the standard DVD and the Blu Ray versions. The real cheesecake for the Blu Ray version lies in the fantastic sound quality, java menus, and the bonus HD content on this disc. If you have a robust home theater with solid surround sound, then this is a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile Cacophany","review":"We watched the first ten minutes of this cacophonous drivel and then switched it off. Our daughter didn't even object. Compared with the ingenuity of Aardman's Pirates and Arthur Christmas Disney and Pixar are starting to slouch. Shamefully bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Filled Film","review":"Cars is a fun filled film that is enjoyable for the whole family. Cars is about a race car, Lightning McQueen, that seeks fame and happiness in in all the wrong places. He thinks true happiness is in fame, fortune, and fine oil. He later realizes that happiness is not found in those things but through friendships and the cars he cares about most. The authors very well got their point across. True happiness is found when you please those around you. This film is full of humor, heartwarming events, and is enjoyable for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Disney release was rushed.","review":"I'm a language teacher and I have a number of DVDs that I use at school as language tools. DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English. Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD. I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I suppose it's my fault for assuming, but I feel ripped off just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie for all ages","review":"my boys LOVE this movie. they would watch it everyday if we would let them. my husband and i also enjoyed the movie tremendously. it is really well done and has enough adult humor to keep us entertained through multiple viewings. definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"All I can say is this is one of the best movies that Disney has released in years and my favorite so far this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"We were very pleased with our service.","review":"I accidentally ordered the wrong item to begin with and was able to cancel it and reorder the exact item that we wanted.

The clever animation that transformed \\"vehicles\\" into people was delightful. The voices of Paul Newman and Owen Wilson were perfect for their roles. Pair this movie with \\"Talledaga Nights\\" and you have THE 'motor head' evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUTE, but some suggestive humor.","review":"My whole family loved this movie! Some of the humor is \\"adult\\", which means it goes over the heads of the younger kids,and it wasn't too bad, but I kinda wish they could have made it interesting to adults, yet without being suggestive.Other than that, I really liked the movie. The voices were great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cars","review":"The dvd itself is fine yet the case was cracked! But other than that it came well within the time said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing....","review":"I am a big Disney and Pixar fan. This film was watchable, but it was far from fantastic. My son, who loves cars, couldn't even sit through it. My husband and I fell asleep while watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great compared to the Pixar classics.","review":"I liked CARS I really did like it but it lacks the magic of TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO. It is beautiful to look at since the animation is so imaginatively detailed. I can see it would be a dream come true to a Preschooler obsessed with anything that sprouts wheels. The Route 66 references were great and I hope this movie will help keep the \\"mother road\\" in the minds of younger generations. Having lived in Oklahoma I had to smile about cow er I mean tractor tipping being so enthustiastically embraced by the small town residents. The characterizations of vehicles living in \\"Radiator Springs\\" were clever but came from central casting. The most original element of \\"Cars\\" is it's depiction of a wheels only universe with nary a human about. In this vehicles only world even the bugs are tiny autos and the \\"planes\\" leave car tracks in the sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Very cute movie, entertaining and even a useful story line. My 2 and 3 year old boys are obsessed. I hope they come out with a 2nd one that is just as good as the first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice set","review":"Comes with the Blu-Ray disc, Dvd and a little metal car and a little metal red truck for my little 15 month old to play with. He loves the red truck. Overall good buy. The movie is great, but the movies catches my sons attention then loses it constantly going back and forth.

Of course, with Blu Ray, you see SO much more, but even I was surprised with how much more crisp an animated picture could be.The movie itself is cute--has a GREAT message, and of course, lots of adult humor mixed in with the kids' stuff. Great movie for all ages. Gotta have a Blu-Ray player--whether it be a PS3 or a separate unit, it's a must-have for any HD home.Oh, and the soundtrack is great, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing Grandkids","review":"This DVD has been purchased 3 times and requested twice, so I have no doubt it is a much loved movie.

He really enjoyed it when he seen the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't this the same plot as \\"Doc Hollywood\\"?","review":"Doc HollywoodDon't get me wrong - I loved the movie! Animation was great, characters were lovable, etc. I just couldn't help thinking that it was a re-vamped version of \\"Doc Hollywood\\". In \\"Doc Hollywood\\", the big-shot doctor(Michael J. Fox) on his way to Beverly Hills to be a plastic surgeon and has a car accident which destroys a fence in a tiny little town in the middle of nowhere. He's stuck in this town while his Porche is being fixed, and to make up for the damage to the fence, he must help out the town's only physician (an aging guy about to retire) as community service. In short, he ends up falling in love with the town, the townspeople, and a certain lady. He ends up going to Beverly Hills to do the plastic surgeon thing, but ultimately misses the town and the girl so much, that he returns to be the town's physician. Sound familiar? Yeah, that's what I thought too."},{"rating":"2","title":"CARS","review":"One of Disney's best, love this movie! Excellent on blu ray, both video & sound. Great addition to my HD collection.

It also has amazing values in the whole story line. Anyone at any age will enjoy this movie. Children and and person that loves cars will definately love it. My family had fun finding all of the 'hidden' cars parts in the scenery. Once you start finding them, you can't stop finding more. The animation was unbelievable. The characters were wonderful and delightful. I just cannot say anything bad about this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veering Off the Highway","review":"Cars, while technically proficient with some beautiful animation and backgrounds, is probably the weakest of the Disney/Pixar productions. There didn't seem to be much heart in the story and even when suspending disbelief, it was difficult to get the mind around the premise that cars inhabited this world.The story did pick up with the tractor tipping scene, but overall, it was somewhat less than satisfying. For a collector of the Pixar efforts, I think the movie should definitely be included as it demonstrates how Pixar is evolving as it continues to turn out movies - but this is certainly not one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"KA-CHOW! Disney & Pixar have done Again, Lighting McQueen Rollin' Along","review":"From the manufacters of Finding Nemo & the Incredibles comes a delightful & thrilling story in a world where cars speak for themselves with voice talents of the legendary Paul Newman & Owen Wilson, Owen Wilson stars as Lighting McQueen, a cocky famous race car who gets waylaid in a small Arizona town called Radiator Springs while on his way to the big race, the Piston Cup, while there he discovers the meaning of friendship. Cheech Marin, Bonnie Hunt and of course John Ratzenberger voice in this once again well done Disney & Pixar triumph, Disney & Pixar can not fail. It's exciting entertainment with the same fantasy that surrounded \\"Toy Story\\" if you seen the last 6 Disney & Pixar films continue with \\"CARS\\" Disney & Pixar make the best computer animated films"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"My five year old enjoyed this one a lot, she was very entertained, so the target audience will probably be giving this a five star rating.I knocked it down a bit just because of the general cornyness (if that's a real word) of the movie, which also meant a bit contrived and a bit predictable, etc.However, I'll be buying the dvd and I do give it a strong recommendation, go take the kids to see it at the movies, it was wholesome and fun and all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool!","review":"I loved it because of the '59 impala.I don't really like racing, butthis film makes racing pretty awesome! and I can get into it reallyeasly cause I'm a car person, even though I'm a girl.

Liked Incredibles. This REEKS!!!","review":"Wow. I though Pixar could do no wrong. But they leveled Owen Wilson, Larry \\"the cable guy,\\" and PAUL FREAKIN' NEWMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie turns racing into a boring, flat, uninteresting, \\"also animated\\" film. Pixar for so long defined memorable pictures that just happened to be animated. So many companies turned out animated, uninteresting films. But not Pixar!!! Until now... What a disappointment. We stopped the film 2/3 into it. We just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned it off halfway through due to boredom","review":"We normally love Pixar films. For instance, thought The Incredibles was, well Incredible. Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 1&2 were great, so were excited when the new Pixar film came out. We didn't catch it in the theater, so when Christmas came around, we asked for, and got it.A couple nights ago, there was nothing interesting on TV, so we decided to put in Cars. We got about halfway through, after laughing a couple of times--tractor tipping--, but then turned it off. I'm not a big NASCAR fan, but I thought, \\"Hey, it's Pixar. They can make anything fun.\\"I guess we should have checked it out of the library first, before deciding if we wanted to add it to our collection.

We just sat down to view this movie (after being told by many friends and relatives it was excellent)and I am still amazed at what I heard and saw. I even had to get up and check the box for the rating...I could not believe it was \\"G\\". The language was disgusting. I would not use the words \\"idiot\\" and \\"moron\\" in front of my children. I certinly do not want them to see it on T.V. And that is only a few of the less than wonderful terms that were used. The terrible crash scene, out running a train, trying to get another vehicle to crash...that's as far as I got and I shut it off. I am dissappointed that in todays world this is okay for our children to see. Not my kids.......I will throw it away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is bad for children","review":"Yes, your kid will be drawn to it like if he were hypnotized, and yes he will not blink for the entire duration of the film, and yes you will have some peace... momentarily. But just wait... when he starts pushing everyone out of the way like if he were in a race car, imitating the bad guy of the story, when he talks back to you using words such as \\"moron\\" and \\"idiot\\", when he runs blindly running over everything in his path like a race car, and when his creativity is null, only playing to repeat the movie, finding all other forms of play unappealing, and when he throws tantrums because he wants to see this film over and over and over and over like if there were nothing else in life, you will want to throw this movie as far far far away as you can, and as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Non-Violent Movie","review":"Our whole family loves this movie.

My nearly 3 year old kept seeing Cars merchandise and began to beg to watch the movie. To date, she had only enough attention span to stick with a 20 or 30 minute cartoon, but she held out to watch this entire movie. I wanted to rent it before buying to see whether it would actually hold her interest. It did! Good movie! My daughter also is very sensitive with any movie involving any person (cartoon person) or animal in the midst of any conflict or danger, but she managed not to get too emotionally involved since cars are the obvious source of all the drama in this movie. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Story and Music are great","review":"If you haven't seen this movie yet then buy it today!

The plot of this movie is basically \\"Sullivan Travels\\" or more exactly \\"Doc Hollywood.\\" There is a little \\"An officer and a Gentlemen\\" thrown in, but the plot is basically a highly successful city dweller gets stuck in the country, learns simplicity is sometimes better, develops sympathy and mercy for his fellow man, and finds love. Since I did not have the \\"Car\\" tie in, I found this movie rather boring. I rather watch \\"Doc Hollywood\\" again.

However, since Cars 2 is coming out, I thought I should finally watch this. I should have stayed with my initial feelings. This is the stupidest Pixar film ever. It looks pretty, sure, but the concept and story are strictly for 3 year-olds. There's nothing for the adult viewer here. The average Chevron commercial has a more entertaining story.

If you need to really understand fluid mechanics and not to continuously deal with divergences and curls, better look for another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not ideal for mathematicians","review":"This book is not ideal for mathematicians. It is written in the style of a physics book, with a large portion of the book devoted to experimental results; the theory is developed in the context of explaining these results, with little mathematical discussion of the resulting equations beyond asymptotic analysis. (This may be expected, given the word \\"Physical\\" in the title.)Overall it is a nice book. But the writing is not as clear as it could be. Some relevant properties of the example flows discussed are not stated explicitly, which I would discover by chance while working with the equations. Many of his derivations are also predicated by overly restrictive/unnecessary assumptions, with no mention of the behavior under other assumptions (although the problems require determining this in order to solve them).

It is so well written that each minor and major shock create a seamless flow within a paradox of uncontrolled energies on one level - yet controlled energies on other levels - coupled with an almost invisible hatred of the human for the entire human condition. To me, it is the most frightening book I have every read. ALso, it is in the realm of the greatest of classics. I cannot help but wonder where or not Blaise Cendrars was or had been an avid reader of Balzac (This is based upon some of his structuring of the story)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisitely depraved travelogue","review":"This may be described as an exquisitely depraved travelogue of regions both geographic and psychological. Other reviewers have more than adequately laid out the storyline and in that regard I have nothing to add.

That said, if you took pleasure from Oscar Wilde's The Portrait of Dorian Gray, J.K. Huysmans' A Rebours (Against Nature), or, stretching a bit, even the fantastical satire of The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov, then this decadent, entertaining romp may be just what the \\"doctor\\" ordered.

I chose this book because I basically the premise. The idea of a white girl getting captured at a young age by Indians and growing up among them was very interesting. What I found hard to believe as I continued reading was how easy Wolf Shadow found her. It was just too much of a coincedence that she happened to be living in the village where he grew up. When they were both captured by the Crow, she didn't seem too distraught when she thought her family was killed and for that matter neither did he about his. There just wasn't any depth to this book.

Drawing from scuptural attitudes, ritual practices, and political atmospheres, Rhodes places the Athenian Acropolis not at an assumed \\"zenith\\" of Greek architecture, but in a very alive and therefore constantly evolving context of artistic achievement. This books appeals to those who enjoy free thought in the most enlightening sense of the words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Not only is Professor Rhodes's book far from boring, but rare in that it allows easy access to a scholar's interpretation of Greek architecture.

Standout tracks on this record, well they are all good so I don't know. I really like \\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Mud Hill\\" a lot, but I like all of the songs on this. Go buy this record, you will love it. Cool cover art and a neat fold out inside with pictures of the band. Really cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"precious rock journalism from amazon.com","review":"An honest music fan is not going to care whether or not the band is on a small label or not unless it really affects the sound. Why would I be glad that Samiam didn't get rich? They have stuck to their own sound all along in my opinion. Unfortunately, the amazon.com reviewer was too interested in his or her very unoriginal rock journalism story about the band to actually listen to the record. I have seen Samiam perform many times and listened to their records many hours and feel comfortable saying they keep getting better but they do not sound like anyone else. Jason's vocals are unmistakable, and so is the guitar (the guitarist also plays in Knapsack). Only Samiam can make a song about boredom and longing so compelling. My recommendation is: Hear them live or borrow one of their albums from someone you know, and then buy this particular record at your local music store. Another recommendation: Amazon.com should hire someone else to review this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewing the VHS tape of Martha's Vineyard","review":"This VHS tape does a good job of explaining the history of Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and the Elisabeth Islands.

And third and last of all, we don't really want something that teaches you capitals of countries and stuff. But if I were you, I'd pick something else. If you like TV stuff that you can play at home try: Yoshi's Story 64, Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. If you like To-Go stuff, try: Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island, Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOO","review":"don't be fooled I'm one mario fan but in this game you answer homework?

This is because the set includes CDs, a textbook (this is not an audio alone course), and a dictionary.However, this series generally does not include enough grammar explanations within the lessons (the French one has a grammar section at the back). Therefore, you may spend a lot of time imitating phrases instead of fully understanding why they are structured that way.Nevertheless, it is a great way to be introduced to the language, and afterwards (or in conjunction with this one), you may want to include more immersion type courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"There is much material with this course-all worthless. If you want to read 100's of phrases and then hear them on cd, then this will work. If you want to be taught, this is not for you. It is a list of phrases, the end. The dictionary lettering is so small as to be unreadable. The travel phrases are on a tiny accordion card.

I think they're better because they lack the stilted artifice so common with language CD's such as this one.

Though the book was relatively short, about 150 pages, that's a feet for me. For that to happen a story has to move me along, interest me and make me beg for more when I put it down--and I couldn't. The characters are as strong as biblical heroes. They speak with a very real backwoods believable prose. I know these people Bulley writes about. He is truly a master of the craft and I applaud the challenge of taking on such an idea. Killing God--whoda' thunk it. Bulley, that's who."},{"rating":"2","title":"God is dead!","review":"This book was utterly fancinating. I was completely captivately, yes by the Main character Eddy, but also by the extremely well done supporting chacter, Paul the gay bapist minister. I am gay, and so my heart went out to this character as he struggled with his sexuality, and with his new and uncomfortable status as a gay man. From minister to pervert is a LONG drop! let me tell you!There is this one passage in the book where Eddy is trying to teach paul how to get along better in society by being more \\"out.\\" Eddy does this by, basically ... assulting other straight men in the restaurant. I laughed out loud! ...Great, great book. Everyone should own one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to be stimulated","review":"Weapon in Heaven tries to turn you away almost from the first page. But instead you find yourself turning pages. The protagonist, Eddie Licklighter, turns on God with a hatred so palpable you may squirm, especially if were raised in any of the major religions. Another major character, a minister named Paul, commits a graphic and unpardonable sin, which ratchets up the discomfort another notch or two. But these two people find each other and begin a journey which challenges the traditional God-view in a humorous and thought-provoking way. This book will offend the devoted believer, but is truly an intellectual exercise for the believer who likes to think for himself. It challenges that which we grew up with -- forces us not to coast on our faith. It won't necessarily change your mind about anything, but it provides the alternative point of view that is fundamantal in any intellectual endeavor. And faith should be an ongoing examination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide to the Bible","review":"This is a wonderful guide to the Bible for Catholics!

All I can say is that this album still has all the energy, style, amazing harmonies and fantastic playing that it had on the first day I listened to it when I bought it on vinyl back in the 80s. In fact, ALL of The Reivers albums are wonderful. If ever a band never got the recognition they deserved, The Reivers are it. Perhaps if a certain band (REM in fact) had never overshadowed them, The Reivers would still be around. But maybe their 4 studio albums (3 as The Reivers and 1 as Zeitgeist) are all we really needed...because how in the world can they ever have kept up such a fine body of work without getting tired?

After some weeks using it, the salt started coming out of the grinder with an unappetizing, suspicious green color. First I thought there was a problem with the sea salt but then I realized that the grinding mechanism was releasing that green material. Scratching the supposedly steel grinder component, it tears apart the crud. The mechanism is crumbling in green dust. I instantly discarded the whole grinder because of how toxic that carbon steel could be. I am really dissappointed with the Olde Thompson grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted after 7 months","review":"This is an attractive set when new and the grinder works well. I purchased mine new in February and it's just October. The outer veneer of both the salt shaker and the pepper grinder is now dull and covered in rust spots.

But as novels go, it was terribly disappointing. I didn't expect it to meet the standard of H. G. Wells, but after reading the sequel, I reread the original.

I own two of these Olde Thompson mills and they are fantastic. I've had my first one for over 3 years now and it just keeps on trucking. On the downside it's a bit fiddly to open and fill and it does take a lot of batteries--six AAA--to drive it's powerful grinding motor (tip: use good quality alkaline). But grind it does, like a real champ--those peppercorns are going DOWN. Lots of other mills I've tried just choke and seize up on the peppercorns at some point. None of that here. I regularly barbecue and not having to grind 6TBS of black pepper by hand is awesome. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pepper Mill","review":"Don't buy this item.

It is also an exceptional review of attitude and technique for those who are advanced in the craft. The exercises are designed to trigger imagination, not to spoon-feed it. The explorations of ethics and struggles with personal challenge are heartfelt. The author's respect for all who try to write flows off the page, as does a clear eye and unsentimental approach to digging deep into personal material. Reading this in tandem with the author's own memoir is a very satisfying way to explore the possibilities of memoir as an art form. Thanks, Ms. B."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Technical Tips but Naysaying Tone","review":"Though I found her tips on memoir-writing techniques helpful, her overall tone was a bit discouraging. There was one part where she warned that one should always be ready to immediately capture on paper those moments of inspiration or risk losing that particular idea forever. I personally believe that one should have faith that any really important ideas will come up again and again. There were a lot of admonishments about the importance of doing things a certain way, and how hard it is to follow through and actually write a memoir. I may never get there, but I do feel that my own creative path is better served with more affirming books.

Not to be insulting to anyone, but this album is simply bad. I direct singing groups and choirs, and take it from me, I know when someone is singing out of key, and many times; he is. The key of the song is so low at times that he talks through them. I would hate to think that people would buy this thinking that it is some kind of gem.

I have a recorder that I taught myself to play, but I always loved the sound of the penny whistle, as it is deeply associated with my heritage. Gathering the gumption to teach myself another instrument, I ordered this.I have had two of these, the first I demanded a refund and new whistle for because no matter how I blew into it it sounded airy had a very poor quality tone. When I got my new whistle, I was excited to try it out again, only to find it makes the same, airy, untunable sound. Very disappointed. It is poorly made, and you can't even take it apart to tune it.The only thing that's worth anything about it is it's a pretty green, and it came with a little bit of sheet music. Besides that, it's pretty much worthless as an instrument.

It is of sturdy construction and is definitely prettier than those plain metal models (in my opinion anyway). I've had no problems with it: no squeaking of any kind. Overall, a very worthwhile purchase for any wind player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good buy.","review":"I started to play the whistle just a few weeks ago and already have learned a good few songs. One of the key things to remember when you are beginning an instrument is to not get an instrument that discourages you from playing, because IT sounds bad.With that in mind, this whistle is fantastic for beginners. It is the not a top-of-the-line whistle like you may want to get when you have some experience under your belt, but it is definitely a high quality whistle that's easy to play, and sounds good.It's cheap, good quality, and it sounds really great.

The other two are kinda squeaky. The only down sides that I have experienced, are getting used to the seam on the bottom, that is necessary to form the tapered whistle, and it takes more air to produce the notes. Not only does this cut down on the time between breaths, but it also makes it more difficult to do cheater vibrato by moving the whistle while you play. I've tried with the Clarke, but it just doesn't work. Aside from that, it's great.Pros:Superior SoundLouderMore AuthenticCons:Air Required"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparing to the Wooden Stop","review":"I bought this one as a gift for a friend, and it was green as pictured. I will call it \\"Green\\" from now on.I own the Clarke Original which is black. I will call it \\"Black\\".Trying out both whistles, I much prefer Green. The mouthpiece is far superior. If you are familiar with Oak whistles, the mouthpiece is very similar - smooth, rounded plastic that feels and sounds fantastic. Black is simply a tin shaft with a wooden stop for the mouthpiece. I...hate it haha! It sounds incredibly airy and is very difficult to clear moisture out of.Other than the mouthpiece, Black and Green are identical whistles. Comparing to other whistles I own (aluminum, plastic bodies), I can say that Clarke's don't get very loud, sound airy, and can be somewhat annoying. The conical shaft feels pretty comfortable, but there is a seam. I would rather have a straight aluminum body.In all, I would chose Oak or Genaration over Clarke, but Green over Black if you gotta have the Clarke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Versatile Whistle","review":"This whistle is great!!!

The first one that I got was not that great, but I atribute that to the fact that I bought it at a toy store. When I bought my first whistle I wasn't really planning on getting serious with it, but one day I decided that it would be cool to learn how to play. This whistle is my third one that I've bought and I love it. The tone and sound quality is amazing. It is very mellow and clear. The whistle feels good in my hands too, which was a problem with my second whistle.

I have a friend who plays the tin whistle very well, and the instrument sounds wonderful, so I figured I'd give it a shot.Now, when my tin whistle arrived, it was not the same one as in the picture. It was still a Clarke Sweetone, but it was blue rather than green. This didn't bother me much; it still worked the same.I do have to point out that it does take some practice to get a really good tune out of it. Without practice, it sounds a bit obnoctious and squeaky, like a recorder. You just have to control your flow of breath, and you get a wonderful tune.It is really a very easy instrument to learn, though. Within the first day I purchased it, I was able to play a very nice rendition of \\"Going Home\\" from \\"The New World\\".Overall, if you have the patience to practice air flow and tone, this is a wonderful instrument, very easy to play and excellent for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but it was damaged badly but the seller made good on it.","review":"It is useful but not just what I had hoped for.

What I noticed when I played this game is that the first few boards are real easy and then suddenly, it shifts to brutally hard! Not cool. That and after you get past maybe one or two real hard boards, it goes back to being way too easy.Krusty's Fun House is a sleeper. It got real boring real quick. Plus when it all came down to it, it was the same board over or and over again with just a few shifts of obstacles and a background change, but still it was the same level.I think Lemmings would be a better buy because it's more challenging and a lot funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who are planning to do more than Sightseeing...","review":"A must have.

It's inexpensive and I've had zero problems with it. It could use additional padding on the shoulder straps, but that would be more of a \\"delighter\\" than a requirement - I'm not taking day hikes with it.

It holds all that easily with room for more - there are pockets I haven't touched yet.

While these movies don't have a tremendous amount of special effects (Some of the special effects were limited in the series) they do have gripping storylines and Darren McGavin really made the character of Carl Kolchak enjoyable. I've watched these movies dozens of times and they're great each and every viewing.I watched the series as a kid when it first aired and it always scared the living daylights out of me! Simon Oakland is perfect as Kolchak's impatient ranting boss. The whole series is a lot of fun but might be too intense for young children.If you're able to find copies of the series (apparently out-of-print) grab them and you'll have a great addition to your collection.

It was one of those \\"don't miss\\" series in the early '70's....highly enjoyable with just enough touches of horror to keep you on the edge of your seat. You knew it wasn't real, but that didn't stop you from biting your nails if you were so inclined.

That's what makes this all come together. Appearances by actors such as Claud Akin, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox, John Caradine, Al Lewis (Grampa from the Munsters), and Margaret Hamilton all add to the enjoyment.The visual imagry of Margaret Hamilton as a college professor with two skulls and a miniature cauldron on the desktop is worth the price alone.View this DVD first, and then buy the boxed set of 20 episodes that make up the original series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long overdue on DVD..thankyou MGM","review":"Back in 1990 I special ordered this from RKOVIDEO, which was then located on W49/Bway in NYC...I remember it was in double tape form and was 39.99, this was the age of the VHS tape and alongside it Laserdiscs could be found...I wanted to say that this 12+ dollar price is excellent.

The texture/feel didn't show quality that it was going to last if I tossed this in the bag. Around the case edges, it has the \\"hiding glue\\" to prevent users from seeing the leather from the side. It reminded me of my old phone case which in less than a year started peeling away. As for the stitching, it is thin. The flat exposed backside where it can rub against surfaces like a book or desk: Could this back stitch wear out faster? I am worried but time will tell.I will hold onto this as long as I can although I am not impressed on the quality up front. Right now my gut tells me this is not worth it because of what I listed above in my inspection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"The stitching quality was poor, although the leather smelled nice.

I was a little disappointed in this DVD. I love Self Magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising. The routines are broken down into four separate workouts. The only one that involved any effort on my part was the Pilates-inspired section. As for the rest, the other sections would have you do too few reps, I felt, to get your muscles warmed up, let alone reshape them. I think this DVD is great for beginners. Its simple enough to follow and it won't scare you away too soon.

Although several people were confirming that this is an official Brazilian edition, it was never confirmed to be an official release. Most likely it is a bootleg (although a nice one) and you can see that from the DVD region that was set to 0 to fit all the countries. The DVD does not have a booklet inside, so it is just a case with the cover and DVD itself.If you are a fan of Roxette, I would recommend getting it, since Roxette or/and EMI never thought about releasing an official Live DVD with any of the Roxette concerts (yet?). On the other hand, if you are really eager to see a good live show by Roxette, try to search for Roxette - Live in Zurich. There are also bootleg DVDs of this show. From my point of view, the concert in Zurich was the best Roxette live perfomance.

Unfortunately, I read first Year One from a far superior writer that kept me engaged. Snapshots is not bad, informative, but very boring and uninspiring. You get the impression that the account was biased because the author struggled himself. Despite his hardship, I think he could have written a more balanced book, if not more interesting and more engaging. For his work as a speechwriter, I found the book to be very bland and boring. Also, it is written in time where the echoes of the 80s were still prevalent on campus. I much prefer Year One as a better account of b-school life in a top school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell?

I am also a \\"poet\\" and a current student at a business school consistently ranked in the top 3. While the curriculum is certainly heavy and the workload can be massive, the environment depicted in this book cannot possibly be considered as a fair description of business school life.It is just one man's biased opinion (the author admits he did not belong in B-School). If you're serious about B-school, don't get fooled by this book: it's much closer to heaven than to hell.

This is a funny book that also rewards with insights about what getting an MBA feels like.While Robinson describes the experience of a full-time two-year program, my experience is going through the same type of full MBA experience but over four years while holding down a full time job, holding a marriage together, and raising several children. So, maybe our experience of exhaustion, anxiety, and struggle have different sources, but they are similar enough.I haven't found b-school to be hell. In fact, I have enjoyed it a great deal and have learned many things that I am already applying to my day job. But there is no getting around the fact that an MBA, especially in one of the top programs, isn't a picnic. Good reading, good writing, good fun.

This book ultimately fails because it offers little support and the writer is not nearly objective eneough to be considered a serious historian. A historian needs to take into consideration any bias his sources may have, something Seward didn't do. All of his sources are Tudor or Lancastrian (his opponents in life), which are naturally hostile.I actually believe Richard did kill his nephews, though I also believe he has been slandered against too much and is accused of actions he had no part of. There is too much emotion on the subject, and it is difficult to have a real debate when there are unsubstantiated polemics on the subject such as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting account...","review":"I read this book from a neutral perspective. I was interested in the Wars of the Roses, and the Yorkist, Lancatrian feud. In that regard, I think this book can spur one onto further reading. While it is clear that Mr. Seward is on the side of the Lancastrians, I don't think his account is as bad as many think. He does not conflate Richard as an ogre who must be defeated. He does illuminate the chain of events that led to the princes' death in the tower. Now, to be frank, the only person who benefited from the princes' death was Henry Tudor (later Henry VII), and I feel that point comes out in other books on this subject. I love ancient and medieval history for this purpose, there are not really any totally unbiased sources, Desmond Seward is trying to use the best data he could get. I think the pro-Ricardians need to stop hyperventilating and give the book its due as one that offers a legitimate look into this oft mentioned subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Should Be","review":"I got a tube (almost empty) with a bit of greasy water in the bottom.

There are a few lines that made me smile but for the most part the bookwas pointless and very unhelpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is one of my favorite books! I found it by mistake. I picked it up and read the back and figured I try it out. I'm so glad I did.

I have recommended this book to many of my friends regardless of their relationship status."},{"rating":"2","title":"As fun as TV if you don't take tv too seriously","review":"I enjoyed this book. The tone and perspective are pitch perfect with Sex and the City, so I guess a fan of the show would enjoy them. Except the stories are personal and in a way maybe their simpler. But always honest and funny, and that's whats important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"This book is laugh out loud funny..read it on a night when things ended with someone..

She came through like an old friend, and I am sorry to say this to such a funny, smart woman, but Cindy your dating life makes me feel better about mine..

Great gift book too, I already gave a copy of it to several of my single friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Fabulous","review":"I purchased this at friend's urging as we were both avid S&TC fans. This book was a disappointment overall. There were some clever plays on words ('hey baby weight') & observations just as you'd expect if you watch S&TC but this book wasn't anywhere near as funny or insightful. A lot of the 'episodes' in this book made the writer seem bitter and intolerant of the life choices of others. Witty at times but a little too sarcastic for my tatse and the chapters were dragged out & way tooooooooooooooo long. Note to the author, the show is only a half an hour & that's what makes it work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This book was an extremely funny and easy read! Read it whether you currently have a boyfriend or not and you're sure to get a good laugh.

I told him that I loved cop/detective/spy thrillers and read them as often as I can. That's when he told me that he had written a book and the next day he gave me Private Heat.I read the book and enjoyed it. In fact, after the first few chapters, I couldn't put the book down. The book was very well written and had the descriptive quality that I like.I am a former cop and I am well travelled. Therefore, the catch phrases, used by the cast of characters, and the descriptions of the areas involved, were right on the mark.The only thing that I did not care for was the hurried ending. It seem as though he was in a hurry to finalize the ending or some parts were missing to the ending. However, the book was a hit, as far as I am concerned. All I can say to Bob is \\"Keep on keeping on, the book was Greater then great\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun entertaining side scroller, very original","review":"Out Of this World, as well as its cousin genre, Flashback, are in my opinion the two funnest games that I have ever played for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. OOTW, is a game in which you are working on an experiment in your basement and an electrical problem occours. Literally, your body dissapears into your computer and then silence falls upon you. Your are cast down as a slave in a strange new world. You must fight your way back home. You are plunged into a world of danger with things trying to kill you constantly, a man vs. man, as well as man vs. nature complex into play. You and your laser pistol are all that save you from the outside world. These two titles I have mentioned are very hard to come across, I found Out of this world in a sale box but now you have the privlage of buying it off Amazon[.com].

I've always hated when people leave reviews when they haven't actually finished the book not to mention that their facts are wrong. Marke never actually moved in with Claymore she was a houseguest of Sitter, a woman that lived at his house.I really disliked the title of this book. It didn't really make any sense to me. I'm wondering who's supposed to be the Beauty & whose is supposed to be the beast? Marke (yes, the female) is described as not being a beauty & she's certainly not a beast. And, I hated the names in this book: Marke (the main female), Lord Perfect (come on now), Heaven (a man's name), & Sitter (yeah, it was short for a last name but still...). That's really not a big deal but I just didn't like it.Aside from my nitpicking I just really didn't like the story & I never got to like the characters.

Not to get too Marvin Gaye, the rich and famous hero recovers and must decide what to do about his Florence Nightingale once the reality of his Aristocratic responsibilties comes for a Christmas visit.

Just fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Cheer!","review":"This is a very pleasing, happy Christmas story. One of my favorites, in fact.And, honestly, of course it's predictable.

But it's only because I can't stomach it. It's one of those books where you know what will happen, not just because you're smart like that, but because you are all but told! I can't wrap my mind around the hero's petulance or the heroine's naivete. I mean, who really just up and moves in with a random stranger? Who does that? No, really!

It is out-dated for the most part, particularly in relation to technology. The book was written at a time when the fastest modems ran at 28.8 bps.As far as help with writing, it is a very beginning book, and at that not very extensive.

Suffice to say that this is one of the best books I've picked up in a long time, with a story that engages, characters that are deep and interesting, that's well-written and insightful, with wonderful turns-of-phrase. The themes that interlace and blow through leave the reader thinking and contemplating. The author's writing style reminds me in some ways of Wallace Stegner. A very satisfying book all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Promise, But Too Slow...","review":"This book has a great story underlying itself. Without spoiling it for you, the conflict of the horses and the dialogue among the character is intriguing, and at times, hilarious. Mr. Meyers truely captures certain Native American linguistics and charm.Unfortunately, he strays from the story and the dialogue FAR, FAR too often. The reader will be captivated by the action or the dialogue (or both) and then suddenly we will be forced to read about the history and culture of Native Americans (and also the Germans). Which is fine, but he places these excessively numerous bits of tedium throughout the novel in places they just don't belong.For the first time ever, I skipped paragraph over paragraph of useless rhetoric just to get to the next line of dialogue.Quite simply: Compress this book into 60 pages and you have a hell of a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has it all","review":"I believe this may be one of the best books I've ever read. Three very diverse young men, each with unique personal problems, are brought together to try to deal with the plight of horses abused by a frightening and vindictive man. The events and the character's reactions to them is the most startling and unexpected I've ever encountered. I actually caught myself gasping in surprise. If you enjoy a strong style of writing, with good use of similes and metaphors and imagery, Kent Meyers is one of the best I've ever seen. Unusual setting. Great plot. \\"The Work of Wolves\\" has it all.

I know that this is a rare B side but surely they know that people are going to want access to a song when it is in a movie, so why not make the thing available? There are so many movies with good music that is either left out of the OST or cannot be obtained in any other way. Another example is the song \\"Is it hot in here?\\" which is in the movie Mystic Pizza.

The song \\"Stranded\\" was featured on the \\"Drive Me Crazy\\" movie soundtrack--the movie that starred Melissa Joan Hart. Anyway, the TUNES for the VERSES for \\"Everywhere\\" and \\"Stranded\\" sound almost identical. The \\"Stranded\\" song starts out: You know it only breaks my heart/To see you standin' in the dark/Oh Ohh you're waiting there for me/To come back/You're to afraid to show...then starts with the chorus. If I'm right let me know. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this unless you're sure","review":"Today I went to see American Pie 2 and kinda liked the music. So I came home and looked up the soundtrack.

It's supposed to be a soundtrack! How misleading. I'm glad I sampled before buying it...This CD is just another cliche teenybopper movie soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Initially disappointing, but has some hidden treasures","review":"The reason i bought this CD was that i thought it would contain some of the more recognizable toons' from the movie (everywhere, in too deep, smooth criminal, want you bad, etc.). Imagine my surprise when i discovered that these recognizable songs were replaced by lesser known tracks.

But as I listened to the samples here at the amazon.com site, most of the songs that were in the movie do not appear on the soundtrack. Why is this? In my opinion there are only like 3 decent songs on this soundtrack, the rest are crap.

The songs in the movie are really full of energy. The music was a perfect blend of laughter, sobriety, and just going crazy. A great summary of the movie. Why, then, when I listen to the soundtrack, does it not remind me of the movie? It's just not a feel-good compilation of what American Pie 2 really was, and will just serve to disappoint loyal fans and would-be buyers of the soundtrack.

But there was ONE song that stood out from the bunch -- Alien Ant Farm's cover of Micheal Jackson's Smooth Criminal (which, BTW, is now getting lots of airplay as well). This is the song that played while our hero was running around with his hand glued down his pants, looking for paint thinner.But for some reason, the hack in charge of compiling this CD apparently decided to eliminate this song (and substituted it with a different AAF track that I don't even remember hearing in the movie).

I even managed to smile at the references to the nasty, unhelpful \\"librarian\\" working at the \\"Circulation Desk\\" - most of us that have set foot in a (largish) public libary know that librarians do not work at Circulation Desks anyway, so I tried not to take it personally. Towards the end of the story, I had really lost a lot of interest in the \\"quest\\", and in the characters as well. I was waiting for a climax, but there was none. I thought the ending was totally ...well, boring actually.

There were a lot of holes left unfilled such as who was sending them on the quest, what happened between Mark and Zeena, and what happend between Mark and his mom. I didn't like the fact that Mark completely ignored Merial after he started the quest. It made me dislike his character a lot. This book was worse that washing the car.

My son LOVES this bike, but again, we have to charge it so frequently he's going to get tired of it fast.1 minute at full speed is unacceptable.13 minutes at a speed that can't even be measure, perhaps, 10 feet in 10 seconds is REALLY unacceptable.Contacted the manufacturer and seller.

I found the book good at detailing the causes for specific diseases but it fails when it comes to providing the same level of specificity for the remediation of the diseases he describes. The good Doctor also seems contradictory when he lauds the body's ability to heal itself only to sound like an apologist for the AMA at other times by describing certain diseases as irreversible. Where's your faith Doc? The general solutions listed in the Health Protocols section of the book serve an a vehicle to hawk the author's proprietary products - obviously self serving.

Jimmy Johnson belongs in the NFL Hall of fame because he transcended college and the pro game and won on both levels. Coach Howard Schnellenberger was a visionary, an architect, Coach Johnson was the master craftsman, and Coach Erickson and Cooke undderstood how to utilize the tools they were handed.

From the lesser known \\"early\\" tracks like \\"Lady Samantha\\", \\"Come Back, Baby\\" and \\"Bad Side of the Moon\\" to the hits that made EJ a superstar in the 70's and 80's, this collection gives the listener a grand tour of Elton's growth as a musician and of his and Bernie Taupin's evolution as songwriters.Some nice bonuses include a rare \\"demo\\" version of \\"Grey Seal\\", and some b sides like \\"Jack Rabbit\\" and \\"Young Man's Blues\\".There is a nice balance of tracks from the albums (not just radio hits), singles and rarities. Especially noteworthy is the inclusion of \\"Lucy in the Sky\\", \\"Ego\\" and \\"Empty Garden\\".In my opinion, this is definitely a collection worth having.Another good EJ compilation is \\"Rare Masters\\" which includes the entire \\"Friends\\" soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait!","review":"Elton is terrific and I have never been disappointed with him!

One, there has been lots of good music from this man in the past 20 years since this was done and it skimps even on his 80's output. Left off are Healing Hands, A Word IN Spanish, Who Wears These Shoes etc. That said, the inclusion of TOnight, Burn Down The Mission, Carla Etude etc. make this a treasure chest for a casual fan who wants to become a true believer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best times i ever had while reading............","review":"i must say GEDION is such a superb NOVEL.....it kept me hooked the entire time........though i must say the some of the plot lines can be guessed.........it still has many SHOCKS...that i bet you wont see coming.........most of the all the entire premise for the story is so Interesting........u wont be able to put this book down...i promise.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmless Fun.","review":"I wouldn't call \\"Gideon\\" a \\"shocking\\" or \\"explosive\\" or \\"great\\" story... but it is an agreeably engrossing suspense/adventure novel with likeable protagonists and villainous enemies.

For a very long time the author went out of his way to not make actually party affiliations (though the implications were obvious) but did, in the end. It was like he was trying so hard not to, and at the end had to give in and started throwing them around left and right. Went from nary a word to overboard in three pages! The story itself was trite - I think most people could see where it was going - and the characters were shallow. Definitely a case of trying too hard to make something unique and unusual, and ending up with something bland and uninspiring. Probably wouldn't waste my time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!","review":"I am a mystery/suspense novel junkie... and Gideon was the one of the worst suspense novels I have ever read.

To be honest, I'm the kind of reader who tends to \\"lurch\\" through books...read 50 pages, set book down for a few days, read another 50, etc. Gideon had me turning the pages and coming back every day until I finished it, so I must say that I found it engrossing.The plot had some good twists but wasn't so complicated that I needed 3x5 cards to figure out what was going on. There were a few memorable characters, good villians, decent hero...if a bit stereotypical. Good action, high body count. Overall, I think most people would find it very entertaining.One other opinion...the identity of the Closer was laughable.

It wasn't even close. The authors' use of sports slang was painful to read, and seemed to be a desperate plea to inject youth in the novel. The closer's identity was a good twist, but overall the plot was stale. I have seen it in the movie theater and have read it in other novels. I was extremely disappointed with the portrayal of the Catholic Church in this novel, the homosexual and pedophilia references were neither proper nor relevant to the story. I am not standing on a soapbox, but I hope modern authors have the talent to write a thrilling novel without employing sensationalism. I will stick with Fyodor Doestevsky. Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, and Brothers Karmazov were tremendous thrillers. I guess the difference in quality is that Fyodor wasn't trying to write a novel and a screen play all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power House Thriller...!!!","review":"I picked up this book at a used book store.

When he finished, I began. We made a great game out of it. He knew all the answers, I continued to read at every opportunity asking all the questions. Of course, he would not tell me what happened next or what the secret was, just led me on with a few mini-hints. It was great fun for us to compare notes when I did finally finish the book as there were tiny buried details in the story that I missed and he could fill in and several little pieces that he missed that I could fill in.The author's style was believable in that his descriptions aptly painted a clear mental picture of the scene. All in all, we found it a tremendously entertaining mystery with plenty of surprises along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good political thriller","review":"A writer, Carl Granville, gets an offer of $250K to write a novel called Gideon, which is based on the material of an old diary. The diary tells of a 10-year-old boy from the South who kills his brain-damaged baby brother. When his editor gets killed and no one knows anything about the book, Carl gets the blame and must run for his life from an unseen enemy who wants to eliminate him and any proof of the book. Carl is forced to search forthe truth behind the diary - the truth which may cost him his life and the future of a very powerful man.

I use this bag mostly for my sport activities since it is made of mesh and it lets things inside dry well. My toddler and I use this mesh backpack mostly for swimming. It is big enough to fit our swimming suits, towels, baby pool toys, and changing clothes. We do not have to worry about drying our bag when we return home. The little zipper compartment in front is a convenient storage for my keys and membership card. I cannot ask for more from this practical mesh backpack.

He can play, sing and write almost any style of music and do it very well. I know other people have said this about Bob, but he is way better live than recorded. If you ever get a chance to see him live you must do so. Every time I go to Texas to see the future in-laws I am always checking to see if Bob is going to play at Antone's so I can see him live there where the Scabs Freebird CD was recorded.

At the end I was left feeling empty, and frankly, after writing this review will probably forget about it completely. It needed more density. It was just too short for such a compelling topic. By the way, it takes place on the New Hampshire coast (not Maine), and they were trying to unionize a mill (not a mine).

Not a good reason for me to buy a book. In any case, I like this book. I like the characters. I like the story. As Americans we talk little and know less of the struggles of working-class America then and now. Whoever said, \\"Those who do not know their history are bound to repeat it,\\" could very well have applied that lesson to today's struggles in the workplace.

The hopping back and forth between characters was tedious and the characters themselves poorly defined. Shreve eventually decides to try to tie them all together and winds up creating a ridiculous farce of an ending. The whole \\"sea glass\\" schmaltz was a cheap and nauseating way of trying to create some kind of romance in this disjointed and, may I say again, BORING novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I thought....","review":"I have enjoyed many of Anita Shreve's books, and have found this one to be pretty disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"Slow and rather boring.

It is an interesting novel of social history, with one character who is well developed. Fortunately, she is the most important character, a solidly grounded woman of the middle class who marries a shallow salesman. Her experiences as a newly wed, and her enjoyment of the beauties of living by the ocean transcend the times. The social history focuses on a New England mill, and a terrible strike which occurs there, but a broader picture is painted, including the very rich.

I devour her books in 1-2 sittings. This dull novel took me almost 1 week to get through. I was disappointed and not intrigued with the characters. I did find the protagonist, Honora, likeable. The entire narrative however was too simple. Exclamtions such as \\"sea glass doesn't break\\" when Honora's husband tosses it is just too simple and lame. The subject of the textile mills and New England was done so well in 'Empire Falls' that I felt here it was just dull.dull. Sorry Anita. Hoping for more intrigue in your next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was greatly disappointed","review":"Usually Anita Shreve does not disappoint. Sadly, SEA GLASS failed to hold my interest.

I can't put them down and am always sad when I come to the end of one. Fortune's Rocks is one of my favorite books of all time and sort of the \\"prequel\\" to Sea Glass. Although, the characters in Sea Glass are not related to those in Fortune's Rocks, the book eludes to them in several places and especially the setting. If you like the setting here, you will love Fortune's Rocks, but don't plan on putting it down after you pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her WORST book to date!","review":"I fell in love with Shreve's books after reading \\"The Pilot's Wife.\\" I went on to read others, all of which I enjoyed. However, when I read \\"The Last Time They Met,\\" I began to doubt my devotion to her novels. And now, upon completion of \\"Sea Glass,\\" I feel certain that I will never pick up another of her books again. I did not like how she switched back and forth between the characters -- most of whom were completely not interesting. Honora and Vivian were remotely \\"real\\" and intriguing, but the men were very flat and boring. In fact, I found myself skimming through the last 150 pages just to make it to the agonizing end. I kept thinking that it would get better, but I was wrong. The \\"massacre\\" at the end did perk up the action a bit, but only to end with her typical sad ending. I advise all former Shreve fans to abandon her and look for entertainment elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"My book club read this and we were unanimous in feeling that it had been an unworthy selection, and mystified by the extremely favorable reviews it has received. The descriptions of life during the depression, and the details of labor strife related to textile mills, were of some interest. But every element of the story seemed unerdeveloped, and the characters, in particular, lacked subtlety and complexity. The symbolism of the sea glass was simultaneously heavy handed and vague. The author has chosen a weighty topic, but because she failed to do it justice, even parts of the book that should have been devastating left me unmoved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but was lacking something. . . .","review":"Upon finishing this book, I felt as if it had been written with the sole purpose to be turned into a \\"made for TV\\" movie. The main characters, Sexton and Honora, lacked the kind of depth that would have made me warm up to either of them and it seemed that the \\"real characterization\\" was being left for the television screenwriter and actors. And, honestly, we could have all done without Honora's little hissy fit with the stinky lobster bodies!Believable characters to me were (in order of believability) Vivian, Alphonse, and Honora's mother -- very believable for the Depression era and their individual situations. I also enjoyed the images of the beach community and the sea glass Honora collected. The ending was disappointing, but again, let's wait for a better one in that made-for-TV movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty in the restraint","review":"Despite Anita Shreve's loyalty to the topic of sad and jilted love, her writing and approach to each novel never seems to run dry. Sea Glass brings the beauty of restraint combined with the eloquence of description to light in a historical manner.Meet Honora, a character who is at once understated and curious. Follow her life as a new wife at the mere at of 20. Along the way, meet characters who, seemingly unimportant at first, become a rich part of Honora's life.Often, it is in the things unsaid where Shreve's true talent lies. The book reads like a sigh, and every once in a while, you must pause to realize just how delicious Shreve's words are. While Sea Glass isn't as shocking or confrontational as Shreve's other works, it will satisfy a more intellectual reader who doesn't want overt and obvious themes thrown in her face. Those who appreciate classical writing, language and complexity of characters over \\"cleverness\\" of plot will surely find a winner in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have boarded up the place for good","review":"As an admirer of Anita Shreve's previous books, I couldn't wait to read her latest. While the first several chapters were strong, the story just fell apart. Fortune's Rock was great from start to finish.

A true improvisor(one of the best female jazz singers today!), however this compilation sticks mostly to ballads, but the ballads have so many intersting tempos, the mood is always exciting thoughout this cd. Jordan is in top form backed by a variety of great jazz musicians, who have plenty of solo space. This cd contains half of the songs from her exellent Muse CD \\"Heart Strings,\\" just one more reason to pick this up.

Too bad it broke first time I used it.The little lever that scrapes the scoop of ice cream out of the, well, out of the scoop broke after only one scoop. The rack and pinion that drives the scraper stripped out the first time I used this scoop. What a waste of $15.00!!!Stay away from this brand; everything they sell seems to be made in China and seems to lacks any sort of quality control. I am very unhappy with this purchase. Only one star means that I can at least use it since I removed the little scraper bit. It's going back to the store.Looks like I'll have to go back to bent spoons!KitchenAid-shame on you. I expected more for my $15.00 than just one scoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the Scoop. NOT!","review":"Like the other reviewers noted the plastic parts that drive the scraper malfunction quickly. I got 3 or 4 uses out of the scoop before the cheap plastic broke. Thing is, the scoop itself feels hefty and sturdy and would be an excellent utensil if they replaced the plastic parts with metal. The scoop stills looks and works fine other than losing the scraper to help free the ice cream from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sim City like game.","review":"You are god... literally in this game. The point of this game is that your blue tribe must survive and destroy the rival red tribe. You play as god, with a birds eye view of their world, and you flatten land for them to build houses and castles, and you create hazards for the rival tribes, such as floods, swamps, knights to destroy and burn their villages, and even create huge mountains from nothing. This is a good game, for the first level! But then there are around 400 levels, each with different lands, featurings deserts, snow, grass and dirt. Each level takes about an hour to three hours to complete, so it gets very boring! Also, pretty poor graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like described","review":"The lantern is made of metal and will probably last a long time. Glass lenses.

It fits perfectly over the windshield all the way to the taillights, which effectively covers everything I wanted to keep out of the sun. It comes in a carrying bag that stays attached to the cover. When not in use, it is easy to fold the cover back into the carrying bag in a very compact size, which fits nicely in the saddlebag.

HOWEVER, this is an absolute must-read for all wannabe, current, and former celebrities and those that make people celebrities. I've never come across a book that has exposed the foundations of celebritydom as this book has. It's \\"Audience Intensity Ladder\\" alone is worth picking up this book.

Thus, he moves to correct this historical error by bringing forth a laundry list of glowing facts about Henry. While Vaughan does have a point about previous renderings of Henry's life, he does little to paint a more accurate picture of the orator. Rather, he glosses over Henry flaws, and presents us with a candy-coated version of the man. And Henry was a man--a good man, but a man nonetheless.

I wanted to add some structure to what I do so I bought this book. Mistake!The ideas presented in this book are by no means ground-breaking or new, and are actually often common-sense to educators/trainers with more than a few years of experience like myself. Not only does the author go into excessive detail with multiple useless charts and checklists, but his thoughts are not organised, which makes the book extremely hard to follow. It is like he just scribbled down ideas as they came to him.I feel sorry for any prospective Instructional Designers who might be stuck with this as a text book. That is enough to put anyone off ID as a career!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canny & Engaging","review":"I'm a bit confused by the mere suggestion that there's a \\"politcal agenda\\" afoot in this impressively written novel, unless there's another version floating around set during World War II and with Sherlock Holmes flying co-pilot on the Enola Gay. Otherwise, A Slight Trick of the Mind is a splendidly lucid and meditative look at the diverse phenomena of human remembering. Set in equal parts in Victorian England, post-war Japan of 1947 and not at all during the war, and rural Sussex, the book is revealing in three stories that come together into one haunting note. As an examination of grief and unrequited love it is a novel that also wrings at your heart. The fact that it stars Sherlock Holmes is pretty much a secondary concern, because Mitch Cullen's gift for both language and story-telling has given us a universal story most of us can relate to or will relate to. Read it for yourself and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"The word \\"Boring\\" comes to mind.","review":"My local Detroit paper raved about this book so I picked it up. Was I disappointed. It is basically a story of an old man, with allof his typical old man problems, such as memory loss, aching bones, sleep apnea, etc. It just so happens that it is Sherlock Holmes at age 93 in 1947. There is no adventure involved and whatever powers he once had are diminished by old age.Also, the book tends to ramble from one memory to the present (1947) and then back to another memory at a different time. He is not a likeable character and his musings are so jumbled and written in such a pedantic way, that you really don't care what the outcome of the story is. It took me awhile to finally finish this book because it wasn't interesting enough to want to find out how it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, poignant and sad, but not Sherlock Holmes","review":"I bought this book because of my interest in Sherlock Holmes and the conceit of Sherlock Holmes at age 93. The book is beautifully written and is very poignant and sad. But it is not Sherlock Holmes. The novel would have been equally effective if it was about an elderly man who was experiencing the losses (physical and emotional) that come with age. Other than to lure in some readers with an affinity for the Sherlock Holmes of A.C. Doyle, I saw no reason to give the protagonist Holmes's identity. As I noted, the book is well written, very touching, and has much to say on the vagaries of memory and the bonds between a father and a son. But if you're looking for any of the traits or characteristics that made Holmes Holmes, this is not the book for you. It wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diet version had awful taste.......","review":"I picked up a can of the sugar free Rock Star today.

After the first drink, I was still thirsty so I braved another swallow and I ended up just opening the car door and dumping the whole can out right then and there.

I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version.

It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like. Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice. They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories. The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site. This is a classic case of bait and switch. Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink. What a slap in the face to their customers. It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back. At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula. Will Rockstar be that smart?

Now, I get nice smooth curls.The only real problem I can see is that the heat setting dial is in a bad location. With every curl, my thumb would accidentally change the dial. I had to make sure, after each curl, to check the number on the dial.

My hair is very fine and when I have my hair \\"clamped\\" in this curling iron and start rolling it towards my head, my hair just slips out of it.

Too, the plug keeps slipping out of every wall socket I plug it into. I've never had that problem with any other curling iron I've owned either.I wish I had gotten the Revlon ceramic curling iron.

Very frustrating. 2) It would not hold a curl for me. I have long, thick, yet fine, hair. I think my hair is hard to keep a curl, but usually have really good luck with cermaic tools. I have an Amika tourmaline ceramic curling wand that works great on my hair and holds curl. I tried a few different things to by changing my conditioner and styling products and even using Bumble and Bumble mousse and hairspray, my curls fell flat within 30-45 minutes and my hair looked terrible.

It does the worst creases I've ever seen a curling iron do. Not something you can really work with either.I made this review on 11/25/11. I went back for another test run 11/26/11 and still am very unhappy about the MAJOR crease this iron makes. I'm pretty sure this iron is more for styling than curling so if that's what you looking for this probably isn't the iron for you. It did however style my hair quite easily, cute, and fast.

It works as advertised and has all the bells and whistles one would want.

With postage costing so much, I think it would be wise to buy a more robust model and pay a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns itself off","review":"This curling iron turns itself off during the 5 minutes it takes me to curl my hair in the morning. When it does, it refuses to turn back on unless it is unplugged and plugged back in. This would otherwise be a great curling iron. It heats up quickly and leaves hair smooth and shiny.

If you want to learn the basics, then you should start with this book. The pages are colorful, bright, and even comes with little goodies like peel-off stickers you can take off and put around your house, and cut-out cards of basic phrases and words. You skim the surface of the Portuguese language, and that's pretty good for when you go on to more advanced books.

It is filled with Eurocentric notions of culture and civilization. The uses of \\"barbaric people\\" and \\"civilized people\\" don't make much sense. For example, he considers the Native people barbaric. The Native people are not the only ones whom he considers barbaric people. He also suggests that Hinduism is based on the Indus cult. I am not a Hundu follower, but I find that offensive. He could have written that there was a connection between Hinduism and the ancient relgion of the Indus region. I am seriously questioning his understanding of history because it looks like that he is not familiar with cultural relativism or any other sociological theories. Yes, he does discuss the world history. The scope of this book is too big for him to handle. As a result, the book is often misleading and inaccurate. I think he made no attempt to correct this because this is his fifth edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable and worthwhile guide","review":"This guide is immediate and thorough; it give a host of places and activities that could fulfill even the most bored tourist's desires. The book is salted with the kind of personal experience that makes visiting these islands so special. They take us away from palm beaches, island vistas and rugged emerald mountains and put us in touch with the people who inhabit these beautiful places. From fishermen in Barrouallie to Rastas in the Port Elizabeth market and a botanist in St. George's, we get a sense of the lives that entwine to make up the fabric of these islands. Also, each section begins with a history of the place at hand, so important to understanding the southern Windwards. The authors have produced a journeyman labor, a product of discernment and enterprise tempered with warmth and humor.

And although this game is a spot on representation of the cartoon it isn't the least bit fun to play, since Spunky is as dumb as post (much like in the cartoons).

A reset fixes this.A lockup of networking off the box (you can disconnect, re-dial and still not move packets to/fro net). A reset fixes this.The interface is lacking *bigtime*. Sure, you wouldn't expect to need to be in it beyond initial setup but believe me... you'll be there often checking status during the normally scheduled lockups.Anyway, if you don't need dialup... get something else.

I orirginally purchased it because it could be used as a router, print server, and wireless access point. Unfortunately, it failed in all three of these functions. As a router and wireless access point, it would work for about half an hour and then simply stop transmitting. Only resetting the device would get it working again.

Range is great and compared to the comparable Linksys model (which I have also used), this model tends to work better in an environment with numerous walls between the router and the wireless PC card.

If SMC could clean up the firmware and fix the lock-up problem, it might be a decent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 defective routers within 60 days","review":"I bought the first in September, it stopped to work after one day.I got the second 10 days later, it did not work at all.I got the third 5 days later, it worked for 5 weeks.

So is the customer support.","review":"Buying a 7004AWBR is a crapshoot. I just wish I had known the odds six months ago. My 7004AWBR saga has recently ended (I hope) with the promise of a full refund (not including the cost of my wasted time) from someone who is high enough in the SMC support hierarchy to admit that certain lots of the 7004AWBR are known to be defective.The problem isn't simply that some of these don't work, it's that getting a replacment or refund took me hours and hours of time on the phone nearly threatening people to get any kind of resolution. I'm left wondering why a company which knows it has a malfunctioning product risks losing customers who are likely to go around spreading the news of their terrible experience to hardware-buying friends, familily, coworkers, and in public forums?If you buy one of these, I sincerely wish you a better experience than I have had. I will never buy from SMC again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk! Locks up. Support is a joke.","review":"This unit is feature rich, and quite simple to setup, but it is plagued with techical problems and support is a nightmare.The most serious issue is that if you transfer any more than a couple of Megabytes of data through it, it locks up completely. It can be reset through the web interface from the wireless, or by unpluging it, but the next time you challenge it with a floppy's worth of data....down it goes.Secondly, if you use the WEP encryption, to encrypt your wireless traffic (which you should!), the data throughput drops as much as 75% (e.g. without encryption 8-9Mbps, with 1.5-3Mbps).Finally, SMC's idea of a solution to the problem is to replace the new one I already own, with a factory refurbished one that HAS THE SAME PROBLEM!In two words....run away....far away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashes constantly","review":"While this router has some nice capabilities it has serious software problems.

I ran the SMC product for two years, tried updating drivers, etc etc etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy setup, but unstable and no uPnP","review":"I was initially so thrilled with this device that I bought my brother one too. The print server in addition to the wired and wireless router functions is of tremendous use to us.Unfortunately instant messaging voice conversations don't work over this device, even when using the DMZ and trying to open holes in the firewall as described by SMC tech support. SMC has also been very latent in getting new firmware out for it.It has also proved unstable and sometimes slow when using the MAC address filtering features. Security is also somewhat flaky. In short, for a basic, unsecured wireless/wired router and print server it is tolerably reliable. If you want voice chats or rock solid reliability, however, I'd look elsewhere. Linksys tends to be more standards compliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"great with 98SE; lousy with XP","review":"I've had this for over a year and loved it until I upgraded to XP. Now I absolutely can not print to my Z52 anymore. It couldn't handle bidirectional communications with the printer before but I could live with that but now it just won't talk to the printer at all. Customer support stinks if you can manage to get an answer from them at all. They just reiterate what is in the manual.

I didn't get a chance to test it though, because when I plugged it into the wall power outlet, thick, white smoke began pouring out of the top of it. Luckily, no other components were damaged, but needless to say, I was disappointed.I'm sure, however, that this sort of thing only happens in very rare situations, and it was probably some kind of simple wiring problem. I have returned the item and a new one is on the way.

I was looking to get everything networked to my cable modem. My first experience was with a Linksys router (to connect the PC) and an Apple Airport (to wirelessly connect the iBook). Everything worked great...except when someone was using our Panasonic 2.4GHz phone! The wireless connection was not compatible because they both use the same 2.4 GHz frequency. I returned the Airport and purchased a Linksys router/wireless access point. This worked great too until someone was talking on the phone. Not being able to use the computer when using the phone reminded me of my pre-cable modem days. In a last ditch attempt I purchased the SMC7004AWBR. Wow what a difference! It works great around the phone and the range is excellent. Also, it appears to be faster than the Linksys product. Thanks SMC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and easy","review":"I didn't want to run ethernet cable around my house. I am a relative neophyte to home networking, and this package got me up and running in less than 10 minutes.

This router has issues.","review":"Works great initially. But unit has a problem with locking up often (possibly to overheating). Others I know who use this unit report similar problems. Must reset unit by powering down. This happens to me about once every 2 weeks. I recommend you spend a little bit more for a product that has a better reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Product","review":"Bought this router because most gave it a good review. However, the router KEEPS LOCKING UP on me when I tried to transfer a large file from one computer to another computer. And the sad thing is that both of these computers are on the wired portion of the network. After trying various things, I gave up and it is now a worthless paperweight. I called SMC support about this and she said she will look into it and give me a call back. It is over a week now and I have yet to hear a call from them.Basically, I think SMC has some serious quality control issues. I have also read on other sites that SMC products have overheating issues (thus the lock up?). So buyer beware!!I decided to purchase the US Robotics 22Mbps wireless router and this one never gave me a problem. It has a greater range, the print server is much faster than the SMC, and the most important thing is, it just works!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just stops working...","review":"Short and sweet:the good:- easy setup with Windows XP- excellent range (strong signal two rooms/60 feet away)the bad:- stops working with no warning; have to reboot often (still hit or miss after rebooting)- runs very hot (may be the cause of the problems)- tech support is generally responsive but not very helpfulTHE BOTTOM LINE: Don't buy this router, especially if you depend on your internet connection for work. Other reviews (put up after I bought mine) mention the exact same problem. The router worked very well when working, but gets 1 star because I don't think it's too much to ask that a product work all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable product","review":"The router locks up once every day (for both wired and wireless connections).

I can not recommend buying SMC products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product good, but printer not supported","review":"The unit installed with minimal pain using the instructions for Windows 2000 (my platform is XP). Too bad SMC doesn't tell you this in advance.

Other than that I'm happy with the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid performer","review":"Easy to set up. Works great. SMC software updates are frequent and work well. Runs cool.

Their technical support never returned my email question.2. Their customer service returned my email question with an auto-reply message.3. When I bought this product, it has a rebate. But see what I got: I received the rebate cheque just one day before the cheque is void! They were lucky as I couldn't go to a bank to cash in the cheque on the EXIPRY date.All the above are TRUTH.If you still want to buy this product, I can tell you as a matter of fact, I bought two of these. One for my home, and one for my company's branch office. The product is easy to setup and is still working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be beat for the price","review":"This router can't be beat for the price. Many wireless access points cost the same, but lack the routing features and 3-port switch. The latest firmware is fairly stable. The only drawbacks with this product are: mediocre wireless throughput compared to its predecessor, the 7004WBR. However, it also costs much less. Some earlier firmware versions are also rather buggy and cause wireless dropouts or frequent router lockups. I would highly recommend upgrading to the latest firmware if you encounter lockups or wireless dropouts.Other than that, for the price, this wireless router really can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good...","review":"Was very easy to set up...

However, as soon as I tried to upgrade the firmware, it fried. So much for ease of use. A general complaint of all of these types of products is that they are COMPLEX!!!!!! I can't say that enough. If you don't know a little bit about PC's and networking, you are gonna be lost. It's not just plug, plug, go. It's plug, plug, try, replug, retry, access config, try, pray, retry, power down, retry, etc. It took me 30 minutes to set up and that's after I had already set up another vendor's product. Be warned!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another brand","review":"Got the router a week ago, set it up without any major hiccups along with a pccard/pci combo. Moved the pc downstairs, about 15 feet away from ap. No signal , no connection. Figuered it might be a firmware problem, checked the firmware but the router had the latest version already. Tried the netgear fm114p router, got a connection but link quality low and ok speeds.Manufacturers really need to start making pci cards with detached antennae so they can be arranged away from the pc. The pc acts as a sheild and blocks most of the signal. Sending the router and pci nic back and going to try a linksys wireless pci nic with the netgear and see if there is any improvements. If not, sending everything back and go back to old trusty cat5 cabling. One of the best things about Amazon (and the main reason I keep coming back) is if you buy a ... product, they make it easy to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most functionality, best price and performance","review":"I can't say anything but good things about this product.

Takes painful amount of time to detect any wireless cards. I tried this witl various different Wireless Cards - the NetGear, then the Toshiba Internal Wireless Card, etc. This definitely takes quite some time. Just cannot recognize the card on plugin.2. Needs Reboot. Well, its been over 2 months since i've had this router, n i've hard-booted it atleast 5 times. Definitely not a good standard by any means.Often, it just cannot assign an IP to even PCs or Laptops connected over the network Cable as well(not just the wireless). Initially, I wasted quite some time figuring out if there was any problem with the PCs. But on investigating, it seems to be a router problem. So every time my network goes down, I've to restart the Router n things start working.Cant say which one is better than this, cuz I've not yet seen the others, but I wont recommend this one to anybody else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Family Organizer","review":"This is a calender for the year 2000!

This book is more like taking a peek inside Amy Tan. It was great.I hated literature in high school and college, because all the professors always talked about all the \\"hidden meaning\\" and symbolism in persons, objects and events happening in the book. I thought this was a bunch of BS. So thank you Amy for proving me right!It is a well written compilation of stories, observations and even commencement addresses. My favorite was her thoughts on waiting to be introduced for a talk and seeing the Cliff Notes of her book on display. Nice touch. I would probably appreciate Joy Luck Club after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I Know Amy","review":"I've always enjoyed her novels, and The Opposite of Fate gave me an even deeper understanding of the origins of her work. I really enjoyed the opportunity to hear, in her own words, the true history of her family, her thoughts on her childhood, young adulthood, and even current day. She's a fun, funky, formidable, & fascinating woman & someone you'd love to know & introduce to all your friends. I really enjoyed having the opportunity to get to know her better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the editor?","review":"I respected her work more before I read this book. Some of the essays are good and some are really bad. The worst part is the repetition. I understand that these were previously published, but couldn't someone have reworked them a little to take out the repetitive passages. I was also left confused; on the one hand she states that shed doesn't want to be pigeon holed as an Asian or Women's writer. On the other she mentions several times that she attended a conference for woman writers or Asian writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful and fun read","review":"I just finished reading this book and really it is very different from any other Amy Tam work. Her voice is so explicitly loud and funny that this book is worth your time even if your aren't a major Amy Tan fan. All the way through she will challenge you to think about writing and life in different ways. As a special bonus, I think I gained alot of insight into her earlier works that casts them in a different light for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories","review":"This collection by a wonderful writer has given me an insight to what Amy Tan struggles with as she writes. It was a delightful read but I would expect nothing less from Amy Tan."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely honest book","review":"Ms Tan being a famous author, expected the memoirs to be heavy with dry details of writing, pure business chase and negotiations with publishers. A pleasant surprise this book tuned out to be, you don't read it, you rather listen to it as you would to a close friend talking to you, sharing the lost growing us years with you, as Amy tells you about the life impacting death of her friend Pete, their para normal encounters, setting Amy on a path of being a successful author. Elizabeth Gilbert a TED talk spoke of the need for an author to separate his artistic self, considering genius as something outside of the author responsible for all her good (and bad) work, and Amy seems to have actually lived it. The boldness with which Amy writes of the love-hate relationship she had with her mother is heart warming and endearing. As you put the book down, a voice rings in your ears long after..Amy..ah, and that is the strength of this book. An enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young kids or tweens.","review":"I got this book on tape from the library to listen to on the way to school with my daughters - one of which is named WENDY due to my love of Peter Pan.The surprise began with intense adult kisses being described between 2 people married but NOT to each other.

The price of a soul, stemming from a parable given by Jesus, really is an ongoing and life-long question for anyone who believes in doing good things. Is a man happy to have gathered million and million of dollars? Or billion and billion of dollars? At what point do we stop guarding our pile of treasures inside the fortress while the poor go without the nessary means?Bryan was given a bad rap, especially due to his challenging the evolution as a ultimate explanation to creation of man...but we could learn from him, especially in terms of today's world of gratuitous violence which could otherwise be known as a result of social darwinism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a poor game.","review":"This is a really bad game if you love pool or if you hate it.

This performance is abridged, and there are no long shots that allow you to take in the whole minimalist staging of singer, musician, and puppeteers, but the essence of the form is still engaging. The play by Chikamatsu is best presented in English by the Donald Keene translation and commentary (also avialable at AmazonThe Major Plays of Chikamatsu), and I recommend the book as a libretto for enhancing the viewing of the video. Keene does a very good job of clarifying the historical context of Chikamatsu's work in a way that reinforces the timeless nature of the Bunraku art, and he even makes a pretty good stab at translating Chikamatu's puns and clever Japanese language that is missed in the video sub-titles.

For those of you unfamiliar with his previous solo carreer, Bruce Dickinson had a topsy turvy time after leaving Iron Maiden in the early 90s to do his own thing, with varying results. Accident of Birth finds him back on form and was his springboard to rejoining Iron Maiden shortly after, a move which all Maiden fans rejoiced at.

The graphs were helpful. I would have liked to see more real world examples and how these different strategies play out. I gave the book an above average rating because I thought it was a decent technical book, which I like, vs. other boods that I've read where there is more fluff and useless stories of the authors big wins etc. I would recommend this book to someone with a little experience in options who wants to take the next step.

Choose this one. Its an easy read style, clear text and graphs and makes it all understandable. As a bonus, the best thing is for new traders are the excellent chapters on Psychology and Technical Analysis which could stand alone as mini-guide on these subjects.(Intermediate/advanced traders could skip them but they are a useful reminder). There are a couple of references to his software but that is fine (in fact while this is a book review I have also benefitted from his course and using the software). At the end is also a good 'Putting it all together' section to actually DO the option trading as well as a useful strategy summary. I am now successfully trading options, initiated to a large to degree by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for the beginner,,","review":"In a world which focuses more on entertaining the reader rather than actually providing them with consistent useful information, Cohen actually believes in teaching. Although a tough subject (to me), he really breaks the information down and builds the reader up to a level of understanding and confidence to begin.I especially liked how he helps you to start and construct your own plan of attack after realizing how to enter the game but without a biased opinion on which one is better.(The area on Technical Analysis was great, however I do wish that he would of spent a little more time on breaking some of the charts down).Even with that I learned quite a bit.I am a young college student with lots of enthusiasm about entering the options game and will be getting his Bible Of Options Strategies as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A picture you'll love.

I have a DirecTV HDTV receiver hooked up to it and love, love, LOVE it. The image is blur-free, bright and crisp. The color saturation is spot on and easy to adjust should you care. I play World of Warcraft, and this monitor can accomodate the 1650x1080 screen resolution like a champ!The downsides are few, but good to know. The speakers are weak and lack range. Even when adjusted at their best, they are tinny. Most people I know who need great sound don't rely on any device's built-in speakers, but these could have been a little bit better in my opinion. Also, while having an awesome tilt adjustment, it doesn't have a height adjustment. Ergonomics are not dismissable anymore.Overall, this is a great monitor if you're prepared to deal with it's minor imperfections.

When mine started to die, I researched this model and learned that it's plagued with power supply issues which result in premature death.It's a fixable problem, but not for the layman.I would generally stay away from this model of monitor unless you get it VERY inexpensively (say, $50 or less). It's not worth much more, since you WILL have problems with it sooner than you should, unless you're very, very lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"The monitor arrived 5 days sooner than expected not to complain and has saved my much need desk top space and works great no problem what so ever.

When it works, it's fine. But it doesn't work without freezing for a couple minutes out of every 10, and after freezing a few times, it just locks up permanently (leading to the above-mentioned attempts at remedy). Oh, and when I say it freezes, I mean everything freezes. I have it connected to a cable modem on the internet side and a wired desktop and a wireless notebook on the local side. When it freezes, I have no internet, period. Wired or wireless. Zilch.

Weird thing also happened..lost connection them my e-mail computer (DURON 1.0G) dialed up ISP through telco modem and made connection, then unit seemed to \\"unlock\\". This firmware has to have bugs for sure. Having set up wired LINKSYS Routers before and had mostly no problems with FTP or AIM. BEFW11S4 V4 needs a firmware update or a technical bulletin explaining what settings are needed to keep it working online. Rebooting seems to fix for a while 1/2 Hour to 8 Hours (overnight).

That said, this product keeps up the fine tradition of being easy to set up, but loses its claim to fame on the stability issue. My device has locked up about every 6 hours since I plugged it in and gave it an Internet connection. I've read around that this is an issue related to NAT at high speeds. If this is the case, it doesn't make a very good broadband router, but if you're just using it for wireless access to your existing network, you might get along just fine with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"keeps logging out","review":"The setup was fine but even at a distance of less than 20 feet,I cannot chat on Yahoo or MSN for few minutes.The tech support asked me to change channels ,upgrade firmware but still has the same problem.The signal strength is excellent but will go low for few seconds every 2-3 minutes causing you to logout and its really annoying.I have the version 4 and I dont recommend it if you want to chat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect it to last","review":"I recommended this unit for 6 months until it stopped working. Horrible customer service included a return to Linksys who sent it back saying that it checks out fine. I now use the equivalent unit from Netgear.

A simple hardware reboot isn't adequate - it needs to be physically disconnected from the power source for several minutes. We get to do this several times each week.

It was so simple to set up that in less than about 15 minutes, my two pc's (connected by their ethernet cables to the back of the router) and my laptop (with a simple to install wireless card, also by Linksys) were all connected to the internet at the same time. I have had it for about 3 months, and have never had a moment's problem with it. I hear the product service is great, but am unable to comment since I have never had to call for help.

A call to Linksys got it working, and it died after 20 minutes of surfing. The next day, I got it running again, and it died again after a slightly longer period. I gave up and went back to the wire. I hesitate to give a bad rating, because with \\"new\\" technology, it's hard to tell if there's something wrong with the product, or my computer, or my modem (linksys also), or my internet provider.

Again everything worked for awhile and then stopped. After several days of deinstalling and reinstalling on the PCs, I got everything working once again. Downloading to the hard-wired PC was quick, but downloading the same file to one of the wireless PCs had 1/10th the speed. At this speed I might as well go back to dial up access instead of DSL!

Try to have the unit above or under the area that you will utilize wireless on different floors. On the same floor, you should be fine. Of course, wall construction makes a difference. If you have a huge house, consider multiple access points. These things are not that expensive, especially if you have own a house where distance is an issue!!! If you want to use wireless by the pool, chances are you can afford to have a wireless AP near a window =)Use your head and you will LOVE this device. As a side note, I've used Linksys PCMCIA wireless network cards, and even the USB wireless device. All great products, and 11mbps on multiple floors in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Home Network","review":"For a non-techy relatively easy to install and set-up to replace \\"hard-wire\\" DSL arrangement.

I would urge anyone who owns one of these units to try pinging the device FROM A WIRELESS connection (the ping via CAT5 connection is fine). I am fairly sure that you will soon discover that the ping will fail within an hour. It is the wireless section of this device that has a bad design. Linksys is not willing to admint it, yet.

Their call center system told me that the average wait time was 10 minutes, and after an hour and a half I had to hang up (there are others in the house who need to use the phone).I took the system back and bought one from Siemens.

Use with VPN... constantly loses your connection... doesn't help with productivity at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK WITH LINUX","review":"I would NOT recommend buying this product if you're using LINUX. My wireless pc card works fine at my office using another wireless hub, but does NOT work at home even when using another Linksys pc card! It seems to work fine in Win98, but DHCP does not ever assign me an IP when using LINUX. I've installed 3-4 firmware upgrades, but the problems persist. I WISH I could return this HORRIBLE product. I've been very happy with Linksys until this product was released. The router seems to assign the wrong MAC address to the wireless iterface, which is probably preventing my LINUX box to see the DHCP ACKs. My DHCP server is getting the DHCP requests, but my wireless computer never gets the response it sends back. The cabled connections seem to work just fine for me, but what's the point if the wireless isn't working? I here the WAP11 works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon","review":"Great unit.

If you try to watch videos from web sites like cnn.com, roadandtrack, etc. the router will crash and have to be re-booted. The older firmware revisions did not have this problem.

After a no-hassle return, I had a new router within a week and am now running smoothly. Be aware that this was not easy to set up and you'll probably be making some calls to technical support (still free and for the most part helpful)but in the end you'll be happy. I know that some reviewers have complained about range - currently the router is \\"hard-wired\\" to a PC on the second floor.

The initial problems were probably the cards' fault, not the router.The range is somewhat less than claimed. I think I get a strong signal under 50 ft, then it starts fading.

It involved upgrading firmware, which can often fail. Further, getting hold of Linksys is not easy at all during business hours. On 2 occasions it took me 45 minutes to get thru.Like I said good solution for plain vanilla Internet access.

You need to access this utility in order to change anything to do with either the router setup or the wireless setup. After literally hundreds of unsuccessful attempts to connect, I called tech support. They said that the site was \\"busy\\", and that I should keep trying.

This happens on the RF and wired ports. It will recover on it's own but frequent pauses can be frustrating. I have spoken with Linksys support. They had me try several code releases but the problem remains. I'd like to recommend this product. The price/feature mix is good but I cannot recommend it until Linksys corrects this issue.If you have this product enable outgoing logging.

The only fix is to power cycle the unit (reset button is ineffective) and then the video will load and play.As others have pointed out, this has been known (not to me until after I purchased the unit) in the community for quite some time and Linksys has not updated the firmware since 2005.What does that say about other products they sell? If they won't even admit that there is a problem, what other bugs exist that you don't know are being caused by your linksys router and that they will not admit or fix?They don't even have the option of loading the older firmware in order to re-enable the video.Best of luck, an ex-linksys fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely usable, unstable and constantly aggravating","review":"I've been using this Linksys wireless router for over a year, so I've got some experience with it. In a word: terrible. Sure, sometimes you can manage to get a wireless signal, but otherwise it'll suddenly drop for no reason, then refuse to let you reconnect. Unplugging it and plugging it back in might help, but who wants to do that a half dozen times a day just to maintain a constant connection?I've tried all the workarounds, from updating the firmware to using a secure connection - and nothing really helps. Oh, and when I do get a stable connection, it's horrendously slow. Somehow, as the connection goes through the cable modem to the router and then to my laptop's wireless card, the speed is reduced to dialup sometimes.I would not recommend this product, unless you regularly purchase electronics as a means of masochism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, if you happen to get one that works!","review":"I've now owned two of these, and neither worked properly.

This is not really Linksys' fault.Second, the range for the wireless part is simply way too short. Despite what the box says, the range I was able to get is about 20 feet, which is not all that much.

I've recently upgraded firmware, but that hasn't helped.I would not buy another device from this manufacturer if (when) I replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst computer add on that I have ever bought. JUNK!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the worst product for the computer routers that you can buy. This router crashes on you all the time. When you call for technical support the people that you are talking to you cant understand because they are from India and also they do not know how to help you anyway because they are idiots. You can never talk to a supervicior or someone from in the United States. I called once and the person asked me for my address, home phone, and social security number. Why is the social needed? I did not give them that and when I said that they could not have that they would not help more they just said that they do not have follow the US laws becuase they are not in the US. I finally got someone in the US after thretening with the BBB. The router that I have is a replacement already and it is just CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!I hope that this review is helpful and that you will make the wise decision. (don't buy it!!!!!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An abysmal product","review":"I have had this Linksys router for about a year, and it has been a living nightmare! It constantly drops the signal and has to be reset, and it stopped working altogether one day. After two hours on the phone with Linksys tech support, I was able to get the Ethernet ports working again - but not the wireless. I've commiserated with many others who've had nothing but trouble with their Linksys wireless products.Now I have a new D-Link wireless router, and it works great. It took me less than a half hour to set up and get running with all three of my laptops (including using WEP security), and the signal from the D-Link router is much stronger throughout my house than the Linksys ever was. I couldn't be happier now that I've ditched the Linksys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Setup Worked Great --for 3 months...","review":"I'm a big fan of Linksys, I have used many of their routers for my customers, so when it was time for me to switch to wireless I naturally bought the BEFW11S4. Installation was simple and setting up security is a snap. The unit performed admirably for 3 months and then I started having problems. The unit would need to be reset occasionally. I could live with that, but now it happens once or twice daily. Very annoying. Also the DHCP server has stopped functioning altogether. I'm able to get along by setting up static ips for my pcs and resetting the unit constantly. I have version 4 of the device. I'll stick with Linksys for their wired routers, but time to try someone else for wireless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died 1 Month After Warranty","review":"Exactly 22 days after 1 year warranty it died.

This device was easy to set up however consistently after 30 minutes it will drop all connections. It requires that you power the device down, then power it back up every 30 minutes for it to work. During that 30 minutes it works just great never drops connections, great connectivity.I have gone through multiple iterations with Linksys support. They were all focusing on reducing the speed at which the connection worked on. To no avail.Tech support is useless. They are aware that this is a problem in a huge portion of the items that they ship, but have no solution to it.I have a standard Linksys cable router as well and it has worked flawlessly for 3 years. I am very dissapointed in this product.When I search on the web for other people with this problem it looks like there are thousands in the same boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Wireless User","review":"I bought this Router because of its popularity. Installing it was quite easy. At first the response was very very poor when I put the router right next to the cable modem on top of the PC. After I put it on the floor, the response time is very good. I am still not sure if it is the PC or the cable modem that causes the problem. The help section however doesn't tell you about things like this. Since many people have spoken negatively about the wireless LinkSys PC card for the laptop, I have decided to buy the one from Netgear. It installs easily with no problem on my Windows 2000 laptop. It works very well too. When I tested the speed, it exceeds the cable modem published rate, amazing. My laptop usually sits downstairs while the router sits upstairs with my desktop. It's true that the signal varies depending on where you use the laptop. I am a happy WIRELESS camper. With rebate and everything, it only costs me ... I got the whole package from Amazon in less than 5 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work.","review":"Linksys has high failure rate: see ... titled \\"Customers share Linksys' growing pains.\\" Within 2 hours of installation I experienced most problems in this article. Both routers I tried were Version-B; however, even though the wireless connection showed 11mpbs, 100% signal strength (since I was only 3feet away), yet was very slow, about 2k transfer from the internet. I got the same slow speed with a direct connection from the PC to the router (not wireless). Exchanged the router, could not login to the second router's configuration screen/IP address (to configure it) until I power cycled the unit. Had to do that twice. Second unit experiences same problems as first. Returned everything. Will try NetGear next.

The manual contains details for the configuration of Windows networking, but no instructions for the configuration of the Macintosh TCP/IP control panel. 3.

After many long and frustrating hours with tech support (and waiting for them to call back :( ) They told me on three different occasions, that I should exchange the router, the card, and the adapter. I did and needless to say, it ended up costing me money in gas and tolls, as well as time. The bottom line is they still couldn't figure out what was wrong, and eventually, the last tech support (who hardly spoke English) simply told me to return the product and get another model. Can you imagine that? What loyalty to the company. Makes you wonder what really happens behind their doors.Needless to say, I did just that, and bought Netgear.Regarding Netgear? Fantastic!!!!!!!!

This is not an official release. Linksys will not provide any technical support. Use this firmware at your own risk\\".I would avoid this product until Linksys releases non-Beta firmware (and the firmware works, based on user reviews), and then I would buy it only if you are adept at firmware upgrades. I'm surprised that Linksys (now owned by Cisco) would let a product out the door like this. Their tech support was no help on this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequent disconnects from internet and cable modem","review":"This item was a big headache.

Couldn't stay connected to AOL thru TCP/IP for more than a few minutes at a time without getting booted off. At least three times a day, the internet connection would be completely dead, and the router and cable modem would have to be powered down and powered back up to re-establish the internet connection. After reading many message boards, and seeing lots of people had the same problem with Linksys routers (not just this model), I sent this back.I got a Belkin F5D6231-4 wireless router as a replacement for about 90 bucks.

Another reviewer mentioned that someone said they were having firmware issues. That was a few months ago. Totally unacceptable.

Then she bought a laptop with Windows XP professional and everything went to hell. We managed to get wireless set up, but the connection was extremeley flaky -- it kept on dropping and we got page not found errors. A search on google brought up a host of newsgroup discussion of problems with firmware. They say that the latest revisions of the firmware are worse than earlier ones. We eventually got the connection to be a bit more stable, but now we get periodic messages saying, \\"One or more wireless networks is available. To see the networks, click here\\" and have to click connect to keep our connection (after an annoying delay). I'm about to order a different router from Amazon and toss this one in the trash.

I have tried reconfiguring varous ways, e.g., static addresses, dynamic addresses, etc. to no avail.So, how is it when it operates correctly? Fine on the hard-wired PC; however, the speed on the wireless connected PC is less than half the speed of the hard-wired one.

The included installation guide was clear and straightforward (with great illustrations). It included all I needed to know to get the router up and running. I didn't even have to install any of the included software. I had a DSL connection on a laptop running Windows XP, and I wanted both to share the DSL connection via a RJ45 wire to another laptop (running Windows 98 2d ed.) in another room, and to be able to get online wirelessly on my primary laptop. This router allowed me to do precisely that.

Linksys still hasn't done a thing about the streaming media bug. This is when you try to use a link that pops open the Window Media player which promptly crashes the router every time. The \\"English as a second language\\" guy in India thumbed his way through the manual and suggested all of the usual crap(MTU,etc) , which of course was fruitless. I can crash it on demand every time. I've tried all of the firmware I can find and searched the forums to try and eliminate the issue without a solution. Very frustrated. I guess it's time to start over and get a Pre N, or wait for the standard to ratify. I also tried the VOIP unit for my Callvantage phone. It was worse than this unit(Went to the D-Link unit.

It literally locks on me about five times a day. I have to get up, unplug the router, wait about thirty seconds, then plug it back in. Sometimes that fixes it, sometimes I have to restart my computer as well. My good friend is a network technician, and even he couldn't figure out why it was doing it. The router itself is about nine feet from me, with no obstructions and the antennas straight up and down, and my connection fluctuates from extremely poor to good. I can take my laptop right now, put it three inches away from the antennas, and the signal would not get any better. It's not my computer, because it works great on other wireless networks, just not ones that use this particular router as an access point.

After 15+ hours on the phone with tech support with Linksys and after the 30 day return policy expired, it became clear that it wasn't going to work, although no one knows why (both computers are brand-new and the DSL connection works great on its own). Linksys claimed that there's something with MSN that changes the configuration, but no one could tell us what the right one was, and every time something would work, something else would go wrong. We spent several lost weekends working on this and our blood pressure shot up exponentially, and Linksys has only offered us a credit with them, not our money back. This products are absolutely TERRIBLE and we wouldn't wish them on anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agony.","review":"I have, at last, installed the linksys wireless system including the router plus the wireless USB card. I have spent upwards of four hours with support personnel, who were unfailingly courteous and anxious to be helpful. The problems are multiple: despite assurances to the contrary there are issues in configuring the system to work with Windows 98 first edition. The signal is weak, despite the fact that the router is only 10' vertically and 20' laterally from the receiving computer. I now have intermittent access to the internet at speeds that are slower than dialup. The whole enterprise has been a black hole for my time and endlessly frustrating. You may well be more fortunate, but if you buy it and it does not function with very little effort, my advice is cut your losses and return it immediately.

I will say that tech support was helpful with the initial setup and configured (they had to be, as the documentation for the \\"advanced features\\" is non-existent). Be sure to ask about the \\"MAC Address Clone\\" feature if you are connecting through a cable modem through which you have already connected via your computer. I, too had the frustration of sending this thing back to Linksys at my own expense and waiting 2 weeks to see it again.

This one looked wonderfully promising, but after 3 weeks of random lockups (after which you must unplug the power cord and reinsert it to get it to respond) in which the PC thinks the router is dead, I'm pulling my hair out.I've read on several Broadband discussion sites that this is a VERY COMMON problem with the BEFW11S4 router VERSION 4. Apparently, version 2 and 3 are fine, but 4 (which is what is currently sold in the US) has some flaws they still have not resolved.Most recent firmware you say? Alas! I have installed it and same thing still happens. Other folks suggested a new beta version of the firmware, but it still has lockup issues too.I would say if you can grab a version 2 or 3 of this router, by all means. But unless you like unplugging your router twice a day to get it unstuck, avoid it until they fix the firmware. As of July 1st, it is still unresolved.-Jim"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, once you've figured out setup","review":"I bought the BEFW11S4 to replace my non-wireless LinkSys BEFSR41 which I liked a lot.

Tested with the Linksys WPC11 card on both a Compaq Presario 14XL (WinME/Win2000) notebook and a Dell Inspiron 7000 laptop (Win2000). In my 1500 sq. ft. house the reception was good or excellent throughout. I was relieved to see the firewall/routing features were identical to that of the BEFSR41 with an additional feature of allowing you to change the WAN adaptor's MAC address (so I did not have to call up my cable modem service to register the new address).The on-line help files provided are very poor (some of the wireless card's online help say \\"Insert detailed description of this tab here.\\"!!!!).I am curious as to how well other wireless cards will hook up to this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!!!!!","review":"Yes, this Wireless router is garbage.

I can't believe it as I am writing this, but I have put up with having to physically power cycle (forcibly reset) the router at least once every two hours! The only reason I have not rushed out and bought a replacement router is because I have spent forever trying to make the best decision and don't want to be in the same shoes in another year or two. I don't know what to do at this point. I have read reviews, guides and visited forums. This is common problem with almost all routers at one time or another but seems to be overly common with this brand/model.

The PDF version of the manual was easy to use to understand how to turn on encryption and limit the # of open ports.I am now using this all over the house and in the yard with excellent reception and very fast speed.

After consulting the Amazon reviews, I quickly discovered that this is *not* an uncommon problem.In addition to the problems with the router, customer service has been slow, two days late on sending RMA information, and does not offer to cover shipping or supply a loaner unit for their defective product.In defense of Linksys, the BEFW11S4 was easy to set up, offered decent range, and operated flawlessly-- until it stopped working.There are a number of choices for 802.11b wireless switch/router/NAT boxes.

No way of knowing for sure.

And when I completed the story, I felt like something was missing, that I hadn't read the whole book - it cut off so abruptly, at 86 pages, and the historical note and pictures seemed there just to make it look longer.

The author seems to assume you have a solid understanding of corporate finance, beyond what you would be exposed to in corporations. The author's way of presenting the material to ask three to four pages of questions, with no explanation and no background material.

When I did inquire, they told me that Amazon made a mistake in the listing, and that they were sorry. They are now offering me a \\"20% discount\\" which I refused, because 20% discount for the 66% of the missing product I ordered is grossly under-cutting it, and term \\"discount\\" implies they are providing something I should not have received in the first place.

RG's most recent edition was published in early 2003 and with all the recent uncertainty in the area, I was nervous to rely on information from 2-3 years ago. However, for this trip, the RG was far better! The main reason it was more useful than LP was that it contained much more detailed explanations of the sites/museums. This book contained maps to almost all the major sites/museums with corresponding letters to explanations of the hieroglyphics/objects within the sites/museums - Far more information than LP. Of course, it also had the usual practical information (hotels, restaurants, getting around, etc.) which we relied upon as well.

I enjoy that time period as much as anyone, but some girl who talks to herself, and roams around while we are wondering why doesn't make for a good movie. This film had no direction, and the scenes in Mexico were a bit weird and disturbing. The end didn't make sense really, but why should it? The rest of the film didn't.

Cher has one expression here: blank. She is very unhappy about something, her family, I guess. She's a runaway, but with street smarts, or so she thinks. There's a soundtrack here, but it's very unobtrusive, which is too bad because some more Cher tunes is just what this vintage howler needs to bring it alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A natural, healthful cure for constipation","review":"My son (10 years old) had been suffering from severe constipation for several years.

He has been taking it for a few months now, and an Ayurvedic doctor advised us that it can be taken for any period of time with no side effects. I am writing this so that if you have a child who suffers from constipation, you can give this miraculous mixture of herbs to help relieve the problem.

Gaining knowledge was more difficult back then, with no internet, no ebay, and little consensus on what was what in the Beatles collecting world. Perry Cox and Joe Lindsay gave us a path to enlightenment, and although some of this book's info and its presentation now looks ancient, it was the first step of a stairway that has been climbed by other authors and fans who owe a debt of gratitude to this pioneering work.

It's sad to see good, original bands like Audio A giving in to [junk] like mainstream trends. Until now, they have always been their own entity. Much like a washed out DC Talk (including Mike, Kevin, AND Toby) AA has given in to popular demand and lost almost everything that made them an excellent band with a phenomenal ministry.But hey, if you're one of those trendy wave riders that liked the last AA album, you'll probably LOVE this one too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch, what happened, guys?","review":"I used to really like Audio A, but LIFT seems to have been hit by some badness:-( Gone are theri deep soul searching lyrics, now we are hit by simple rhyme schemes and silly songs. And Larry is no where to be found! They still have the same great sound, but seem to be plauged by Brittany type pop lyrics. I also didn;t see Ben Cissel's name in the credits, maybe he is the reason the depth and spiritualness of this album is gone. If so, COME BACK BEN THEY NEED YOU!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in alternative christian music!","review":"Newsboys, you better watch out, because this album is hard to beat. Audio A has come up with their most precious release so far. There is no weak song on the track, except \\"Lonely Man\\".The lyrics are amazing, especially in \\"Ocean Floor\\". When we give ourselves to Jesus, he casts our sins to the ocean floor - beautiful! \\"Lift\\", \\"I'm Alive\\", \\"You Still Amaze Me\\" have a great drive and also the slower songs like \\"Speak To Me\\" and the very U2 sounding \\"Tremble\\" are not drowsy at all.Congratulation, very good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL","review":"This case is well built and feels amazing! The brown is a great shade and the cut outs are precise. It feels nice and the leather is almost puffy(not flat/hard like other leather cases) which also adds to the feel of the case. I've been looking for a case for the longest time and was going to go with a silicone until I found this. Glad I did. It has a couple of slots for credit or business cards and also comes with a clip. Stitching so far has been good, but we shall see. For the price I definitely recommend this case for this model.

Can she be serious that there is a link between a societal ban on hitting kids and the rise in child abuse? I think we need to see some hard research on that. If that's not bad enough, she also wonders whether there is something to be learned from her own mother, who freely called out to bisbehaving kids, \\"I'll kill you!\\" Although her concern for the inhibited parent may be justified, she doesn't seem to know when to draw the line on parental aggression nor give the reader a sense of appropriate ways to express anger. Thanks anyway, I'll pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A harangue","review":"I found the tone of the first chapter to be so hectoring that I just couldn't keep reading. I don't doubt she has great advice, but I couldn't read the book. A scold. A very nice counter to this book, and one that I do recommend, is Loving Your Child is Not Enough, Positive Discipline That Works, by Nancy Simalin and Martha Moraghan Jablow. Same gist: children need clear, firm boundaries and rules. Different tones: most parents are too self-involved to take good care of their kids (Spoiling Childhood), versus parenting is difficult work, and here's how to hone your skills (Loving Your Child...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful book","review":"Haddon's book contains a lot of useful information for those of us who are no longer in our teens, and points out some beauty mistakes we make as we age (such as putting our blusher on wrong or choosing the same colors we did in our 20's). This is one of the few books that addresses how to adjust your look as you age. She also gives good advice on health and exercise aimed at more mature bodies. Know going in that Haddon is beautiful, rich, and a spokeswoman for L'Oreal. Her photos are airbrushed so you don't see a single line in her face. Also, we don't all have the financial resources that Haddon has, so you have to adapt much of her advice to fit your budget. I also own the Beauty Bible, which is a better all-around book, but Haddon's book is more tailored to the needs of the over 40 crowd. It's a rich, lovely book with some gorgeous photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"I was very dissapointed with this book. If it were possible I would have given it zero stars. While the photographs are beautiful, the text has very little substance. Ms. Haddon isn't giving us any new information here that we can't find in most beauty and health magazines and on the internet. In fact some of her information is rather uninspired and some actually dated. Simply put, the lovely photographs that comprise this book are not worth $30.00. I would suggest the following titles as a very small sample of books with advise that really, really works. Some to consider: Menopause Without Medicine by Linda Ojeda, The Pilates Body by Brooke Siler, Bobbi Brown Beauty by Bobbi Brown, Facercise by Carol Maggio, and a video Callanetics by Callan Pinckney. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very pretty advertisement for a couple of cosmetic firms..","review":"After seeing Dayle on Ophrah, I rushed to buy her book, thinking that she would have some new perspective on this thing called aging. The book itself is very visually attactive. It is however a chore to read. Long drawn out sections and paragraphs have little substance...but plenty of fluff. Dayle is an impressive woman and a role model...especially in light of her personal struggles. I would have rather heard about how she drew her strength than what comes out in this book. Lucrative contracts with various cosmetic firms appear to have tainted her objectivity...I sure hope she receives a commission from all the women who will undoubtably go and buy what she is selling.Dayle...you've sold yourself short. It's like reading a romance novel from Maya Angelou."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good for the 40-plus ego","review":"I think Dayle Haddon is addressing a very important point: you can still feel and look good into your forties and beyond. You can still take care of your face and body but also remember it's a mind-set -- enjoy your wisdom, your experiences and don't be afraid to be a different sort of beautiful, but just as valid, as you were in your twenties. None of us look 25 when we are 45 and we should not feel that we have to. We are still gorgeous. You have to believe it. Overall, don't be afraid of change and finding ways to be better. That is what I got out of the book and it's a darned important message that women in their forties sometimes forget. Thanks Dayle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a Coffee Table Book","review":"I bought this book in great expectation of obtaining some ideas and hints for beauty treatments for women over 40.

The first chapters deal with the history of the dolls and how they were made, essential to the serious and beginning collector alike. Mertz tells what one should look for in buying a compo doll today. The bulk of the book consists of a \\"by manufacturer\\" Gallery of Dolls, featuring wonderful photos of composition dolls from the years 1900 to 1950, many of which have never been seen in any previous doll book. Photos, mostly by Mertz's husband, Otto, are first rate.

Noll, Hatch, and Marsden (all are Evangelicals) thoroughly dispel the myth that America was ever a \\"Christian\\" nation.

Challenging but hours of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun arcade game port, gets to be difficult","review":"This game is a port of an arcade version, so there aren't any features like saving (which would be useful, considering the game's difficulty). It's great with a friend, and is still fun alone, albeit more of a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Money, Big Prizes... I LOVE IT!","review":"Smash TV for the snes is one of my all time favorite games. Its bloodthirsty irreverance is only matched by the movie Running Man from which it was copied. Yes, the graphics arent that amazing, your main goal is to stay alive in an arena filled with manic killers and armoured robotic ordinance set to destroy meaning you just hold down on the fire button and avoid dying while collecting prize packages. Yes, the bosses arent that hard to beat and the sayings are cheesy and repetitive but it doesnt pretend to be more than it is either which is capitalism and voyeurism on steroids. Frankly, im surprised the good people at Rock Star havnt gotten hold of the franchise and souped this little baby up. Im sure they could add their evil to it just fine. Ultimately, the game is what it is and I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Why even give this two stars? 'Cause I normally like Pyun's martial arts related films.

There are always a lot more enemies than heroes on the screen for the most part and that makes this easy game a little confusing and a little too challenging seeing as how if you get hit like once or twice, you die and when a screen full of bad guys shoots 8 bullets in all different directions, it's kind of hard to didge.Turtles in Time is a much better 2 player game but if you're looking for a slight change of pace, here's your chance with this cowboy shoot em up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the Genesis version.","review":"To start off their are two versions of this game, the SNES version and the Genesis version.This game looks terrible in comparison with the Genesis version,less colors, terrible sprites and ugly sounding music.The only plus would probably be that every boss has their own little voice intro but that really isn't important.The snes version is so much harder, you die in about 4 or 5 shots, period. In the genesis version you have continues and more bonus games. One downfall is that you can only choose between two characters on the gens version, but i think that they are the best characters of the four.Skip the SNES version and go straight for the Gens game.Best of luck too you."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!","review":"These things are wonderful!! They're like someone took a pretzel and shaved it into layers -- they are shaped like a traditional pretzel, but they are thin and crispy and GREAT to dip with or just snack on.

Without Petra where would the Christian music industry be now?All I can say is 2 thumbs up and keep rocking Petra!!!God Bless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Loved Petra!","review":"Revival is a wonderful praise & worshp CD which I enjoyed immensely. Petra was THE pioneer for Christian Rock and they truly blazed the trail for the current genre.I do agree with other reviewers that it would have been great to have all of Petra return to the fold for this one. But times change and I give them credit for trying to inject some \\"newness\\" into their music but still hold on to the personna we die-hard Petra fans know and love.Let's face it though; we're all growing older. In the opening song, Revival, I did hear a slight aging in John's voice (sorry John), not that it made the song bad or anything.If you like Christian Rock and P&W, this is definitely worth having in your Petra collection. I cannot say it is my favorite Petra CD (and I have just about all of them) but I enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petra is back with cool modern praise & worship","review":"The first thing that jumps out at me is John's vocal range; who would have ever thought he could pull this off. The upfront drums that seem to be lacking on most albums today are fresh and very cool.The songs: There are six songs that I think really stand out on this album; \\"Send Revival\\" \\"Jesus Friend Of Sinners\\" \\"Better Is One Day\\" \\"The Noise We Make\\" (it's having to grow on me) and my two favorites on the album \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"How Long\\".There a couple of songs \\"Prodigal's Song\\" and \\"You Satisfy\\" that really seem to be bland or not willing to go anywhere; They both have a good message, but they are just there, nothing more.Overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars for the timely message, great song production, and it being current and I think fresh for this day and time in the music world. This band will continue to move us the way God intended.

Just a wonderful read, especially if you like suspence, mystery and treasure all wrapped up in one package. Nick Gallagher comes on scene after his father dies as his boat sinks while searching for sunken treasure. Accident? Or murder? That is the question, among others, and those are just the start of one fantastic story full of suspense and thrills that have a nice ending. Read it. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid for this. OUCH!","review":"This book sucks! I tried to get into the book and could not. I read two hundred pages of under developed plot and characters. I just could not take anymore and skipped to the end of the book. And I am glad I did it was even an unimaginative ending. This book ranks in my top 5 lame books of all time. Also I can not believe Clive Cussler was endorsing this book on the cover. He must have been getting some cash for his endorsement. If you want to read a good book read Rip Tide by Preston and Child. This is a real treasure hunting book that will grab you and keep you reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book this is.","review":"I got this book from a friend a while back and just never really picked it up, but boy am I glad I finally did.

One thing, it does not work with CFL bulbs at all. This requires a certain amount of wattage in the bulbs to start the dimming, and dimmable cfls don't have enough in them.

Anyway, I love that item! It is easy for me to watch movies in less brightness. Lights fade up and down smoothly. allowing my eyes to adjust.

Try Big Bogus Bomb.","review":"This Is not a story about the hunt for the longest python but the hunt for someone else to find the longest python. The Author spends very little time looking for the snake . When one is found at the end of the book he is off getting married. It never even tells us if some zoo bought the big snake the other guys found. I wanted to hear about catching the snake NOT about a rave on the roof of a bank. if you want to read it wait for the paperback or for the library copy. As a highschool Biology teacher who loves to go herping this was a total bust for me. feel free to e-mail me if you have Questions. Sheldonreptiles4us@earthlink.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Ego: The Hunt for the World's Longest Whine","review":"Well, as treatises on growing into manhood go, it's about average. What gets me is the title: why call it a hunt for a python? All the author hunted was other people to find a snake, and his own elusive maturity. I also cannot imagine going into such an endeavour so unprepared. It would have been more interesting, at least from a herp point of view, if a reticulated python hunted Twigger.Buy this book only if you have a man in your family that refuses to grow up, and you want to show him into what he could deteriorate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need next volume NOW!!!","review":"Ok. So I get sick of trying to read magic battles. So I'm tired of trying to keep straight magic stones and magic lockets and magic words, and I get annoyed with having to submerge myself into a magic world just to understand the story. With Hot Gimmick, I didn't have to. This was the first manga I ever purchased, and it was SO worth my money. It was on my level, and I enjoyed every bit of it. Such a pity volume three isn't out til march, and volume two isn't in stores yet. If you haven't read this manga, and if you're a big shoujo fan, read this manga. NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Choice","review":"This had quite a disappointing plot. Although in the start it seemed like it could get somewhere, upon reaching the end of the novel, there was really no personal character development WHATSOEVER on Hatsumi OR Ryoki's part. This story just displays how Ryoki USES Hatsumi. Personally, if I were the author, I would have made Hatsumi end up with Shinogu, who is a much better ideal. It seems completely unlikely that Hatsumi would choose an immature brat like Ryoki. Also, Hatsumi herself is not a good example setter for teens who read this novel. She has no self confidence at all and allows herself to be bossed around by anyone and everyone. All in all, this novel COULD HAVE gone somewhere but in the end it was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of crap!!!","review":"First of all, I read all the five star reviews, and I can tell why people like this manga.It's like Gossip Girl, except I think that it's even more explicit.I knew beforehand, that there would be rape, groping, and all kinds of misbehavior.But I didn't realized that it would be a bunch of crap when I started reading.The heroine is such a loser. I understand meeting a guy for the fist time, and she gets groped.But she continues to be so dumb, and even agrees to be his slave. She has no dignity for herself.and the rape scene was just too much for me.If anyone wants a manga about romance, I recommend \\"High School Debut\\", or \\"Kimi Ni Todoke\\" it's not as \\"sensational\\" as Hot Gimmick, but its sends a message that relationships should be honored, not abused like in Hot Gimmick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there done that","review":"Eh..I've read and watched other mangas/animes that have better storylines. This story is not that original, and the fact that the main character has no backbone gets kind of old and annoying. I also couldn't stand the artwork. The characters are not cute at all. It seemed like the author tried to change her drawing style around volume 4 or 5, to try and give the characters more emotion/depth (with the humorous expressions with buggy eyes, dropping jaws, etc.) but it didn't work for me. If you want a better story with blackmail and with better artwork, I highly suggest Peach Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read some other shoujo","review":"I borrowed this series from a friend and I read it all the way through. It really isn't anything unique which is fine...that's not the reason I hate it. The main character Hatsumi is an idiot. She can't think for herself and lets all the male characters push her around. She's a terrible female lead. Read a shoujo manga or any other manga for that matter, that has a smart female character in it. Hatsumi's idiocy is just too much--just sickening. I read it all to see if she grows a damn brain but she remains an idiot forever, it seems.There is no growth for her character or for the other characters either. Her sister is a far better character than her. If you want some good shoujo manga read Ouran Host Club instead. The female protagonist-- Haruhi has more brains in a strand of hair than Hatsumi has in the vast empty space which is her skull. Hot Gimmick is poo."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd have given it 5 stars if there weren't so much rape.","review":"Like my title says: I'd have given Hot Gimmick 5 stars if it didn't have so many ALMOST rapes. I read the first 4 Volumes and quit because it was too upsetting. I like the art, the characters (mostly), the storyline... It's really interesting and well-done. But when (spoiler) the main character was very nearly gang-raped, it was just too much. I couldn't read any more. If you get to that part and you're not upset, then you'll probably love the series. But if you're just considering buying it... I'd say read some in a store, to see what you think, before putting money into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"no magic s***","review":"I finally found a manga that i love!!!hot gimmick has a great story and beautiful art.buts its not for everyone.i myself like pure romance novels, i dont like magic stuff.(which is weird because when i read 'regular'books, i enjoy a nice medevil story)if u like magical creatures and action adventure stuff,this is not for you.this book is a\\"love-dovey\\" novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"facinating","review":"2 year old loves the songs and relates as his life experience, laughing and singing along.

When I got this game for a buck, I figured it would be as good as the other tiny toons titles (bab's big break, Tiny toons for the nes). What I got was a game that was good for the first level and then pathetic afterwards. It really proves too much of a challenge too early. The only way that I beat the game was playing it through \\"children\\" mode. This took a lot of the fun out of it however because there are no boss battles. All in all, not a good game, try the other ones though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that started it all here","review":"I have the original UK import on Creation. \\"Live Forever\\" broke oasis in the US.

The book just started great. I like the fact that this man, although he is very mysterious, knows what he likes...and sometimes he likes it before he realizes that he likes it. This woman has strength she doesn't know she has but is willing to stand alone for her beliefs. Why aren't more books this engaging. Some of my favorite authors have gone to contemporary mysteries, but they don't take you where historical romances go...in my opinion. While this book isn't for everyone, it is the kind of book that I relish. We need more of these type of romances where it is about the personal beliefs and convictions of the hero and the heroine. The book is very intuitive in the fact that, if this is the kind of book you like to read,it does not disappoint. It gives you all the sex, intrigue, dangerous plots and twists that you never see coming. Not for everyone, but definitely for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great breakthrough CD","review":"This CD has a broad mix of styles, which exemplifies vocal agility, legato lines, and the ever mellow tones of Hawaiian style music. The two lead singers have amazing voices- one an agile falsetto and the other a Cazamero-like baritone that both sound natural and unforced. Musically this CD is pleasing to the ear, not only because of the range in styles, but the group also pays careful attention to the text. The only flaw I found was in their rendition of \\"Lady in Red\\" where the singer used quarter tones which didn't seem to match with the style of the piece. Nevertheless, this CD is an EXCELLENT purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"I first heard this group while listening to KAPA radio in Kona on the Big Island. It took me a long time to find out who they were since the radio station refused to name the group. I just new I loved their sound. I finally discovered 'Ale'a. Their cover of \\"Baby Can I Hold You\\" is, bar none, the best version of that song. I love Hawaiian music and this group is one of the best. Beautiful sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Why do poeple find Caligula fascinating? It was because of his obscure, cruel, fascinating behavior. Unfortuantely, Mr. Barret Tends to focus, often too in depth, of the family lineage of Caligula. I swear he spends more time talking about how someone is related to some minor character than our beloved emporer. He makes more references to other people than he does the title character. I almost gave up on this book God knows how many times. But, the hope that he would eventually talk about one of Caligula's crazy antics made me press on, often bored to tears. If you want a good history on the former emporer, I would highly recommend the episode Of Biography that A & E did on him. I would not read this book unless you are an insomniac and can't afford medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stig of the Dump","review":"In England, it was required of us to read Stig of the Dump at school.

I am now reading it to my 6 year old daughter and she is loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Album!!!!","review":"Jyve V is truly on to something that can definitely compete in the Latin Pop and English Pop markets. They have an energy that they have captured in \\"Solar\\" that trancsends cultural boundires. \\"Solar\\" contains a variety of songs in Spanish and English that range from sensual ballads to dance songs filled with hip hop beats and Latin spice. Songs that you can move to and groove to. Anyone that loves pop, hip hop, or latin dance will love this album. Its diversity will appeal to a wide range of music lovers everywhere. They are a unique blend of both cultures and are not hindered in either language. Their smooth sound is captured in each and every song. You can feel the Latino, the youth and the energy in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"good show, poor remastering","review":"The digital remaster has made the picture clearer, but introduced artifacts such as white squares at the corners of some scenes and occasional white lines. I returned the first set and am now on my second, but the artifacts are still there. Since these aren't present in the original DVDs I rented, I assume they were introduced during a sloppy remastering. Too bad, I enjoy this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Revival","review":"With the scope TV dramas have today, with the possibility of international locations and virtually no restriction on what can be brought to life in action scenes, I had quite forgotten how things used to be. Claustrophobic static, low-budget sets were the name of the game in British TV drama and comedy of the time, with very few forays into the outside world meant that storylines had to be intriguing and tight, and acting needed to be convincing and on-the-ball. In this respect 'The Sandbaggers' does not disappoint. The stories are just as dark and cynical as you'd expect from a Cold War spy drama. 'Callan' is also a must-have from this genre. It's great to see these 'greats' being resurrected for ardent LWT fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color of chrome","review":"Looks good.

One of these works was Portraits, which had Vangelis and Anderson together--I fell in love w/ their music and have bought all the music I can with the two of them performing together.Short Stories does not disappoint.

I looked at the length of the movie (89 minutes) and figured it would cut out a lot of the book. But I did not expect it to cut out so many of the extremely vital events, conversations, characters and stories. The plot in the book is extremely thick and the movie is merely a portion of a shodow of the book. Needless to say I was very disappointed in this movie. If you have read the book, don't waste your money or time on this movie. However, if you haven't read the book, this may be a mildly entertaining movie for you. But don't write a book report from this movie and don't expect the same deep moral storyline that is in the book. If you seen this movie, don't let it deter you from reading the book. The book is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"book girl","review":"It arrived broken in the mail.

It was not expensive, so no big deal, but I won't order any more films through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This TV version of one of the great psychological novels ever is terrible. One main problem is that one can't condense a 500 page book into a 2 hour TV movie and make it good at the same time. Avoid it, but see it only if it comes on TV once again. Not worth the rental price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, but still cannot hold a candle to the book.","review":"You could watch this adaption of Dostoevsky's masterpiece rather than reading the book. Although, I'm not sure why you would want to. It's not a bad adaption, but you would be doing yourself a great favour to read the book first.However, I must say that Patrick Dempsey plays a better Raskolnikof than I would have expected, considering that... well it's Patrick Dempsey. And credit must go to the casting of Julie Delpy: the actress with whom I personally envisioned the role of Sophia, when I read the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"ha","review":"You call this a correct adaptation of Dostoevsky's wonderful and chilling novel, I dont think so.This is even worse then the 1930's version. I know that it was hard taking a 500 pg. novel and turning it into a 90 minute film, but for Christsakes why didnt he just make a 3 hour version. I found myself wondering throughout the movie what happened to the vulnerable, scared, depressed, excitied, and strange characters that Fyodor created. This is what I call a disaster of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valley of Light","review":"A somewhat sad movie with a strange plot that leaves you a bit onedge, even at the end of the movie.

If I have to use in-line styles throughout the app, why bother with CSS? When choosing a book on CSS, make sure it mentions external style sheets. I did not find anything about external CSS at all in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most solid CSS reference I have seen yet","review":"I love this book. Each CSS 1, 2 and proposed CSS 3 property is listed along with examples, browser support or lack thereof, and then goes on to detail exactly what bits are not supported. This book belongs on every designer/developer's shelf and will be valid for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone wants it?","review":"I bought this book because the review spoke about a \\"pragmatic and practical\\" approach, and \\"how CSS actually works in current major browsers\\". The reality is that this book lists the properties (I can have that from the W3C web site) and rates a property \\"safe\\", \\"unsafe\\" or \\"partial\\" - but almost no explanation what the implementation of this property actually causes in what browser. Vital information for the real world use of CSS is non-existent, not even caveats that certain properties, when applied to certain elements, can cause certain browsers to crash. In my opinion, this book is useless. Anyone wants it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference for CSS","review":"Core CSS Cascading Style Sheets is a book that every web designer who wants to use or uses CSS should have in their library. Avoiding CSS for some time, I finally decided to look into CSS for my site designs. Setting up type (i.e., typography) for a web page is a hit and miss situation. It is problem that finally led me to employ CSS in my designs. I found Core CSS Cascading Style Sheets an excellent place to start. The book is a complete overview of CSS including, definitions, differences between the major browsers, what is and is not supported by major browsers, and examples. This book isa good investment if you plan on using CSS in your web designs. I would recommend Core CSS Cascading Style Sheets to anyone wanting to know more about CSS and its implimentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restoring the Christian Soul","review":"This book is about helping people overcome the hurts in their lives. Forgiveness and getting set free by the power of God. It was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Literary Eruption!","review":"This anthology of fiction and poetry by authors with North Dakota connections is essential to anyone with an interest in North Dakota. It's also a wonderful excursion for anyone; the stories and poems express the diversity of life in one of our more interesting--and least understood--states. There is history, geography, love, grief, anger, passion, and faith in these pages--a mix of strong voices exploring issues of home, land, kin, and \\"the other,\\" as well as a host of other themes.Authors include Roland Flint, Louise Erdrich, Jon Hassler, Louis L'Amour, Thomas McGrath, Kathleen Norris, Antony Oldknow, Mark Vinz, Larry Watson, and Larry Woiwode, as well as many other other fine, less famous writers.The beautiful introduction by Martha Meek (who edited this collection with her husband, poet/editor Jay Meek) is alone worth the price of the book. It's a moving introduction to a collection that truly captures the North Dakota environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good, considering their other music","review":"I would skip this one.

I had the impression that Lilly spent her time in some sort of dark depression wandering through a mystery with no focus. Turns out the book was well-written, the ending to the mystery followed the clues, and while the book dealt more solidly with the violence in Lilly's past it was well-placed and not contrived. I enjoyed the book. The characters were as well-developed as in her past books and so was the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Series","review":"I thought this book (#5) was the best of the series! I was all wrong about who the perpetrator was, and I was pleased with the way the mystery was resolved. This one was darker than the previous four books, but it was very much in line with who Lily Bard is. I was glad to see the character address certain issues that seemed so obviously to stalk her from book 1. Would love to have a sixth book in the series to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put these books away","review":"I have become a Charlaine Harris fan through True Blood, the Sookie books and now I'm reading the Teagarden series, too. This one was really complex and the story line with Jack ended perfectly.

The story revolves around the women Lily meets at a support group she attends at the behest of new husband, Jack Leeds.I thought the story was fairly bizarre, and was a bit disappointed in the series ending with a whimper rather than a bang, but I enjoyed the character of Lily just as much as ever. If you are reading the series, this is a decent conclusion. If you are new to the character, definitely start with the first book, Shakespeare's Landlord, which introduces this fascinating character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful Series","review":"I love this series, and this newest addition didn't disappoint me. Lily continues to grow and change, both in her personal and professional life. I thought Ms. Harris combined the mystery, with Lily' personal struggles to come to grips with her past and future, very well. I hope there will be more Lily, Jack, and Shakespeare Arkansas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Harris Book","review":"Charlaine Harris has done it again with another superb book in the Lily Bard Mystery Series. Lily has decided to go for counseling to deal with her past. True to form she is soon tripping over dead bodies and everyone is confiding in her. This wasn't what she signed up for but clenches her teeth, listens, and sets out to solve the mystery. Of course there are a lot of twists and turns and mishaps along the way. The book flows well and moves along at a decent pace. It is not an on the edge of your seat mystery but there are certainly moments like this.The characters are believable and mostly likeable and it was really nice to find out a lot more about Lily's personal life and her past. I would highly recommend this book and it is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good example of a survivor.","review":"This story was worth reading since it portrays a woman who survived a terribe ordeal and still fights back.

I loved everything about doing this with my son, except that the birth certificate is really, truly, seriously, cheap and hideous. I actually made up my own, printed it on cardstock and cut it out because the one that comes with the bear is UGLY. It is basically a giant advertisement for the company and has a big, ugly moose on it. I wish I had saved it to post a picture of it here to share with you, but I threw it out. It's totally pathetic that they advertise the cherished memories you can save on your own birth certificate for your bear because I can't imagine anyone wanting to save such an ugly piece of trash. Cute bear, but make your own birth certificate for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the jew likes it","review":"The first time I heard this CD I was absolutely blown away. She has a voice and quality of sound that rivals Sarah McLachlan (and I don't make that comparison often.) Being a Jew, I don't tend to listen to a whole lot of the Christian music, but she's so outstanding that for her I'll make an exception. The act of enjoying such fine music surely makes God happy, no matter what religion.

When her album was released, I still couldn't find it here, so I downloaded every single of her mp3s. I love them all, especially \\"Say Won't You Say\\" and \\"Charity\\". It has more rock type of music, and I like it -- and I'm not a rock fan! Her lyrics, her voice and the music is catching. Really wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grew on me!","review":"When I first listened to this album I think much of it.

While it doesn't make the best first impression, it's very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal","review":"Few artists get me to buy EVERY albuumn they've ever made. Jennifer Knapp is one of them. Her authenticity as a Christian gifted with superlative talents she has submitted is a work of art in and of itself. She soars on this album. I give this album to my friends, whom I love, who have not come to know the love of Christ. Knapp's lyrics and Carly Simon-meets-Natalie Merchant- voice allows her to sing 'em directly into all 4 chambers of your heart where the melody of praise and gratitude makes every day a good-to-be -alive kind of day!

Ms. Rubio is without a doubt the hottest thing going in Latin Pop but this CD does not show Pau at her best.

His first was a first hand account of his experience of life at the Front in WWI. This is propoganda pure and simple. After a while his great sense of humor comes through. I admire his sense of patriotism and wish that more Americans felt the way that he does. But the book is centered more on drumming up recruits for the war effort. Still it is an amazing glimpse into WWI and America during war. His take on our treatment of military these days would be very interesting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new era of monologue study","review":"Neil Freeman has taken what all actors and theatre professionals do and put it together in one book (or three!). He's put the modern version of speeches & soliloquies and placed them side-by-side with the folio versions. He's also added insightful commentary on the changes and highlighted important aspects. Shakespeare was meant to be performed (not read) and you can't perform his plays without examing the folio for clues to character and inspirational guidelines. This book makes streamlines this process. Now if only someone would publish all of the plays like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Xikar Did It Right!","review":"A friend of mine had this cutter and the novelty alone convinced me to purchase it. Once I used it I was really impressed, it is sharp and cuts cleanly and now I have a really cool cutter that everyone else wants. Also, after I received the cutter and registered it with Xikar they sent me a free leather carry case. I am very pleased and would recommend it - Xikar did it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality motor oil.","review":"I looked at many of the grades sold by Valvoline and other manufacturers.

I read these rave reviews on here and decided to listen to the samples of this CD. The title of my review says it all. The world's greatest blues guitarist??? Whatever it is you're smokin'.....I don't want any! This has got to be one of the worst sounding electric guitars I've ever heard! It's so shrill thin and irritating that I couldn't listen for very long without a headache. If you want to hear some great electric blues, buy something by Gary Moore. This guy couldn't stand on the same stage with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blooze, blooze, blooze!","review":"Mr Earl is BACK! Definitely his best since \\"Live in Europe\\". No jazz in sight, only soul-saving and gut-wrenching blues!It's like each songs pays hommage to a particular blues man. From the swinging Freddie King-style opener, over rough'n'ready Howlin' Wolf (Wolf Dance) and John Lee Hookers type tunes to the sweet'n'soulful closer Donna... This whole album's a gem.Ronnie Earl is definitely one of the top 3 best blues guitarists out there today. Wonder what a collaboration between him and Duke Robillard would sound like?Gentlemen? An idea for the future?Five stars! Anything less is an abomination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronnie Earl is the world's best guitarist!","review":"Phenomenal! Jaw-dropping! Awesome! I could go on, but I think you get the picture. With this release Ronnie Earl returns to the killer Blues guiter sound that I fell in love with when I first heard \\"Blues Guitar Virtuoso Live In Europe\\". The band is tight, and the songs are bluesy...no jazz-fusion thrown in on this one. If anyone were ever to ask you what modern Blues guitar player was the very best, you could name Ronnie Earl...then submit this CD as evidence and you'd have a very compelling case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Miso soup. This version is too grainy.","review":"I have one or two servings of Miso with our without Tofu everyday. If you're a vegetarian, Miso is one way to get some of your B vitamins, as most B vitamins only come from animals. Miso is fermented and the bacteria that thrive in the ferment are full of B vitamins because bacteria are animals. Anyways this version is too grainy, the seaweed is in very small, almost ground up pieces and the flavor is way too salty for my tastes. If you like Miso soup either make your own, or try the Kikkoman products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It -- Dreadful","review":"I like Seaweed soup and just love the same product from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get it, it's 5-star!).This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. Wish there was a zero-star rating.I didn't finish the first cup even (but did give it a second try the next day with same result). Therefore, I only used one 2-serving envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. But ALL the Miso-cup were equally dreadful!!!I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes really bad","review":"I love miso soup and was shocked that this soup was so bad. The smell alone was enough to make me want to dump it out. I can't put my finger on what exactly was so bad about it, but after making one cup I threw the box away."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION !","review":"Having been raised on miso soup, I was looking forward to trying this instant variety. Objectively and politely reviewed, it is just terrible! When stirred briskly into boiling water, the granules become suspended briefly but do NOT dissolve, producing a brown sludge at the bottom of the cup. The presentation is unappetising. The taste is execrable. The bits of seaweed are minusule. And the deadly salt content is ten times (10 X) the recommended allowance! I am not sure what this is, but I can tell you from 70 years of experience with wonderful miso soups here and in Japan that this product is not fit for human consumption. I threw it out, not wishing to see it restocked and resold by the Seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your regular instant soup...","review":"This is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick. It will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do. Also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java - it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine. True it has a lot of solium, but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals. The seaweed veriety is the best. Open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away, for others it may take some time to get used to. Do try. Your body will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like the flavor","review":"Sorry guys, I don't know if I wasn't tasting REAL Miso Soup at my local restaurant, but the thing is I didn't like this one bit, and I still have lots of packages left! haha.. I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted, at home. But, I didn't like the flavor, don't know if I'm missing something, but better buy one (ONE) a see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH 4.5","review":"This is a great cd of old Albert tunes from the early 50s & 60s good quality for the age.

The drumming is bland; alternating the snare and bass drum on the up and down beats with little to no change up. The vocals and lyrics are so-so.

But at half-way through, I've realized I'm just bored and I dont care about any of the characters. The ponderous pacing is painful, the random mixed Povs are weird and dont mesh well.I quit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive.","review":"This was the first novel I've read by Morgan, but after reading Market Forces, I'll have to go back and pick up his first two efforts. Other reviewers have said this book is the weakest of the three he's written; if that's so, the first two must be spectacular!I greatly enjoyed this novel. True, it wasn't a classic for the ages, but what is? Or rather, what is recognized as being a classic at the time it's written? *wink* The writing was crisp and flowing, never bogged down, and was lean without being light in description. The dialogue was smooth, and the characters were great. All of them had their seedy sides, things that made me say 'what the hell is wrong with you?', but that's what I liked about them. No cardboard cutouts for me, thanks. I like conflicted characters; anything else is boooooring."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Richard K Morgan","review":"I've enjoyed every Richard K. Morgan book I've read. All of them. MARKET FORCES stands out as my favorite for its uniqueness and maybe for the maturity of it. Its not quite the gratuitous SF fun that the rest of his books are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every author has an outlier","review":"Preposterous premise: Corporate executives compete against corporate rivals and internal peers by managed road rage challenges. Can't see how that would select for the best upper management. Book jacket notes from the author said this was based on a short story. That's all the treatment the idea deserved. Trying to stretch it into a novel was a complete disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"A juvenile, pedantic rant masking as a science fiction novel. Yeah, I understand this is supposed to be satire, but 400 pages - give me a break. Couldn't finish it. Buy Altered Carbon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road Warrior meets NAFTA","review":"The dystopian scene is the UK in about the year 2050. The meritocratic world has three classes of people: Zek-Tiv's (executives) who run things and settle scores in blood, Zone-Dwellers who resemble 1984's proles and also settle scores in blood, and the rest of the world, which is basically a huge sharecropper society.The \\"hero\\" of the story has qualms about his day job, which mostly involves running bloody civil wars for profit, and almost saves his soul by defecting to the UN, but in the end the golden handcuffs work as well as ever. I liked that touch.All this has come about because of globalization which, among other things, was put in place to keep the western world permanently up, and everyone else permanently down.In this book the violence is ultra, the sex is pornographic, the background is an anti-market rant. Oh, and there's a cute reference to his other books.I finished the book, but didn't particularly like it. It's simply too much of a rant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible future for us","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It covers a corporate culture gone amok where executives actually killed each other in the roads and in conference rooms. Corporation were extremely powerful and were funding and actively participating in wars. Maybe the future world envisioned in this book isn't so far fetch. Along these lines I also recommend Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakneck action in this standalone work","review":"Somewhere between the Kovacs SF and the brutal fantasy, Morgan gave us <em>Market Forces</em>, a near-future dystopia that combines Death Race with The Firm.Evil corporate suits fight - in cars - to climb the ladder. It contains all the Morgan hallmarks: sex, violence, stony-hearted protagonists, cinematic action and a vicious lambasting of both capitalist and anti-capitalist movements.Sadly, and wrongfully, overshadowed by his other works, Market Forces has a lot to offer - primarily entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible disappointment","review":"I loved \\"Altered Carbon\\" (I constantly suggest it to friends) and thought \\"Broken Angels\\" was OK (not as good as the first but a decent sophomore effort, stupid twist at the end aside), but this was just a big disappointment. Heavy-handed social commentary masquerading as 3rd-rate science fiction - I should, perhaps, know better than to buy fiction that has a 'suggested reading' post-script, much less one that features Chomsky and Michael Moore. The cutesy bit where the protagonist ends up reading Morgan's first book really pushed me over the edge.Avoid this if you liked \\"Altered Carbon\\" and pray Morgan can re-find his groove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Kovacs novels, but this one was a miss","review":"I love the philosophical angles of all 4 of Morgan's books that I've read, but I really had trouble believing the world of Market Forces. While the Kovacs novels draw on hard boiled themes and technological horrors, Market Forces seemed to be half Michael Moore, half Fast and the Furious.Love the premise, but the action doesn't grab me. Definitely give it a try if you like his other stuff, but don't let it burn you to the point of missing the Kovacs novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth finishing","review":"I ususally persevere to the end of whatever I pick up to read. I very much enjoyed Morgan's two previous books, with Altered Carbon, the 1st one, the better of the two. I saw the recent NY Times Review of Books review of this work and immediately looked forward to more entertainment from an author I've liked in the past.I got through over 300 pages of this more than 400 page book, and stopped. I say 'got through' because it wasn't entertaining after the initial exposition of the theme. This might have been a decent read at 200 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it would make a socialist wanna swing side","review":"Totally un-realistic and unbelievable story, characters lacking any interest, full of clichés, my guess is that most of the good reviews were based on biased opinions made out of this book synopsis, not from actual readers.Alternatively, thriller for politically correct readers having never read a thriller.For all the others, go back to effective and well written social thrillers like those of Raymond Chandler, Jim Thomson, Chester Himes, James Crumley etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"as bad as It could have been written by 14 years old adolescent.","review":"After reading the back cover critics I bought it expecting some quality.I read it entirely looking for that little sample of quality and i'm still looking after it.really the story is ridiculous. maybe because I'm spanish and I don't get the philosophy behind it, i'm just kidding, this book could have been written by an adolescent (may be richard Morgan wrote it when he was 12)the story is about brokers that kill other executive on the road before they reach their office so they can get their job. can you think about something more stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A juvenile mockery of his Takeshi Kovacs novels","review":"I was very hopeful about Market Forces as I really enjoyed Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs novels. But I was stunned by just how terrible this book was. I literally thought the whole thing was a joke, and read through the first few chapters hoping he would start the \\"real\\" story. The premise and plot make absolutely no sense. This \\"investment\\" firm hires stunt drivers who earn their reputation by killing each other in car races. They have no actual investment skills, and how the firm actually makes any money is never explained (at least not before I could no longer stand to read). It almost seemed that the whole book was slapped together by a 12 year-old writing under Morgan's name. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The future of investment banking","review":"This was a great book. While not the cheeriest view of the future, it was entertaining. I see a lot of similarities between the characters in the book and on the Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of crap!","review":"Considering how much fun his first two books were, this pointless violence, sex, drinking and machismo bored me so much I dropped the book halfway through. What happened to this guy? Did success make him write this in a hurry to please his publisher? Man, this book has no real plot except to drive, drink, f**k and write some of the worst prose in the English language. I hope #4 is better but I'll try a library copy first......"},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad falling off","review":"Altered Carbon and Fallen Angels were very, very good--clever, noir-ish, cyberpunky and exciting. This one is an anti-globalization tract very thinly disguised as a novel, and it is dumber than you can imagine. Too bad--on the strength of his first two, I had vowed to read every word Morgan published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Globalized nightmare","review":"Wow, very dark, super bleak sci-fi from this promising author. This is globalization gone horribly wrong. The book was maybe 50-75 pages longer than it had to be, but I highly recommend it nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Preposterous","review":"I enjoyed Morgan's first novels but this one was a real disappointment. Morgan clearly doesn't understand economics and political science. Career advancement depending on wins an armored car duel? Megacorporations making billions legally funding wars? And I was floored by Morgan's recommendations at the end of the novel. The writers he listed are buffoons. I guess Morgan had an off day - or perhaps an off couple of months. Pass on this one. It's really not worth reading, and I'm sorry I bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort after two winners","review":"First off - I truly enjoyed Altered Carbon and Broken Angels - superb, dense, pieces of hard sci fi that were hard to put down.I didn't like this book and could barely finish it. The storyline was predictable, the writing was below Morgan's usual standard and the political analysis was simplistic to say the least.This actually is not a sci fi book at all but a polemic. The author should spare us the warmed over Chomsky and stick to the far future. I look forward to a return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"At best, a disappointment...","review":"I read and enjoyed Mr. Morgan's 1st two books, so I tossed this one in my luggage for a recent trip. This is one of those books where you tell yourself, \\"This is going to get better soon - in a few pages he's going to pull me in - any minute now I'm going to start enjoying this.\\" I'm 2/3rds of the way through and I'm still on the outside, looking in. I find chunks of the posited social system ridiculous and the dialog (perhaps because I don't accept the context) is wooden. Sorry - gotta recommend giving this one a pass..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say it","review":"After reading the Takeshi Kovac's series, I was thrilled when I foundMarket Forces. Unfortunately it left me very disappointed. Whereas Morganwas able to create a rich and textured world of the future in the Kovacsseries, this one is barely believable and somewhat 2-dimensional. Theprotagonist is certainly no Kovacs, either, although I suspect that iswhat Morgan wanted. My apologies Morgan fans, I did not want to write thisreview. In my opinion, though, you can miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"While looking for a new author, well just a new book to read that might just be a tad outside my usual reading list, a friend of mine in europe suggested this author calling it \\"cyberpunk gritty\\"well i don't know what cyberpunk gritty was but I was very glad she reccomended it. I fully intend to look into his other books and have just added him to my \\"must read\\" pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least of Morgan's novels to date","review":"I'll be brief: this is the least of Morgan's books. The writing is almost a parody of his better work. The characters are cut-outs. The premise, while amusing, is poorly thought out and explained. The politics are pushed too nakedly (and I'm a member of the choir Morgan is preaching to.) Do yourself a favor and just re-read Altered Carbon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyberpunk from the top","review":"This book is set in a future where corporations are at the top, and most of society is at the bottom.Where most books of this genre look at things from street level, this one looks out from the so called top, from inside the corporation.It drives forward to a future where violence is part of the corporate structure, and is used to resolve disputes both internally and between corporations.This is the kind of book that would make a very bad movie, but made for a good read. The action sequences were done well, and I looked forward to them.I would recommend this book to people that like this genre and are looking for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice screenplay for a Keanu Reeves movie!","review":"The car-crash death matches are beyond silly and the novel is hardly speculative. Major corporations already influence conflicts in poorer parts of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh wow i heard they got worse but not this worse","review":"Yeah man this blows. I mean like really blows. They have like totally gone towards mainstream punk like Bowling for Soup. Yeah they definately lost nething they had when tom left to start streetlight manifesto. They sound a lot more like the old catch 22 in fact better the keasbey nights by streetlight is much better than catch 22's but their own original album Everything Goes Numb is even better than catch 22 ever did. Yeah as far as im concerned Catch 22 is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow..... thats all i can say","review":"wow ... this cd is disapointing. If your expecting another keasby nights you will be very surprised. It serriously doesnt even come close to any of their previous recordings. If you want to listen to a more pop/ska type record i guess this would be a good thing to buy. If your just being introduced to catch 22 then i strongly recomend buying keasby nights instead. I gave it 2 stars because catch 22 put out the album and they are an amazing band. I would buy it just to complete your catch 22 colection. I felt the only good song was number 7. If i could say it one more time BUY KEASBy NIGHTS INSTEAD. Oh yea go see them live they are increadible. Buy the cd just to support this insanly good band even if it is as bad as it is. they should be respected for there amazing previous albums. Maybe we will all forget this album was ever created and they will make another keasby nights. that would be the day. i guess try to enjoy this album if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"CATCH22, THEY ROCK","review":"Buy the CD, judge for yourself. If you are looking for Keasby Nights all over again, go get yourself another copy of it and stop moaning. If you want fresh new sounds with the same AWESOME band, go buy yourself Dinosaur Sounds. Catch 22 ROCKS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New direction,same energy","review":"Granted,as many of the reviewers here,it took me less than a minute to buy the cd. I listened to it one time,and put it away for a few months. I picked it back up and popped it in my cd player on a long drive and fell in love with it!The song writing is a little different,and true, Ryan sounds totally different than anyone else (kevin does the lead vocals for most of the older songs). But, Catch 22, and the ska scene itself is never just about the lyrics. The horns are simply amazing on the album. Yes,they are slower than on Alone in the crowd, and keaseby nights, but I'm never let down at the re-invention of the horns by C22.The lyrics are a little more mature,and reflect a lot more what the band, is facing. I mean, come on, would you expect men to write songs like boys? The daily life is different, and thus songs are going to be too. The shows are still as good with dinosaur sounds as they've ever been.Evolution of a band is a must have, and I think this album is too."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can you not like this?","review":"as a huge Catch 22 fan i do not understand how everyone else doesnt like this catch 22 new sound...after all, the sound didnt change much, it just matured into something better. i do recommend \\"keasbey nights\\" as the bands best album...live on Catch 22 and try to catch them on the SKA IS NOT DEAD TOUR (w/ mustard plug and more!) thanx"},{"rating":"1","title":"We Want Keasby","review":"In the words of Reel Big Fish: \\"Everything Sucks.\\"Well, maybe not everything. The horns are still good. But everything else seems poppy and simplified. I'm still going to see them at the \\"Ska is Dead\\" show but this new cd is completely dissapointing compared to Keasby Nights, as many fans have pointed out. Those poppy vocals don't cut it and the lyrics don't either. I say go back to the good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dunno","review":"i have been a catch 22 for a while now and well i must say it is a sad day when i say that this cd isnt all that great, it is the first cd i have bought by any artist and said wow i wish i haven't, i will give them credit tho there are a few good tracks but if you are a catch fan and want some uplifting check out Streetlight Manifesto, it is like the keasby sound, sorry fellow catch fans i am just not impressed with Dinosaur Sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst ska has to offer","review":"good charlotte with horns is the only way to describe this cd. so if you like good charlotte i'm sure you'll appreciate the talentless guitar and bass riffs. with the exceptions of the horns being excellent, everything else about this cd is terrible (including the singer's voice). i refused to purchace it after listening to it once, and they are probably in my top 5 of fave bands. go out and get any of their other albums (preferably keasbey nights) but lets just sweep this one under the carpet and pretend it never existed. good for 14 y/o's but it won't cut it for me (or any other real fan of this band). not to sound elitest, but other reviewers put it best whent hey said \\"this is no keasby nights\\" cause indeed it isn't, none of the talent i know these boys have is expressed int his cd, and no real effort was put into it either. anyone who says \\"it's good in it's own way\\" is only supportive because they love the band so much or are just discovering the band now."},{"rating":"1","title":"emo-pop garbage","review":"UGH, This CD is a total waste of money. I actually thought alone in a crowd was pretty good but this CD is horrible! It's more of the emo, pop trash you love in catch 22 right? WRONG Maybe old Catch 22 has some emo songs(Kristina) but this is awful. I bought it, couldn't sell it, and ended up trashing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i had to take a shower after listening to this","review":"i heard 2 of these songs from mp3.com and i have to say if the rest of the albums is like this then if you ever liked catch 22 you should never get this. It would be a good album if it were anyone but catch 22, but with their new new singer, who doesnt have the signiture raspy voice of their past, it just sounds wrong (he sounds like tony from mest kinda). Its a combination of metal and ska and its just not working out.when i heard the songs it made me cringe...if you fell in love with keasby nights and dug alone in a crowd..youll get what im saying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely dynamic and upbeat, what did you expect?!","review":"This album is so cool I wanted to smack my mom on the ... and tell her thanks for making sure I could be here to hear it. Like the other reviewers say, it's not Keasbey Nights or Alone in a Crowd, but since those two already sound very much alike it creates a nice change of pace. For the narcotic addicts out there who like all their music playing 1000mph with unintelligible lyrics, this is not for you. Not to say there aren't a few fast songs though. The lyrics could be a bit more insightful, but overall Dinosaur Sounds is definitely an impressive display of musicianship. As a fan of Spring Heeled Jack [1st album ONLY], Jeffries Fan club [all albums], Reel Big Fish [all albums, including Cheer Up!], Less Than Jake [all albums, plus Anthem limited edition], Hippos [all 3 albums, yes THREE!] fan... this is right up my alley. Good job guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW>>..","review":"All I can say is what a dissappiontment these follow up albums are since Tom Kalnoky and others left the band. Seriously, the band shouldn't be called Catch 22 anymore because they just live off the fame of the original members and Keasbey nights. Its sad to see how people think Catch 22 is the same band as it was. Buy the Streetlight Manifesto album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Just picked it up last night. The horn parts are really great, too bad there is not as much of them on this CD. A lot more punk rock on this CD, but it is still great. The songs really get great right after the secret track, which jumps right into So Cold, which is great, Lamont's Lament remains my favorite. Dinosaur Sounds could have been better, but Catch 22 proves that Ska is not dead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but still really good","review":"The old Catch 22 of the Keasby Night age is gone with the songwriter of this era. Now this is a new Catch 22 more poppy, but still ska and sill good. The horns are ok, like everything on this cd but this band could have done better.

She is motivating, encouraging, well cued, without being annoying, irritating, and too perky. This is a 30 minute total body toning workout. There is no need for an exercise bench or chair. A set of cheap dumbbells would do. I am limited on workout space but this workout seems to fit my needs perfectly. The scenery and background is a lovely beach in Mexico. I find this workout not to hard but challenging enough for me to feel I've got a workout. I would definitely buy her other workout dvd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I really love this one. It's challenging but fun and it works for sure.

Summer is around the corner you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapponting!","review":"I have been reading Self magazine for years and have diligently cut out the different exercises that they had published. I thought that the DVD will be as equally challenging but it's a workout for BEGINNERS. It is a short circuit training workout. There are three exercises that work out the upper and the lower body and you do two sets of each. There are better workouts one could get for $20. For a true 30 min circuit challenge try David Kirsch's Boot camp or you a better off buying a proper strength training workout.I was so disappointed with the workout that I am not even going to consider buying any of the other DVD workouts from Self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out for the upper body","review":"I won't go through all the parts in the DVD as others have already done that. I will say though I really enjoyed this workout and like another reviewer started out with heavier weights and had to change down to lower weights. Quite different pilates inspired moves which I found refreshing as I do get bored easy and like to mix things up. I also liked Ellen as an instructor, motivating without being cheesy and although the other girls smiled a lot I didn't find it aggravating. My only negative would be that there didn't seem to be enough intensity in the leg work, but that may just be me as I use DVD's to cross train from my running and I do have quite strong legs.

One day she slips and falls in the street and a young man rushes out of his basement flat and helps her. He is as lonely in his own way as she is, and the two form a strange but lovely friendship. The young man is perfectly played by the very romantic looking Rupert Friend.The story is simple and well told. I found the scene where the fellow sings \\"For All We Know\\" to the woman quite beautiful. Plowright's tears will bring tears to the viewer, I guarantee. Personally I got a little tired of Plowright's character's saintliness and I found the ending quite syrupy/sentimental.

Who can predict what people will have that magic something which translates into deep friendship. In these days, we see alot about love, true love, romantic love, and let's not forget the \\"the opposite of love\\"... this movie is different in that it portrays friendship love... a deep, precious and comfortable love that transcends age.

There are many situations where I thought the action was going to get interesting but did not.

Which is unfortunately hard to come by in today's fast-moving society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thievery Style!","review":"I've been a big Thievery Corp. fan ever since their mix on the DJ Kicks series. Although I was excited about the new DVD, I understood that it would be difficult to capture the whole Thievery vibe in a concert DVD.Fortunately, I was wrong.The music is tight. The visuals are just right. And nothing is lost from the Thievery vibe. It is much better than I expected. Put simply, it's one of the best concert DVDs I've seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live at 9:30 Club - Fabulous","review":"The only disappointment I had with this product is that it did not contain a CD with the DVD so I could put it on my MP3 player and listen at work without the video.

It is completely incompatible with Windows Media Center, which is why I upgraded to Vista in the first place. The \\"updated\\" files on the website won't detect the card either, and the drivers aren't even listed on the drivers page. I did get the drivers to install once when I told Windows to search for them on the CD, but the software still says it doesn't detect any hardware.

It was completely wrong for the culture of the time, however, in ways that caused me to lose \\"suspended disbelief\\".

Not only is the price inflated but the outsized packaging practically insures this CD won't be accommodated by most filing systems. Probably just as well, since the album warrants frequent playings. Gene Harris & associates are so light and tight in the groove that the recording might easily be considered the one to own if price and space dictate only one by the group. The microscopic print might as well be in Japanese, but at least the piano sonorities are immediately identifiable as Rudy Van Gelder's work. And the digital transcription is first rate. A bonus: the CD contains two additional tracks (11 minutes of music), which are not listed on the back cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie that takes you back .","review":"I can't believe it's been 20 years since it's release.

One star is probably not too many for a movie that isn't really a \\"movie\\" in the sense of having a coherent plot, credible dialogue, minimal acting skills, etc. \\"Roller Boogie\\" would have made a perfect Charlie's Angels episode -- in fact, it did, when Jaclyn, Farrah and Kate (or their stunt doubles) donned their four-wheel, suede-booted skates and chased the bad guys down Venice Beach.But the Angels were the Angels; everything they did was in the greater service of looking good, acting very little, and trying not to laugh their way through ridiculous plots. \\"Roller Boogie\\", on the other hand, offers us Queen of the B's Linda Blair surrounded by a bevy of nonactors, a raft of horrendous disco songs (this stuff makes the Bee Gees sound like great art), and endless choreographed disco-on-skates numbers.

From the opening roller disco scene where they \\"boogie\\" on their skates all over LA, to the bad flute playing. This movie is a real hoot. Although Linda Blair is very cute, she is a bit on the chunky side for mainstream movies. Her love interest, is just a bit \\"fey\\" and petite if you ask me. By the ending sequence, during the big roller disco contest, you can just about see the guy wires enabling him to toss her around and over as if she is light as a feather.

If you like Nostolga and Camp this is the real deal and it is all good. I would say this is one of those movies that has a great Cult factor and is right up there with 80's films like Skatetown USA also in 1979, Breakin, Breakin 2 \\"Electric Boogaloo\\", Beat Street.

After I got the 1st season I went ahead and bought the 2nd it is also very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An improvement upon the original","review":"Where the original NCIS was a welcome respite from the utterly idiotic inaccuracies of JAG, this too is a welcome respite from the original's flaws such as Gibbs' perpetual crankiness, Tony's overgrown fratboy routine, and Ziva's perpetual inability to get an idiomatic expression correct. Now the focus shifts from forensics procedural to buddy-cop action with NCIS's LA-based Office of Special Projects black-bag unit, who are far more upbeat and quirkier. The action largely follows deep-cover agent G. Callen, who doesn't even know what his own first name is, and ex-Navy SEAL Sam Hanna, with occasional help from resident cool chick Kensi Bly. Even their boss Hetty is a lively individual with her own idiosyncrasies. It's a welcome return to fun cop shows after about a decade of dragged-out police procedural."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst tv shows","review":"NCIS is one of the worst TV shows I have seen. It is incredible fool. LL Cool J is not an actor. He looks so stupid playing the tough guy... As Hety, Linda Hunt looks awful. Her small size and her \\"brilliant mind\\" are not a good combo.

I had a hard time hearing a consistent genuine connection between the artist and his lyrics. Have known this guy for a long time, and believe in his talent, but believe his very early cassette releases showed a more sincere, less fussy artist of true quality. A couple of the songs on this disc appeared in different versions on those early cassettes; get your hands on a copy if you can and take a listen to \\"Fall on Me\\" as it was originally recorded--stark, heartfelt, compelling.

The text is a bit dry, but it would be very useful in the context of a high school classroom or library."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit hard to follow at the beginning...","review":"but well-done at its core: I think the side-by-side comparison of the Protocols and the work it was plagiarized from is by far the most compelling part of the book. However, I did have some trouble keeping the characters straight at the start of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lies, D**m Lies, and Propaganda","review":"If you loved Maus and works like that, you will be blown away by Eisner's final work. In it, he meticulously follows the path of the Protocols of Zion and goes about debunking them at every turn.More importantly, he's able to shine a light into why they continue to hold such a strong power over people even after 100+ years.Eisner's work is as clear as ever, making this an excellent \\"gateway\\" book to people who are not used to graphic novels. The extensive use of an index and bibliography show us how much research went into it and the introduction by Umberto Eco will draw in many people who haven't touched a \\"comic book\\" since they were teens.I think after reading this work, they might change their minds some. I just wish Eisner had survived to see how well this was received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, for something totally new","review":"And the Spirit doesn't strike again! That Will Eisner is a master of the ilustrated narrative everyone knew, but that he was a master of political causes, well, I didn't know. One had glimpses of it, from his string of Graphic Novels, dealing with racial tensions, housing issues, and other questions, but they all seemed to have something to do with the story, it was never the \\"issue\\" for the issue. Now, with the history of the infamous libel, the protocols of the elders of zion, this can be almost considered a school book: it's didactic, it has a clear theme presentation methodology, it clearifies the reaserch method... A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This graphic book about the history of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is excellent from two different perspectives. First, the artistry and overall production values are outstanding. Of course, everyone knows that Mr. Eisner was a genius. Secondly, the information about the history of the protocols is fascinating. One review I read stated that the world didn't need another book of this nature, that the fact that the protocols are spurious is well documented. I guess I knew that, but I did not know the actual history before. I found it absolutely amazing, both in the motivation of the original forgers, along with the fact that the document apparently continues to surface. So this book can be another voice crying out in the wilderness, so to speak, revealing the facts of the matter. I enjoyed this very much and highly recommend it both to history buffs and fans of Mr. Eisner's graphic work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Misleading","review":"I don't know if the Protocols were made up (Plagerized) or not.....and it doesn't really make alot difference. All one has to do read the document for themself and and reflect on recent historyie., the past 100 years. Also read the (online) book Waters Flowing Eastward [esp part II sec 1]. If all this stuff was made I must say the author had a heckova furtile imagination.The problem I have with this book is the title is misleading. It sound like it is supporting the\\"protocols\\" but is really attempting to debunk them and in my opinion it didn't do a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to be on a school curriculum","review":"Eisner was a master at creating atmospheric and dramatic scenes. His representation of emotions in his characters is superb. At this stage in history the protocols are completely discredited. The great service this book does is to chart their creation and more importantly their impact on political attitudes. The book is well illustrated with ink and ink wash drawings, all very atmoshperic and indeed menacing. A morbid paranoia of Jews percolates through the tale. The fabrication of the protocols is a terrible story in itself, and Eisner has dramatically chronicled this in lavish terms. The book does its best to draw out (pardon the pun) the malevolence behind the fabrication, and does so in terms intelligble to almost anyone. That for me is the real brilliance of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it...NOW!!!","review":"This album is music at its best. David Torrens shows off in his debut; the music varies from song to song thus you'll never grow tired of the CD. From Jazz to Pop to Rock flared by the famous Cuban flavor. The lyrics are also very diverse, having songs that talk about love,sex,lust,politics,with comical interludes. Unfortunately Torrens has not gotten the exposure he deserves, but that should not discourage anyone from buying this album.A must for musical enthusiasts looking for something fresh and new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Impressed...","review":"This was just the kind of book I needed, but as it turned out, this particular one did not impress.

When I got back home in to North Carolina, I started searching for Shannon Noll (I of course thought his last name was spelled Knoll making him a little harder to find). I finally found him on the web and found he was in Australia which is why I hadn't heard of him before. Even more interesting is he started his career by being the winner on a television show in Australia called Australian Idol (winner of the first season) which is Simon Fuller's Australian version of his American Idol show. So, I guess he is to Australia and New Zealand as Kelly Clarkson is to us here in the US. I am convinced that if you buy his album, Lift will become YOUR favorite song too.

The topics covered include birthdays, back to school, holidays, pets, family nights, and many more. Just a wonderful, wonderful resource for all kinds of families.My only very minor complaint is that there were A LOT of religious traditions. I would have liked to see some more secular traditions. But even still, many of the religious rituals could be modified for the secular family.

Following the suggestions in this book and the recipes, it wouldn't be all that hard to hit 80-100++ grams of carb per day... which is simply TOO HIGH for many people who are following low carb lifestyles.Many recipes call for sugar, white flour, semi-sweet chocolate and cornstarch. Come ON... those are NOT \\"low carb\\" ingredients.This is more or less a repackaged low fat/lower cal cookbook with \\"low carb\\" thrown on the cover to try to generate some market share.

I think their efforts have improved with each subsequent album, creatively and artistically. I think, also, that this live record plays more like a greatest hits album than anything, but nearly everything they ever recorded together was top notch.

It is very handy, so far read the first 3 chapters. Gives very good and easy to read details on definition of leadership, ways of looking at leadership. Leadership as traits, leadership as skills, leadership as an interactive process, and more. Gives good comparison between leadership and management, covers commonalities. Has good concise case studies (with no answers - got to work with a mentor or instructor on that), some self-assessment tools, like leadership trait questionaire. Overall all it is a very good reference on the topic and also provides plenty of practical examples, case studies and tools to use right away, book is easy to read and follow, paper is not glossy hence very easy to read and does not reflect light, text is black / blue, well organized. Good buy for the buck !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leadership poor examples","review":"When a leader has to contrive situations to get their staff to follow them, they are not very good leaders.

If you liked progression through unlearning (or designs for that matter), save yourself the time, effort and money and just slam your face into a wall until blood comes out. I'm all for bands going in new directions, but I feel about as tricked as expecting Cave In's \\"Jupiter\\" to be anything other than the meadow-prancing, unicorn hug-fest that it was. The beat, drive and energy of Snapcase's past albums just aint in this one and they seem to be getting a little too artsy. The upside is, I like being angry and energetic when I listen to music, and all the crappy techno definitely leaves me enervated. Out of deference to their past efforts, I listened to the whole thing--and then threw the f*cker out my car window.

The first track has about 1.5 seconds of another track appended at the end. The track fades at the end of the first piece then a quick burst of music abruptly truncated, then the next track. In addition there are seven other tracks that have been truncated on this CD. Everything going along fine then, Bam! The music cuts out in mid-note and the next track starts.The abrupt stops and extra bits in the playback are very distracting. You can be listening to this as background music and your ear will immediately detect the glitches. This makes the album virtually worthless. Buy something else.

So, I went to the store and bought a hard copy. Yes!! I love this band enough to buy their new album twice in the same day. But to my surprise the production quality was the same! Song structure is not on par with their previous albums either. The vocals are way to far in the back and you hear constant buzzing. I'm not saying this album is horrible I think these guys couldn't write horrible if they wanted to. However, the album was not what I have come to appreciate about this band. I have always loved their use of metaphors and story telling, the attempt at aggression on this album seems immature. Of course I'll still buy their next album anyway (THERE G.D. BAD RELIGON)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"What a disappointment this record! I am a HUGE Bad Religion fan, and was stoked to pick up the new release. Was very disappointed in this record. First off, each track doesn't come off as individual. Every track seems to blend into the next with no discernable differences amongst them. I do like how they've gone to a more \\"Minor\\" tone to each track, but overall they all sound basically the same.The biggest complaint I have with this record is with the mixing. Greg's vocals get swallowed up by the production. Too many times the guitars and harmony vocals completely drown out the lead vocal. So much to the point where things tend to sound \\"muddy\\". I much prefer to hear Greg's vocals distinctly above the rest of the production. Not sure what they did differently this time, but there are WAY too many times when Greg's vocals are indistinguishable.Whoever did the sound editing on this one should be shot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah blah..

I own all the albums (even Into the Unknown which was it's own whole fiasco) and this one sounds like dirty dish water compared to all but the New America album. I'm not sure if these guys are done or if this is just that bad album every epic band puts out once a decade. I sincerely hope this album is just a mistake, because they're just that good....Don't buy this album. Pick up \\"Recipe for Hate\\" or \\"Suffer\\" and enjoy some classic punk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Bad Religion Album...","review":"While not quite as inspired or adventurous as their last two albums The Process of Belief and The Empire Strikes First, New Maps of Hell is yet another worthy addition to the Bad Religion catalog. The sound is classic Bad Religion and is even reminiscient of some of their earlier harder edged albums like Against The Grain. Bad Religion fans will not be disappointed with this album. Songs like New Dark Ages and Honest Goodbye fit right in with the best that Bad Religion has ever released. The only complaint that I have is with the mix. It must be on purpose, but it just seems like this album was mixed much more dirty than any of their other recent releases. The vocals tend to get lost a bit. It's mostly a minor complaint. The album is still very good by any standards. It is great to see that after 27 years and 14 full length albums that Bad Religion still has something to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Love These","review":"I was surprised at how small these books are and how thin the pages are.

While the 3D graphics look horrendous, it's interesting to see how it worked back in the 16-bit era. In some ways I like the level designs better than Starfox 64's because they feel more creative and more interesting. For example, one part of the game is like a space version of the ocean with whales, stingrays, and more sea creatures in this interesting environment. I like how the villain Andross is designed as well, in fact it's kinda creepy(And he's a fighter in the upcoming Super Smash Brothers Brawl). The missions are still exciting and wierd to this day and it is a very rewarding experience. Though time has done some damage to this game it doesn't feel very worn. Oh, and by the way, Slippy is still an incompetent pilot as he was in Starfox 64, and Falco is still an ungrateful d*** as he was in Starfox 64."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Second Childhood","review":"Ever find yourself in the middle of doing something really dumb?The protagonist, in a small town with lots of social layers, does exactly that - in a big way.

It's small so doesn't hog desk space, easy to set up and use, has plenty of features (more than I'll ever need or use) and though the print quality isn't the best you'll ever see, it is easily legible and certainly satisfactory, for both faxing and copying.

The effects work is weak, as is the charmless script. The only saving graces are some nice production design, especially the Nautilus' interior, and another spirited performance by Michael Caine, who is always a class act. However, despite Caine's performance, this rates a poor second to the Ben Cross version, also available through Amazon. That isn't great either, but at least isn't so retina-scorchingly long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny!

The squid scene is VERY weak, even the 1950's version has a significantly better and more fun squid scene. Michael Caine does well as a tough talking Capt.

Motion City isn't a bad group but the climate has changed. This is not 2005 when Motion City along FOB and HelloGoodbye were fresh. An overused sound has destroyed Motion City and all of its clones.

You will remember Vincent Irizarry (the handsome Derek in this film) as \\"Lujack\\" on Guiding Light in the early 1980's. Cassidy Rae found fame on the short lived 90's drama, Model's Inc. This is a true story about a high school senior who gets mixed up with a much older, and married, man. He buys her expensive gifts, and takes her out to dinner and art exhibits. While Amy (Cassidy Rae) thinks she's met her dream man, someone is making her life a living hell. Someone trashes her locker at school, mails a bra to her house with a letter attached, and while driving home someone tries to run her off the road. Who is the mystery person? Let's just say it's not who you think. My daughter & I love to watch this movie. I would tell anyone who's interested to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifetime Movie","review":"I love this movie.

Having great respect for the work of Agros and World Vision it seemed logical to read a copy and gain a deeper appreciation of their work. Sadly I am disappointed in what I found, not because of any disagreement with its content or motives of the author, but that it is far to intellectual to be understood by laymen (such as myself and co-workers). If one can't understand what the writer is saying, of what use is the book?Surely World Vision must have someone on their staff who can assemble this information in a book that can be readily comprehended by lay people. Currently World Vision president, Richard Stearns, has an excellent book in print, The Hole in Our Gospel, which is not only inspiring, but easy to read. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thorough and challening walk with the poor","review":"Bryant's book is a very comphensive introduction to holistic Christian development.

They have a tight harmony and flow with each song and they add their own thing to each individual song. But without taking anything away from the original song and that takes some talent to be able to pull off \\"I Want You Back\\" or even \\"Stop! In The Name of Love\\". Being those were huge hits for the Jackson 5 and the Supremes respectively.I give it 4 stars for it being a cover album...but one that is done with the utmost class and respect.

I dont care how old he is, he is a little spueaky boy. i saw his little performance on the Disney Christmas parade and it was terrible. to put it into a few words THE BOY CANT SINg and he should not be jumping around with women 3 times his age. the only reason why he has money is because little girls get sucked in by his nonsense music and bleachblonde hair. im sorry if ive hurt anybodys feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO GREAT","review":"HI I have been a fan of Aaron Carter for about 3 years now.

His song Aaron's Party Come Get it was alright it is fun to listin' to and all but it just wasn't the greatest. Then i listened to Jump Jump ! That song is so Great! His voice has changed a lot and hes a wonderful singer!!! Not saying he wasn't before but it is a very big improvement from his first self titled CD in which he sounded like a talented singing squeeky mouse. Well just letting you know this single is so great.

It's quite good yes, but no where close to better. FY and Alice 19th are by the same author and both love stories, but FY is more. Alice 19th is a bit confusing at first but you have to just go with the flow and say \\"what the heck\\". The art work is cute though. Yu Watase as a special talent in making the characters really likable and realistic. That goes for Alice most of the time, but she can get a bit annoying with how many times she says \\"sis!\\". Ahhh makes me wanna slap her. Heh, but that's just another example of how real the characters are. I recommend this book for people who like romance and can handle not knowing what the in the heck is going on, it's a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improvement","review":"I have had experience with Yuu Watase from watching the Fushigi Yugi anime series. I loved it, naturally, but found the relationship between Miaka and Tamahome unrealistic, forced, and dull. Too much \\"Miaka!!\\" \\"Tamahome!!\\" stuff.I was somewhat skeptical buying this, but I made an excellent choice. Alice, the main character, is actually likeable (unlike Miaka) and Kyo has a real personality, also. This was a welcome change from M + T.

UNDERRATED CABLE!","review":"Heated up to dangerous temperatures in just moments after plugging it into my TV. This wire is underrated, it is listed as 18AWG but it is not. The wire says 0.75mm^2 which is around 19AWG, while that doesn't sounds like a lot, that's a difference of about 3 amps (or 350 Watt) power handling difference, but my TV is new plasma model that doesn't draw anywhere near the limits of even 19AWG, so it wouldn't shock me if it was aluminum wire to boot. I would cut it open to find out what is really inside, but then I couldn't get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"short lived","review":"Well I bought this cord so that I'd have a power cord long enough to reach from my surge protector to my TV, since my original cable was too short to reach after mounting my TV to the wall.

I purchased this item so my newly mounted TV could reach the outlet. As soon as I plugged it in, it began to smoke and got very hot. Thankfully, I was able to unplug it before it caught fire or destroyed my TV.

Although some of the dialogue was corny, I liked the characters. I liked Bailey very much, she seemed the most real of the three women. She was loving, tender, and sometimes fragile, but she still got mad like real women do! Cade was wonderful the way he took care of her, although it wasn't very smart of her to stay at his house when she didn't know him.

The plot line basically consisted of boy likes girl, girl obsessed with boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy back. That was it, there wasn't anything else to it, there was no complex plot, or character development. It was just a rich girl who fell for a guy whose life was skating and had a revelation not to listen to mommy and daddy ('rents) anymore and date him. It was utterly boring. Even though simple books can be refreshing sometimes, this book was overly simple. At the end, it left you with a sick feeling of I just wasted a couple hours of my precious time for that!

It quotes studies that show that the views and backgrounds of those who choose to become reporters are well to the left of the country at large. It then provides an exhaustive list of quotes from well-known media figures that trash conservatives and Republicans and praise liberals and Democrats.The book was published in 1990, so some of its subject matter (Ronald Reagan, the Cold War) is dated, but other areas (economic issues, campaigns and elections) are still topical. Regardless of the topic, though, most members of the mainstream press have not changed their stripes, so the book is still as relevant today as it was almost twenty years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary, Out-of-Date, and more than a little Prejudicial...","review":"Saying you're impartial and actually acting (and writing) impartially are two different things, and the latter is much more difficult -- and noble -- than the former. Unfortunately, this out-of-date tome promises to be a balanced look at the liberal media bias, and then proceeds to take potshots at anybody who has ever voted for a Democrat, and excuse or celebrate anybody who has ever voted for a Republican. I suppose a tribe of apolitical reporters who have given up their power to vote would be preferable to the author, or better yet, inhuman proxies who'd just pull the Republican right-wing lever each and every time. The writing is dry and boring, and there is plenty of old-fashioned euphemistic code, giving one the distinct feeling that Mr. Bozell won't be caught having a conversation over lunch with a gay Jewish Democrat anytime soon. It left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel.","review":"Great good fun. I enjoyed The Thin Pink Line and was looking forward to continuing the story--I was not disappointed. Once again Baratz-Logsted provides entertainment on every page.

Jane grows and learns as the year passes--with the help of her new baby--and as she does she becomes aware of problems that had been completely outside her selfish orbit.Highly recommended to anyone who likes to laugh yet wants the humor to be within the lines of a well-written book that does not ignore serious issues.I'm looking forward to the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it out.

The sound is not creative or original in the mode of a future Fatboy Slim or William Orbit, but it is very danceable and reasonably varied.Pochette Surprise begs party guests to break out 'n' boogie, charms listeners with the ramblings of a French kid, and raises eyebrows among child-welfare advocates."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sufficiently focused on USA car culture","review":"I was expecting this to be a collection of articles about the American experience of the automobile: how the industry grew, specific cars that made an impact on the culture, specific people who contributed to the advancement of technology, and well written articles by people who grew up loving cars. Unfortunately, almost none of the articles fit the bill. Many articles deal with South American and European drivers, cars, and history. There are few articles that deal with American car culture. I ended up not reading most of the articles till the end (they were all less than 20 pages long) simply because I had lost interest. The best things about this book are the title and the preface, both written by the editor, who should have written the entire book herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good blinds for the price!","review":"These blinds are excellent if you want simple and cheap. I put this on my back door which is in my kitchen, so no one would be able to look into the house at night or during the day. The blinds are plastic and white so it will not make the room very dark during the day (the black colored ones might), but their purpose was to prevent someone from snooping in my house. The blinds came with everything I would need for mounting and if you follow the useful directions, you will not go wrong. These get the job done if you want to prevent people from looking at your valuables and dont care about having plastic blinds. Excellent product and the item was shipped from the company the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"You DON'T get what you pay for.","review":"When I installed the new blind I left very positive feedback. That was a mistake. The blind is lightweight, very white, and very fine in every appearance. But.... after one month of very minimal use, raised and lowered maybe 10 times, the threads in one vertical column busted and now the blind does not work at all. It cost three or four times more than one I could get at a local department store, plus shipping. I definitely do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blinds Purchased","review":"I bought this set of blinds because it was a hard to find size. This was the only place that carried the blinds. They fit just as expected. The only issue I found, which really wasn't an issue to me was the white color had the slightest tint of a blue to them. So if you are getting blinds for an area make sure to get the blinds for the windows that are next to one another. I think the middle set of blinds that were store bought have the slightest difference in color. This was as to be expected and I am extremely happy with my purchase considering every store I was to didn't have the odd size of what my window was.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"mini blind junk","review":"Mini blinds came out of the box with a broken top blind and they hung crooked when mounted.

Two of the blinds snapped at the top while letting the blinds go down for the night. I had to re-order both of them. The second replacement has a wand that is very hard to turn to allow light in or out. Therefore, I must unfortunately have to say that these blinds were made very cheaply, and you must be very gentle with them or they will break, and you may get a blind that is totally defective. I have to recommend to everyone that you should pay a little more for a better product. Venetian blinds should not break even when you are gentle with them. I can't recommend this product. Look for something else. Two blinds breaking and one wand hard to turn is quite un-acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for a stationary blind.","review":"Purchased in 2011. Thin.

It would teach you alot about buying horses and what to look for in buying the right horse for yourself. In this book, Carole, Stevie, and Lisa have to find a home for Veronica DiAngelo's old horse, Garnet, when Veronica gets a new expensive Thoroughbred. Although, I should point out one thing, it said in the book the Danny, Veronica's new Thoroughbred states that his bloodlines trace back to Secretariat, and they say state in the book that Secretariat is a son of Man O' War. That is an incorrect fact. Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler and Man O' War was long dead before Secretariat even came into the racing world. Other than that it was a good bok with alot of facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book falls _way_ short of its promises.","review":"Although the initial discussion of spinoffs was ok, the 90 or so \\"case histories\\" are useless. Each one is about a paragraph in length, and merely describes the terms of the spinoff, with _no_ commentary whatsoever. The book will give you an idea of which types of spinoffs are worth further investigation, but it does not teach you how to analyze these situations further. However, there is a shameless advertisement for the author's spinoff newsletter at the end of the book.

The book is based on present day with Alan Scott attempting to solve a murder committed in the 60's.Guy gives Scott such intelligence and personality, you really don't think you are reading fiction. The entire book is so realistic, Guy is a master at details. All of the characters in the book come to life as you read about them.

The Bible is smyth-sewn, and has quality French paper.Unfortunately, all the Bible has is text and concordance with coloured maps in the back, and wide margins. No helps whatsoever.I would even hesitate before I marked up the Bible, that's how beautiful it is. However, if all you want is a pretty cover, buy it. Otherwise, forget it.

Not that they sound the same, but they both make me wonder if bands actually listen to their music before they release an album.Ok, Stereomud isn't as bad as Hed P.E. At least Stereomud's singer sings and doesn't rap, and that's something you hardly see (hear) these days. As for the songs themselves, they don't really stand out from anything already released. The best song is Anything but Jesus, the first single. I think it's sad when an album's best song is the first single because it seems the album is filled with.. well.. fillers..Even if you like some of these songs, there's no reason really to pick up Every Given Moment (good title and cover by the way). There is so much better out there, you just need to look a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only Columbia Records Gave Them Respect...","review":"You know, this band could really kick off if their record company, Columbia, would dish out the cash for them to be a huge star. I've seen them live 2 times, and have even met the lead vocalist Erik at a show here in Wisconsin. Awesome band, I loved their first CD, Perfect Self, and this CD did not dissapoint me one bit. They released \\"Breathing\\" as a single, and I think that there are plenty of other songs on the album that are much better. Songs like \\"Show Me\\", \\"Anything But Jesus\\", \\"Control Freak\\", and \\"Searching\\" are all kick ass and should be recognized by the listeners. This band has to be the best of the unknown rock bands out there on the scene today without a doubt.

This shocking tale is gruesome without being vulgar; gripping without being sentimental. The distorted thinking and values that allowed slavery to continue were intelligently portrayed. It is interesting how people, when they violate their own sensibilities and basic moral principals, become defensive, fearful, and violent. Such is this study of the slave holder as well as the enslaved. Mr. Northrup, from an emancipated family fell into the traps of kidnapping and enslavement. His education and connections allowed him to finally regain the life he had lost. As the story is recalled, the narrative reflected intelligence and sophistication, even if the prose was antiquated. Its style and relevance, however, make a great vocabulary builder and, in my opinion, should be required reading of every student in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"I was not expecting it to be this good.

It is a story that will break your heart as Solomon was torn away from his family for over a decade. According to a quote from 1853, when Solomon first published his memoirs, \\"Think of it: For thirty years a man, with all a man's hopes, fears and aspirations--with a wife and children to call him by the endearing names of husband and father--with a home, humble it may be, but still a home...then for twelve years a thing, a chattel personal, classed with mules and horses. ...Oh! it is horrible. It chills the blood to think that such are.\\" And indeed, this story will both chill--and boil--your blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wll worth your time and money!","review":"This book presents one of the most comprehensive and intersting descriptions on the history and development of chemical and biological weapons I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It is well researched and the source material is identified for further study. The author has a knack for presenting a wealth of information in a most useful format and interesting manner. Even more than the description and history of the weapons is the insight into human nature and the conduct of war. No one who reads this book will doubt the imagination and ingenuity of ancient warriors, nor have any illusions as to the prospects of such weapons in the hands of contemporary armies and governments, not to mention terrorists. I began reading the book as a text to increase my knowledge of the subject but finished with a deeper insight and appreciation for the historical precedents. For anyone interested in this subject, it is well worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greek Fire, Poison Arrows & Scorpion Bombs: Biological and C","review":"This book had such good potential to inform the mass readership. Instead it ended up being what it always was an academic tome that a few people would be interested in. Instead of really discussing any one subject, Ms. Mayor jumped around the entire universe of weapons of mass destruction. In the end, all she said was that weapons of mass destruction have been around since antiquity. It would have been better for Ms. Mayor to devote a chapter on the methods by which the Mongols changed the course of history with their introduction of the plague in warfare, or a chapter on the impact Greek fire on the ancient world. She merely devoted a few paragraphs to such truly interesting things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chock full of facts, but wild with conclusions","review":"No where else have I seen such accounts of ancient warfare. Her descriptions are entertaining and the facts interesting. In the hands of a good writer this subject matter would be wonderful, but alas, the book is poorly written. The author defines chemical and biological warfare so unlike our contemporary concepts that it is difficult overcome while reading. Many of her conclusions and comparisons to modern day warfare are dubious and at times I wondered if the book were a bit tainted with religious bigotry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greek Fire a definative work","review":"Adrienne Mayor's book is the definitive work concerning ancient chemical and biological warfare. No library or knowledge of ancient warfare is complete without it. The book is topical in our current age as well as possessing a fascination all its own.

I was pleasantly surprised - it is concise, informative, well organized and fun. I have the Jan 2005 edition which covers everything until the Iraq war in 2003, apparently a big difference from the 1997 edition. Regardless of whether you're 15 or 50 give this book a try.

It makes my helmet fitting a bit snug and I feel it helps keep it dry in very intense heat. I am very happy with my purchase so far but will see after couple of washes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic? More Like A Curse!","review":"I have read several other of the author's books and enjoyed them. To say this book was disappointing is putting it mildly. The hero repeatedly rapes his wife...these scenes are very distressing to read. Even when he decides to treat his wife with 'kindness' in bed, he still continually humiliates her -privately and in public. His cruelness is boundless. There is an unsatisfying mystery thrown in half-way through the book. Try another of Ms. Coulter's books and bypass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape is not romantic- don't waste your money","review":"I went into this novel with high expectations. The heroine is feisty and the hero seemed at least somewhat sympathetic, if a bit chauvanistic. But then the characters get married, and it's all downhill from there. Sexual assault is never sexy and like another reviewer said, it has no place in a romance novel... The only thing that could have saved this book would have been if the heroine found some other guy to love and left, but of course, she falls in love with the...loser. Don't waste your money on this book- I'm still bitter that I wasted mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one ladies!","review":"I had to give this book one reluctant star because it actually started well. I had already read Calypso Magic and really enjoyed that story. However, the first in the series turned out to be a waste of time. The characters have no depth, Hawk is just another dense, chauvinistic male, and the storyline drops off abruptly after the marriage. I have not read Moonspun Magic, and am now quite hesitant about picking up the last of the trilogy. And one question-must every one of Coulter's Regency books have a rape scene? Violence against women is repulsive and has no place in a romance novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How is rape romantic?","review":"This was my first Catherine Coulter book. I bought her book because she is listed as a best-selling romantic novelist, but it seems to me that she's a bit warped. How is rape romantic? And why are people so obsessed with her books?

It would have been even better if the rape had been left out of it. It does give people an insight of what life must have be like for women to have to live with a man they had no feelings for. Frances is a brillant character and i would like to have some of her characteristics it would make life very interesting. Hawk on the other hand should have shown more respect for the woman he took as a wife. She may not have then been so hard on him serves him right. It is a story of how love conquers all and how people are not always what they seem. I recommended that if people read this book then they should also read the next book in the Trilogy Calypso Magic which introduces the characters of Lyon and Diana who learn to love each other as did Hawk and Frances. Lyon and Hawk were best friends in the book Midsummer Magic and in Calypso Magic the friendship continues. Hope you like the books as much as i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"When reviewing my past orders.","review":"When reviewing my past orders I find that I did not receive this order.Midsummer Magic (Magic Trilogy)Moonspun Magic (Magic Trilogy)Calypso Magic (Magic Trilogy).

I enjoyed reading this one because Frances was a great character. I'm not too sure about Hawk though, it seems I din't get to know him as a character that well. He could have been a little better.

I always love reading Coulter and even though this one wasn't one of her best I really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This A Romance???!!!","review":"If the rating system would have allowed it, I would have given this book zero stars.

Anthology is nice, but the best experience was its original release. In my opinion and many others, this is the best in the ongoing FF series. The story line could bring tears to your eyes it was so damn good. It felt like you were actually in it. The battle system was so each character had his or her own unique abilities. Take Edgar for example. He had his powerful tools. Or Sabin. He had all his awesome blitz techniques. Magic was great also. It came in the form of Espers. You could equip anyone with any esper and have them learn all the magic abilities from it. This allowed each character to have every single magic in the game. Can you say ULTIMA baby??? The game's graphics were a nice step up from FF 2. The music in this game was and probably is still the best to grace any RPG or any game for that matter.

As a mother of 4 myself, my husband and I have taken a different road and still maintain a Godly marriage. I know many many others who have done the same.

I enjoy this genre. I've read quite a few books recently that fall into that category. Quite a few good books. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I found I could not empathize with any of the characters; they seemed too stereotypical and self-serving. As far as plot goes, it was, at best, cute. It was adequately written, but I didn't find myself laughing or even cracking a smile while reading. There are no memorable lines; no amusing lines. It was a [very] mindless, light read. If you want to read a good book in this particular genre, there are plenty of other alternatives. For example: \\"It Had To Be You,\\" \\"The Best Man,\\" \\"Fool's Errand,\\" or \\"California Screaming.\\" This book probably doesn't even belong in this category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Buy Me Love or a great book","review":"An easy read, but also not a very good one.

The cover caught my eye & although this is a different genre for me, I bought it & it quickly became one of my favorite books. Jack, the lead character, certainly charges through life by the hour getting into one mess after another. Just like the supporting characters, you can do nothing but sit back and hold on for the ride.While you will laugh and shake your head at his \\"messes\\" you will also enjoy the introspective moments as well.It is well written, but doesn't get bogged down in too many details. I could easily picture each situation as they happened as well as feel each reaction of Jack and the other characters as they happened. I have recommended this book to several friends & hope to see more from this author. Great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the gaunt's ghosts books to date","review":"i think this is the best of the series to date, through 'his last command.'

You get to start in the same level, at the same checkpoint, just without the ship power-ups. Also, much like the gradius series, there is no r-type II (at least for americans) just the original, and III.The only thing i'm wondering about is the price. 100 bones and up? when i bought it from ebay (for a grip less,) the cheapest amazon had it at was 240!! does anyone know why? is this game hard to find or rare?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep House at it's Finest","review":"From start to Finish this CD carries you through a wave of emotions..

My doctor was extremely skeptical and dismissive, but I decided to give it a try anyway.

I did enjoy the fleshing out of some of the collatural players in the events.This book has issues with the facts, the timeline as well as embellishing statments of some of the key players in the story. The continual misrepresentation of some of the events, caused me to question all the information in the book.In addition, the barely veiled animous that the authors show for the police, the prosecutors and the LDS Church also colored the remaining material.

It would be impossible for them to have chronicled the dialogues that are quoted.

The entire book is obviously a \\"hit piece\\" intended to discredit the Mormon Church, and they miss no opportunity to do so.

I find myself singing along a lot too actually so it isn't annoying to watch over and over either.I like the message in it as well.

So I certainly picked up this book with some prejudice, wondering if I might find myself surprised by a talent on the page not in evidence in his other venues. Nope.

He's not a writer who creates caring toward his bizarre (in good and bad sense) characters, nor about their situations. I think he needs to amplify his ability with words with heart. That is just one man's honest opinion.

K S Sastry, the only other purchaser/reviewer to date, summarizes the book fairly, but I wish Verso, the book's publisher, had hired a very good writer of English text to work with the author to make this book much more readable. Throughout the book the author consistently uses very complex sentences and complex vocabulary with the result that this book is one of the most difficult to read of any books that I have tried to read.I believe that Unger has very worthwhile ideas and I wish I understood what he is saying to a greater extent than I can manage with the current text.

It starts with the International Geophysical Year, a 18-month period that startos off causing confusion for Howland Owl and Churchy - does that mean ten-and-a-half day weeks? Well, they're easily confused. The story meanders across the swamp and past all of the usual characters, Miz Beaver, Mlle Hepzibah, Sarcophagous McAbre, and (my favorite) Grundoon. There's a trip to the moon, planned if not a achieved. The insects decide how they'll divvy up the world once people A-bomb themselves off it.

Relying on a similarity between two sounding words does not an argument make!While I found HBHG highly believable, this book, in my mind, destroys Baigent and Leigh's credibility through the usage of flawed, unsubstianted, long leaps of faith.No one who presents compelling theories should rest on their laurels instead of their research."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an eye-opener!","review":"I've read \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" and was held spellboundthroughout.

For 1994, this game looks sharp, with detailed character models and cool backrounds. The music and the sound effects are just okay; a bit on the repetitive side for me.Mortal Kombat II's gameplay is much like Street Fighter's. A 2D fighter, you move with directional pad and push the triggers to block, while the action buttons make an attack. The special moves, while a bit hard to pull off, are very rewarding, and the fatalities are, well, delicious.With only 12 playable characters (with a couple of hidden ones!) and the lack of a decent save/password feature, this title lacks some decent replay value, but this is still a fine entry in the MK series, and is well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sequel","review":"Mortal Kombat 1 was a bit weak on its own since it was the first in the series, but made a good setup for this sequel, which had more characters, more of a storyline, and better features.

The album definitely captures the excitement of her live performances better than do the studio albums; too bad it doesn't include the visuals.The performance at the N.C.

I feel awed and deeply affected. I am not a writer, but I can see and appreciate how creatively and beautifully Barrington structured her memoir. The places where she intertwines her body/experience with her mother's stunned me. In a way, I feel that the whole book allows the reader to do the same with her, so it becomes the readers' experience, too. It's been good to walk in the territory of the fear of grief with someone who got to the other side. I experience this as a gift of courage.

Running from her grief, as well as her emerging desires for women, Barrington travels to Spain to work as a tour guide for a winery. There, she submerges herself in her work and in nightly encounters with various men. It's not until many years pass, that Barrington is able to grapple with her grief and visit her parents' grave in Gibraltar. This autobiography is about the struggle to overcome past tragedies and pain, and to finally embrace the full emotional range of one's self in the journey to wholeness. I was rather enchanted with Barrington's style, yet I felt she didn't delve into the depths as much as the memoir warranted. She does address this in the narrative, where she remarks on how people reacted upon hearing of the deaths of her parents at sea. Everyone does deal with tragedy in different ways, and who's to say which is more appropriate?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnected and frustrating","review":"The opening chapters, about the author's childhood viewpoint of her parents, and the conflicts prefiguring their at-sea deaths some years later, were engrossing. But the memoir seems disconnected when it then jumps to her young adulthood after her parents' deaths, as she lives a rowdy, promiscuous life in Spain for some years. Somehow this is meant to connect to her guilt about her parents' deaths, but it is unclear, superficial and repetitively tedious. Also, references to issues that seem important to her(e.g., sexual identity) are not followed up. Barrington is a good writer, and I expected a better crafted memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fit!!!","review":"The floor mat comes in two pieces and really does not fit well.

I can only assume it's to rip people off and I am not happy about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff","review":"This gel clears up my spots very quickly, and I refer to it as my magic cream with my family. I have pretty oily skin, so this doesn't dry up my face too much, but people with normal to dry skin should be careful when applying this as it will likely dry up your skin a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Fascinating Read","review":"This book gave me insight to the details of a killer's mind. Janice is someone who could walk amongst us on any given day yet her greed made her take that extra step into evil that most of us are able to resist. The description of the gathering of evidence and of putting a case together so that Janice would not get away with this murder is presented in an organized and exciting way. I highly recommend this book to everyone from those unfamiliar with the investigation and court system to the trial lawyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"hunting season, big game","review":"Dead Center is a well paced and descriptively vivid and evocative tale of murder on the high plateau. The reader is drawn into the ambiguities of a capital case. Of particular fascination is the ability of the prosecution on behalf of the People to win a first degree murder conviction without a murder weapon and also without specifying whether or not the defendant acted as the principal (pulled the trigger) or as a complicitor. The Colorado Court of Appeals has affirmed the verdict in a case that was extremely difficult to prove."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],B={key:0},O={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const L=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-b71e4f2f"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/45.md","filePath":"sponsor/45.md"}'),H={name:"sponsor/45.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
