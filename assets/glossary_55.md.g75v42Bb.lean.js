Why we should even consider reading any material from people whom believe in Partying & affairs & drugs sex & rock & roll, it's amazing to me, that the baby boomers with ideas of smoke a joint peace love have never grown up & can't see the world as it truly is for the smoke is in their eyes.

Read page 14- Al quotes Ann Coulter and then in the following paragraph admits that these comments were taken from other people, but realy justify his hatred for Ann Coulter. This book does have an honest title though, it is filled with filled with LIES, but they are all told by AL FRANKEN; I think Al ment it as an biography.Al Frankin is a graduate of the Bill Maher school of humor with a Master of BS degree in \\"Al Sharpton\\" hyprocracy.

But then again, just how hard is it to find inaccuracies, half-truths, lies and worse in the rantings of zealots like Coulter and Co.? Unfortunately, Franken misses the larger issue, which is that public discourse in America is increasingly dominated by zealots of right and left, and Ivins, Moore, Hightower and their ilk play just as loose with facts and are just as ideologically driven as their right wing counterparts. So unfortunately Franken misses a nice trick by focusing on the blatant stupidity of his political and cultural enemies, and ends up merely preaching to the choir instead of capitalizing on the opportunity to examine a problem of real urgency, which is the increasingly fundamentalist character of America, or rather, of two competing Americas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Pompous","review":"I liked Al's previous book.

He belongs to an exclusive gang of small men with small ideas, men who play a large part in degrading the political discourse of our nation.Rather than put forth a positive agenda for America, Franken continues the standard radical Democrat modus operandi of engaging the politics of personal destruction, rather than that of the cerebellum.Bottom Line: Even serious liberals and socialists can garner no more than cheap laughs from a man with cheap morals.By the way...One star is a generous rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demented Former Comic","review":"I actually liked this clown when he was just doing comedy but his forays into politics are mind-bogglingly inane.

The style that mixes facts with satire that implies a truth that never was, is reminicent of Crocodile the old Soviet satire journal. Note the mixture of footnotes where the facts are solid and chapter references where they are not. The quotes of various right oriented commentators that he calls ad hominim attacks (e.g. calling Clinton a rapist)are well documented and used as examples of the tone of the Right, although the facts of the Clinton criminal cases are not disputed.His technique is Classical Marxist in character and is a dificult read for anyone not well aquainted with Marxist dialectic."},{"rating":"1","title":"another liberal trash","review":"Along with his slanderous \\"big fat idiot\\" title directed to Rush Limbaugh, I wouldn't mind calling him an extremely retarded and morally degraded skunk.

Ian Anderson said it so well in the 70's \\"If Jesus saves, well he'd beter save himself from the gory, glory seekers who use his name in death.\\" Reading some of the negative reviews is entertaining in itself.

It sheds a lot of light on the games and deceptions that some politicians and a lot of the media engage in. He does a great job of researching the facts in his book and showing how people like O'Reilly, Hannity and Coulter distort facts for their own objectives and have no real journalistic integrity. I think both so-called liberals and and those in the center will enjoy this book, but those on the \\"right-wing\\" will naturally avoid it. I think Franken is a bit too glowing in some of his comments regarding the Clinton administration, but all in all, most of his comments ring very true once he lays out his research into topics such as politics, 9/11, and economics.

Speculation, and assumption, run rampant throughout the pages. Right, left, middle-left, middle-right, and left-right, all become very skewed and confused throughout the whole of the book. Another problem I found, as proved in Arnold Griffith's review above, is the lumping of all people of similarity into a whole, for example, Griffith claims after having read this book that all Christians are hypocrites. If I am not mistaken that is the same kind of illogical reasoning that puts gypsies in prison camps, and people with birth defects in gas chambers. If you want to read something, I would look in the area of positive and helpful, rather than negative and destructive, and this book has plenty of the negativity and destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"al franken is a disturbed, illogical propagandist","review":"Al Franken is a disturbed propagandist whose success shows how dangerous secularism is in the national discourse. Mean, petty, prone to violence he cannot look rationally at any issue. Didactic reasoning is something he is immune to if he has an axe to grind. Also, notice how he writes books that smear reputations. Calling O'Reilly a liar is a case in point. O'Reilly made a mistake saying Fox won a Peabody instead of a Polk award. He clarified his mistake twice on air. Yet, showing what a propagandist Franken is he did not mention this, and said O'Reilly claimed he won the Peabody. What a venal thing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about lies, Al Franken lies throughout this book","review":"What a poorly written book.

The liberal/democrat stance has always been one of tolerance and that all conservatives are evil; however, as I read this book it became obvious how perfectly INTOLERANT liberalism, and Al Franken, really is. This book is a look through a set of hateful, intolerant eyes. Such hypocrisy deserves to remain on the shelf. If you are liberal or just looking to get revenge for losing the elections of 2000, 2002 and recall 2003, then this book is for you.

I mean, you've got to admit that mug of his is still pretty funny.Oh yeah, the book. Let's see...all the words seemed to be spelled correctly (I didn't check every single one, however) and he did seem to have a handle on the grammar. Uhmm...I loved the cover. Yes, yes, the cover was just dandy; you know how I love that mug of his. And, let me think...oh, yeah...the pages were numbered just the right way and the book seemed to have sturdy binding.I'd expand my comments to include my thoughts on the content of the book, but my nine-year-old son just reminded me that that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.

It is a waste of money and time, and Al Franken should be ashamed of himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I realy liked it","review":"I will admit that I don fullow politics very much but he is an funny guy.I don't know who a lot of these people in the book are, but I know most people on TV and so I beleeve him when he says the bad guys are mean.If TV stars and funny people can tell us who to vote for then I dont have to pay attention.Vary good book and will help you when you vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure garbage....dont waste your money","review":"this book is terrible...i could barely get through it...this guy is trying to act like he is doing a parody when it is obvious that he believes all this nonsense...he thinks much more of himself than he deserves...dont waste your money...buy something that will at least expand your brain...this is just a book full of personal grudges....very uninteresting and not informative at all...dont be fooled by the television hype and coverage...wish i had my 18 bucks back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have always been suspicious of this administration. Now I know the truth. The thing about Al is whether you are conservative or liberal you have to respect his research and attention to detail. Not to mention the fact he is hillarious. I like to alternate his book and David Cross's new CD. It seems like whenever conservatives go after liberals all they can do is character assassinations because they have nothing. I especially like the points about Clinton's Army. By the way I don't feel I hate America. In fact being that I am in the military, I would say I love my country. The troops love ya Al, thanks for all your support"},{"rating":"1","title":"what madness is this","review":"I hate this book, because Rush and NR said to. It is a perfect example of how the stupid evil weak traitorous liberals are destroying America, by questioning the President in every way. Without absolute faith our city on the hill will crumble like the bistro food so many effete liberals enjoy. I purchased this book simply to burn it, and show those fascist liberals what is what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinton loved this book...","review":"So if the head liar loves it, the hateful liberals will adore it. Let us not forget that Frankens idol, Clinton was a do-nothing lying, and impeached fool.....and Franken proves himself a worthy student, sans impeachement.Are we sure that Franken isn't Rosey O. in drag?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocritical","review":"I also noticed some inconsistencies in some of Frankens comments.For instance, he says that O'Reilly compared the Koran to Mein Kampf when really, he compared making Americans read the Kuran to the hypothetical situation of making Americans reading Mein Kampf during World War II. There is a difference.He also writes that O'Reilly is talented. I saw him a few nights ago on Conan O'Brien where he said that the reason O'Reilly doesn't do USO tours is because O'Reilly has no talent. I imagine Franken would say this is just an example of his satirical style but it appears that he is disingenuous in his attempts to not be as politically simple as he accuses his targets of being.I wonder what Franken actually covers in his USO tours. I find it hard to believe that the commentary in this book would be very well recieved by US troops. And if the material he chooses for these tours is different, isn't that a kind of lie as well? And, in that case, what is his motivation to do the tours at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"rush sucks! don't compare al f. to rush.","review":"al may not be on an atkins diet, but he is nowhere near fat idiot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dishin' It Out","review":"Which is what the conservatives do so well but as their reviews show they sure can't take it! Great book with serious documentation. Democrats owe this guy a large debt of gratitude. A note to the unfavorable (conservative) reviewers who feel Al is so mean spirited: Are you aware that Al is friendly with many conservatives as evidenced by their (Jerry Falwell, G. Gordon Liddy, William F. Buckley) appearences on his since-cancelled show \\"Lateline\\"? Did you even read the part of the book where he speaks so nicely of Gary Bauer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book? More a collection of cartoons and \\"Thoughts\\"","review":"Real analysis hardly matters anymore, really. Who has the attention span to really focus on an issue, after all? Certainly not this guy. This book is a chopped-up collection of paragraphs and pictures for the MTV crowd. A little flash from a comedian that has a lot of friends in the press who think being droll and satirical is an indication of superior intelligence. Hell, Howard Stern's book had more substance. Not much difference between the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on the state of politics in America","review":"If you are a liberal, you will love this book. If you're conservative, you will undoubtedly dismiss it as left-wing propaganda. However, this book is excellent. Franken does a terrific job of disproving many conservative myths, including the one about the \\"liberal\\" media bias. In addition, Franken shows the unbelievable lengths that conservatives will go to in order to gain control (such as painting the picture that a triple amputee from vietnam is unpatriotic). If you are liberal, this book is for you. If you are conservative, all I ask that you try to have an open mind about it, and not dismiss it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I really the first?","review":"This book is a funny but mild retort to the rightwingers among us.Sure, Anne Coulter, Sean Hannity, and Bill O'Reilly don't care afig about the facts (favorite quotation: Hannity says \\"I don't havea lot of time to refute every fact here\\") but they hardlycompare with the threat posed by the supine media, the mandatedelectronic (ie, corruptable, no permanent record, and provided100% by rightwing corporations) balloting, and the completedisinterest of Americans in the other 75% of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very humerous plus bonus","review":"The bonus is truth. Limbough, O'Reilly, Hannity, all lampooned so very effectively and he uses facts to do so. Franken has a way to cut through the bull and the \\"spin\\" with a wit and wisdom unmatched in the world of political humor. His book is surprising well researched and he proves that fact can be funnier than fiction. I am certainly not fully onboard with all his political views but who cares, Franken is the funniest guy in the room."},{"rating":"1","title":".......and the lying Franken lies to the liars.......Yawn","review":"This is clearly a book written by yet another liberal for liberals, with a very tired agenda: let's make another attack on conservatives, Christians and Republicans.

However, if you are looking for a serious political commentary, this is definitly not the book for you.

Well, gee whiz and ole golly, what else is new?I want to recommend that everyone interested in politics in America read this book! Why? Because playing loose with the facts appears to be a cross political boundary problem and Al is in effect doing in this book what he is accusing his political opponents of doing: Lying!Franken is a real smart guy who is making money from the left! God bless the man and his capitalistic and monetary requirements that are apparently immense!

He does NOT support the troops. He tells anyone who will listen about his USO tours so he can pretend that he really supports the troops, but it's a cover.By the way, Franken planned the confrontation with O'Reilly at the LA book convention. But he lies about that, too. It's all calculated to advance his pathetic career of attacking people. He's a loser who goes on radio shows to talk about other people.By the way, his friendship with Senator Wellstone is fiction. The Wellstone family wants nothing to do with this retarded attack chipmunk. Al Franken is an embarrassment to the Wellstone family.By the way, I hear that Franni Franken resembles Triumph the Comic Insult Dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes great toliet paper!!!

Why? you ask. Its because hes another comedian like Michael Moore who can not come up with valid real world solutions, instead they spin facts and phrases and poke fun at them, and LIBERALS EAT IT UP! its what they love to hear.Maybe if I went to one of the those clown colleges like Berkley I too would enjoy this book.But I give it 3 stars for the toliet paper aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about LIARS","review":"This book was so full of unsubstatiated rhetoric,inconsistencies, outright lies and quotes taken out of context,it was outright laughable.

What rubbish. Franken should stick to being Stuart Smally. Oh, but I forgot, there is much more money writing left wing political diatribes than making more bad movies. Franken certainly doesn't improve the quality of the current politcal discourse. A thinking person should pass on this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Al's mom and I am embarrassed....","review":"Al was always a silly little boy wetting his bedsheets and generally making a nuisances of himself.

Lord knows he didn't use toliet paper to wipe his rear.Al, come home son, or I'll throw out your barbie doll collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn! Another batch of pulp from a pseudo-writer.","review":"Franken has sunk to new lows. He attacks the person, not their views. He resorts to name-calling and innuendo. He has nothing new to say, nor does he say it in a new way. His writing is nothing more than an attack (dare I say Conserva-phobic) on the right. If he left the ad hominem attacks out, this might be mildly entertaining. Instead, he uses the Clintonesque attempts of character assassination and non sequitor to further his immature view on what people should be allowed to do and think.Don't waste your time with this book, it really is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great work of fiction...","review":"By all means ,purchase this book, read it and enjoy a glimpse into the inner workings of a truly demented mind!This guy shouldn't have left his day job...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke of a book from the joker himself","review":"This book smacks of your tiresome left wing talking points.

The chapter on Bill O'Reilly interested me the most so I jumped right in. Never have I read such stupid, unintelligent nonsense. Mr. Franken wrote this book for dullards and simpletons. He rambles about some few mistakes that Bill O'Reilly made in claiming that Inside Edition had won a Peabody. Who cares!

To engage in congenial political discourse or to refute the talking points of Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, and others is one thing, but to lower yourself and your \\"humor\\" to a level that is bellicose, vitriolic, and completely devoid of substance is entirely another.

Also, this doesn't make me as condemnable as what liberals have charged the one star reviewers for doing, and that is passing judgment with no basis. Instead, I too, like the reviewer pandorasdad, am going to depreciate the people on both sides of the aisle, as libs and cons are both over-the-top in their hardened party lines.However, i'm not gonna' be clement to rate this with 3 stars. I give this one star based on the stinging fact that's materialized, which is that the liberals are REALLY, just monstrously more hostile and corrosive in their reviews.

When will we get some intelligent people to speak our case? Is a washed-up comedian the best we have to offer? Our (Kerry's) numbers are plummeting and Bush is skyrocketing and we have Stuart Smalley leading us! Yes, we have a dull candidate, but this book is even duller.

The problem for them is that the research is well done and doesn't present the argument with any spin. He just lays it out there. Obviously we know what his opinions are on the people and issues he brings up, but he isn't trying to fool anyone. Any educated person (with a sense of humor) can see quite clearly what Al is trying to say in this book.

He also presents a sort of wimpy American-style liberalism. If you want the real thing, read some Chomsky and go eat lunch with Vanessa Redgrave.

Franken's comedic approach only made me shake my head in disgust as he poked fun at many prominent right wing politicians and TV personalities. In my opinion Franken's approach is what is wrong with politics recently, preferring to criticize and pick apart policies as well as personalities. If you're a liberal supporter you will probably find this book entertaining but most conservatives won't find it worth their while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous, but....","review":"Just because things are funny does not make them accurate. Al Franken as well as Ann Coulter are guilty of the same problem; they use humor and insults in an attempt to make people see their point. That's fine if you are writing for sheer entertainment value, not so much if serious political commentary is your goal. Mr. Franken may be a very talented writer and a somewhat smart guy, that, however, does not mean he has a clue as to how this country should be handled. If you are looking for a comedic look at politics, read this book. For those of you who are looking for serious political commentary, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy has no experience except being stupid","review":"Al Franken is a little fat weasal (as opposed to a big, fat idiot).What a sorry excuse for a human being.If you have ANY actual ideas that make sense, let us know.

A lie that he responded to saying it was \\"regrettable\\" by citing a source that was made up. Liberal's look at this book as a bashing on O'Reilly and enjoy it because of O'Reilly's huge following. Yet, O'Reilly IS a political commentator and not a comedian. Naturally, he (anybody) will have a large following if he speaks to Americans critical mind. I'm sure all whom agree with the words of Franken also find the political commentary of people like Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Alec Baldwin, Danny Glover, etc. to be well thought out rationalization about politics in America. And if you believe that you probably also think that Bill Clinton was a moral man injected with family value's. Think critically when you read this book, and consider the source, just like anything else in life, liberal or conservative, black or white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al is no honest broker","review":"Franken starts with a sincere sounding mission of proving the lies of the right wing media (Coulter, Limbaugh, Hannity) but then loses all of his credibility. He claims for example that Ann Coulter \\"lied\\" when she said that Norman Thomas, the socialist presidential candidate, was Evan Thomas's (the Newsweek editor) father. He even has a satirical dialogue with Evan in which Evan denies the statement as if it were preposterous, wholly without factual basis! What Franken never admits is that Norman Thomas was Evan's grandfather, not father, context which would turn Coulter's \\"lie\\" into something less, such as a mistake. Thus Franken commits the very duplicity he so earnestly complains that the right is guilty of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure","review":"Al Frankin was a failure as a comedian on SNL, now he fails to tell the truth in his one and ONLY book.

Political satirist Franken obliterates the liars he focuses on. It is like watching a skilled surgeon cutting out a malignant tumor. I particularly enjoyed his dismantling of Ann Coulter and her book, Slander, where she tells outright lies that the average knee jerk conservative would never think to question. Supply side Jesus has got to be my favorite part of the book.My only criticism is that Franken does not offer as compelling an explanation of the purpose and intent behind the lying. If you want to go the next step and understand exactly WHY all these liars are selling their souls, read Francione's HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD. Not quite as entertaining as Franken but it goes much deeper looking behind the lies to the reasons why.

Talk about a liar!Numbers Two and onward: go to www.anncoulter.org and look for her article entitled \\"I Guess You're Right: There Is No Liberal Media Bias\\". It is a crying shame that someone as educated and intelligent as Ann has dignified Franken's defamation as legitimate debate.If it weren't so sad, it would be funny that liberals are actually looking to so-called comedians to champion their political debate.

I am a native of the South (South Carolina) and I loved the Bob Jones \\"University\\" (Bob Jones Standard Only) chapter.I only wish the Franken Team had spent more time exposing the \\"Christian Coalition\\" of the South for the racist and sexist practices. Hopefully that will be in the next book that will hopefully be published before the 2004 election. Having lived most of my life in the South (the first 30 years) it was interesting watching the Klu Klux Klan become a group of conservative christians represented first by the Reagan Administration (and look at Tom Delay today).Great Job and keep the facts coming as humorously as you can Team Franken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY THE TRUTH IS TOLD","review":"This is an excellent read.

Anyone who saw him in one of his Saturday Night Live skits or his (thankfully) short-lived tv show already knows this isn't the case. Whiney and obnoxious are terms that come more readily to mind. An even better description would be one mentioned by Fox in their legal proceedings: \\"parasite\\".Heard an interview (also not funny, although Franken seemed to amuse himself) on NPR the other day in which he noted Bill O'Reilly's inconsequential comments about his (O'R's) own childhood as \\"lies\\" while calling his (Franken's) own use of a phoney solicitation on unauthorised Harvard letterhead for the purpose of gaining material for his own enrichment and the gratuitous embarassment of others a \\"prank\\".If you want amusing political commentary, read P.J.

Instead of making jokes he has become a joke ... and not in a funny way. This book is nothing more than childish name calling that even a elemenatry school student knows is not constructive. You have to hand it to him. He has finally found a way to profit from the notes he used to pass in grade school.

Franken has never denied that he is partisan. In this book, as in the Rush Limbaugh book, Mr. Franken has exposed the inaccuracies of various conservative media outlets. He did this in what I felt was a very humerous way. The trip to Bob Jones University was hilarious! Many of those reviewers who disliked the book were very shrill and, occasionally, downright cruel. There was one reviewer who admitted that (s)he hadn't read the book, and another who found some measure of satisfaction in the recent death of Mr. Franken's mother.

But we donft have enough time to carry out analysis, which Team Franken conducted, and live in a doubtful world. This book (or Team Franken) did great job of google analysis, fact finding, and connecting missing information, and clarified how policymakers or media intentionally modified our views or views, which we faced everyday. Harsh (but witty) criticism in the book is based on the accumulation of analysis. After reading this book, considering intention behind news might become habit. It is good warning for us to reconsider news through media and good education to be wise citizens. At the same time, this book is the outcome of smart (Kennedy School and Harvard) studentsf rigorous after-school activities. Though you may feel some part is unconnected, it is stimulating reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good...but not fair and balanced","review":"The book is fun. Franken is witty and intelligent, but he distorts the truth as much as Ann Coulter or Bill O'Reilly. For example, he goes on about \\"lies\\" by Coulter, and makes a point about Evan Thomas not being--as Coulter claims--the son of Socialist Norman Thomas. True enough, but Evan Thomas is the grandson of Norman. He apparently notes the distinction in the footnotes, but those of us listening to the audio book didn't get footnotes.Second, Franken is especially venomous toward Christianity. His comments about wanting to be photographed on a cross at Bob Jones University were neither funny nor tasteful.Those comments aside, this is a very interesting and-for the most part-funny book. The section about the pig geyser is not to be missed. \\"Fair and balanced\\" it isn't, but entertaining it certainly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Crude? Too Mean-Spirited?

Al Franken is a national treasure and I'm thrilled by the success of this book.As someone who actually reads the newspapers and watches the news, I've known for a long time that the \\"liberal media\\" was nothing more than an invention of the radical right, but I'm thrilled to see a #1 bestselling book finally knock it down for good. Anybody who can read the chapters on the outrageous way that Al Gore's campaign and Paul Wellstone's memorial were covered in the press and still think the media is controlled by liberals is truly beyond help.You keep giving them hell, Al. This proud liberal is sick and tired of being called anti-American and blamed for 9/11 and every other ill that's ever befallen this country. Finally, someone tells it like it is.

First - it pays attention to fact, not just rhetoric. Second - Al takes a very level, even-handed approach to the distinction between 'truth' and 'spin'. Third - Al simply dismantles the Rushian empire by using truth, as opposed to over-inflated biased accusations. Lastly - Al takes the administration to task over statements that have been made repeatedly without much challenge from the mainstream media. Nice job Al!

From Minimum knowledge I now have a far greater understanding of MS and how debilitating it is. The book goes through Nadine's health decline and her battle to overcome MS but the reader senses the determination of this lady and also that she has a loving family # all of which helped her win this battle.

The regulator was cheaply manufactured. We went out to buy a good regulator after a few weeks.2. The burner head is poorly designed. The pan/wok sits too closed to the flame. The hottest part of a flame is the oxizing zone- slightly lower than the tip of the flame. So it does not heat up as fsst.3. The electronic ignitor is tempermental.

This book is a matter-of-fact look at the life of St. Peter Julian Eymard. I have found his writings to be tremendously inspirational and highly recommend them... so I went ahead and looked for something about the saint himself. Well, the pickings are slim in that category but this book does the job. You will read about the life and death of this Apostle of the Eucharist with a heavy focus on the founding of his religious congregation and the struggles (physically and spiritual) he faced along the way. It includes many excerpts from his correspondence and you will come away with a good idea of who the saint was and what he was about. So don't go into this expecting a wildly inspiring story. It's a lot of facts. But it served its purpose for me.

After seeing, \\"The Haunted History of Halloween\\" on the History Channel, I went out and bought this book. It is by far the best book I have found that tells the whole history behind the holiday that we celebrate every October 31. From the ancient festivities of Samhain to the parties thrown by Victorians to parades in the 30's and 40's, this book explores the significance behind this holiday. Why do we trick or treat and dress up? Why are ghosts, witches, black cats, and devils associated with this holiday. This book answers these questions and a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a book that verifies its sources; this one is a bust.","review":"Two pages into the 1990 printing, the book speaks of Samhain, the Celtic Lord of the Dead. There was no such character in any Celtic pantheon; the word Samhain (pronounced roughly \\"sah-wen\\") actually means \\"summer's end.\\" This old chestnut has been reputed extensively, something the author would do well to note as it is precisely this misinformation that has been used by many so zealots to condemn modern Halloween.With this egregious of an error in the opening pages, I have no faith that the rest of the book would hold up to scrutiny. Take a pass on this one and find a book that actually verifies its sources. Sure, the most recent edition has corrected this error, but I have little faith in the accuracy of the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT SHORT HISTORY","review":"Anyone interested in learning about the history of this great Holiday will enjoy this read. Halloween tradition from its earliest Celtic roots to the present day is covered. At 160 pages large print it's a quick read for anyone, and little space is devoted to any one period so readers will not be forced to slog through chapters that don't interest them. Of course, that also causes problems on the other end as well. I wish the author had devoted more time to the Twentieth Century, when Halloween really took off. Also, only American tradition and practices are described even though the holiday has become international by this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy is alive!","review":"Jacob Needleman is not a bureaucratic philosopher. His teachings are about an intense search for a meaningful life. In this book he talks about some intense experiences in his own life and also with students and their parents. He also presents a very personal overview of occidental philosophy.Many philosophy teachers of our days are more concerned about formalities and structures of thought. Past philosophies are studied as dead bodies: cut into pieces, dissolved with chemicals, watched through microscopes.I have already used this book in philosophy seminars for management students, at the University of Campinas, here in Brasil (there is a Portuguese translation).

There is compelling evidence to believe that the Vedas *are* the literature of the Saravati and Indus Valley Civilisation, and the authors have done a good job in bringing this to the forefront.I have given it only 4 stars because I felt that the material which described the organisation of the books in the Rg Veda and the explanation of the Vedic fire altars could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent presentation of ground-breaking material","review":"The authors present their central arguments for the origins and continuity of the Indic civilization very convincingly and forcefully. This is a well written, well-documented book. This book should be required reading in high schools and colleges across India. I highly recommend this to any students of ancient history. In some sections of the book, however, the authors indulge in unwarranted rose-tinted speculation, e.g. suggesting the Vedas pre-empted modern cosmological and Darwinian theories. Aside from these deviations, the book is a very objective work of historical detective work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again Amazon deletes the one star reviews.","review":"Remember to always subtract 2 stars from any Amazon rating since they delete the one star ratings and allow the authors and their friends to submit multiple 5 star reviews with different IDs.My original review simply noted that genetic science has now proven the Aryan invasion theory.

There was an Aryan invasion, saying otherwise is merely reactionary nonsense, designed to undermine the achievements of the Dravidian people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating: more than speculation , less than conclusive","review":"A fascinating read using Vedas, archeology, varied sources to make case against Aryan Invasion theory (conclusive), for very ancient continuous tradition predating Sumner (believable), and for connections between early Indus and later Ganges cultures (also believable).Until the Indus script is broken and more archeological work done in the Thar we anxiously await further proofs and revisions. Very recent under water cities that likely are about 7000 years old will add to the story when explored. Exposes racial, cultural, disciplinary biases that have held back 'progress' in better understanding early civilization and its continuity in India.This is far more than idle or imaginative speculation and well worth reading although traditional historians would appreciate more sources of evidence and may be uncomfortable with that which uses early Vedic texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takuan, more than just a tasty pickle!","review":"This text, which includes the elusive \\"Taia-ki\\" or Sword of Taia is not for the casual reader. It requires study and serious thought to approach it's lessons. My suggestion is to read it, study it, and then forget it and go about your business. Zen is found in our daily activities, so keep it simple. Eat when hungry, go to the toilet when you need to eliminate, and sleep when tired. Once internalized, let it go, focus on the here and now, and get out of the trap of over-intellectualizing everything. These are some of the fundamental lessons of the priest Takuan Soho. He was a confidante to the powerful, and a master of many arts. His advice to the Yagyu sword experts is as valid today as it was 400 years ago. Whether the reader has an interest in zen and martial arts or not, this philosophical work is worthy of the reader's attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into Zen mind","review":"I found this text to be a complex, informative glimpse into the Zen mindset towards swordsmanship, yet general enough to be applicable to other martial arts.Takuan Soho's words will show you something new about yourself, and perhaps change the way you perceive certain aspects of yourself/ your training. A must read for anyone who is serious about applying a Zen mindset to their daily practice, whatever it may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated","review":"I enjoyed reading this book although I can't really say what I got out of it.

For avid readers of the Zen tradition, this book offers both contrast and compliment to Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki. Most intersting I thought was his disticntion between the \\"mind of principle\\" and the \\"mind of technique\\". It stimulates meditation on our own day-to-day quality of thought and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fills my memory banks","review":"I just wanted to say thanks to Rob Mullins for being a part of my favorite music for 20 + years.

It is too bad you cannot return cd's that you don't like. Yo La Tengo's Fakebook with David Schramm is one of my favorite cd's but The Schramms Dizzy Spell was a complete waste of time and energy. David Shramm's voice lacks melody and almost sounds a bit grating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Indie!!!!!!","review":"Cheers to Big Jim Boinski and John Stemberg and all the Chicago actors and crew that made this happen. A great indie film with a super score. Can't wait for the soundtrack. Cheers to Doug Carter who wrote the score, and Lee Greenwod for \\"Desires of the Heart\\", listen to the words they are meaningful. John, the song you wrote & composed \\"Dressing up for Baby\\" is fantastic. Angie Schoofs performs it so well. Love the chemistry amongst the actors. For an indie film made with no budget this movie holds your interest from beginning to end. A nice mixture of serious and light humor and of course the grit that comes with it. All questions are answered. A great movie to view, leaves you talking about it.Will there be a \\"legit 2\\"? Can't Wait!!Thanks for filming in Chicago and using Chicago talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epicurus is an absolute pleasure","review":"Epicurus the Sage is a biting satire about the philosophical and historical climate of classical Athens. Although not at all historically accurate, it takes each character, including good old Socrates himself, to the extreme. No knowledge of philosophy or the mythology is required to get the most out of this book, although it certainly helps. It seems to take a while for the plot to kick and it winds up very quickly, which is a little disappointing. Still, it had my whole household rolling on the floor with laughter. In the tradition of Asterix, this is a great comic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"For a old graphic novel, this was actually a pretty entertaining read. It's a retelling of the Greek myths but with more naughty humor along with modern-day references. The artwork and colors are pretty good for their time, and the stories within are entertaining (three of them altogether) along with some exploration of philosophy and mythology for a decent price make for a solid buy. I especially liked the Hades and Persephone tale - it was funny to see the idea that they eloped together and made it look like a kidnapping. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some books ARE trashworthy","review":"First book I ever threw in the trash because it was so bad.

I was quite obsessed with it, they were my favourite books. But after about book 20, the quality started to slide. The series has become too commercial, and the books themselves have suffered. They have from having too many characters and too many authors, which makes the biggest problem inconsistentcy. There are so many discrepancies in the books that I don't know what is happening. None of the new authors seem to have read the previous books, and with so many charaters, none of them are getting a fair chance and it's very difficult to keep them all straight in your mind and remeber who is who. I also think that some of the characters' motives are a bit questionable, particularly Christina. The girl needs a bit of constancy. I thought Sterling was supposed to be the horse of her dreams?

Over all, I am very disappointed and no longer consider these books worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WAY JOSE!!!!!!!","review":"I am simply annoyed with the entire Star thing.

They're sturdy and colorful. The only drawback is there are few where colored paint is on the side, but it's really not that noticeable.

The book is set in the modern world, but flashes back to the time of King Arthur. I don't want to spoil the story for those who have not read it. Suffice it to say that the main characters are realistic and genuine. The story is entertaining with a lot of action. It is a fun read and the writing style is excellent. I hope these authors collaborate on more books in the future. Richard, the main character, is apparently modeled after the LaCroix character Nigel Bennett played on Forever Knight. This book is a must read for Forever Night fans as well as those people who like vampires, but hate the ultra-gorgeous Anne Rice kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I'm a fan of Nigel Bennett--when he's on TV--and a big fan of P. N. Elrod's--except for this book. The plot elements are so disparate that it's hard to believe that even Elrod could make a good vampire novel out of them; it ranges from Celtic mysticism to Camelot to some wierd tribute to I Heard the Owl Call My Name to modern-day Toronto. The small portions set in Kingcome Inlet are so bad it's embarassing; the rest of the book is so far below Ms. Elrod's usual fine writing that I'm tempted to blame it on Mr. Bennett. But a tight deadline and loose editing are likely the real culprits."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEH","review":"I wanted to like this book. I like the cover. I LOVED LaCroix in Forever Knight. But. The book seems surprisingly lame. i can't put my finger on it, exactly..... I guess I would describe it as facile. As an avid reader, and fan of the genre, it just didn't grab me. In fact I put it aside and never finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was Elephant?","review":"A friend gave me this book for Christmas. I couldn't believe what I read. What happen to editing! I've read some poor written stuff on the the Internet, but this took the cake! And this was published by the same company that publishes my favorite MAN-KZIN WARS series. To paraphase a line from the story. I've read some moronic stories but is was ELEPHANT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating","review":"I was absolutely captivated by this novel. I didn't expect to think much of it, but in fact it was amazing. I received it Monday and had it devoured by Wednesday.The goddess elements and mythology used were very accurate. I enjoyed the descriptive quality and word usage. It flowed very well. I like to describe the book as James Bond meets Anne Rice. An enjoyable fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"suspence from cover to cover","review":"Forever Knight is my all time favorite vampire show, and Nigel Bennett my hero. I was delighted when I found out about the book he and Ms. Elrod had written I bought it and read it with gusto! When I read Keeper of the King, the sequence of events flowed smoothly, just the right number of characters as not to be confusing and the best part a wide open ending so more books please.."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and versatile","review":"Personally I think it is nice to make homemade cards for friends and family, with the price of cards today this is a plus. Also I can personalize the card and change it to what I want to say. I am having alot of fun with this program. It has a built in address book and calendar and a reminder so I will never forget another birthday or whatever. Then there is the card just for fun because I am thinking of someone. I have not had any of the problems that I read in the other review and I really like this product for the price. I am totally satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating, condescending and inflexible","review":"Not only does this product insist on printing a cheesy label on the back of every card to assure people that, yes indeed, it's a homemade computer card, but it hijacks your computer and printer when it's time to print. It forces--and I mean forces--you to endure a paper-wasting printer process to determine the best way to print your card. It's only mildly annoying the first time. It's infuriating subsequent times, when there is no way to tell it that you have already printed with this program on this printer and you don't want to kill more trees. Hallmark can and should do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Little Program!","review":"I was looking for an easy-to-use software program to design my own note and greeting cards, using my own photos. For 10 bucks, I figured I didn't have much to lose, so I bought it - and have used it steadily ever since. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but I can import my own photos (processed and framed in my photo-editing software), size them to fit, add my own sentiment (or use one of theirs), and even print my own card logo on the back! I've used more expansive (read: expensive) programs, but they took up a lot of space on my computer and had features I didn't need or want. If you want to use your own artwork or photos for cards, invitations, brochures. . .this is it! I do wish the Curved Text feature was a bit more sophisticated, but that's minor. The choice of fonts is excellent, colors can be changed - and it's all very simple. For those looking for a straightforward program to design cards, I recommend this. For the price, it's a real bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Event Planner?","review":"The product I got was in a different wrapping then the picture and although it says it has an Event Planner it isn't there. The user guide says there is a button for it, yet it doesn't exist. I've tried re-installing it figuring I might have missed something on the install, but it is still missing the Event Planner. The sole reason I purchased this product was to replace my Create-A-Card that had the Event Planner because I was told this works on Windows 7 and my really old software doesn't.... I've contacted Hallmark about this and am waiting to hear back.. as of right now, I'd say the version 1stVideo is selling now doesn't seem to have Event Planner!!!

The kids just don't appreciate the heavy sarcasm and disrespect, and were quite horrified that the babysitter ended up sleeping on the couch while the kids were up. The book is about disrespect, disobedience, a lack of adult control and is written in such a manner as to encourage children to copy it.

I have been measured several times and have worn a 34D for 10+ years. The band on this bra was HUGE - it fit more like a 36 or bigger. The cups had an odd shape that was very unflattering, and were too thin - the 'headlights' would definitely show through. It was so big that if offered no support at all. I returned it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to get used to it","review":"This is the first time I have found a bra that fits, holds me up and improves my posture.

I'm used to dealing with horrible, sharp underwire sapping my will to live one mile at a time. I put up with it because I doubted I could have adequate support without it, however, this bra proved me wrong by providing great support without any metal additions. There is a sort of itchy tag that was irritating before I washed it a few times. This bra is my workout staple. I love it.* Please be advised that this bra is sized the way high quality bras are sized. If you wear bras from Macy's or Victoria's secret, your size will be very different from what you need to order. The best place I've found to get properly sized for free is at Nordstrom. Once you have your new size, this bra will most likely fit like a dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fit and comfortable","review":"Fits well and keeps everything in place (for the most part). My only issue is when I'm doing high-impact aerobics. The bra doesn't seem to keep everything in place. I'm sure if I went to a smaller size, I won't have that problem, but then I don't think the bra would be as comfortable (which is the case for another bra I recently bought on Amazon). I guess I have to sacrifice size for comfort.I do recommend this bra. But if you are big chested, you might have the same issue I have with this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Pros: Liked the back. Seems sturdy strong material.Cons: Runs a bit small, Not enough separation between the cups.This bra caught my attention because of the back. I have to alter my bras in the back so the straps come closer to the center. Because I need sturdy bras T-back bras aren't enough support. I'm returning because the front cups squeeze the girls together instead of lift and separate. It runs slightly small in the band size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ow, the shoulder straps","review":"I had difficulty determining the size to get, and I must had got it wrong. On the negative side, the cups are smaller than expected, and this is the first bra I've ever had that the shoulder straps dig in, even buying additional padding isn't helping. On the plus side, wow, there is NO bounce! I may try this item again, but in a size up both cup and band. Oh, and there was the unexpected bill from fedex for additional customs fees etc. I didn't check into customs ahead of time, so my fault, but now, not the great deal it seemed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"Having a DD bust size doesn't make it easy to exercise. I found this bra to be comfortable during Zumba workouts. I wish it was a little more supportive."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"This is the second one I've bought and it won't be the last. It has become my favorite, turn-to bra. The original one has gone through countless washings and held up very well. It gives me the support I need during exercise or for daily wear. Other bras end up sagging and lose elasticity, especially the straps. This glamorise sport bra has kept its original shape after 2 years. It fits very well and looks good under casual clothing. I have arthritis in my neck and shoulders and am a D cup. Although this isn't a posture bra, it does fit and support well enough to reduce back strain. As for the complaint about lack of comfort, I haven't found this to be the case. Some people's skin is more sensitive than others. A good fabric softener might go a long way toward solving that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinion","review":"I was very disappointed. It is a rough bra and caused great discomfort.

My guess is that the manufacturers are in a war to fake the most positive reviews and are also dissing the competition's products.

Perhaps this is a sports bra feature as opposed to a \\"regular\\" bra, since 38G's in those are perfect fits for me.I will order more, maybe even replace all of my bras with these, but will have to order a 40 H.Otherwise, it's a great bra for the price, very comfortable, and super supportive without underwire- something I didn't think was possible for someone my size.Add it to your wish list or shopping list today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT SPORTS BRA!","review":"This is the first sports bra that I've ever owned that does what a sports bra should - holds me in so I don't jiggle! It is very well constructed and has a very wide elastic closure (four hooks rather than the usual two or three). It does not have an underwire which initially concerned me but it works just fine. Although it fits perfectly, I'm a bit concerned that the elastic portion might stretch in time since I wear it on last (smallest) hooks. I'll probably order a 34 D next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Complain","review":"I was satisfied with the structure and support of this bra~It's a little tighter than the size should be and I wished it had the modesty petals in it or at least some sort of lining.

The shoulder straps dug so hard into my shoulders that it felt like knives. My breasts bounced around so much that I almost knocked myself out. I am usually a 42F - so - I thought I'd play it safe and order a 44G. The band fit pretty well - but I was busting out the sides of the cups.

Well it fit perfectly despite the confusion of getting two completely different size recommendations based upon the measurements from Amazon (40F or something ridiculous) vs the Glamorise website (42C), which still were not my usual size (40D). I went with the Glamorise website and it fit perfectly in the band and cup and I tightened the shoulder straps as much as they could go. The material is pretty scratchy. Well after jogging just one mile the straps had already broken the skin on BOTH my shoulders. This is no jog bra for full figured women and I certainly would'nt wear it in public/under my regular clothes either because it really makes your chest look funky. Save your money and go for a more expensive one is my advice and now I'm pissed because I certainly can't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Itchy band, terrible shape!","review":"I ordered this sports bra online with trepidation because I have such a hard time finding sports bras in my size in brick and mortar stores. The reviews convinced me that it would be a good purchase, but it turned out to be terrible! The fabric on the band is incredibly rough and itchy, and the cups made my breasts look like they were in a 1950's cone-shaped bra. Some reviewers mentioned that they wore it as a regular bra, but it comes up so high in the front (which I wasn't expecting from the advertised picture) that I think it would show with a lot of my shirts, and I don't even wear low-cut shirts.Now I'm afraid to ever buy a sports bra online again.

These bras run small and I would recommend ordering a size up in the band size that you normally wear. Also, as soon as I put this bra on the band immediately rolled.

There are a few really good performances on this disc but I find it to almost be too mellow...not really in a bad way though.The second disc, from MTV's live at the ten spot is more upbeat and rocking. Really not a bad performance on this disc. My favorite would have to be A Murder Of One. The only complaint I can find on this disc is that the sound quality isn't quite perfect although it's far from bad.I own alot of live music and this is really quite good. I would definitely reccomend this disc to anyone getting into the crows or fans of band's such as dave matthews band, matchbox twenty, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great live cd---must have for a counting crows fan","review":"Just buy it.This two disc cd offers a great mix of electric versions of many of their songs as well as some acoustic versions too. Adam Duritz and the band re-vamp some songs so nicely that I find the studio versions of \\"Have you seen me lately\\" \\"Catapault\\" and \\"Mr. Jones\\" (as well as many others) seem to pale in comparision to these live versions. It proves that the Crows are an excellent live band that doesn't need to stick to that studio sound when on stage, to sound EXCELLENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"They try too hard!","review":"The acoustic CD is wonderful. Adam is nice and quiet and puts some variety to his songs. Mr. Jones acoustic is one of the coolest songs I've ever heard. But their live concert CD is horrible. Adam trys too hard to make his songs sound new and original. It comes off as annoying. They sound better on an album. Adam up tight during the concert and ends up ruining some of his best songs. For example, \\"Murder of One\\" was changed from a slow quiet song to a loud obnoxious song in which Adam keeps yelling, \\"Get the hell up!\\" They've proved that they're just another stupid band without brains unlike DMB or Blues Traveler. I've lost all respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Ramblings Do Not Replace a Melody","review":"Adam Duritz was at his best in August and Everything After, and its really been down-hill since then. The VH1 set (1st album) is awful in that it sounds like AD is sooo bored of doing the same old tunes, that he purposefully masacres the songs, especially their haunting melodies. He has a soul-tearing voice, but he doesn't realize that his non-melodious ramblings are simply not musically valid forays into diversity. He's just tired of the way the song sounds and instead of creatively changing it, he butchers it till its unrecognizable. I have listed to August and Everything After 1000 times, Recovering the Satellites 100, and this album, only a few times. I'm going to send it back. I was so excited to see this album on the shelves, this is truly a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do anything for me","review":"I was very excited when I saw this double disc set in the store. I rushed home and popped the first one into my VCR -- boy was I crushed. I didn't like it at all. So, I figured the second one would be much better -- Nope. Adam changed the melodies...and in some cases, the lyrics! The result? Songs that sound NOTHING like the versions that I love on the albums. What a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"They try way too hard to sound original","review":"If this CD was only made up of one disc, I would give a star or two, but two discs full of live performances is just too much for any music fan to handle. The lead singer tries to hard to change the flows of the songs from the studio recordings, and he does fairly good job. But overall, he fails to bring a quality sound. If you need 2 boring CD's just to play while you sleep at night, get this one (it will put you to sleep right away), otherwise it will just collect more dust on your CD tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If there were zero stars, this CD would definetly deserve it. I am not exactly sure what Counting Crows attempted with this CD... I mean, it's not like they have 6 or 7 albums out there, or like they are already established \\"big rock band.\\" Just because they made it on the cover of the Rolling Stone magazine, it doesn't mean that they can knock down anything in their way. I mean, common, even Spice Girls made it on the cover. First disc is OK, just OK. But on the second disc, it seems like the singer himself is bored with the lyrics and lame music. He attempts to put some life into it, but it falls even shorter then that. I have pushed myself to listen the 2nd disc till the end just so I could write this review.... In order to warn other people: THIS CD IS NOT WORTH EVEN $1. Stick with their other 2 CD's, because these guys are no Dave Matthew's Band. 1/2 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crows Live","review":"Across The Wire is a double live disc from the band. The first is an acoustic based set from their performance on VH1 Storytellers and the second is an electric set from their MTV Live At The 10 Spot show. Some songs crossover and appear on both discs, but that's a good thing. You get to a hear song like \\"Angels Of The Silence\\" which is a harder-edged song in its original electrified version as well as acoustically. The band is in top form and Adam Duritz can sing the heck out of a song in any style. The one major problem I have is with the Storytellers disc. The show has artists explain how they came about writing the songs they are performing and for some inexplicable reason, the band decided to edit those parts off the disk. That is a major reason to watch the show and their absence takes something away from the listening experience. That criticism aside, the album is still a good listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD anyone can buy!","review":"This is the best CD with the dave matthews band ever anyone who even hears of this band should buy the cd asap! love all of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me?","review":"How can people like these two discs? They're slow, droning and awful, awful versions of the songs. I threw mine away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak, weak effort","review":"I have always felt that Adam is a terrific lyricist, and had the uncanny knack for saying things in a very poetic and cool way. In these two curious recordings, however, he seems very intent on changing his delivery of this very cool messages. I don't feel the versioning of the songs has done any kind of service to music. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, as the saying goes. I would have to rate this as 1 star, as I would NEVER choose to listen to these renderings over the original studio discs, which, still remain flawless and beautiful in my mind. Nice try, but a failed effort -- to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was at this show","review":"I actually went to live at the 10 spot. I remember them announcing they were recording this live. It was a great show, though I had wished it was longer. Seems like the Counting Crows are lazy. I was a little disappointed they didn't play Mr. Jones. Overall great show though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Counting Crows","review":"Anyone out there who has seen the Counting Crows live can appreciate what is going on here. Although I didn't find this to be the best thing ever by them, I did find it very enjoyable to hear live recordings after only two albums. Is there a better live band to see. I mean, sure there are the great guitarists, or musicians like DMB, but no one (and I mean no one) can tear up a crowd with such heart-wrenching emotion as Adam Duritz. I believe it is with great sarcasm that we tell people to, \\"Say what you really mean, don't hold back.\\" Here that is exactly what Adam does and if you can't feel what he is saying, go get your pulse checked. If you don't like this album, go see them live and then listen again. You won't be disappointed any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I am a big fan of live music and also enjoy the work of the Crows. However, this album was a disappointment. I can handle a song or two with a change of pace or tempo. It typically shows some nice creativity and range. But not every single song on the album. There is no need to reinterpret every single song on your playlist. This CD gets old and painful very quick. It would have been nice if they spent at least the second album (the electric version) covering some of their better material in the same or at least remotely similar format that made it a hit in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"one misfire","review":"I object not to bands who change arrangments or words in their songs when performing live--it often energizes the shows and electrifies the audience. Van Morrison and Bruce Springsteen have been wildly successful at showing us the multifacetedness of their songs by doing just that. Unfortunately, the Crows take aim at doing it and end up with an endless, tiring bore. They can be a searing live band, but here the seriousness and earnestness bog the entire thing down, as the Crows destroy the likes of \\"Mr. Jones\\" and \\"Anna Begins\\" by stretching, bending, and remolding them until they break. All things in moderation, it is said. The Counting Crows missed that when they took a ball-peen hammer to their songs and let Adam Duritz run wild with his wounded-lover musings. One day they'll figure out that seriousness and artistry are not always the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment.","review":"I gotta agree with the people who find the songs on the album butchered. AAEA is one of my favorite albums of all time. But it's an absolute CRIME what they've done to these songs on these CD's. Complete WASTE of money. This music isn't beautiful to listen to, it's pure, boring, whining, AGONY. Adam, get off your high horse and stop messing with perfection. We won't think you're a sellout. Honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Athough the crows are indeed a good live band, the recording quality on this CD is still less than admirable. (ie) track 11"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crow lover","review":"What a cd! The Crows have surely outdone themselves on this one. Sure Duritz's voice can become annoying sometimes but most of the time it is as sweet as sugar. The Cd contains a version of Round Here that makes me want to cry, Raining in Baltimore with a soothing piano and Have you seen me lately that will leave you depressed but in love with the song. If you truly like the counting crows this is for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your cd player NEEDS this cd!","review":"This is by far the best CD that the Counting Crows have delivered. Two live cds, one acoustic and somber, the other uplifting energetic. I love to hear live music because the amount of the emotion that the artist puts into makes it more special... the Counting Crows have captured this incredibly. I definatly listen to the acoustic cd at least every other day. If you like, love, or want to discover the Counting Crows, this is the best cd to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt Rockers","review":"I listened to Counting Crows way back when their debut album was released, but it was only in recent years that I've gone back and rediscovered what a great band they really are. I don't think they get nearly enough praise for their albums, all of which are good or great. This 2 CD live set explores both their acoustic/partially unplugged side and their more electric performances. Further proof of what a vital and dynamic band they are. No duds on this set, but I would have also liked some \\"surprise\\" covers or something more than the obvious favorites. Nevertheless, you can't fault what's on here. I was tempted to give this only 4 stars but this is just too good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all Crows fans!","review":"Across a Wire provides creative interpretations of all the CC songs that people have grown to love. The Storyteller's CD allows the songs to take on a more mellow, acoustic, and relaxing feel. The Hammerstein Ballroom CD is reflective of Counting Crows performances during the Recovering the Satellites tour. I recognized many of the added/altered lyrics from the shows I attended. In essence, Across the Wire is a sampling of Counting Crows creative, fresh, and dynamic stage performances. This CD is definitely a gem!:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"The 3 previous reviews have nailed it. These are two really boring, annoying discs. The melodies are all changed and awful to listen to. I'd give it one and a half stars if I could, just because I still like Adam's voice...just not with these depressing versions of the songs I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic and Electric shows...","review":"This is a double live CD from 1997.

This is interesting for a light read, and I learned a few things domestic horse behavior.But most topics were glossed over and not answered with any depth, and the book was sprinkled with misnomers and subjective answers. For instance, the author says that a horse works better with a trainer because owners are afraid of their horses, and that many people will tell you to flip a rearing horse over--never heard of that! There are also questions such as why horses hate riding on trailers, and hate getting on trailers. Most horses, of course, don't have problems with horse trailers. These sorts of projections made me question the validity of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BOOK!","review":"Tried to buy it new at several book stores and then went to AMAZONand got it very affordably!

It focuses on the physical examination, and on the symptomatology.The second part contains a summary of basic clinical facts about the diseases which you can read in any standard textbook. In addition, there're many important subjects which are not covered properly in this section (e.g. dermatology).This book is not intended to be a complete textbook, and I think it should be supplemented by further reading.

The zipper has always been difficult to get started and so I usually ignore it and just close the hook-and-loop fasteners unless it is windy out. Yet despite this limited use, the zipper has now started to come open below the raised pull tab, just as most cheap plastic zippers do eventually. (No, it is not because it fits too tightly. It is actually quite loose on me.) For this price, I expected a decent, heavy-duty zipper. Perhaps they could afford that if they left off all their embroidered company logos.... Also, the top of the zipper comes to the top of the collar, and when closed pokes into the bottom of my chin, which is very annoying.In addition, you must be very careful not to brush against anything sharp, such as broken branches or barbed wire, as the outer material tears VERY easily.I gave it two stars instead of one because it is warm, and the sleeves are actually long enough for my long arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE MY COAT!","review":"I am into nice things.

The story here relates to Nazi Germany's cruiser war - the use of its surface ships as commerce raiders against Allied shipping and convoys in the Atlantic, particularly. Well written and easy to read, Reeman's fiction can perhaps be faulted for complicating his well-described naval actions with somewhat less well etched character development among members of his supporting cast (as compared to his much better presented leading characters).

Planet Terror is like a flaky irritating push on all action films that have been made. It tries to be clever but then even Scary Movie tried.Overall, a 5/10Bruce Willis has no role, Naveen Andrews is after testicles in the film (!) and the storyline is just a sham.

I went into watching this expecting to hate it, but I really ended up loving it.The special effect's and zombie's in this movie are great looking. It does not go 10min. without making your TV cry out for windshield wiper's with all the blood spraying everwhere.

This movie was hilarious. I can imagine it being played back-to-back with two other horror movies, and exploitation movies in the wee hours of the night. This was unusually well made in it's acting and effects and story. This uses the actual, original, intermission clips. There is non stop action that never lets up for a second. Plus, it includes faux movie previews that are awesome. This is a movie you either get or you don't. Yes there is gratuitous violence, but I think most people would realize that if they read what the movie is about before they watch it.This movie is a tribute to girl power movies like \\"Faster Pussycat, Kill!

To make it worse, the makeup makes Dr Who look like Star Wars: dreadful.

The movie itself was a decent flick. Lots of big name stars who didnt really seem to gel with the type of movie. Fergie? come on. Dont look for the meaning of life in this film. Just action, gore, and a few laughs. I was bored during the middle of the film but the end was pretty over the top. They say on the back cover one of the most memorable screen heroines ever.

Rose McGowan alone makes this movie as she is one of the sexiest looking stars in movies.

I was really looking forward to buying it on DVD, but I will NOT buy it like this. It's not that I didn't enjoy each movie independently, but a large part of what I enjoyed so much in the theater was the \\"double feature\\" experience of back to back movies, and the trailers between them.

This is one of those movies where you will laugh and cringe at the same time. Acting is intentionally overdone; so, it's actually good acting! The picture is ok; but, has been edited to make it look faded, scrathed-up and older. That's because it's paying tribute to the Grindhouse films of old. Sound is great; but, a little too good for a grindhouse film. The only thing about the blu-ray is, that I wish they would drop the scratch-free version; and, add the theatrical cut in whole.

So, the story presented in the film had to be rewritten in order to make a 26 episode series possible, as well as to make it possible for the franchise to continue.

Unless you have 5 full range speakers, rendition of bass can be problematic. I recently read in some of the home theater magazines about stand alone base management systems at a reasonable price. I purchased one and have to say it does make a real difference in getting good bass from the typical home theater satellite speaker setup when listening to DVD-Audio (early versions of players didn't have bass management). With this recording, bass from each of the 5 speakers was directed to the subwoofer so the absence of the LFE or .1 channel was not missed too much. I still got decent bass from this DVD-Audio recording. To blow your friends away with DVD-Audio, I would still recommend Blue Man Group DVD-Audio, first song on disc.

Why can't there ever be a romance novel with a heroine that doesn't trip over herself or realizes that maybe, just maybe, she's just not too bad looking? No matter how much time Adler may have claimed to spend in Italy, her notion of a place where nothing changing, life is better when it's simpler, and every Tuscan town is full of interesting and intriguing Italian stereotypes is sorely mislabeled. Time to take a few more trips to Italy...or hire a better researcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but distracting mistakes","review":"As in other books, Ms. Adler really needs to do some research. It is hugely distracting to just begin a novel and hear such mistakes as a fully trained physician being called a resident. Over and over we are beat about the head about Gemma being poor. Excuse me, but why? A fully trained, experienced emergency room physician should be able to comfortably support her daughter and herself. I almost turned the CD off many times because this was so annoying. Gemma herself was a bit annoying, to tell you the truth. A bit too much martyrdom for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Summer in Tuscany","review":"I was reading along, wondering when I was going to get to the part about living and coping in Tuscany.

I blushed with the strong felt love between the 'afraid to love' Gemma & the handsome, loving Ben Raphael and his persistence not to let her go.

The \\"white\\" part of my dominoes are of a varying color, there is paint smear on many of them that can't be scrubbed off with an abrasive even.

The first one had some of the paint that is used to fill the dots, fall out. It makes me wonder if any others are going to do the same. The second domino had a scrape in the back of it. I tried to use some rubbing compound to get the scrape out; however the rubbing compound sank into some cracks that I could not see or feel.

Upon opening it, we were unpleasantly surprised to find that many pieces had paint smears, chips, and/or unidentifiable and unremovable grime on the sides and back. At least 8 pieces were easily markable when turned over, which is way too big of a temptation for the cheaters among us.

The dots are not the same size for all numbers. Many of the topsides (white) of the tiles are like they are stained---not nice and crisp white.When you go to stand the tiles on edge after you have drawn them, some don't like to stand that way and upon close examination I found that the edges are not always flat or square with the rest of the tile.

The plastic cover for the peg compartment is very difficult to move. Even the card deck is slightly smaller than usual, but that doesn't really bother me since we have plenty of card decks. It is the shoddy construction of the board itself that is a disappointment. It was inexpensive, but it isn't worth anywhere near the price. It is more like something that you would find at one of the dollar or less stores.Cribbage itself is an excellent game, and a board makes a convenient way to keep track, but if you are looking at cribbage boards, you probably already know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable set","review":"I have had this set for several years and have not had some of the problems of the other reviewer. I admit the cards are flimsy though and I replaced them after a short time. My husband and I play at least once a week. The third track is handy during the holidays because my father-in-law plays both of us. All-in-all not a bad set. I like the tin the board folds up into for storage. I looked at one recently for a friend and the same set now comes in just a cardboard sleeve, no tin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great colaboration","review":"This is a colaboration of Concerto Moon guitarist and Saber Tiger vocalists. Bothe Concerto Moon and Saber Tiger are great bands on their own. For CM check out Rain Forest and for ST get Project One(actually has Ron Keel on vocals). I like this singer better on this cd than I do with ST. He's not fantastic but gets the job done here. Kind of rough Bonett/Dio mix. The guitar playing is top notch. Not as neo-classical as CM, more straight forward 80's style metal. It's all sung in English(like ST, but not CM) and the lyrics aren't that bad. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, but not the best book on nursing","review":"I have used this book for three months, since the birth of my daughter, and it does have useful information.

Why the heck are they allowing this toxic (albeit in varying degrees) for cooking purposes?!2. It's not solid stainless steel.3. The edges are kind of jagged and rough.

Instead of feeling encouraged I felt so heavy and burdened down. It was one huge list of do do do do ..... she gave so many \\"do's\\" but not a lot of constructive \\"how to\\" and very little focus on how God's grace will help the christian wife to live for Christ and be a witness.

There are some filler scenery scenes, some of which where noticeably shot with a different camera in another location. No bad language, no sex, no nudity, and no piranha.

Do we take life for granted, what are we doing with our lives and what meaning and perspective do we draw from taking chances. The books gives us an introduction and a window into the stakes and price of gambling, what affects ordinary people lives and the devastations that present themselves.

This book ranks as one of my favorite non-fictional stories because it is very captivating and it is a huge inspiration, showing that even ordinary people can achieve great things if they set their minds to it.

He's the kind of guy your mother would want you to bring home. Clean cut and well behaved, he is a role model for all teenagers.

I was interested in mountaineering, but after I read this book I knew that I was going to climb Mount Everest. This book touched me and I read it over and over.

He falls behind in school and perhaps never catches up even though he is bright. The only reason he even got to publish this book is because he happened to be on the same expedition to Everest as the leaders who died and were memorialized by John Krakauer and Imax.

It was not really about the Titanic at all. Most of the movie concentrates on the research submarine that will go down and explore. The narrator seems more interested in waxing poetically about the tragedy and the sunset than giving us real information. There is no footage of the boat whatsoever except about 10 seconds of shadows when they first figure out where the boat is.

I bought the John Gardner novels in order to finish my collection, I would never buy them in order to get enjoyment out of them! Mr Gardner cannot even begin to fill the shoes of Ian Flemming. His stories are too far fetched, his twists and plots are so over the top they are confusing and the pace of all the books I have read, is as slow as hell!

Well . . . that was true untill I picked up Julia Whitty's short story collection, A Tortoise for the Queen of Tonga. What caught my eye was the title (being a tortoise lover all my life) but what captured my intrest and kept me reading was Whitty's unusual weave of people, animals and beautifully rendered scenes of exotic places. Whether viewing ice age art in a French cave with The Story of the Deep Dark or under the Antartic ice cap with Jimmy Under Water, I was so completely involved with the stories that I didn't want them to end. These ten stories with Whitty's unique outlook on life and nature have captured my heart and introduced me to fantastic short story writing.

Also, it's rather bulky so if your USB ports are close together, the other ports may be partiality covered and not usable.I plug mine into the USB port in the back of my Wii, it's a lot cheaper than an actual remote charger and a lot harder to loose than a normal battery charger. ~'4 of 5 cause the lights don't go off and it may prevent use of other USB ports.I recommend it for everyone, even if you don't normally use a lot of batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amy Beach","review":"This recording just didn't do it for me, I found it lacking emotion and focus.

The Mary Celeste was a ship found adrift in the Atlantic in the 1870s, with nobody aboard and no sign of a struggle or bad weather. Since that time the mystery of her crew's fate has puzzled and intrigued writers and historians. Hicks lays out all the known facts of the case, while delving into the personal life of the captain and the details of the lawsuit which followed the incident, when the ship was salvaged. He then takes a few amusing detours, recounting the ship's subsequent ill-fated story, the absurd tales that grew up around it, and more plausible early theories of what had happened. In the end, Hicks lays out what he believes occurred, and his case as presented here is certainly the best explanation to date; I do fancy he's solved it. We close with a brief discussion of the Mary Celeste's wreck, which was found recently by divers off Haiti, and this satisfying, well-rounded true tale is complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Story Stretched Out","review":"Brian Hicks does a satisfying job in Ghost Ship in presenting all angles of the mystery surrounding the Mary Celeste and her missing crew. Particularly interesting is the author's examination of the how this true tale of terror morphed into an almost legendary event as various myths began to attach themselves to an historical occurence, starting with a story by Arthur Conan Doyle. The ship's name even changed from Mary Celeste into Marie Celeste in common usage as if in tribute to its own new iconic status. The book, at times, feels a little padded as the author veers into somewhat related spheres (such as the Bermuda Triangle). The author, though, does provide a solution that seems to answer many of the unanswered questions and seems far more reasonable than anything put forward previously. A nice summer beach read as one looks out at the ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story Expands","review":"You cannot help but get caught up in the life of a little town named \\"Fred.\\" As we learn more about a maturing young man, we learn more about a wise and passionate father.

William Burroughs wrote a blurb for this book stating that it draws a map of real places -- which is incredible, because these are some far-out places -- and yet you get the sense that Burroughs was right.

You couldn't wait for the next moment to see what was going to happen next. They had more historical footage than in TWOIA and it was more dramatic. In TWOIA, it was more focused on interviews and was less exciting for someone who isn't a space buff such as myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wonder of it all","review":"This potentially entertaining blue ray DVD is structured in a format that would not play on my Sony Blue Ray Player..

This whole era has been called the \\"McCarthy Era.\\" The question of \\"Who lost China?\\" played a big role in the politics of the early 1950s.Consequently, \\"Stillwell and the American Experience in China is a very important book for a substantive understanding of the events that led to the 1949 Revolution in China...Tuchman's writing keeps the reader's attention to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"I am not certain, but believe this is the cd that has the most excellent song, HANDS UP, that you may have heard from Club Med commercials in the eighties.

The archival photographs are quite nicely reproduced, however, the current photographs are very poor. I enjoy digital photography and was in Hollywood a few weeks ago and visited the same historic scenes from this book. I quite easily found the angle of the original shots found in this book.. why this book showed those same shots but taken from different angles than the original photos is beyond me. The modern photos in this book are also very unflattering, out of focus and even amateur in appearance... not much more than snapshots.The worst thing about this book are the many obvious mistakes in locations and historic details. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your facts Rosemary","review":"Another piece of drivel from the typewriter of Rosemary Lord. Don't let the lovely cover fool you, the interior contains nothing of value. Lord's photos are incredibly poor and badly shot. Of course there's also the unappetizing prerequisite of factual errors which are far too common throughout Lord's work. The provenance of the El Capitan Theater seems to have confused her as has the difference between Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax. This book was made for gullible tourists.

When I listen to his albums it just increases my desire to know Him more and to meditate upon His Word. Thanks Rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"Rich Mullins is truly a man of God.

The songs are so touching and really captures the true Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the Demos!","review":"For believers interested in one of, if not the most moving CCM CD ever recorded, they need to buy and listen to this record. ESPECIALLY the demos. The Jesus final recordings are strong, but the demos are a spiritual magnum opus for Mr. Mullins. It is a tragic loss for us down here and a glorious gain for heaven with his passing, but if it was his time to go, he ended on an absolute artistic high note. The demos are compelling to a degree that goes beyond words. I encourage one and all to purchase this wonderful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wonder....","review":"\\"In my Father's house there are many, many rooms / In my Father's house there are many, many rooms / And I'm going up there now to prepare a place for you / That where I am, there you may also be\\"... from the last track on Rich's CD, and also the most joyful.

I also like, \\"I Will Bless the Lord\\", \\"Do You Know Him\\", \\"Glad To Be Alive\\", and \\"The Invitation\\".

Lt. Todd Ingram and rag-tag bunch of navy and army men escape the horror of the Japanese attack in a small patrol boat with which they hope to make it to Austrailia. With the Japanese air force and navy hot on his tail Ingram must use all of his cunning to evade the Pacific aggressors. But Ingram has another mission as well: serving in a US navy uniform is a Nazi spy that knows the details about the Midway offensive. If this spy warns the Japanese in time what's left of the US Pacific fleet is doomed. The story that follows is a thrilling race between the two men to reach civilization. A lot of fun and a wonderful view of the battle for the Phillipines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great WW2 Historical novel.","review":"Strong story using the history of WW2 in the Pacific as the background.

Mr. Douglas starts off explaining why \\"the roots of bisexuality, its causes, are often evidence of genuine psychological disturbance.\\" Among other things, he believes most of us are nymphomaniacs and unable to commit to lasting relationships. He even goes so far as to describe the character traits of the bisexual male and female, as if we are all virtually the same person.

I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book. Once I opened it I had to finish it. This book takes the reader through so many emotions. Although there are many sad passages and heartbreaking moments, Mr. Floyd eases these painful passages by incorporating Martin's memories of happier times in the storyline. The author, Nikita Floyd's strength in storytelling lies in his intricate weaving of the story's facts with poetic and Biblical similies and methaphors. The plot is intriguing and sad at the same time as it was uplifting at other times. This is an excellent debut novel and I am glad Mr. Floyd found his voice and an audience willing to listen. I look forward to his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a great drama with a twist.","review":"This book was great from beginning to end.

Unfortunately, the writing and the sci-fi angle are both child-like. The author is narcissistic, self-righteous and judgmental.

For computers, at least, strategy guides are usually limited to black and white textbooks with hand-drawn game maps.But not Prima's Official Daikatana Strategy Guide. This is a beautiful, full-color, slick-paged gem packed with more information and extras than you would will get from any other strat guide. You can only compare this book with a strat guide for a console game such as Metal Gear Solid or Final Fantasy VIII.There are over a thousand screenshots for the walkthroughs, excellent top-down 3D game maps, designer tips on each episode and level, multiplayer tips and strategic info, instructions on how to use the Daikatana map editor, a centerfold poster of Stevie Case, the author, and a Daikatana Comic Book by Top Cow Productions in the back.

While Bob Beauchemin certainly seems to know quite a bit about databases and ADO.Net I found that his writing style made it hard for me to learn as much as I had hoped I would. He tends to just state facts (useful as they may be) without giving proper context. He never seems to explain why something is the way it is.

Basically, he is using channelling to detect reversals of up and down trends. Half of the book uses his method to analyze the Dow Jones Industrial Average for a ten year period.

We were astounded by the parallels between her thought process and ours. Over and over, we read of the exact same thoughts, worries and conversations that we had.This is a great book for the parents of premature or otherwise complicated babies. Reading this, you'll see that what you're feeling is normal; that your thoughts and your worries are shared by others.

I am delighted that Denis encouraged Ann to write and look forward to more of her books.Ann writes not only with humor but also with honesty, clarity and tenderness. To have a premature child in a foreign country and be stuck there for five months (vitrually alone and broke) coping with the uncertainties of life or death, is enough to throw the hardiest woman into the depths of depression. To be able to tell this story with such humor and love is a gift.I want all of my friends and family to read this book.

If she's going to write about this, however, I shouldn't feel any more guilty to say I didn't like how it was told if she's all right with using it as material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Because the author's sons were burned in a playhouse fire, I was intrigued by her personal story and wanted to see how that would play out in this fictional account of a burn victim. I was disappointed by this book that I found confusing and difficult to understand. Since the story is told from an 8 year old burn victim's perspective, the storytelling is limited. I was longing for more detail that an 8 year old would not have the maturity or knowledge to explain. I almost wish Lee Merrill Byrd told the story from a mother's perspective. There certainly are disturbing images throughout the book that are difficult to stomach, most notably the way Riley's mother treats him. However, I found myself struggling to get through this book. With short chapters and big margins, it should have been a page turner, yet I finished the book with more questions than answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book...","review":"but was confused by the run-on thoughts and ideas. Most of the AA characters are portrayed in a negative light, which only distracted from the story. Riley's Fire needed a talented editor to make it shine. The ending left me with many questions, and wishing this had been a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and wonderful","review":"Despite the sad subject and setting of this book, I felt uplifted by young Riley's spirit and his acceptance of his life and the people in it. I loved his little-boyness; for me, Byrd's Riley is one of the best drawn child characters since the children in To Kill A Mockingbird. Others characters were interesting or disturbing; I'd surely love to see a sequel to Riley's Fire. The ending was a bit too much of a surprise for me, but a surprise, nonetheless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful plant","review":"I ordered the last plant that was in stock at that time and thought it might not be in good shape but it was a beautiful green plant about a foot tall with a lot of greenery. It planted easily and has taken well to the Arizona weather. I bought it late in the season but expect it to do really well as it has already grown 7 inches in two months. My neighbor planted hydrandeas from another source and they didn't do well at all. I heard on the DIY Network that this was a very hardy form of the plant so I decided I wanted one."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book!","review":"my children are 20, 23, and 25 and I'm still buying this book when they begin new colleges and jobs........and as a gift to \\"first timers\\" of all ages..............i loved it when they were little; and still love it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not receive!!!!","review":"I thought, my how cheap.

A definite must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply tedious","review":"The story starts well but after a chapter or two it deteriorate and the magic is completely lost. I would not bother to read anymore books from the same author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warmth for the heart and soul","review":"This is more than good music. What we have here is a truly rare musical presence: Bob Andrews' warmth, compassion, and depth, both emotional and spiritual, shine through his voice and his lyrics. We are touched and reassured by his humanity and sensitivity, as some of the frozen spots in our hearts start to melt and open up. Though only one of the songs is overtly spiritual--the amazing \\"Holy Ground\\"--this is very real, very inspiring stuff, coming from a place of deep connection. Have it on your shelf for those cold winter nights of the body and soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor, quality true to price.","review":"The text of the book is accurate. Various symbols, including hebrew letters, are rendered as latin characters, at times with no discernible connexion to its intended meaning. There is no linked TOC, paragraphs & spacing throughout the book is awkward or missing entirely, occasionally leading to a wall of text spanning several pages. All of A.E. Waite's footnotes & all illustrations have been omitted in toto.The omission of a great deal of content makes this an unacceptable surrogate for a physical edition. There are other digital editions available free of charge, notably a PDF on Hermetic.com, that are of superb quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good transfer to the Kindle","review":"This transfer to the Kindle looks good. If you liked this book, I recommend this version on the Kindle. It's great to add to any occult Kindle list. Even if you already own the physical book, this is awesome in Kindle's ability to keyword search it and do real time comparisons with other occult works."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sound great but...","review":"They smell HORRIBLE! I bought a bag of these, expecting them to smell like chicken but instead I got a huge whiff of some gross chemical smell. I didn't even give them to my dogs because I felt like the smell was just too wrong. Call me crazy but \\"natural\\" dog treats shouldn't smell like chemicals at all. Plus, what the heck are all of the chemical names at the end of the ingredients list? Doesn't sound very natural to me.I think I'll be sticking with Natural Pups since their treats actually smell like the flavors they're supposed to be and they're way healthier."},{"rating":"1","title":"all the dogs refused them.","review":"We have two dogs and they did not like these treats at all. We tried all the dogs in the neighborhood and out of 14 dogs o.ly two dogs liked the treats.

The only issue I have with them and this may not apply to you, but my dog (medium sized, 25lb) does not chew these - he swallows them whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Training Treat","review":"Perfect size for training. Easy to break in half (or smaller) for smaller dogs and toy breeds. Haven't found any dogs yet who have turned them down. I appreciate the quality of the ingredients. It's not easy to find good treats which don't require refrigeration. These are small and soft and perfect for class. They have enough smell/taste appeal to compete with other normal training class environment. I've purchased these in a number of flavors for use in classes and with my own dogs. I recommend them to my students because of the quality and convenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dog Loves them","review":"I use these as a training treat when walking, and my dog loves all the flavors.

Our three month old Shi Tzu loves them. He favors the chicken over the peanut butter slightly, but won't turn either away.

Easy to chew, they beg for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good option for training","review":"The price on Amazon is great - much lower than my local pet store. I like these treats because they're small and perfect for training. These are the only small soft treats I've been able to find that are reasonably priced and all natural. My only complaint is that they get hard pretty quickly. Keep the bag sealed and/or consider splitting it into smaller sealed containers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats, Salmon","review":"Excellent little treats about the size of the tip of your little finger. I even cut them in half for my Italian greyhound so I can give him \\"more.\\" He can \\"count,\\" but doesn't recognize quantity. He's very sensitive to certain ingredients, especially corn, and Zuke's treats don't make him ill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Papillon loves them!","review":"These treats are relatively healthy when compared to the competition. They could be better by excluding grains and salt but they are treats after all. These are made in the USA which is a big bonus and they do not contain ethoxyquin which is a harmful preservative found in many dog foods and treats. I usually split these treats into 2 pieces, which is easily done just by squishing the 2 ends together. This makes my puppy feel like he's getting more treats."},{"rating":"1","title":"he loves them... but he gets the runs :(","review":"My 55pound pitt mix has been able to eat nearly anything till now.

I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zukes Peanut Butter Mini Treats","review":"This product is my dog's absolute favorite when it comes to dog treats. I find them perfect for training... and so does she!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful treats!","review":"I thought that these treats might be a little too small for my basset hound mix, but she loves them! They smell ridiculously strong which is a good thing since my dog knows she's getting a treat whenever I open the bag. I'm planning to try all the other flavors from this company! I tried them with a 3 mo beagle puppy and an adult German shepherd and they adored these too so I know they're great for all sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best dog treats ever","review":"My black lab will do ANYTHING for the peanut butter treats.

But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats. My mini dachshund turned her nose up at the treats, over and over. Even with nothing else to eat in the home, she actually preferred gnawing on her deer antler over the Zuke's.i'm not saying that these treats are bad at all---but it may be a waste of money for overindulged dogs with \\"caviar tastes\\" that have been spoiled by their owners (especially small companion dogs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size ,ingredients , and quality","review":"I have been using Zuke's treats for years now. We probably use 1.5lbs per month with the large amount of training we do, perfect size for training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my toy fox terrier","review":"These treats are great training treats for my 12 lb toy fox terrier. I even normally cut them in half. she loves them! I mainly get the chicken and PB flavors. the salmon one seems to have too strong a scent to it that I don't care for. They arent' messy or crumbly, and since my dog loves soft chewy treats, they are pefect for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"gave my dog the runs","review":"the ingredients and reviews for these treats seem great, but they gave my dog the runs. (peanut butter) Every dog is different, I guess. These treats are also not grain free, if that's important to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Treats","review":"These are by far the favorite treats of our two dogs and a treat of which they never tire. We keep them in a cannister by the dining room slider so there always handy for a good dog who came when called or allowed me to dry her wet feet.We like that the treats are small and soft also. These make great training treats for one can easily carry a handful in your pocket.As a dog enthusiast who's bought many kinds of treats, I highly recommend Zuke's treats, especially the salmon mini naturals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for training!","review":"These treats are excellent for training. My dogs love the (safe) peanut butter flavor. They come running when they hear the pouch open! A tad pricey, but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dogs like them, but they STINK!","review":"We got the salmon and the peanut butter flavors for our puppies, and they go crazy for them. They were really hard to potty train, but these were small and healthy enough that we were able to give them to our dogs every time they pottied outside. They worked great for that, and our dogs finally got the message! But they really don't smell appetizing, and even one of the salmon ones will make their breath smell terrible for a whole day!I'm giving it 4 stars for that reason. If your dogs like them as much as ours do, I think it's well worth the stinky breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"We call it doggie crack.","review":"I think the title explains it. We cut it into quarters and use it for rewarding our puppy while we train it. Took us 24 hours to teach a 8 week puppy to use the outdoor for relieving itself.

I'm working on clicker training with my dog, and these were just the right size to keep her interested without filling her up on treats. She loved them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves them","review":"My golden loves these treats. I use them a lot for positive reinforcement and training purposes. As they're really small they work great for this purpose, so you don't have to \\"over treat\\" and it always leaves the dog wanting more (not full). He likes the Chicken flavor better then the peanut butter I think, but it can be difficult to tell, because if he's hungry a shoe is probably just as appetizing. Just guessing from how excited he gets some of the time.Anyways, for an natural dog treat that is healthy and well priced - you cannot go wrong! Definitely recommend.

If you are having trouble with your dog heeling or following you around the house, just keep a few of these in your pocket and she'll follow you everywhere!

When I took her to the vet, she was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea... and she had to stay at the vet for three days. Over $1,000 in vet bills later, I gave Zuke's hq a call to let them know. While symphathetic, basically Zuke's gave me a $15 check to cover the cost of the bone, but failed to take responsibility for the incident, even though the vet wrote a note saying the bone was the most likely cause.

I can't say how the treats would do for a very fussy dog.It never crumbles in your pocket but splits easily for giving small training rewards. It's tiny enough to use a bunch without filling up your dog. It has good ingredients. It doesn't mess with the puppy's digestion.The only possible drawback is that it's smelly. Not gross, just smells like fish. They love the treats and I'm sure the odor has something to do with it, but they also can smell it on you, so you can't surprise them with a treat.Overall, the go-to treat for training, rewarding, and stuffing in toys to prevent separation anxiety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog doesn't like them","review":"My maltipoo is pretty picky with food and treats and she absolutely hates these treats.

They sometimes will play with them for a minute but will not eat them and are not the least bit excited about them. They even lost interest in the sound of the treat jar that normally gets them very excited. These treats feel and look more like a wad of gelatin than chicken and have been relegated to the trash bin. They would be a little on the expensive side if they actually were mostly chicken but they are way overpriced for sort of chicken gel wads.While almost everything \\"tastes like chicken\\" these treats don't, as evidenced by the fact that our chicken-loving dogs do not like them one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy Maltese hate salmon flavor","review":"I was training my maltese puppies, using chicken liver treats, every time i would throw the ball, they would bring he ball back for a chicken liver treat.

The problem is that even in a sealed bag inside a separate sealed ziplock, the smell of these treats is unbearable. We tried keeping them in the car, but the car would retain the horrible smell for days. We eventually ending up keeping them in a sealed container in the back yard until the bag was gone. If you touch them with your fingers, your hand will smell of them until you can wash your hands. Disappointing as they are a perfect size for training, but I will not buy them again. I wish they would make a similar treat without the odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made My Dog Sick","review":"I've fed Zuke's treats for awhile (3+ years) but the last two bags gave my dogs horrible upset stomach.

Heck, she eats more produce than most people do. So we bought the duck jerky and peanut butter bits. She won't touch either one. Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over."},{"rating":"2","title":"mini treats","review":"I like that these are small.

After signing up for a puppy class and him learning some things, I am making sure to reward him when he listens and obeys commands. After a while you realize that your choice of treats becomes very important to keep him happy and healty. I saw this had high reviews here so I decided to give them a show. He really likes them! They are nice and small so he can easily chew and swallow them, and the bag is huge! I am used to buying the Blue Buffalo treats so this seems to be a bit more bang for the buck :) The only \\"con\\" is that they really are smelly (chicken flavor). Not sure about the other flavors but they smell like a bottle of vitamins."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Great Dane LOVES them!","review":"I'm click-training our male great dane, and he can easily lose his appetite when he feels stress or anxious (...which can make him difficult to keep his focus when doing click training).

I want to get them to listen to me so I work with them using these as training treats. the dogs don't care that they are tiny- every treat is like a steak dinner to them when it is given with praise. These treats are also good because other dogs will often hang around looking for a handout and if their owners say it is okay I am fine giving them away one at a time- they are bigger than tic tacs but smaller than a life saver and there seem to be a zillion in every bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dogs Love These Treats!","review":"My dogs love these treats and give me that head snapping approval when I give them to them.

Luckily we found Zuke's right away! There is no beef, wheat, or corn in them. With their small size (about the size of a pencil eraser) and moist texture, they are the best for training and reinforcing good behavior. We've tried the chicken, peanut butter, and salmon flavors, and the salmon are definitely her favorite. Next up - I think I'll get the rabbit flavor for her to try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy doggy dots","review":"I didn't realize when i bought these that they were going to be so small, so as a treat for anything larger than a yorkie you might have to use a small handful of these. Great for my dog outside of the size because they are grain free and have no fillers which my dog is allergic to. They must taste good because the dog cant wait to get a treat after he walk outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Training Treats!","review":"The treats are absolutely fantastic for training. The smell of the treat is enticing to my dog and helps to get her motivated! They are small and easily consumed which is handy during training.

One of my favorite dog consumables by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sheltie absolutely loves Zukes","review":"My dog goes crazy for Zukes mini naturals.

Zukes is now the only treats that I give my dog and he just loves them, highly recommend Zukes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size for training","review":"My dog loves these and they're my training treats of choice. I've only tried the chicken flavor.They're semi-moist, not messy, and pretty small. They're not scored, but can still be halved or quartered with a sharp knife or a long fingernail. Each piece has 3 calories. For med-small dogs, you can cut them down into really tiny bits and still make a dog happy. If you quarter them, you could give 20 rewards during training and only be adding 15 calories.The bag has a reclosable seal, and you'll need it because they dry out and get hard and crumbly if left exposed. If I take some with me away from the house, I put precut treats in a snack-sized zip bag to keep them fresh.They also come in a larger sized bag which is more economical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quality Dog Snack","review":"Using Zuke's mini snack for my 6 1/2 month Siberian Husky has been fantastic. Before starting her on Obedience classes I was required to find something she really went for. I guess it was the trainer's way of making her training easier for her. This natural product has been amazing! It's chewy and savory and just right for my picky dog/pup. Except my pup prefers the beef flavor but thankfully she is now becoming a well-behaved dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great training treats!","review":"My dog loves these! I've only tried the salmon and peanut butter, I held off on the chicken due to other reviews saying it smells bad. I prefer the peanut butter by far, the salmon is a bit stinky.

The Magic Pill conbines Teri Holtzclaw's Primer with many of her useful messages. I find that the her method of providing short-read's, some call it brochure-like,to make sense. I think the author knew what she was doing when she called her books \\"companions\\" and not \\"novels.\\" Since my sugery, I can only digest small qauntities of food at a time.

The main problem with this book is that it is so riddled with spelling, gramatical and punctuation errors, that it is impossible to read without becoming irritated. Did she not have an editor? Didn't anyone bother to actually read through the manuscript before sending it off to a printer? Also, there is not enough substance here for a book in the first place and the author ends up saying the same things over and over again to fill up the pages.

It encompasses the glimmering significance of every musical genre, becoming itself purely genreless. With the combination of a sexy trumpet dancing casually and sometimes forcefully in the foreground, an elegant violin, a femininly shaped bass,and a defeated romantic guitar player, this arrangement of ballads and blistering harmonics is a must for any jazz, folk, blues, rockabilly, or classical enthusiast. Imagine sashaying through a ballroom lit with blue, cupping a golden glass of champagne, meeting the intoxicating charismas of cowboys, and slow dancing with Django Reinhardt and you will still have no idea of the fantastical world that these songs will send your mind and body to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say spellcheck???","review":"I thought that the storyline was ok but there were too many typos and incorrect usage of words as such as the spelling of \\"weak\\" when they meant \\"week\\".

I've seen \\"The Fan\\" several times since it came out and I've never been disappointed. James Garner as her former husband does a fine job too.

I found it to be an interesting character study of an obsessed fan, played by Michael Biehn. He was a new actor at the time and a total unknown, which helped in this role. He went to star in \\"The Terminator\\" and has had a decent career. The other co-star....well, you might have heard of her: Lauren Bacall.I read a lot of criticism of Bacall for this role, and think it is totally unjustified. She was just fine, thank you, playing a believable character: a veteran actress being stalked by some deranged killer.With Maureen Stapleton, James Garner, Hector Elizondo, some great cinematography with wonderful close-up shots and a good score, what's not to like?

Michael Biehn poorly tries to channel Travis Bickle in his account of a psychotic star worshipper. Fortunately he had a career after appearing in this swill.

Most I did with it was jog and go to work. It's ben a waste of money. First of all, the ten year battery doesn't actually last ten, or even five, years. Secondly, if the battery did in fact last ten years, wouldn't you expect the watch to last at lest half as long? There's a lot of fine print you ned to read.

The majority of this whopping 38-minute film is a re-enactment of Hearst's childhood told in a style appropriate for kindergartners. After 20 minutes, we adults awaken from our slumber to see actors playing Hearst and Julia Morgan pantomiming discussion about the castle while the insipid voice-over drones on. The final few minutes of this turkey re-enact a weekend at San Simeon in the most irritating way possible.

If only the director could've restrained his \\"these films influenced me\\" excesses, I'd have given this 5 stars.

The insanity level of every character, except for the victim, in this film creates a world that is unbelievable.

But it all goes down hill (from a horror movie standpoint) when the entire town is revealed to be raving lunatics during the bar scene. The movie became about being weird for the sake of being weird and lost any footing in reality. Yes, I know, men can do crazy and horrific things as a group. The Nazis come to mind. But this film did not succeed in selling the reality of a group gone mad. That several men would all psychotically believe a bloodied man, in a dress, to be their same lost female lover is ridiculous. The dance sequence IS hilarious though.

Okay maybe the word 'disturbing' evokes an undeniable visceral response. This might not have gotten to you, but there's no denying that it is unpleasant. Nasty.I did not like the movie. At all. Except for the guys dancing in the bar, that scene (starting with the piano) was good enough for a Miike movie.And this doesn't compare to Haute Tension.1. They have nothing in common except violence.2. Haute Tension actually had some action/movement.3. A girl masturbating is not an equivalent cinematic experience as pig raping.4. Haute Tension was superb (aside from some stringent issues I have with the way that the last scene was shot).If you want a dirty movie in pretty woods that is about gender-confused inbreds and don't mind ZERO antagonistic action from the victim, then this is the movie for you.And it is in French!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"Ordeal\\" was....","review":"I gotta admit, I'm completely flummoxed by some of the great reviews for this film.

He might not be macho, but he sure doesn't look like a \\"Gloria\\" to me. Nice atmospheric touches, a squealing pig, and a cute calf couldn't save this \\"homage\\" to '70s horror films for me.

The first two tracks on the cd alone was the main reason why i bought this cd. I just like the fact that if you buy the single you get the song you either hear on the radio or in the club. Unlike when you buy a cd which may have the song you want but it only plays 15 seconds of the song. Again this is a must have item!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Stories","review":"The Young Ones is a very interesting but a sobering read. These individual experiences truly make you realize the sacrifices our airmen made during WWII. Surely, in most cases, to remember and relay those harrowing days was difficult for the veteran. I feel much gratitude toward these men for their service to our country and also for having their stories recorded for history.The impact the years in the service had on these men is evident by the details they were able to recall and describe. The recording of these experiences was made many years after WWII.This truly is a classic collection of some very brave and courageous young Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Stories!","review":"As with Erik Dyreborg's previous book,The Lucky Ones,The Young Ones focuses on the experiences of U.S. airmen during World War II. In most cases the detailed accounts are told by the airmen themselves; others have been submitted by family members, committed to seeing these stories shared. Each chapter contains a different account. Some are extremely painful to read. They relay horrific events far beyond my comprehension (occasionally \\"haunting\\" the individuals involved for years). Many accounts include positive, and even humorous perspectives, adding an often appreciated and refreshing balance. In all cases, they are sensitively written accounts that increase my respect for and appreciation toward all who serve in our Armed Forces. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the complexities of war, intrigued by human behavior amidst adversity, and inspired by the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Young Ones- a must buy!","review":"I finished reading the Young Ones last week and it was time very well spent. The book details the missions of the brave young men who fought and died in the airwar over Europe. All the stories have a very personal touch since the author contacted living airmen from WW2 to interview.Sadly we are losing the Young Ones at an alarming rate each year. Soon the achievements of this greatest generation and their sacrifices (which made America the greatest country in the world) will only live on in memories and books such as this one.Even if you are not a history buff this book details personal accounts and thus makes it a book of human experiences. The book had me feeling emotions of joy, sadness, excitement and humor. There are many rare, one of a kind personal photos from the era. It is is suitable for teenagers to old folks. It should be required reading in High School. Thank you Amazon for offering this book at a great price! You will not be disappointed in The Young Ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected....","review":"Setting up the bar was easy anf fast.We had it up in 15 mins.However the design of the bar is flawed in the sense that the bar can topple easily since it does not have any base.Also considerign we have carpet floors ,it is very wobbly.If only it had a base this would have taken care of the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"This was thoroughly disappointing.

Deftly synthesizing from a broad range of materials--literary, cultural, historical, anthropological--Mullen chooses a digestibly specific focus on Chicago's cultural renaissance, a period he convincingly establishes as crucially significant to an understanding of African American literature in the twentieth century. My only quibble with the book--and it's a minor one--is that at times it assumes a more complete knowledge of the political landscape of the time than an average reader might have. Some more background on the history of the CPUSA and the Popular Front in general might have helped. Still, a fine study, one that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide to help you through lifes ruff spots","review":"This book was an excellent guide for me when my husband came out of the closet.

But here I am just over a year later and the thing doesn't work. Can't even blend a banana in a cup of milk. At the time of purchase, I spent nearly $300 and opted to not get a used Vita-Mix because it wouldn't fit under my kitchen cupboard and didn't look nice on the countertop.

But at age four the game became boring quickly. I would make that your guideline: if your child likes Candyland, your child will like Hiss. If your child is moving on to more complicated games, your child may be too old for Hiss.As a side note, Hiss may be a good game to play when friends come over.

My favourite moment is in the first book (I believe?) when Tohru explains how everyone has an onigiri on their back with a different flavor of umiboshi in the middle. (Or something like that.) Anyway, she uses it as a brilliant metaphor for different people possessing their own special abilities and personalities.

It tells of a very modest girl and her need to belong. However, the lack of a strong support and structure have made this become an okay book.

I bought the second and third manga and maybe it could just be because I tend to like mangas with a little more action and the fact that I'm not much of a romantic...But I just. Didn't.

I prefer manga drawn like Hot Gimmick, W Juliet, or B.B. Explosion. So anyway I checked out the first volume from my local library and instantly fell in love with it. Tohru is an unrealistic optimistic character but loveable. I wonder if she is in love with either Kyo or Yuki sometimes but how could she possibly chose? Both are so nice!

As a gay man living in Atlanta I may be at a disadvantage however, for I found this book to be nothing more that a tour of the city through a pretentious gay man's eyes. Others who do not live here may find it charming. If there were some depth to the characters possibly I wouldn't have put this one down.If you're looking for a winner try Louis Bayard's \\"Fool's Errand\\". Or look up Jim Grimsley, a fellow Atlantan who writes about the city in a much more interesting way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read","review":"Sticky Kisses is one of the best books I've read in a long time.

I read this book quickly and compulsively and didn't want it to end!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I bought this book because I loved Johnson's \\"Pegan Babies\\" from a few years ago. \\"Sticky Kisses\\" however is a major disappointment. It had such potenital to be a great book, and there are plenty of scenes that are quite wonderful. But the story never quite comes together and the ending doesn't wrap up anything.

This CD has the range of several music genres. It has a Hip-Hop feel with tracks like Believer and Heaven, Swing style with Biggest, Greatest Thing, blues and traditional gospel with Yesterday.If you haven't been blessed by the sounds of Mary Mary's latest CD, please, do yourself a favor and pick it up.

I am glad that they were put on this Earth. The way they give the word of God through song is unbelieveable. But they give the word of God through sond in a totally different manner. They do it in such a Moving way. I know that track #3 Heaven, that song samples from a song called Want Ads by The Honey Cones. Trust me, it sounds just like that song too. I thank God that Mary Mary was put on this earth. My favorite tracks are Love you that Much, Heaven, Believer, Biggest Greatest thing, and The Real Party. But all the tracks are wonderful too. I rate this album 5 stars and even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm A Believer","review":"These truly annointed women of God have done it once again! After two amazing albums \\"Thankful\\" and \\"Incredible\\", \\"Mary Mary\\" is a fabulous addition to their stellar career.

Singing better than ever as well as great production- mostly Warryn \\"Baby Dubb\\" Campbell (Erica's husband) God has really blessed them. When you are feeling down or have lost your way spiritually, put in \\"Mary Mary\\" and you are sure to find a song to minister to you.

Well, if you are expecting the same kinds of songs that you heard from the first 2, you might be disappointed. You'll find hints of big band, disco, blues and more. It sounds NOTHING like the previous albums. Don't get me wrong, I'll give it a 10 for creativity and it's nice that they've branched out and tried something different. It's just not what I was expecting. If you like the song \\"Heaven\\", don't be fooled because it's the only song that has that Mary Mary style and sound.

Normally when an artist explores different styles of music on the same project it creates a more effective and creative approach to music, this is GARBAGE. I am so glad I didn't buy this cd because I would be fuming I mean as a music major I'm disgusted! There is no real musicianship on this album and someone need explain there is a line between secular and gospel and this album HAS CROSSED IT.

I was very happy they came out with a really good album this time. I didn't buy the last one, cause there wasn't a song on that one that made me want to buy it, but it was nice though. But this album I had to get. It's a great contemporary gospel album. It came out right on time, cause the contemporary gospel music has been kind of dry so far this year.

I BELIEVE THIS CD IS A BLESSING TO THE BODY OF CHRIST AND TO NON BELIEVERS ALSO. THE ANNOINTING IS ALL OVER IT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.

They have done it again for the third time! Their music is excellent, It specifies Christ, and it is just what a christian would want to listen to. With their music, they can minister to the unsaved and win souls to Christ. Their music is more than a melody, the beats and the instruments to the music are heart-warming, and their voices knocks me out. I never have and never will get tired of Mary Mary's music. They inspire me to truly grow in the Lord, and listening to their music makes me excited because I can't wait to get into the music business because I want to sing of God's mercy, grace, and love. I love to praise him. But now, I give Mary Mary 2 thumbs up and I engourage them to keep at it, keep on praising God, and that I will see them when I get there and when god comes back to meet us in the air.

Home-cooked food is better than store-bought any day of the week. The good: it won't pick up odors, you can bring two kinds of things to eat, you can throw it in the dishwasher, and I suspect you could even cook in it in a pinch. The bad: it's clearly not microwave-safe (only non-metallic glass really is), the handle on the top lid rusted a bit, neither the top nor the bottom units are spill-proof, and unless you put them in an insulated sack, your lunch is going to get cold. Still, it's oodles better than using plastic, and despite the surface rust, I expect it to last a good long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a book insurance companies wish was not in print!

Though I'm a big fan of his funk quartet it's a shame that this line of thought wasn't continued. He himself said that there was nowhere else to go with this music and perhaps he's right. However, Sextant stands as a powerful milestone in the post \\"Bitch's Brew\\" world. Innovative in just about every respect; instrumentation, composition, use of synthesizers and incredible solos from Herbie and Eddie Henderson et al. Though this is unquestionably avant-garde the earthy (and unearthly) grooves makes it accessible to anyone with an open ear and mind. Though recorded in the early seventies this music is still fresh and futuristic. A wonderful artistic highpoint for Herbie Hancock in a career not lacking in creative highpoints. My highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great synth grooves","review":"This album contains few melodies and lots of synthesizer blips and swooshes. If you're a fan of something like Miles Davis' On The Corner you might enjoy this, since it's basically a series of grooves, with a little horn melody here and there. And if you like the sounds of analog synthesizers, you'll be in heaven with this recording. Great ARP sounds from Dr. Patrick Gleeson make this a very spacy, out-there recording, and the synth programming on Rain Dance was probably very state of the art at the time it was recorded. This is definitely not easy listening, and those thinking, \\"hmm...I need a jazz record to study or relax to,\\" this is not the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Far Out Trip!","review":"Sextant is a wonderful sonic voyage. Herbie pioneered music on this album that is just begininng to blossom today. He was thirty years ahead of his time. The music is visual, rich, and imaginative. This album very well may have sown the seeds for techno, electronica, and ambienent. However, the music here is better than most anything I've heard from those genres. Travel back in time to the 70's in order to take a voyage to the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great record, but for fans of the period","review":"There are easier places to break into Hancock's hardcore electric fusion period - and fusion in general - than this record. usually when someone refers to fusion, they're refering to a mix of jazz with some other more popular form of music: funk, rock, etc. This record is part of the Electronic Fusion/Jazz gang, and conversely will likely yield a better time for fans of ambient music or Autechre/Brian Eno/early Kraftwerk than, say, Weather Report.The album is hardcore 70s Herbie, pre-Headhunters, which is where most people come onboard with him outside of his Miles Davis gigs and \\"Rock It\\". It's not for the faint of heart, and not even the one from this period you should start with. Try \\"ManChild\\" or \\"Mwandishi\\" before you hit this one. You'll appreciate its depth more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a computer game","review":"Did nothing for me.

However, he stretches the page count with example after example. You get the point after the 3rd example, but there are five more examples after that! The Darwin analogy works most of the time, but again Ries stretches the concept. For example, he uses clock radios as a failure of convergence. In order for clock radios to be successful, every clock should have a radio, according to Ries. I'm sure he has spent many nights in hotels during his travels, but he seems to have failed to notice that every hotel room - and every bedroom in America, I wager - has a clock radio on the nightstand. Yet, Ries knows his stuff when it comes to branding, and anyone who is in marketing should pay attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which way to go?","review":"I believe that this kind of book is for those who want to open their mind to another kind of Marketing thinking.In this book we can see the other side of the coin, because all the big companies are thinking in convergence, like Apple, and Divergence is a concept that will arise in the following years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darwinian Branding?","review":"Ries and Ries pulled it off...again. While I'll admit to being a member of the Al Ries fan club, I wasn't sure what to expect from this volume because I didn't think the pair could carry the evolutionary analogy-the tree of life-through the whole book. But I was pleasantly surprised. Like other Ries and Ries work, I spend a lot of time nodding my head in silent agreement and muttering, \\"How can corporate America be so blind?\\" While they're not always correct (some of their speculations fall flat in the light of history) and I recognized many of the examples and principles from previous works, The Origin of Brands was a pleasurable read that added to my body of knowledge on the subject of brands and branding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The only real use I could see for it is to give it to someone in your company who is all gung-ho on convergence or is afraid to tackle creating a new product category. There are many, many, many examples in the book, heavily weighted in areas of technology, communication, etc. and after a while you want to scream, HEY I GOT THE POINT ALREADY! If you're looking for useful advice and guidance, try any one of Ries' other books, which rank among the best on differentiation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like its namesake, has a few holes","review":"If you can get past some flawed Darwinian thinking, this book makes some excellent points that will change the way your run your business and invest your money. The father/daughter team of Al & Laura Ries are the first to talk about divergence being where the money is, albeit not as glamerous as the press related to convergence products. As a small business owner, I found this book helpful in planning my own strategy even at a regional level. Like Darwin's theories, this book also has some gaping, unexplainable holes in its theories. Al & Laura give many examples to support their work, but conveniently forget about businesses that buck the very trends they discuss. Nothing is as black and white as the Ries' make it. Read the book, take it with the proverbial grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN OUTRAGEOUS RIP-OFF!","review":"This item is really a waste of money. For 20 or 30 dollars you get a vocabulary of at most 100 words. Want to learn some more? Then you must shell out another 20 or 30 for the \\"intermediate\\" one, and so on. As Amazon discreetly omits any description of the product on its web site, I got the impression it was a language course, because it said \\"beginning level\\". But it turns out that it's more like a phrasebook. There's no grammar, no explanations, just a bunch of phrases and words to learn. This is by no stretch of the imagination \\"learning\\" a language. The most insidious thing about it is that they could have crammed all the 3 levels onto one CD, but that would have damaged their profits.

I highly recommend it for the age group of 6 years old and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great documentation","review":"I bought the book based on the coverphoto. Regarding that I in fact wanted a book on New York, I cannot say I regret it. The book is fully illustrated with beautiful photographs of New Yorks five boroughs. Though I\`ve been to New York five times before I\`ve only been to Manhattan and Queens, but I surely was tempted to see all five boroughs when I go back during fall -99. The photographs has a soul in a way and all represent a motion or a mood that I catched right away. I could actually feel the smells the sounds and the dynamic pulse New York stands for. Pete Hamill's text as an introduction to each borough gives the reader a fully good and poetic insight in New Yorks majestic soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY WILL RISE AGAIN!!","review":"I bought this book back in 1999. I am a New Yorker and I wanted a book that showcased all of my wonderful city. I never, in my wildest dreams, thought that I would have to look at this book in order to ever see the World Trade Center again. After the attack on New York City on Sept.11, 2001, my whole world as I knew it changed forever. This wonderful, beautiful book is my only reminder of the New York City that I have known and loved all my life. I know the Twin Towers will rise again!

When I saw this video, I assumed it was an interesting documentary about the finding of the Titanic. It, however, is almost not about the Titanic at all. First it compares the size of the titanic to footage of current ships. Then it goes into extreme detail about the robotic camera, the cable it will use, and how it works. We see footage of many days at sea with no results. The narrator seems to think it is an opportunity to showcase his acting skills as he rambles about the sunset, and other things. After 46 minutes of boring video, the last minute shows finding the titanic and you see 60 seconds of the same shot over and over - which has no detail at all - part of the rudder. We were gravely disappointed and only wish we could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor engineering makes it difficult to appreciate; some gems","review":"The sound quality is weedy and thin, making it hard to judge the individual performances...some beautiful tenor work from Adrian Brand, and the duets with Brand and soprano Helene Obadia, and those with Obadia and alto Madeleine Jalbert are heart-lifting.

We tried out this game with my Girl Scout Troop - Girls between Kindergarten through 2nd grade, and a few Jr. High school girls. Even though some of the girls are younger than the recommended age, they had a blast telling stories about their lives, and liked to add just enough \\"lies\\" to make the stories fun. They truly loved the game, and couldn't wait until it was available. This is a great game to play with your children. I had a lot of fun listening to the girls' experiences, and we laughed a whole lot together during the game.I'm also a foster parent, and this is an EXCELLENT way to learn about new children in the home in a non-threatening, non-interrogating, and fun way.This would be a great way for your children (or grandchildren) to learn about your life as a youngster, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan and Scan Hell","review":"This was a scope movie, with a theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1.

Then I discover that Artisan have released it in fullscreen and not even in the proper title. Jeez, was I upset and deeply crestfallen.This is an outrageous action movie that very deserved a better release than it got. The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack may be better than the VHS but the musical score (awesome) sounds terrible and even \\"chewed up\\" in places. The fullscreen picture is even grainy and has too much color shimmer.All us fans can do is hope that the ever falling retail price of this DVD means is that Artisan is planning to do a proper widescreen release sometime in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOTTOM OF THE BARREL TREATMENT FOR TOP DRAWER MOVIE","review":"I honestly don't know what Artisan were thinking by releasing this in pan and scan with terrible Dolby 2.0 sound that desperately needs remastering. The cropped 1.33:1 picture is grainy and has quite a lot of speckles and dirt thru-out. This really is Dolph's best movie and Segal makes for a seriously cool villain but with this pathetic treatment by Artisan all the cool gun battles and car chases and explosions are just as rubbish as they were on VHS. Pick it up if the price temps but don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrecked movie!","review":"Why oh why is this in pan and scan only. This is a 2.35:1 framed movie and the well balanced and well composed cinematography is completely ruined on this DVD. About half the movie is missing. I love Joshua Tree but I won't buy this DVD. Artisan must understand this simply won't do. Sadly, the only widescreen version out there is the Japanese Laserdisc. And that's LONG out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was a little skeptical at first about buying a used DVD but i figured you can't go wrong with the price.

UGH!This film is supposed to be in 2.35:1 but instead Artisan, for some reason, released it in a mutilated 1.33:1. This is not right. The directors vision of the film is the one that should be respected and seen by everyone. I advise you to wait for a more definative release of Joshua Tree (not Army of One). Joshua Tree is the REAL title.I really do hope that Artisan change their minds about this DVD and release a better version soon. Widescreen is the most important feature of ANY DVD released. But it is not present here so save your cash for a future release."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Lundgren's better movies","review":"I thought this was a good entertaining movie.

It had a different (and better) ending than the DVD. The action is seriously cool and proffesionally handled by BAFTA award-winning stunt co-ordinator Vic Armstrong. Joel Goldsmiths musical score will put you right into the emotion of the story and Dolph is remarkably stoic as Wellman Anthony Santee-the hero. George Segal turns in a good performance and Kristen Alfonso is a babe.But Artisans DVD is terrible. No widescreen (the AR of Joshua Tree is 2.35:1) and very bad Dolby 2.0 sound. The DVD is not even digital. Instead it is directly mastered from the VHS tape and is of the same quality. A single trailer is the only extra and it even advertises the film by its actual title. Not this Army of One nonsense.Anyways, this is a cool movie and I suggest you check it out sometime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lundgren a One Man Army????????","review":"Another spectacle from action star Dolph Lundgren who was made famous for his legendary fight with Sly Stallone in Rocky IV.

You're a detective and you're assigned a mission by the Chief (from the TV show). Something valuable has been stolen by one of Carmen Sandiego's crooks!

It truly is nothing more than a regurgitation of a good newspaper's \\"Year in Review\\" section for each of the years covered. It simply lists one event after another. There is no attempt to analyze or put in perspective events, nor is there even a shred of a story thread to carry the reader.I haven't read the first two volumes in this series, but I can't imagine them being as bad as this one, else the author would never have received a contract to do this book.

Inconsistent in places, dead wrong in others, practically no synthesis.

They are really heavy, so not very easy to use as occasional tables that you bring out when you need an extra table. As a permanent table that stays in the same place they would be fine. But for me, the nesting idea was the appealing part - I planned on putting them in a corner and bringing out a table when we had extra guests. These were way to heavy and awkward for that.The finish didn't look anything like the picture. That was the most disappointing part - they were really \\"distressed\\" and looked pretty rough and beat up. Not at all a nice looking walnut finish. I guess for the price I should have expected it. I won't bother to send them back, since shipping was more than the price of the tables. Overall, very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winsome Wood Nesting Tables","review":"We love the tables. They are a great size for our living room. Much easier to move when we need to than our old coffee table. Would have given them a 5 star rating, but the finish is a little rough, but nothing that can't be lived with. When we received the tables the middle table had a crack in the wood. Contacted store we bought it from, they bent over backwards to do whatever they could to make things right. They didn't have any in stock, so they contacted Winsome Wood and they had a replacement top, which we just got today. I'm impressed with Best Service Stores and Winsome Wood. Top notch people to buy from. Oh, and the tables are REALLY built strong. I'd purchase them to give as a present, they are really great."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what we were looking for","review":"The tables were easy to put together by 1 person and are solidly made. Easy to move around (not too heavy at all for 1 normal-sized person to shift), they perfectly serve the purpose for bringing out at informal occasions (a Thanksgiving get-together in our case). Agree with previous reviews that the finish is at times a little rough/distressed, particularly on the table tops, but really not a major drawback. Good, solid nesting stables!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Service was EXCELLENT","review":"Wish I could tell you about the gain, sound quality, ease of use etc. Unfortunately, I can't because mine was DOA.

My local audio store -- not a big box -- could have sold me a $120 NAD phono preamp if the backup and disinterested \\"sales\\" rep cared at all about helping me. So I prowled around the Web, did a bit of research and found recommendations on reputable sites for the ART DJ Pre II Phono Preamp. This handy little device seems to provide enough oomph, and it does so at half the price of the NAD product. I wish there was an on/off switch for the ART preamp because the light stays on constantly, but at this point, that's my only complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"new to vinyl","review":"Right now I have it hooked up to my Techniques SL-1800mk2 and a Grado Black cartridge I think it sounds excellent considering the receiver I have it connected to.

I wish someone would recommend to me a good quality 2 channel receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save the Phono","review":"I bought this ART DJ Pre II Phono Preamp after looking at some much more expensive options. The need arose when I replaced my old Kenwood receiver with a new Yamaha RX-V467 receiver so that I could use an iPod dock. Unfortunately, the Yamaha, like most current receivers, does not have a phono input. I used the ART DJ to interface between my turntable and my new receiver and within minutes, it was up and running with the same terrific sound I used to get with my Kenwood. Some of the reviewers complain about the blue light on the ART DJ; it doesn't bother me, but if it did, I would just keep the unit unplugged until I needed to use it. It doesn't come with any connectors, so you'll need to supply the connections between your receiver and the ART DJ. Overall, I think this is a terrific product at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid build, works great","review":"I'm only using this pre amp for a turntable in my home stereo, but the first thing I noticed was the solid metal case. Looks like this thing is built like a tank. Sound is great, and the level adjustment DEFINITELY makes this worth looking at over other pre amps. I could dial in the exact level I needed to work with my other components' levels.The only negative I can think of is the bright LED (I assume it's an LED) that is always on, unless the amp is unplugged. It might be bothersome if you're using this in low lighting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as it is supposed to","review":"I bought this unit to connect my old turntable to a newer receiver. Looking forward to convert the old vinyl to digital.Would have given item 5 stars, except the lights on the panel are so bright, it actually hurts my eyes.

Their other albums have even more samples by Richard Smallwood [Total Praise], Kurt Carr [For Every Mountain]... the list can go on.

TBT is still doing what it does best. That is giving us messages from the heart that inspire us to press on and not to grow weary of doing good. Put God first and then everything else will fall into line. The TBT choir does not \\"perform\\" but rather, it ministers to those who need to be encouraged during these days of trials and tribulations. On this album you will find sweet ballads and soul stirring anthems to lift your spirit. I never lost my praise is the track that comes to mind. It speaks of giving God the praise even in the dark times because He always comes through for you. It encourages you to not let the world steal your joy and rob you of the praises that you should offer up daily.

Moser makes you care about these people, and she drives home the Biblical truth of the very real struggle between good and evil.

More revisionist history from one of those unbiased producers at 60 Minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist Claptrap","review":"If you're looking for a book that fully and impartially chronicles the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan, look elsewhere. \\"Charlie Wilson's War\\" is nothing more than an attempt by a liberal journalist to concoct some positive role in America's Cold War victory for the Democratic Party. The author scracely mentions Ronald Reagan's name at all and each use of the word \\"conservative\\" is preceded by \\"ultra\\", \\"arch\\" or \\"extreme.\\" There is a whole chapter devoted to \\"Right Wing Crazies.\\" Afghanistan seems to have defeated the Soviets despite the Reagan administration who just coincidentally happened to occupy the White House at the time of the Soviet collapse. Sure. Maybe 10 years from now this guy will author a book about how the War on Terrorism was actually won by Tom Daschle and Ted Kennedy despite the meddling of George W.

Even though the focus is on Charlie Wilson and how and why he effects change--more than that in a macro sense it shows how world politics is really carried out and allows one rare glimpses of just who the puppet masters are. A real eye opener of who uses who and offers up evidence that the \\"winners\\" may not be those that superficially win. Outstanding read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, excrutiatingly detailed","review":"This book was really interesting at first, but I couldn't keep reading beyond a few hundred pages. The author keeps saying the same things over and over and over again (I got it, Charlie Wilson was tall and good looking, Gust was working class, etc.) He restates the same things so many times, it seems like he things readers are stupid and can't remember anything from prior chapters.At first, I enjoyed learning about the inner workings of the CIA and the House of Representatives, etc. But this book is so tedious, I can't summon the attention span to finish reading it.I almost always read a book before seeing the related movie because I like to read the more detailed story. In this case I am hoping the movie does a much better job of just telling the story without all of the extra noise and redundancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile tone overshadows interesting story.","review":"The gee-whiz, Boys Own Stories tone of the writing made this a very difficult book to get through. It's too bad because the author has clearly done a tremendous amount of research, and the story itself is almost to bizarre to be true. But after the umpteenth description of this tall, square-jawed Texas congressman I wanted to fwow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edutainment - lacks balance","review":"The problem with this book is that it lacks balance and appeals to people who love tall tales. These kind of stories are rife in any business that is covert, especially the arms trafficking business.Lots of flash but the Iran Contra scandal is juicier--everybody knows the US aided the mujadadeen--so what?But an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Hubris; Full of Errors","review":"This is a great story, but Crile is not a great writer, or even a good one.

I took him as the prototype for the president in my second novel, \\"The Sixth Battle,\\" but still learned far more in Mr. Crile's book than I knew before. Moreover, it's a highly entertaining as well as informative volume: the extent of Crile's work is evident in the scope and detail of the text, to say nothing of the huge cast of characters he interviewed. I would happily rate this book at five stars except for the author's obsessive reliance on definite articles. \\"This\\" and \\"these\\" are vastly over-used on nearly every page (6 times on pg 301 alone), referring to subjects that usually are obvious but sometimes are not. Frankly, Crile's otherwise excellent manuscript deserved better editing. Otherwise, \\"Good-Time Charlie\\" is a subject worthy of a movie, complete with a colorful, flawed hero; back-channel contacts; politics; sex; guns; and an ending that defines \\"unintended consequences.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the movie","review":"A riveting account of one of the most intriguing and peculiar chapters in Cold War history.For anyone who liked the movie, the book is a MUST for its additional details and anecdotes it contains.FOR EXAMPLE: The account (in Chapter 24) of how Gust Avrakotos handled the kerfuffle that erupted over the sexual liberties that the Afghan Mujaheddin took with the Tennessee mules the United States gave them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Entirely Objective but Very Informative and Entertaining","review":"It's true that there are some areas where the author is not entirely objective, the main characters are revealed to have flaws, but many of the other characters are viewed in fairly one dimensional terms, and there are important omissions. Zia Ul Haq deserves a bit more investigation as to who is right, is he a hero or a ruthless dictator? In fairness Crile does leave it ambiguous with the understanding that there are views both ways, but given how central this figure is to Wilson and the war, it feels like we should know a bit more. That being said, its such a phenomenal look inside the workings of the congress and appropriations comittees and CIA, and the fact that it was so massively entertaining, I can't help but give it 4.5 stars (rounded to 5 for Amazon).BTW, it's not listed elsewhere but the unabridged CD is 17 discs long and about 20 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting...just like a spy movie, but it's real.","review":"A round of applause for this author for his research. A lot of these things that happenned I thought only happened in movies. I enjoyed the audio book, because the narrarator was exceptionally good. Anyone who is interested in Afghanistan I think must read this book as they will understand the country's politics more. Why four stars and not five? The final 2 discs were a bit long, but that should not be taken away from the rest of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie Wilson's War","review":"Everyone should read this book. Shocking, sub-cultures everywhere, when 'revenge' is honored, 'peace' is never. Book could have been written in 300 pages, instead of 500. Finding truth is forever difficult. So much for an open society and so much for rules and laws. Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Missing Link to our current war","review":"This novel reads as fiction but definitely isn't. It shows the dire mistakes made by our leaders. With incredible luck Charlie Wilson came out a hero to government and clandstine groups, but could have easily begun WW3. The American people would surely have ended his follies if they would have been aware. His private war gave him his victory but supplied all the weaponry and knowledge required to now kill and main our troops fighting a holy war against near wild animals.To maintain our super power standing we must turn to intellect with our elected officials. Wild men and shoot'um up cowboys make good story lines but as history shows they will hurt our country. As this story shows they have before and they will again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Kept My Interests","review":"Unreliable story of the CIA involvement in the Afghan War. Lots of insight of the secret in and out of our clandestine service. Interesting read but at the same time lots of grandstanding by the author toward the subject of the book which sometime seem a bit hard to believe. Recommended reading for anyone who is a history buff and would like to expand his/her detailed knowledge of the downfall of Communism and the last military action of the cold war. Don't bother to compare the movie; like most of the time, is the book according to Hollywood re writers.

It is the story of a journey - a journey made by Lavinia Byrne from her middle class Catholic family background, a journey that took her into the confines of a convent and ultimately to a clash with the Vatican. Byrne's crime? To talk openly about the ordination of women to the priesthood in the Catholic Church. The Vatican ordered the American publishers of her book on women priests to pulp it. The Congregation for Religious put enormous pressure on Byrne's own religious order to stop her talking about the issue. Ultimately she was forced out of religious life.

A few useful ideas (some lifted from other sources without attribution) combined with a lot of tips you could pick up from any number of less expensive and self-righteous books. The separation of ethics into two separate areas -business and personal - reminds me of the mentality of the old clipper ship captains that felt it was OK to pillage and rape while they were in the South Pacific; as long as they attended church and were good to their families when they were home.

On page 69 the author writes that the Japanese Army had no tank divisions where in fact they had 4. the 2nd tank division fought in the Philippines in 1945 and was wiped out there.

What happened to the action-adventure thrillers, the medical thrillers, the political thrillers, the romantic thrillers? There's at least a dozen thriller subgenres, but you wouldn't know it from this book. From a book about Thriller, I would have expected more than a discourse on crime fiction.And why are so few women writers even mentioned?

As is the trend in most recent comedies, \\"Deuce Bigalow\\" is rife with childish potty humor that one would expect to find only in the schoolyards of middle school preteens. In place of wit, and unique humor, we now are expected to laugh at situations that are in whole simply gross and disgusting.

Yes, it's crass, crude, stupid and whatever but it's generally likable and a funny movie in many spots.Rob Schneider does a fine job playing this amiable loser. Several scenes are just laugh-out-loud funny. The female interest, Arija Bareikis, is not someone I was familiar with but I liked her wholesome looks. William Forsythe plays the villain and, of course, he's over-the-top. The film had a nice soundtrack, a lot of familiar rock tunes.As with most modern comedies, this gets carried and a little stupid at the end but, overall the film is good low-grade fun (and I mean \\"low grade!\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Teens will like this humor, but I'm past this crap!

When movies start getting to fart jokes, that's when I turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scraping the bottom of the barrel...","review":"Rob Schneider is just plain annoying. I've never thought he was funny and never will. So, to say that I liked Deuce Bigalow would be more than an anomaly. This movie just plain stinks. The funniest parts, which are few and far between, you've already seen in the commercials. Eddie Griffin is the only funny character in Deuce Bigalow playing Deuce's pimp. Deuce is a fish tank cleaner who accidentally breaks a $6,000 dollar tank while fish sitting a gigolo's house. Needless to say Deuce takes to Man-Hoen' like a fish to water (sorry...). The movie centers around his motley crew of dates like the narcoleptic, the giant and the rather rotund African-American woman. The story is weak and so are the jokes. Rob Schneider is best in cameo role's like the Waterboy \\"You can DO IT\\" or in Big Daddy as the delivery man. But at 90 minutes this film felt like 3 hours, it's just too much Schneider to go around.

I happened to see it at a friend's house for free and I feel ripped off because of the time I spent seeing it. That is how bad it is. The first \\"joke\\" is: Deuce gets off the bus with a dripping pail in his hand. The old lady that follows him slips on the stairs.

It's one of the funniest things I have EVER seen. The plot is simple. A fish tank cleaner, Deuce, (Rob Schneider) is hired to clean the fish pond of a wealthy gigolo, Antoine (Oded Fehr, The Mummy). But Deuce notices that a very rare fish in the fish tank in the house is very sick, so Antoine asks Deuce to stay in his house for a couple of weeks while he's away on business and take car of his ill fish.

On the plus side it introduces Gambit's wife Belladona and sets the stage for a lot of the mutant Cajun's future development.

I've never been a teen girl before, but I have known and know a few and I can't imagine them being like this girl.The whole doubting God part of the diary felt too shallow. Essentially all she does is exchange her parents church for a more lively version with a cute youth pastor. Would have been nice for her to have walked away from religion and faith completely. That would be more real and dramatic. I could only shake my head at the statement \\"I thought all Christians believed...\\" Really? Even a teen should be able to realize that there are myriads of beliefs out there.Didn't like it at all, then again I'm not the target reader. I'll let the girls read it and see what they have to say about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book!","review":"This book is a must read for any teenage girl.

Another major point in this book is her decision to keep her virginity until marriage. She struggles with how to tell people, and I ask \\"WHY?\\" (????) It's not a big deal.

Its a catching story for teens that deserves an encore (and it has one!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenage Drama","review":"Becoming Me is a diary written by an average teenage girl, Caitlin O'Conner. She writes about all of the trials and problems she runs into in high school. She starts hanging out with the popular crowd, only leading her into trouble. She starts getting into situations with her family, friends, and boyfriend that she doesn't know how to handle. She desperately searches for God for the answers. She later finds that God will help anyone who lets Him.This book is an excellent portrait of a teenage girl's life. It includes many difficulties like popularity, drinking, faith, friendships, and boys. I loved this book and would give it five stars. It was so realistic and showed how a normal teenage girl handles the problems that life throws at her. I would recommend this book to any girl from ages thirteen to eighteen. Also, I would recommend it to anyone who has questions about how God can complete their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Book, even though it started slow","review":"I thought that the book was really good once interesting things started to happen.

Richard and songwriter/producer Peter Wolf (he worked with Fleetwood Mac among many others)have collaborated to create a wonderful blend of pop, rock and gospel with an R&B thread to tie it all together.

When I received this DVD/CD combo as a gift I was so excited because I'd never seen her perform live before. But my excitement soon disappeared as I watched the DVD. Talk about unprofessional editing! In the same song they hop from concert to concert, so you don't get a consistant performance. To make matters worse, the sound quality is so bad during some of the concert shots that you can barely hear Alanis, much less the music. Certain points are muted and distorted.I am really upset that Alanis allowed this type of \\"quality\\" to be put out for her fans. I would expect better from a multiplatinum artist.

Feast on Scraps switches from her live performances to home videos. It includes \\"Uninvited\\" which is one of my favorites. She is a great performer and very funny. I never thought she would be so funny because most of her songs are angry. I was very surprised. If you're a fan of hers than you should get this dvd. If you're not a fan than borrow it from someone and maybe you'll become one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"I've seen much of the parts of this DVD already on the feast on scraps website.

Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy won't leave you cold","review":"This is a Action Figure of Han Solo as he appeared on the ice planet of Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back. The figure includes a removable face mask, a sensor pack, a blaster (that fits in the holster on his leg) and Luke Skywalker's lightsaber (which he used to slice open his tauntaun). The figure also has a button on the back that when pressed, make the figure's waist turn to simulate a lightsaber sslash. This figure is a whole lot of fun to play with. The detailing an likeness is incredible. I highly suggest you also but the Hoth figure 4 pack to complement this figure. The only downside is that the blaster is kinda small and does not fit in his hand very well. However that is a minor detail, and no Star Wars collector should pass up this figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but Needs to Be Seen to Be Appreciated","review":"I was lured into buying this album because of how quirky and strangely disturbing the video for \\"Mountain Trip...\\" was. A \\"family\\" singing a vaudevillian-style ditty about public executions in post-WWII Japan is certainly unique and funny, but hearing it on CD just doesn't do it justice. That's pretty much the problem with the rest of the album.Despite the \\"stories\\" within each song being very humorous, the whole package just doesn't work because we're only getting half of the presentation. It's not as much the music as it is the experience and an experience this odd deserves more than a CD job. A DVD companion is a must for this goofy concept album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even without live performance... they're good","review":"Speaking as someone who didn't discover them by seeing the live show, I can say I think the band works in all levels.

This is original, interesting and should be seen as a step outside traditional music, which is very much welcome and appreciated. At least by people who are tired of hearing the same pop crap on the radio.

I don't have any problems steering it and I love how easy it is to open and close.

Like others have said, it steers poorly and is impossible to push with one hand. Bumps are tough on it and so are curbs and tight turns. The cup holder has broken for the second time in one year. The screws come out of the cup holder, the cheap plastic has cracked now it no longer stays in the up position - rather useless indeed. Also, the small plastic piece that is at the end of the recline adjustment straps also fell off and the sun shade barely covers my child's face in the bright sun. But I did purchase it for its lightweightedness and therein lies its only redeeming quality. Too bad, because not only was it expensive, but I purchased it on the Peg reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read customers' reviews first!!","review":"Believe in reviews!! I read about customers' reviews after buying this stroller. I thought about return it because most of the reviews were not so good. I regret I did not upgrade to another one. I hate it! First of all, it's hard to lock the car seat in place. This drives me crazy. Second, it is alright when you go straight. But when you make turns, it just doesn't turn the way you want, especially in small passege way in restaurants or stores.

Again and again this venerable maverick Zen master swings his blow at the very core of Buddhist thinking, while responding to questions and riddles posed by his own followers, as well as by monks visiting his monastery. Most of Master Bassui's teachings are arranged in the usual Q&A form, prevalent in Zen literature, with short, concise and helpful notes by the translator appearing at the end of the book. Although coming to us from a distance of some centuries, the teachings are an enjoyable reading, their message as clear as glass. Put your mind to it and learn from this extraordinary Master!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And, finally, the last word.....","review":"If you ever read Bassui from the beginning, as one of your very first Buddhist writings, and then went on to read all those hundreds of other Buddhist works, I think you'd eventually return to Bassui: he just teaches it simply and without the circus and fanfare.If, on the other hand, you happened upon Bassui after having read all those other hundreds of Buddhist works, then I think you just might find your self thinking \\"why didn't I start with Bassui from the very beginning?\\" If you had an original samadhi, so many years ago, and now your life is one of searching to re-experience that original \\"seeing\\", study Bassui.

In this case, the sea turtle is a loggerhead, but the hazards apply to all species. These hazards include shark attacks, boat and propeller strikes (a boat strike is pictured), and by-catch (being caught in a net is depicted). There is a hint that storms are hazardous for sea turtles in shallow waters; I am unaware of the importance or impact of these events on turtle condition.This is not a \\"Teddy the Happy Turtle\\" type of book, with the turtle talking to his friends in the sea.

Steriods, in case you don't know what I'm talking about.I remember watching Triple H having a small body, and then BOOM he gets big. Wonder why? Ask Hulk Hogan, or Scott Steiner, they both may tell you how Triple REALLY got his physique.I hiss at this book, it's like buying hair products from Cher, even though she's wearing a wig.

It seems like triple h has been having too many burgers and not lifting enough weights.It seems to me, that the only thing bigger then triple h's ever-increasing waistline is his gigantic nose. I think it's wrong for a guy like triple h to write a bodybuilding book since he is so terribly overweight, its like Stevie Wonder writing a book about bird watching.

It's like learning to drive, you don't master driving skills in one sitting, you have to practice enough times before you can get results.

This knowledge was much easier to assimilate and retain than before I used the techniques described in this book.However, the only thing about Scheele and company I like is his photoreading book - not even the 'Natural Brilliance' book.

The mainstream will never understand where he's been, what he's heard or what he's presenting inside embellished rainbows of jazz inflected folk that simply is miles ahead of most artist recording today.Amazingly originative narrations guide the listener through germinal thoughts and abstractions.One heck of an accomplishment by any standards and most assuredly transcending, setting it firmly amoungst the true recorded masterpieces of this century."},{"rating":"1","title":"He must owe money to the clarinet player.","review":"I've heard a couple of Joe Henry's albums and have really liked them, so I was looking forward to this one. It's too bad he gave some the instrumentalists free reign to play whatever out-of-tune junior-high-level improvisation they felt like. Throw out the clarinet player, and it's still a pretty good album. But as is - especially for anyone with an ear for jazz - it's unlistenable at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY OVERRATED","review":"Critics and record store clerks are going gaga over this album, but I just don't hear it. Henry creates layered soundscapes, but rather than reward repeat listens, they aggravate the listener--at least this listener. The more I listen to this album, the less I like it.His lyrics are crafty and clever in places, but they don't provide deep insight. How many times do we have to listen to more-alienated-than-thou singer-songwriters lament the loss of innocence in our corrupt modern world. This would have been edgy stuff in 1991, but today it sounds trite. Henry's delivery makes it worse. I can see him dressed in black smoking clove cigarettes, pretending to be serious but really looking down the sundress of a young suburban acolyte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarities that should have stayed buried.","review":"Long-hidden Morricone that should have remained unknown. Not soundtracks, but saccarine easy listening composed for the Italian pop market in the late 50s and early 60s. Despite Morricone's later achievements, this is totally forgettable elevator music. Sounds like the tapes have been given a digital clean-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nailer Pins","review":"I have the GREX 635 pin nailer so I bought these pins for use in it.

The delay gave me enough time to get thoroughly engrossed in this book, and I could not put it down! I thought this book was extremely funny, and it was a bit of a change of pace from the British wit that characterizes most single women's tales.

I'm sure the author wants this life she has created on paper, and hopefully she'll get it one day. But in the meantime I truly hope she'll just stop asking the reading public to suffer through her fictional wishings.There are many well-written and funny and smart books out there (try \\"It's My F#cking Birthday\\" by Markoe, \\"Her\\" by Zigman, or anything by Eleanor Lipman).

Being in the same position as Emma, dating again after a breakup from a long term relationship I felt insulted. I expected to find a kindred spirit in the character and all I found myself doing was asking, \\"Is this over yet?\\". The book is extremely monotonous and the plot is very dull except for little parts here and there that might redeem it if they weren't so few and in between. The ending was good, the last 50 pages had the most action in them compared to the rest of the book. I just kept reading thinking that something has got to happen but nothing much ever came. I love reading and I almost felt that this book was a waste of my time. But not my money, thankfully I picked it up cheap at a garage sale and now I'm donating it to the library where some other person will be tortured with the boringness of this book.

Emma Carter is a real person with real concerns and we get to watch her develop herself from a woman with insecurities about herself, her career and her relationship with men, into a woman who goes after the career and man she wants. Ultimately, this means that Emma has to first find out who she is before she can figure out what she wants. You'll find some of yourself in her.

Many questions young children ask about Santa such as his age, etc., are magically answered in this must watch tale. I put this movie on for the kids when family came to visit and found even the grandparents sitting down and intrigued by the story.

The writing is so atrocious I don't even know how anyone likes this. The characters are all annoying except for the cat, who's only fun because he's the only character that I don't feel like choking with a fork. Rather, I think he wants to choke everyone in this manga with a fork, which is the reason I like him.When I finished the first volume, I hated it. But I thought maybe it got better. Sometimes it only gets good after a few books. I had up to volume 6 on my to-read list. After this, I'm taking them all off.

Three different writers with the three different views, but yet, President Bush is the same man in each book. He's confident, driven, passionate and smart--yes, you heard me. Dubya is smart. Anyone who has been inside the Bush White House will testify, just as these three writers have, that he's the boss, not Cheney or Rumsfeld or Powell, as the press would have us believe.

To make matters worse, the author goes on to imply that rotating a square 45 degrees will cause it to become a \\"diamond.\\" First, there is no such shape as a diamond in geometry.

I admit, although I love Classical and Rock (and Neoclassical for that matter), I had never heard of him until now, but very glad I did. This is a masterwork of Classical music fused with Rock, Danney has done an amazing job.For those who may think this is similar to Yngwie Malmsteen, it is not; it is a very different kind of work. Malmsteen's songs are influenced by Classical music but they are his own compositions, not the classical songs as this one. Danney does not compose a song of his own, he creates an arrangement for guitar (and drums, bass and piano) for the classical songs and also his style is a lot less flashy than Malmsteen's.I greatly recommend this album for all those who like classical, rock and neoclassical. It is, unfortunately, a very underrated album, an unknown masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Bowl","review":"This bowl has a nice rim so it's easy to toss and serve salad.

They give a good feeling of how strongly their religious beliefs influenced their day to day lives and also a sense of what life was like for the egyptians, although artistic license has been used to make up for lost facts. I like the writing style for the most part, but it did at times become repititive, possibly something has been lost in the translation from French into English. All in all, I haven't enjoyed a series of books like this for years, and it is certainly worth a read, especially if you are interested in this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wunderbar!","review":"I have read it till now, volume five and I can't seem to get enough. The whole story is beautiful.

I ended feeling very depressed because I found the story very sad. I traced the life of someone from birth till death. The death part makes you feel very very uncomfortable.

If you're looking for supernatural frights, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a historical-adventure told with an interesting storytelling method, then you've come to the right book. The reader will be so caught up in the time-traveling ghost story, that they won't realize they've just read a historical fiction - the premise is slavery. This book redeemed my faith in author Avi, solely by the way he chose to begin the book. Although the ending is abrupt and opened-ended, it's a good book for young readers to read over the summer.

The sound quality is everything Shure is cracked up to be - clean, clear, and crisp. The downside comes in the integration of the two functions - the two leads (to MP3 player and cellphone) are inequal in length for some reason, and the junction/switch box between them is pretty huge - it also contains a nigh-useless volume control, which despite being a dial, seems to have only two settings - regular, and extremely quiet.In any case, they work for my needs - but if you're planning to jog with them, or keep your MP3 player more than about 8 inches from your phone, you're out of luck.

Very non-aggresive. Then, as I fell in and out of romantic interludes with a few women, AYMF turned into a soundtrack for my life at the time (ages 19 - 22). There were several opportunities I had to purchase the album, but I did not, until now, here at Amazon.com, I am getting it for a penny, unless they happen to be out of stock. So what if it's used!!! It's a great album. Cadillac, Michigan really turned it over for me. Reminded me of Smashing Pumpkins, from their final album. Beautiful melodies over electronic rock beats...AMAZING!!!

I highly recommend all the Alex sets for crafty preschoolers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different Alex set!!!","review":"This set is sooo disappointing! I love the other Alex kits, specifically the bug set and sea critters lacing set. This one just stinks!First of all, the different animals are not divided into kits, and no instructions are provided. So you get a box of a lot of pieces of random colored paper, tissues, googly eyes, stickers, feathers, pipe cleaners, etc, but no clue on how to use them. You end up with a small child grabbing at everything and making a random critter with a huge mess.The other Alex kits that divide into separate sections are much better for a busy mom. Also, note that once this box is opened, there's no way to organize it all.The stickers in it are like superglue, there's no way to reposition them if the kids stick them to the wrong spot, which is sort of likely for this age, so things just go wrong once you open the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merrill Osmond's Never Say Never Again CD","review":"I really like this CD.

I thought the first two (Requiem and Dark Sister) were very well done. Indigo never quite goes anywhere. It drags like few books I've ever read. The book deals with Jack Chamber's attempts, as executor, to resolve his estranged and eccentric father's unusual will. Interesting story line on the surface, but a dull, boring, aimless and draggy implementation by Mr. Joyce. My sincere recommendation: Be kind to yourself, read something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Letdown","review":"I'm a big fan of Joyce. Tooth Fairy, Dark Sister and Requiem were all unique and engrossing reads, which makes Indigo all the more disappointing. I couldn't empathize with any of the characters and the pseudo-scientific concept of Indigo lost its appeal quickly. Pass on this one and read Tooth Fairy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the guy that wrote Tooth Fairy?","review":"This book was such a dissapointment. I knew it wasn't Joyce's best, but after reading The Tooth Fairy, which was one of the better books I've read in a long time, I thought that his not-best will still be a very good book.Indigo has got a very lame idea and carton-like characters. But it could have still worked, if the writing was worth anything.I have no idea how I survived it and read it through.Stay away - don't let it burn a bad impression of Joyce in your memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book raises a lot of themes and issues and fails to live up to its promise to pull them together into a coherent plot. Mix-mash mush. There is really no excuse why the author couldn't have made better use of intriguing themes except perhaps laziness. I will trust the other reviewers that his other books are better, but I was extremely dissatisfied with the lack of focus and ultimately lack of resolution in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I really don't even know where to begin. When i read the summary of this book, i was so excited because it sounded extremely interested and different from anything i have ever read. Definately different, but in the worst way possible. I didn't understand anything this author was trying to explain about Indigo and becoming invisible. It comes to the last four pages until the answer appears, and it is cliched and nothing what you think it would be. The language is vulgar and sex becomes the most important part of this book. It is explained so grafically, I wanted to put the book away. I really wanted this book to be good, but none of it made sense. I was so bored that i was wishing i was a speed reader so i could finish it as fast as possible. Also, after i read the book, i realized that the author, is the same author as the book dark sister, which i also read and detested. I would never have bought the book in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intresting thought... and that's about it","review":"When I read the back cover of Indigo I thought it sounded amazing. Pretty much the only aspect of the book that stood out was the fact that the main character couldn't keep his mind out of the gutter with thoughts about his half sister. It seemed like every chapter had the same epic struggle with the sexually frusterated monkeys in his head vs. his rationalily that said \\"IT'S YOUR SISTER FOR GOD'S SAKE!\\"I got through half of the book and put it down (something I rarely do.) And I consider myself the most easily entertained peson I know. I'd finish the book but I can get the same sick feeling in my stomach by watching Jerry Springer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue about Indigo","review":"Disappointing. Neither the characters, the plot nor the attempt to combine a supernatural theme with the natural sexual attraction of half siblings worked.The reader was left with the feeling that the \\"invisiblity\\" sought by the book's characters might be their way of disassociating themselves from the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot","review":"Great stuff. I really enjoyed this. Not as good as The Tooth Fairy, but still a hot read, and very profound as Joyce keeps you guessing all the way through. I can't begin to tell you what its about because its one of those books where each part says something about another part. Read this and then The Tooth Fairy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull","review":"Please, I beg you, spare yourself the hours you would spend reading this book and read or do something else. Perhaps this will persuade you: this is one of those books with a vague non-ending. You read and read, then there's this odd little image at the end, which resolves nothing. To top it all off, it's very boring. It's supposed to be about becoming invisible and perhaps the author has resorted to a big pun on the reader in that interesting characters, plot and suspense are all out of sight. This book cannot be representative of this author's work, or I doubt he would be published at all.

The rest of the book is not very good when compared to any of the other advice books that cost half as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a gigantic waste of money","review":"Half the book is a detailed listing of production companies, of which 99 percent don't want your material unless you have an agent. The agent listings are no help either, telling you to contact the agents directly, who in turn don't want to see your material. So the end result is that this book is a gigantic waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was quite underwhelmed by this book","review":"Perhaps if you knew nothing about Hollywood and screenwriting, this book might help you a little. I've taken several classes and written four scripts, and I found all of the information extremely basic and below the level need for someone ready to break into the business. I thought it would be helpful with all the agent listings, but they mostly tell you to contact the agency for submission policies anyway, which is really no help at all, making it an expensive telephone book. I also think the book could have been cut back on some - the \\"war stories\\" are nothing new and really aren't helpful at all. The stuff about LA really belongs in a guidebook and not in a screenwriting book; that just seemed like a lot of padding."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a big disappointment","review":"It's big and thick and looks like it might have a lot of information, until you put it to use and find out it's so cluttered with errors. Many of the people I contacted as a result of this book were miffed, having been listed without consultation. I checked the author's screenwriting credits and found he had none. Perhaps next time he should learn a little more about the profession before he writes a how-to book about it. A big thumbs down from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, the book quickly dated itself","review":"This was a good idea for a book, but it's the sort of thing that quickly dated itself. The agent and manager contacts in this book, you will find, have become saturated -- while they seem interested in reading new material per their profiles in the book, you'll find it's a different story now as they've been inundated. It's sort of like coming into a gold rush six months too late. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree -- this book is next to worthless","review":"I am a story analyst for a major lit agency and, as part of my job, read and evaluate all of the new screenwriting books that come to market. I must say this is just about the worst book for the screenwriter that has come along in quite some time. It totally misrepresents how one needs to go about breaking into the business as a screenwriter. A lot of the suggestions it contains would be, in fact, detrimental for the emerging screenwriter. The author's lack of credits and lack of real-world experience as a screenwriter is woefully obvious in the bad advice that fills this book. Anyone who tries to use it will find it a guide to misfortune. Too many people are writing screenwriting books who have no experience in the trade, and this book is a prime example of that trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"many errors and mistakes that should have been checked first","review":"There are many errors and mistakes in the listings in this book: misspelled names, wrong phone numbers, wrong addresses, people are not at the companies in the listing, etc. The rest of the book is okay, more a pep talk than any real new information."},{"rating":"1","title":"software reviews are good - otherwise the book is very poor","review":"The software reviews are good but you could get that by reading it in the library or a bookstore.

Boy was I wrong. More than half the numbers I called in the book are incorrect (not counting the 213/323 area code change). For the contacts that are right, more than half of those refused to read my material, even though this book said they would. Some people said they were very annoyed at being listed in the book because they felt it misrepresented them severely. A lot of the listings also look helpful until you parse them and find out you have to contact the agents or companies anyway as the author supplies no contact information. I feel really let down by this book. I thought it would be helpful and I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guide book that puts you in touch with Hollywood","review":"A Screenwriter's Bible? You bet it is! Chock full of interviews, addresses, websites and contacts; This is a book every hopeful screenwriter needs. Not only informative, and helpful, Skip shares amusing stories and tips that add insight to how the game is played in Hollywood. This book is a must for the novice writer who needs up to date information on how to get their scripts read. And if you're looking to find an agent, that is covered too.

There was no real connection between characters, no spark of life evident anywhere. I did not care about Ushman and his sad little life. I was most interested in the character of Mrs. Roberts, but she was only peripheral. Most people seem to really like this novel so give it a try, but I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stars for Ushman","review":"What an astonishing read. Where so many books are focused on a woman's struggle, immigrant or otherwise, for love and lost love Mullen's RUG MERCHANT is quite refreshing with Ushman Khan being our main character.

Quite lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of character development dulled the story","review":"The Rug Merchant is not a book that draws the reader in. There are only a handful of characters in the book that have any dialogue exchange at all. The nineteen year old character Stella's dialogue was distractingly contrived in several places. Other than Ushman, the few characters who are in the book are boringly undeveloped and lacking in complexity. Since the characters were so simplified, I was unable to take an interest in them individually and thus had a hard time plodding on to the end of the book (but I did finish it, just to get it over with).The story had potential to be a good read, but I don't think the author was up to the task of turning a decent short story into a compelling novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Near Miss","review":"Take a heart-broken Iranian immigrant, an unfulfilled, wealthy woman of \\"a certain age,\\" and a bright but aimless college student. Mullin's willingness to examine their thoughts and feelings in this character-driven novel is admirable, and at points she succeed quite nicely in conveying the alienation and empathy found within complex relationships. That being said, ultimately a writer's job is to tell a good story. Mullins deserves credit for daring to write about the inner lives of her characters. No proverbial car chases, missing babies or serial killers here. But as this leaves us with only the characters themselves to consider, this book might have benefitted from a slightly less tentative rendering. Mullin invents a great cast but doesn't give them quite enough to \\"say.\\" With a bit more courage and color, this could have been a great book; hopefully this talented author will try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRING","review":"I found this book to be a very slow, boring read.

I am putting this book aside for now because the protagonist had the trash people pick up a $20,000 very special carpet that fate put in his hands. Granted, it becomes a symbolic gesture of a failed marriage. This really offended my sensibilities about these carpets. Any rug merchant who admires the work of all those female fingers with broken backs because of the weaving process, would NOT throw out such a special carpet. He would have known he should use the carpet as a prayer rug to heal his wounds.I will read this another time. I finally acquired my own very special carpet after 40 years of longing.

I will buy two more, one for each of my other granddaughters, to give when they come of age and get their first households.As far as drips go, the same technique that is used for all honey pots is the rule: one must swirl the drizzler stick continually until one reaches one's cup of tea to keep the honey from dripping all over.

Both my girls take ballet and are totally inspired while watching it and often put on their ballet shoes and do the dance steps. The DVD is great because it has an interactive component where you can act with Barbie in different scenes. The documentary of the Ballet School is also a nice component for budding ballerinas to see what it's like to be a real dancer.

Any resemblance of the E.T.A. Hoffman story/Tchaikovski ballet to this DVD is purely coincidental. The ballet musical numbers are chopped up and rearranged and much is left on the cutting room floor. The story goes off into really strange directions that have little to do with the original story - the Mouse King is not that central a character except here. I could see kids enjoying this but I could also see young kids being scared by it. But this is just more money in the pockets of people who own the Barbie copyrights, and if a holiday favorite gets trashed along the way, who cares as long as we turn a profit. Avoid this muddled mess and get a DVD of the real ballet."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE","review":"Bought this video for my toddler granddaughter who loves music and can sit through a ballet on T.V. I was excited about it and could not wait to get it. This is NOT the ballet \\"The Nutcracker\\" which is what it leads you to believe...and is what I thought I was buying. It is a running story with very little music and dance...mostly talk...and not very well done. She did not watch it for a second and truthfully...neither could I. I really don't know who..or what age... it would appeal to...if anyone at all. It should not be advertised in a way that leads you to believe you will be watching a ballet. I tried to return it the very next day to ToysRus and they would not take it back. As it is actually falsely advertised they should have. I am not sure what they had in mind when they made this video but in fact it is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"This movie is unneccesarily frightening. There are whole segments that have nothing to do with the Nutcracker. There is very little dancing and alot of fighting and running away from very scary villans. My daughters were very afraid of the rock monster and the mouse king, they don't want to see it again. I beleive that this movie falls into the category of lets scare the hell out of the kids. This movie is nothing like the Nutcracker that one usually thinks of, it is completely altered and not very entertaining, unless you like your kids to have nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary!","review":"This video is so scary, my 3 year old was going,\\"Mom, what are they doing?\\" I finally shut it off and am going to return it tomorrow. Also, the story does not follow the real ballet. I'd rather have the real thing. In short, I was Very DISSAPPOINTED in this video. I certainly do not recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I am planning on taking my 4 yo daughter to see the actual ballet, so I was hoping to get her familiar with the music & story beforehand. I borrowed the Barbie movie from a friend of mine who said it was really good. Now I am annoyed because this adaptation is NOTHING like the actual ballet, and now I have to try to explain why the versions are so different. As a stand-alone piece, this movie wouldn't be so bad (although it's as Barbie-saccharine as you'd expect). It's just sad that they are calling it \\"The Nutcracker,\\" when it really isn't. Apples and oranges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie in the Nutcracker","review":"My daughter is seven years of age and wanted this movie for her birthday. She absolutely loves this movie. She also likes the extra bonus features that are provided. The act along with the movie portion is her favorite part. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes barbie, the nutcracker, or ballet dancing. There is also an informative short documentary on the DVD about the life of six students that attend the New York City school of ballet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect curl-up on the couch movie!","review":"As one reviewer said---as an adult I watched this myself and didn't expect to fall in love with it! I saw it played on TV one Thanksgiving before I even had children and having been an avid Barbie collector in my youth I sat to watch with no expectations. The animation was wonderful and it brought \\"to life\\" a classic story. It was well done and I bought a copy to enjoy with my own children today. It's definately worth the few dollars Amazon has it listed for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with Barbie princess movies","review":"I ordered this Barbie movie for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves Barbie movies. I can't wait to sit down and watch it with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie Nutcracker","review":"My daughter absolutely loves this movie! I enjoy hearing the music to the nutcracker and they did a better rendition for children than a lot of the ones I have seen. Great for young kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't the ballet","review":"Since my daughter, age 7, is taking ballet, I was excited to have two things she likes combined (Barbie & ballet). Unfortunately, the plot and characters of The Nutcracker ballet have been changed dramatically and the dancing limited to the final scene. The video's plot is the nutcracker's battle to find the sugar plum princess and regain his true identity. I particularly found the added \\"rock giant\\" character distasteful. On the plus side; the animated dancing in the final scene is quite good and the music by Tchaikovsky is used consistently throughout the movie. The movie has a positive message though it is heavy handed. If you are looking for the classic ballet dancing or story you will not find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouse King and Rock Giant Scary","review":"I am new to the modern Barbie and have to say I am very impressed. (I hated Barbie as a kid!) Overall, this is a wonderful version of the Nutcracker. All of the characters work together to solve problems, the animation is amazing and the music, of course is timeless. There is also a bonus track about girls/women who are professional ballerinas. My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves to watch this part of the DVD over and over again. However, she finds the Mouse King a little too real and the Rock Giant terrifies her. My 2-year old son loves the whole thing and likes to stomp around the house like the Rock Giant. All kids are different, so you should make sure you watch this movie and evaluate it for your children before you let them watch it. (Of course, you should do that for any movie!!)P.S. Tim Curry plays the voice of the Mouse King!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Intro to Ballet","review":"Although it is not a real \\"ballet\\" as a ballet teacher myself of 3 yr olds I find it a good intro to ballet for the very young. It does get them interested in classical music (also very good for brain development) and this will later get them excited to see the actual ballet live and bring much needed culture into children's lives! I recommend the video \\"Learn Nutcracker Ballet Dances with Me\\" as a good choice in addition to Barbie Nutcracker because it gets the kids up and dancing with the Sugar Plum Fairy and other characters from the Nutcracker. They learn dances from the Nutcracker so this way they really learn to enjoy classical music and the ballet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starring in her first ever movie!","review":"For the first time.Barbie in the Nutcracker,with computer graphics.This movie is realy great.The dance was so beautiful,the music is so wonderful by Peter Tchakovsy as preformed by The London Symphony Orchestra,and the story is so cute.The fairies are so beautiful like:the snow fairies and the other fairies who is so cute.I realy love this movie.And this movie is on TV in christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie In The Nutcraker","review":"Hi- I have not seen all of this movie, but all i saw of it was perfect. I Recommend this movie for everyone. It's a Perfect movie to see at any time. [ Especially at Christmas Time.] I think all Family's would enjoy this movie because it's a fun movie and an adventure everyone can enjoy.So Please Buy Or Rent This Movie I'm Sure You Will Like It!I Wish Barbie Could Read This.Enjoy Barbie In The Nutcraker Everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not as good as the princess and pauper","review":"Good enough for my 11yr. to watch. She liked it & it is a version for the nutcracker. This is an enchating movie for any fans. The songs & animation is good. Also the story line is great. This is a great item for any barbie fan or maybe a nutcracker fan. Also it is actually good for any age. the movie is great, so I would definelly recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!","review":"I am so glad I decided to view this video before I spent good money on it. The computer animation is stiff and wooden, and the plot doesn't keep to the original version. The characters talk, instead of just dance the story. My 4 yr old daughter was screaming all through the mouse fights. Then for some reason the sugarplum fairy is the only one who can restore Barbie to her original size. Somehow she had become shrunk. My daughter who loves both ballet and Barbie just ordered us to turn it off. Any ballet fans should steer clear of this one. Take your child to see the real thing, or invest in a video that has live ballet dancers in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying travesty, but unfortunately, it serves a purpose.","review":"Okay, I do *not* like Barbie videos... AT ALL! I find the animation cheap and annoying.That being said, my 4-year-old *loved* this video. She saw it during a Parents'-Night-Out, held by her daycare. It's colorful and flashy, and put a visual story to the music she knows so well. In fact, several months later when I played the CD of the ballet, she danced around the room, and told us the story... mostly based on what she gleaned from this video.Thus, while I *refuse* to have this video in my house (much less sit and actually watch more than a few minutes of it), it is not a complete waste of time... it served its purpose. However, I would much rather have her watch the real thing, and hope to find a version that will erase this travesty from her memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"apalling","review":"I found this film to be apalling. I was a dancer for 11 years and danced in 8 performances of \\"The Nutcracker\\". I saw the first portion of this movie on television and I believe that it is a disgrace to the ballet. There were few ballet sequences, which does not make sense because \\"The Nutcracker\\" is a ballet (last time I checked). Also, there was little evidence of Tchaikovsky's beautiful music. Lastly, a majority of the story was dedicated to the mouse king, and that completely disagrees with the actual story. There were made up characters and made up plot lines. Overall, I feel that the Barbie Nutcracker film was a disgrace to ballet, and if a little girl wants to see \\"The Nutcracker\\", they should attend a live performance or watch a video with real dancers in it instead of viewing this horrific animated version."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was B-A-D","review":"I can't believe they capitalized the 'her' in the phrase \\"Starring in Her first movie\\". What is she, some goddess??"},{"rating":"1","title":"off with her HEAD!!!!!!","review":"this...this thing is so shiver worthy and heck me i hope we cud thro it into outer space and it will land in jupiter and be ruined by booiling gazez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't rate this 0 stars? :(","review":"Oh my God. A Barbie video? Don't tell me who did this. HAS EVERYONE GONE INSANE?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter wants to watch this movie over and over again!!!!","review":"I would have given it 5 stars but I just can take it anymore...we always buy the Barbie movies for my 2 year old daughter...this one is her favorite so far. We watch it over and over again. She tries to mimic the dancing in the movie which is very cute. And reacts to the scenes emotionally...she does not like the mouse king...\\"he's a bad guy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you'd expect...","review":"We bought this to replace our original which mysteriously (ok, not so mysteriously) was scratched and skipping. The first of the Barbie movies, Nutcracker offers the London Symphony Orchestra playing and computer animated ballerinas dancing to actual pieces from Tchaikovsky's work. The Barbie movie trademark is twisting stories so that Barbie (heroine) uses honor, determination and quick wit to save the day. I think it is a good way to introduce kids to a classical piece. Tim Curry is great comic relief as the Mouse King. My now 5 year old son will watch it with my daughter (though he'd never admit it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get children interested in the arts","review":"I just wanted to add that for a kid's version of the Nutcracker this is not to bad. This is the first version of the musical my 5 year old has seen and she loved the Nutcracker so well she wanted to see the live action version. What a good way to get your children interested in the arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids loved it!","review":"Im normally a bit cynical re barbie products. I think most are cheaply made and sell only due to the barbie name. So I was very surprised how good the movie (plot and animation) were. I read the other reviews about children being scared and dont agree. The villians were the same level of scary as any cartoon or disney movie out there. I would recommend this video to any barbie crazed kids like my 3 and 5 yr old girls are. My 8yr old nephew (definite nonbarbie fan) also sat transfixed and watched the whole movie, due to the great storyline and action. If it was a straight ballet movie I sure I would have lost all three! But with the story, dance and music combination its a great way to expose your kids to the \\"classics\\" Have a great christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nutcracker? Not even close!","review":"If you purchase this with the intent of sharing your love for the orginal,cherished version of the Nutcracker story or music then do not make the purchase. There is very little of the orginal story line or music in this DVD. In this version, Clara doesn't have parents, is raised by her mean grandfather, and it's her liberated Aunt who gives her the nutcracker. They are chased throughout the story by the wicked rat king...who sends out flying bats to keep them from seeing the Sugar Plum Queen. In the process of searching the nutcracker, Clara, and two others that are on the journey with them...are chased by a huge evil \\"stone monster\\" sent out by the rat king. After more non-original activities...the story ends by Clara returning home to meet the nutcracker as a real live boy who she will now be dating.Buyer be warned! This is NOT the real story line, the dancing is minimized, and the orginal music is all but gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scary","review":"I thought this video was too scary and the scary mice parts in the middle outweighed the dancing and music at the beginning and end. I started it for my 4-yr old granddaughter, who loves Barbie and dancing, left the room, and came back to a terrified child cowering behind the couch. I stayed with her while I fast-forwarded to see what else was coming, and it was still too much for her. I think this would also frighten her 5-yr old sister. This video should not be seen by children without an entire viewing by an adult prior to showing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Little Girls","review":"My four-year-old granddaughter really enjoyed this well-done movie. And her mom and I also found the story enchanting. A nice take on the original story. Great for girls ages 3 to 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad","review":"I don't mean \\"not bad\\" in the colloquial sense (meaning \\"good\\") but not awful.It is kind of splitting hairs to find fault with this for not following The Nutcracker ballet's plot--the story was changed so much from Hoffman's tale when they made it into a ballet.But the fact is, despite the title, you can't use this movie to introduce your child to the ballet. Not one dance appears in its entirety, the music is utterly out of sequence, they added characters and deleted them with what seems a careless disregard for the story we have become familiar with. (Why did we need a bat with an English accent? Why a rock monster? Why kill off Clara's parents and change her brother's name?)It's a cute, albeit obvious, story, and the animation is good. If they had called it \\"Barbie's Sweetland Adventure\\" I would have given it three stars, but to call it \\"Barbie in the Nutcracker\\" is just false advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute movie","review":"I was given this movie as a gift and I thought it was cute. I am a big fan of Barbie and ballet so I'm glad that the two were combined for this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for little girls","review":"My daughter really likes this movie.She always wants to get dressed up in her \\"ballerina\\" clothes and fairy clothes and play and dance along.Many movies are to scary for her.. this one isn't... it has just enough suspence to make the ending exiting without disturbing herMy husband hates it... it probably isnt good for family movie night."},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!......","review":"NOT. Look, this movie is soooo lame, who woulda ever thought of it? Barbie is SO sugary sweet that she gives me cavities. I can prove it. I'll show you my teeth! That oughta scare everyone away. And Ken is SO dumb to fall in love with such a bee-atch. So is Skipper (or should I say Mud Skipper), Kelly, Kira, Christie, and that stupid everything is SO pink. Blech I hate pink. And all animals are kind to her I swear if you take the camera away they will devour that woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful video is enchanting, enthralling","review":"This variation of The Nutcracker opens children's learning horizons to include classical music and ballet. Every scene of the movie is breathtakingly intricate and vivid. It is a rainbow of color from beginning to end. The characters have such unique personalities--it's hard to believe they're not real. I was completely enchanted with the story--its pleasant surprises, twists and turns are delightful. I watch it with my 6-year-old every other week or so. I would recommend this movie to everyone of every age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute...","review":"This is a very well made movie, the graphics are great. I was very excited that Barbie was coming out with her own movie!But, it doesn't hold my daughter's interest just yet. At 2 years old, she is a movie fanatic..she will sit through most movies that she likes (such as Toy Story) but this one I must say she doesn't care for.I think she will like it more in a year or two. I am not disappointed that I bought it, as I think we will get use out of it later on :)I recommend this for the seriously girly barbie girl in your life! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scared of...What?","review":"I'm befuddled by the several reviews saying that the Barbie Nutcracker is scary. My three year old daughter has watched it about 500 times. She dances along with the dance scenes. She loves the Kelly character. She finds the CGI intriguing. When we took her to see the Nutcracker performed live, she had a fine basis for what she was watching. Look, this is not High Art -- it's Barbie and Ken. But, it's clever...enough. If there's a problem, it's that there's a middle act that moves slowly. But Tim Curry as the Mouse King is a hoot -- he gobbles the scenery, along with the gingerbread. It's not Snow White, but it is entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the greatest Barbie DVD","review":"I've bought most of the Barbie DVD collection for my 3 year old granddaughter. Nutcracker is one of the least enjoyable. In fact, I found I couldn't wait for it to end. My granddaughter prefers the ones that have less evil, scary, 'bad guys.' We love Mermaid's Tale, Princess and the Pauper, Three Musketeers, Diamond Castle,Magic of Pegasus, Swan Lake, and Fashion Fairytale. Nutcracker and Barbie's Christmas Carol are at the bottom of the heap.If your child enjoys 'Mermaid's Tale', there's a bonus feature on Fashion Fairytale that shows young girls demonstrating the 'Queen of the Waves' dance. We've had lots of fun with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie dances into the heart of little girls","review":"My four-year old daughter adores Barbie and Kelly so naturally she wanted to see Barbie's the Nutcracker. I didn't have alot of expectations so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. The music and production values are excellent. Barbie is a positive role model as is the Nutcracker. The Mouse King (voiced by Tim Curry) and his bat sidekick are amusing. Even my six-year old son enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chopinesque Joplin","review":"Roy Eaton plays these pieces with much style and generally much vigor. Though often times the approach reminds one of recorded performances of Chopin waltzes or mazurkas, the beat is never lost: Eaton is faithful to the spirit of ragtime.The works present on this disc are perceptively chosen. I believe this is enough ragtime to satisfy most anyone. Joplin occasionally hearkens back to earlier American composers such as Louis Moreau Gottschalk (particularly in The Chrysanthemum). Aside from the famed Maple Leaf Rag and The Entertainer, other works give equal pleasure, such as Original Rags, The Search-Light Rag and Solace (A Mexican Serenade that can be called nothing other than truly American).These Joplin Rags are enjoyable from any perspective. After dipping into this set or one like it, I recommend looking into older American composers such as Gottschalk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Singer of the 20th Century","review":"It was a great joy to see this video. Mahalia doesn't sing a song, she \\"lives\\" it. The audience feels that she has got a direct cable to God. Never before I heard such a great version of \\"We shall overcome\\". She sang it in the church of Uppsala, Sweden. Every person in the audience and every viewer of the video feels the presense of God. Just a little bit sad is, that the director of this video made some mistakes. So, it was not Mahalias last Europe Tour. This video depends on her tour of 1969. Her latest Europe tour was in summer 1971. I saw her at Hannover in September 1971. Some days later, in Munich, she collapsed. And there are other wrong comments, too. It would have been better that the director had read L. Goreaus biography \\"Just Mahalia, Baby\\". There you can read everything about her Europe tours between 1952 and 1971. But inspite of that, it's a great video about a wonderful woman. There will be no other Mahalia. She is the greatest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mahalia Jackson-Give God the Glory","review":"Because of the fact that I met Ms. Jackson at a very early age and she and my Aunt belonged to the same church - Greater Salem Baptist Church under the pastorate of the late Rev. Petty and the late Rev. Leon Jenkins, Sr. I could say that I am biased. However, this was an excellent documentary and it gives an up close and personal look at her life and her craft. She truly was working for the Lord! She was dedicated unto death to her master our Lord and Saviour - Jesus Christ! I wholeheartedly recommend this and have bought several as gifts for those that love real and original Gospel Music and for those who loved the QUEEN of Gospel - Mahalia Jackson! I repeat the Queen of Gospel!!! Get a copy and your life will never be the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Prepared","review":"As a father of a child with lissencephaly, I most certainly can relate to most items Janet talks about in this book. With exceptions: The most notable is that my baby girl (well I guess she's not a baby anymore, she's almost two!) is still alive... and well, all considered.I think I picked up the book expecting to read more about the everyday life with a liss child. It didn't happen to be the way I expected, but that does not take away from the book, or the story being related.What I took away from it, was a lesson of faith. For those of you on support networks, you know what I speak of. Death of our little ones is more constant that anyone would care to see - and for those who've had death visit their door to take their angels back to heaven: There is Life After Grief.

Thus pretty much rendering this title unwatchable with the thick accents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, naughty fun.","review":"The highlight of this production is Peter O'Toole. Hands down, bar none. There are the remains of a drop dead gorgeous (go see Lawrence again) man here and his story is believably supported by David Tennant; who manages the rather remarkable feat of living up to Mr. O'Toole's talent -- and looks.Stunning script, but that's to be expected from those who loved this writer's Dr. Who -- however the wardrobe stuff and the occasional set decoration, what, malfunction? maladjustment? downright weirdness? is -- well, jarring. However, not enough to dim the emotional impact of this really fun, funny and emotionally satisfying story. Thank God the Brits made this; it's actually sexy -- as opposed to sterile or gratuitous, without being peruile about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casanova (Masterpiece Theater)~ David Tennant","review":"Brilliant, Witty and funny. Tennant is on a fast track of becoming a major UK superstar. Laura Fraser is adorable and what more could be said about the amazing Peter O' Toole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casanova - David Tennant","review":"Nice little British romp. Campy at times...but, isn't that very British?David Tennant delivers a likeable young Casanova... flaws and all.Not at all like the commercial Casanova that came out that same year. That story was a bit more light hearted and had a happy ending where this version by Russell T. Davies ends a bit dark.But, the costumes and sets were a lot of fun to see..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casanova","review":"Loved it! David Tennant is such a joy to watch in anything and he has once again proven that he is up to the task. He was magnificent as the young Casanova and put a new aspect on the character.Peter O'Toole was marvelous as the aging Casanova, still pining for his lost love.Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly entertaining","review":"I had not seen this show before and got it because I think that David Tennant is a terrific actor. The DVD did not disappoint. He is just brilliant in it. It is just a hoot. His asides to the camera are just hilarious. I would strongly recommend this video to anyone who is a David Tennant fan. David Tennant and Peter O'Toole, how can you possibly go wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly emotional","review":"I watched the movie because of David Tennant. He was great although the colored contact lenses were rather distracting. The movie, like Casanova's life, is a lot of fun until it isn't. I enjoyed watching Casanova's antics. I was totally caught up in his pursuit of Henriette and Bellino. But when the turning point finally came, it changed how I saw those romps and I almost felt bad for how I'd admired his cheeky seductions. The film was more serious and poignant than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Romp","review":"Exactly the hilarious romp I expected from the writing of Russell T. Davies. David Tennant is delightful, charming and sometimes disturbing in the lead role of the most famous seducer in literature. If you are expecting this to be a historically accurate film, you will be disappointed. Anyone who has ever seen Davies Dr. Who work will not be surprised at the unusual parade of characters or Casanova's stance on \\"morality\\". Rich costumes, beautiful scenery, creative use of make-up and memorable characters all come together to create a delightful film about judging others and taking excesses too far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rendering the Nuances of Love","review":"If you're looking for exceedingly exacting period costumes and settings, this may not be for you. There are many fine location shots and the costuming is good. The cinematography has a slightly surreal tone, appropriate for disclosing the inner life of its characters. But the subtle work of the British actors and actresses make up for any minor insufficiencies, rendering the life of a man who would not let his epoch incarcerate him, but who was determined to travel the world to understand the considerable dimensions of human love, including many perhaps unanticipated. I found this BBC rendition probably the most mature and moving version of this man's lifetime to be found out there in the historical media. This film makes questions of historicity moot and subsidiary to the realm and verities of truly human experience through the life of an exceptional man. Compare, e.g., Marcello Mastroianni's rendition in La Nuit de Varennes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casanova - Masterpiece Theater","review":"David Tennant is hilarious as Casanova. I caught sketches of this on TV Masterpiece Theater, and wanted to see the whole thing, so ordered it. There are several bawdy scenes in it, or it wouldn't be Casanova, but it's all done in fun and good taste. It's certainly a different \\"take\\" on the legend, and seeing him with his son, who appears out of the blue after one of his escapades, is funny. The boy doesn't talk, just looks, but at least is a good-looking child - UNTIL he grows up. Then the young man who plays the young man is repulsive as he has now lost his good looks by the process of growing up. Peter O'Toole as the wistful older Casanova is quite believable, mourning his lost love. Laura Fraser is always good. I now have Hamlet with David Tennant, which I have not watched, but am curious as to his comic take on Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're here, just get it!","review":"If you've made it this far, you've probably heard about this gem.

Um, no.There are several other anachronisms and examples of reasons I, personally, do not connect with these characters, but these three are the most egregious. About halfway through the book, I completely stopped caring who was murdering the hookers. I admit I skimmed the rest just to find out, and I was not surprised. Horrified, and grossed out, but not surprised.Oddly, the author does the best job when she is narrating from the killer's point of view. That's a little disturbing as well.It seems to me that I've liked books by Sutcliffe before, but this one really misses the mark. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars - GREAT READ!","review":"I was so intrigued by the emotionally-damaged, yet strong characters and gut-wrenching plot, I didn't even notice the evening go by.

They were both suffering. Holly from being a former hooker and J.D. from losing his family. They found hope and a second chance with each other. What made me want to read the book more was the fact that it was a romance suspense and I love trying to figure out who did the crime.

The material is almost completely useless for retail brokers and most financial planners. The material would mainly be usable by fee-only financial planners catering to extremely wealthy individuals and wishing to take the author's \\"concierge\\" approach to servicing clients.

What I got was a book by Deena Katz on Deena Katz. For example, in discussing contact management systems, she glosses over Act! and Goldmine; barely mentions Text Library System and ProTracker, but spends considerable time talking about paying $50,000 to have a consultant design a system. If you currently have a fee only practice that is grossing in the high 6-figures and want to develop it into a multi-million $ firm, like Deena Katz, then I suggest you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Practice Management Must","review":"I keep Deena's book by my desk as a virtual bible on practice management. There are so many places that are helpful to use for quick reference when I run into a day to day crisis. When I am faced with the long-term strategic issues that will either lead my practice to the place that I want it to be, or cause it to go somewhere else, I can look to Deena's book. I am writing this with bias. Deena had asked that I write the forward to her book, not because she loved my writing style, but because she knew that she had helped me in some key practice areas. Most would term our financial planning company as successful -- I owe much of that to Deena. More importantly, Deena has captured far more things than she had even shared with me in this excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a real HOOT!","review":"I really enjoyed the music from this quirky show.

The price is definitely a bargain for the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product at a Very Reasonable Price","review":"I'm a fledgling birder, and I bought this product for that purpose. I already had several cheapie small binoculars, was looking for something with better image resolution. I read several reviews, and settled on this product. Appealing in appearance, comfortable in the hand, it performs FAR better than my other compact binoculars (which are now relegated to a drawer with other seldom used equipment). The image is crisp, the colors true. I have the 10X version, which works best if you have a steady hand and some experience with binoculars.Any disadvantages? Only those dictated by physics. Compact binoculars, confined by the parameters the universe imposes on them, simply cannot gather light in the quantity that full-sized binoculars can. So, in the early AM, and at dusk, you're better off with the full-sized cousins of these nifty Nikons. Otherwise, this product is an excellent value and a pleasure to use, a very distinct improvement over cheapie compacts."},{"rating":"2","title":"98% RATING","review":"Nikon Travelite V 10x25 BinocularTHESE BINOCULARS ARE MISSING FRONT LENS CAPS OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT I WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE AS MUCH BOUNCE AS OTHERS THAT I HAVE TESTED I RECCOMEND THEMIF A NIKON REPRESENTITIVE READS THIS PLEASE ADD 2 FRONT LENSE COVERS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon 7510 Travelite 10 x 25 mm Binoculars","review":"So far, so good...I'm impressed with the optics...easy to use and focus.Actually, purchased these binoculars for a Cruise/Tour of Alaska scheduled for later this summer...will re-visit site after the trip andgive a more complete review!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend","review":"I purchased these binoculars for my wife to use on a cruise after reading another good review written by someone that used them on an Alaskan cruise.

He said he needed a wallet with a lot of pockets for his various cards and would prefer a bill fold over a tri fold. I had it delivered to me so I could check the product out and wrap it and everything. There was a bit of cosmetic damage on the inside which I wasn't able to fix. There were also a couple of short threads sticking out around the wallet; I secured them all with a little clear nail polish. Also, when I pulled the card out that came in the clear pocket, it left a stain on the clear plastic that I had to get out with nail polish remover. It was also a bit stiff but that's to be expected from a new wallet, and I made it a little softer with some leather conditioner.All in all, great value, good product, only a little fixing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holds plenty of credit cards.....but","review":"This was advertised as a tri-fold wallet.

The book begins in Europe during the 1848 revolutions. The author displays a political awareness of the events that is rare in modern writing. Unfortunately, political awareness is not very popular in the U.S. and this may go unnoticed. The interesting thing about this book is that it is written in two layers. One a non-fiction historical and the other an exciting almost comic romp through America. The main characters are colorful and endearing. The historical facts are interesting, even for the most jaded reader of historicals. As a New Yorker I can't walk through some sections of the city without remembering the author's descriptions of how it may have been in the mid-1800's. I was sorry that this book ended. Usually epics get tiring towards the end but I miss these characters. If you want a refreshing historical that breathes new life into the past this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!","review":"The pre-publicity on this book led me to think that it would be interesting and enlightening. Instead, it was a book with no character or plot development and a massive amount of data signifying..what? E.L. Doctrow did this much better in \\"Ragtime\\". He had real people who signified various threads that have explified much of the color and pain of the twentieth and twenty-first century in American life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I Missing Something?","review":"I Ordered this book hoping to see in writing what I enjoyed so much in the movie \\" Far and Away \\" starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. They both cover approximately the same period of our country's development. Boy, was I in for a huge disappointment! The author\\"s fictional tome was a series of rambling episodes that lacked cohesion and interest. The lead characters were the most vapid individuals I've encountered in years. I noticed that this title made a quick exit from the Best Seller list and I had the good fortune to unload my copy to another unsuspecting customer via my Amazon for sale listing. My advice is to keep looking and waiting for a writer of fiction to successfully capture the flavor and personalities of this rather fascinating era of US history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"As historical novels go this was not what I expected. It is a bit too long, and it drags in places. I found myself skipping large passages because they were not really relevant. Perhaps it is 200 pages overwritten. But it is a good story, well researched for authenticity and well plotted with interesting characters and the historical time frame is extremely interesting.I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys thick books, big plots and history as authentically researched as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Overdone, but Just a Bit","review":"This novel revealed a lot of historical facts to me. Most were relevant to the plot, but some were just showing off. I find the other reviews very thorough, and I DID like the book, despite some things I could not accept. A devoutly religious pyrotechnic, Drumont's chase from Paris to San Francisco (mainly across uncharted territory in 1848) and actually landing (with many convenient coincidences) on Ben Knowles's doorstep, Duff Lucking taking up with the Indians and actually \\"becoming one.\\" I was born in New York and have lived in the San Francisco Bay Area (10 years apiece) and learned MUCH about both areas that I did NOT know previously, though I think Caleb Carr fits his research in more smoothly. I also discovered why California is the most expensive state to live in--once gold was discovered there, prices immediately inflated and they've never in 160 years stopped! Otherwise, a very fine book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Interesting in the concept of weaving the story lines; but disappointed in the story as a whole. If you read the liner notes on the dust jacket, you've read the story. Just having a few historical names scattered within the storyline doesn't make for an historical novel. I find reading real history more interesting....I looked up Fremont, one of the characters noted in the novel on wikipedia and found the information on him much more interesting. The characters just plodded on. Thus I couldn't wait for the end; it was not a \\"page turner\\" for me....it was a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I started this book.

But after my husband, a Mechanical Engineer, read about the way the Dutch oven was constructed he said this pot has the very best of everything and will be amazing to cook with (He was so right!)! He explained to me how each metal in the pot worked, heated and distributed heat. The copper goes up the sides and is not just on the bottom as does the aluminum with the benefit of the durable stainless steel!! The engineering that went into this pot was the very best and the results are the very best!!! I tried the chicken recipe that one of the other reviewers suggested about browning the chicken and then slow roasting it for 3 hours.......O-MY-GOSH was that fantastic!!! I am so excited about this Dutch oven that my mission is now to buy the entire line of the 'All-Clad Copper Core'!! If I could give it 10 stars I would!!! Buy this pot and you'll ditch all of your others!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Best Cookware","review":"I have owned a set of the All-Clad copper core cookware for several years and it is absolutely the best cookware I have ever bought. Over the years I have purchased a piece of practically every major cookware made but nothing compares to this.The original Dutch oven is the typical straight-sided model that is larger and therefore heavier. When the new curved-sided model came out I was thrilled. Because of the cost it was hard to justify buying another one but I have not regretted it one minute.This is truly non-stick cookware without the Teflon or other coating. If you preheat the pan, add oil, let it heat for 5-10 seconds, then add food, nothing sticks! I use the Dutch oven at least once or twice a week and am thrilled I bought it. You can use your stainless utensils without the worry of scratching off a coating or pitting the bottom.

Not only was this CD *not* made from the master tapes, it wasn't made from a tape at all. It was mastered from an LP (just like my homemade CD), apparently with no effort to clean up the surface noise or ticks and pops. 5 stars for content, but zero stars for not going back to the master tapes.

As in PRC's Devil Bat's Daughter (also 1946), a tortured girl believes herself to be a monster on the prowl as a result of a tainted heritage or a legendary curse. If you're looking for werewolves in London, you better look elsewhere: lycanthropy only appears as the title of a book read by the heroine. Fans of the Sherlock Holmes series might enjoy the presence of Dennis Hoey as a diligent Scotland Yard inspector (unlike Lestrade), Lloyd Corrigan as a Watson-like assistant, character actors Martin Koslek (Persuit in Algiers)and Frederick Worlock (Dressed to Kill), plus the garden weeder from Scarlet Claw.

I would have given 4 stars but there are not nearly enough illustrations. Something critical in an art history book. He often referred to works which I'm not familair with and were not illustrated. I found this to be very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"An affordable reference on Art History; but seriously lacking","review":"\\"Art: A New History: by Paul JohnsonIf nothing else, this text has a bargain price; but there are critical shortcomings with the book. First, it is minimally illustrated, even if the colorful reproductions in the book are useful. What it lacks is reproduction of some of the most critical drawings and paintings ever made. It has only a couple of works by Francisco Goya, and none of his major work. Likewise with Picasso. \\"Guernica\\" is not represented in the book, and it is one of the most powerful murals the artist ever produced.Another reviewer correctly identified that the history seems to elevate certain secondary or minor aspects of art history, while sublimating major or primary elements of art history. This is a difficulty.Although the book is large, and has some utility, I cannot recommend it highly. If one can afford it, some usefulness can be obtained, but it may leave the reader with an erroneous perception of the artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art history as seen by one man","review":"Paul Johnson has written a very personal view of the history of art. He makes some very interesting observations. Some of these are thought provoking and others are just plain silly. His ideas are worth considering for ancient art but they become so personal and opinionated for modern art, they can only be termed laughable. Another problem for me was that as an Englishman, the author seems to believe that the English have been a much greater influence in the development of art than they have, in fact been. Because there is no bibliography or footnotes, it is very difficult to tell when the author is providing his own opinions or citing accepted scholarship. If you hate most of the art of the last 150 years, you may find this book one that will bolster your ideas. The illustrations are all in color and are quite good. Many are works that do not appear in other books on art history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Insentive Eye","review":"A stunningly mediocre book. Unorthodox, revisionist stances, can often be bracing. Johnson's are merely inane. He seem incapable of seeing with a sympathetic eye. His biases are pervasive and uninteresting. So one can \\"learn\\" from Johnson that Giotto is \\"wooden\\"; that Artemisia Gentlischi \\"weakness was that she was overweight\\"; that Cezanne is a \\"would be realist\\" producing \\"crude\\" pieces which are \\"stiff and awkward and anatomically incorrect....clumsily painted ( Johnson reaches this conclusion by comparing him to Chardin!) and that Cezanne's reputation is really only a result of \\"commerce. Johnson eye is so dead and his theories so skewed that he is obliged to excoriate virtually all art from the twentieth century onward as mere \\"fashion art\\" and \\"higher frivolity\\". Wretched history to be sure--but hardly \\"new\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This book, \\"ART, A NEW HISTORY\\" by Paul Johnson was listed as used.

He's the closest writer we have to Winston Churchill today. That is to say - clear, opinionated, incredibly readable.Here Johnson turns his writing to Art. He tells the whole \\"story of art\\" his way.Certainly, specialist art critics will find specific problems with the book, and possibly be annoyed by the book (what's Paul Johnson doing writing about Art?)This big book is intelligent, superb, reads like a thriller, and so on ... all you'd expect from Johnson. He's a little bit right-leaning and conservative-ish so there's going to be a bit of tension with the left-leaning-ish art world, but all the better.Take in your whole human heritage in one enormous swoop - here it is in a non-stop page-turner.

It was almost like they ran out of money and said \\"ok..lets just finish here.\\" There was no resolution it just stopped. And can anyone tell me what the closeup of the discarded book left in the park by Daniel was all about in the last scene. Was that significant or meant to mean anything? I couldn't make out the title of the book so if there was a message there then I lost it....Message to director/writer/producer...if you are going to market a film as a romantic comedy then give it a definate ending...I can't see \\"Notting Hill\\" being the sucess it was if it had of ended when Hugh Grant rushed into the hotel for the press conference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it promises","review":"Really depressing movie.

I thought the acting was well done and the story was interesting and I was anxious to see how it would end. I will not give any spoilers but I think the director must have run out of money or something and had been reading too many Stephen King novels and thought - wow I should end this movie like most of his books and just stop where I am right now. I was ready to give these movie at least 4 stars but with the ending - it really made me angry. I watched this with a group of friends and all of them agreed with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The One","review":"Great build up of the plot, and then it went down the drain. It started as a romantic search of love, and diverted to a self indulgence of pleasure with no regard of consequences, and left us hanging to a less than ideal outcome.

It should have been titled Me, Myself and I !"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not The One","review":"Despite the positive sounding title, and the promising start and premise the film's ending is a complete disappointment and, like other reviewers, just made me angry.

I based my decision to purchase based on this review. I watched the first two to ten minutes of the movie, and pressed eject. First scene is of a verbal exchange with the protaganist, and a gay male friend who worships people who look perfect... Seems to hate his own body, and is stereotypical of gay men in general, I found it offensive. I may give this movie another chance, but not sure when.Horrified is my response. love your body, love your cells, as GOD is not giving you another one.

The publication\`s size gives the beginner a better view of the Chinese character and the basic Chinese 8 strokes that one must learn to write properly. This book not only provides the reader with a complete guide to writing Chinese characters but includes: making Chinese calligraphy fans, making decorative cards, bamboo books, paper cutting, mounting Chinese calligraphy, writing on Tee shirts, making Chinese scrolls and making Chinese seals. The author also goes into great detail to show the reader the 4 treasures of the studio namely: the brush, the ink, the paper and the ink stone. A brief history is also given with pictures of some of the greatest Chinese styles of Chinese calligraphy. The book is really very impressive and I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the art of Chinese Calligraphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, sorry for purchasing that","review":"Well a do not believe this book is rated as 5-star.

This book does not have anythink but 10 pages in common with caligraphy. So if you are interested in calligraphy and not in creating smal simple gifts to your child friend dont byu it.

But it doesn't. The regular Sims2 plays slow on my pc and I was hoping this would be my answer to faster play. Unfortunately it is just as slow as the regular Sims and not as fun to play and no access to custom content which makes the game so fun in the first place. And the life stories are really just a small expansion of the regular Sims goals and wants anyway. I might buy the Sims Castaway Stories since it might be interesting to see what goes on at the deserted island, but LifeStories and Pet LifeStories is just a different and not as fun way to play regular Sims.

It would freeze and crash, it was impossible! This game is very similar, just not expandable. You can play in Freeplay which is just like Sims 2, or you can play the storylines. Riley's was cute, but I really enjoyed Vincent's, it is laugh out loud funny. If you have ever dated people from the internet you can really relate to Vincent. I completed the Vincent storyline, and have been free playing him for weeks now, having him marry various people within the game and of my own creation. He has built quite the legacy. I have been giving him Elixir of Life, and he has lived an extremely long time. Call me sentimental, I just can't let him die.I would love it if EA would release a lot more of these Laptop Friendly Sim's games. I would like a nightlife type one, or something more bizarre.

At first I didn't think that i would use them but I use them all the time. I also really like that this game has laptop friendly Specs (doesn't take up much space). One of the things that really makes this game so much fun is the story mode. One of the reasons why i loved the console versions of the sims was because of the story mode that it oftered. To have the story mode now on the pc is wonderful. The guided storys are a lot of fun to play and i plan on playing them again.

It was the second Mary Balogh I've listened to and will be the last. This story was trying to be a lot of things and failed in every way. The interactions between Susanna Osbourne and Peter Edgeworth are really just plain silly. The love scenes fall short and they don't make you pine for the couple to get together. Peter is, for lack of a better word, a wuss who doesn't grow a backbone till the very end of the novel. I really didn't care for the too proud Susanna either regardless of her tragic past.

She loves him but doesn't think he loves her (yawn), and is generally disapproving of him and only reluctantly admits he is a kind man. (Whoa, hold me back!) Delusional feminist overtones (I am strong, I don't need a man, but my deepest dream is to have a husband and family...),This is a big disappoitment: dry, no chemistry, the big secret is so anticlamatic...and so much exposition instead of story - just let us live it with the characters instead of telling us everything! Read at your risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story and characters","review":"I am a huge Balogh fan but in this particular series of books, she's batting .500. I will confess that I've bough books in her series simply to find out what has happened to characters introduced in other books (here for example, we have characters connected to the Butler family and the Bedwyns) and in this group, the books about Claudia Martin (Freyja Bedwyn's governess) and Anne Jewell/Sydnam Butler were either better written or they had nore appeal. Even though this book featured Peter, first introduced in a Summer to Remember, it just wasn't very interesting. There are plenty of reviews about the plot and characters in this book so no need to repeat that. Skip it unless you are a die hard fan or want to read the entire \\"Simply\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZzZzZzZzZzZz","review":"One of the slowest book I've ever read! Especially since I was listening to the audio. Goodness, I almost fell asleep!! Second book I read by Mary Balogh. I think it'll be the last. Not worth my time. The first book I read was just as slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it!","review":"Just finished \\"Simply Love\\" and now am reading \\" Simply Magic\\" and it's as good as the others in the series. Mary Balogh is a great author and I just want to read all she's written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and service","review":"This was my first order and the service was great. The book arrived in 3 days and I really enjoyed the convienence. I enjoy this author and will look for more books by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love these very real charactors. I like the way they challenged each other to confront their demons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, secrets and mystery leads to a good read","review":"Susanna is a teacher in Miss Martin's school for Girls and is very pretty for such a life. When she is visiting her former colleague and close friend Frances the wife of Viscount Lucius Marshall, she meets with handsome Peter Edgeworth. Peter falls in love with her and tries to get her affections one way or another. However, there are some barriers between them that Peter doesn't know. Susanna's past holds the truths that are too difficult to avoid indeed.Nice story, which starts pretty fast, develop into mystery nicely which reveals itself gradually. The reason I don't give 5 stars is because at the end, some of the very well described issues are underestimated and simply avoided. The closure of the issues did not convince me completely. Other than this very nice read, I personally like it better than the first book of this series, Simply Unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"she is always amazing","review":"She always manages to take the reader there, i love her books and would recommend to any reader to pick one up and sit back and enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing","review":"To be honest, it's boring and lacks plot and I'm finding it difficult to even finish it. I want more heroes like Wulfric Bedwyne, Duke of Bewcastle in the 'Slightly' series, or Jocelyn Dudley, Duke of Tresham (More than a Mistress) or best of all Adam Trent, Duke of Ridgeway (The Secret Pearl)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"I just love Mary Balogh. She doesn't need big plots or silly misunderstandings to tell us a simple, heartwarming Lovestory. And that's what this book is all about. Two people who are trying to find themselves and each other. I absolutely loved it and I hope she will continue with outstanding stories like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Balogh Magic?","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that Mary Balogh is my all-time favorite Regency writer. And I have problably read about 30 of her books. No one writes wittier dialogue and compelling Regency romance better. That being said, I was greatly disappointed with \\"Simply Magic.\\"The whole plot and premise was forced formula romance for me. Frankly, as some other reviewers have said this was boring. I did not care about the characters and I could definitely put this one down. Ms. Balogh seems to have written to satisfy a deadline and that is all. Try some of her older works. Even her \\"Slightly\\" series is overall a much more entertaining lot than any of the \\"Simply\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable rainy day read","review":"I did enjoy Simply Magic maybe for some of the same reasons that other reviewers did not. I liked that Susanna had a more cerebral approach at times to the relationship and was a person in her own right. I personally relate more to that characteristic in a heroine. To me there was a subtheme that love isn't happily ever after-there is work and growth to people and therefore to relationships which I found refreshing compared to other books. Peter wasn't the typical hardened alpha male either but had some growing up to do. Again, these may be the same reasons others didn't enjoy the book as much as I did. Was it the best, most compelling romance I ever read? Absolutely not...but for an enjoyable afternoon of light romance with a little twist from the normal, it was perfect for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Put Me to Sleep","review":"Thank goodness I got this book from the library because it was SOOO boring. It took me two weeks to get through the first 30-40 pages and I only finished it because I felt obligated to do so. I found myself hoping Viscount Whitleaf would just have his merry way with Susanna Osbourne and be done with it so she could live out the rest of her days as a boring spinster school teacher. And (PLOT SPOILER AHEAD) I'm sorry, but if I found out that your mom had an affair with my dad, was going to insinuate rape and then my dad killed himself over it, guess what, we are NOT hooking up for rather boring sex in the Dower House, end of story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I have had a lot of fun with this workout. It is usually hard for me to stay focused on a video workout because it tends to be work, but Taebo Believer's workout is not as much work as it is fun! I would recommend this tape for anyone just getting started, and even if you have been doing Taebo for awhile, it is a very good one to do on a \\"relaxing\\" day."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST perfect","review":"I try to work out every day, so the pace of this one is a little less intimidating than my regular TaeBo workouts. This is my favorite TaeBo so far! It kept me sweating, heartrate up, through most of the workout. You can maximize your results at different levels of experience by really tightening your muscles, or have a lazy day and just get through it. My only issue (and it's a pretty small one) is the religious factor. I know a lot of people love that about this dvd, but I would love to know if there's another TaeBo workout that's similar but secular. As it stands, I'm fairly willing to continue ignoring the shouts out to Jesus and skipping the ending prayer session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Inspiring Workout!","review":"This is a great workout for those beginning Taebo. Billy talks alot about drawing on your faith for strength. The workout is not as tough as some other Taebo tapes, but I still worked up a great sweat!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ran dry after 8 weeks of very light use","review":"After very light usage, the refill stopped delivering ink after 2 months. Looking for a replacement that will work at least as long as a Bic or Pilot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pen, poor quality refills","review":"I love my Waterman pen. I was given it as a Christmas present about five years ago. The black refill and came with it was perfect. When it started to die about two years in, I bought a three pack of black refills--all Waterman brand. None of those would write. I had to coax the ink out of them and often just made scratch marks on the paper. Unfortunately, I prefer that problem to the problem I have with this blue medium point refill. It is much easier to write with, but if you store it upright--like in a pocket--it will slowly leak. Usually, the leak isn't fast enough to be concerned about, but over a weekend stored in an upright position, it can build up enough ink on the tip to stain a shirt.So, I'm done with Waterman and am looking for a different brand pen with similar feel and refills that work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The refills are a consistent bust","review":"I've owned Waterman pens for over 10 years. I enjoy the feel of the pen but the refills are a total bust. I bought a pack of 5 about 2 years ago and all have a scratchy writing quality to them that makes me feel like I'm fighting the pen to write. All of the refills in the pack were the same. After giving up on the pens for 2 years, and using Faber Castell pens, I ordered the refills again - same thing.I'm done with Watermans for good now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I just could not get into this book. I found this story and the characters too boring to continue. I gave up on it after about 100 pages. I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"While I am not familiar with other works by Ms. Jones, it seems like she's a romance writer not familiar with the workings of a mystery or a suspence novel. And though she may have done extensive research on the Ripper killings, her characters are severely lacking in common sense. Victoria Thomas is both physically and emotionally weak, and the sex scenes are intrusive and unnecessary. FBI and Scotland Yard protocol was ignored to the point of absurdity. The \\"present-day\\" murders were described more for their shock value than literary value. Finally, the identity of the modern murderer was painfully obvious; that Victoria couldn't identify him until the last minute is insulting to both the character and the reader.This is neither the time nor place to debate whether Jones' assumption that J.K. Stephen was the 1888 Ripper is true(doubtful) but suffice to say this book is the most contrived \\"suspence\\" story I've found in an adult reading level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are there killer genes flowing through his veins?","review":"Bloodline is a departure from Jill Jones' previous novels. She deftly and skillfully makes the transition from \\"intriquing\\" to \\"chilling\\"! Bloodline will keep you rivited from page one. Jones ability to weave the present and the past is, as usual, superbly researched and presented. Her heroins are strong, sensual and human. It is no different with Bloodline's Victoria Thomas. Her emotional relationship with her mother brings you back from the horror of the murders into everyday reality. Beware, however, Jones has a way of describing the murders in chilling and bloody detail. The cold cunningness of the killer's thought process and the demons of another era that haunted him, will make you shiver. Are the genes of Jack the Ripper flowing in his veins? You be the judge..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mystery","review":"I found this book very disappointing. Aside from a total lack of suspense, the killer was obvious in the first chapter. This is the 1st book I have read by Jill Jones and it's probably the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved her Susan Ashton Album","review":"I have the first Susan Ashton album ~ and I LOVE it. I felt this CD was just plain 'lacking'. It left me missing the old Susan. Perhaps I just prefer her to remain a Christian artist. After reviewing the lyrics and the album cover I am not impressed. Not something I would like to put in to spend some time alone with God and I could do that with her first album. Sorry but I have to poo poo this album. It's to bad too because I really was hoping to enjoy this one too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Gotta Witness not too stable?\\"","review":"I should have known by the cover of Susan Ashton's \\"Closer\\" CD that, times have changed for this woman of faith! Susan, you've been like a personal friend over the years. You have always been my favorite contemporary Christian artist. You always sang from your heart, openly and honestly. I only hope and pray that you will use your gift from God for His glory once again, not just for your fans' sake, but for His. Disappointment is an understatement Still listening to your past work, and always will, until He returns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I'm a fan of Susan Ashton's Christian music, and I also like country music, so I bought this CD. I was not too impressed. Get back to your roots, Susan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favorite Artist Falls Away","review":"I couldn't help but notice the irony in Susan's new album titled \\"Closer\\". Closer to whom or what? Certainly not closer to the Lord Jesus Christ. She is getting closer to the world and its secular garbage. Look at the cover. Does her dress and pose identify her as one who desires a closer relationship with God? When I first saw it, I couldn't believe it was her. Her lyrics point people to human love which fails, instead of the love of Jesus Christ that surpasses any human love. How can anyone minister from a secular standpoint anyways? Amy Grant crossed over...how many people got saved, or were encouraged in their walk with Jesus Christ. Instead Amy Grant has pushed aside what the Bible says and has divorced and married a divorced man. What is happening to Christian music? It has become an industry rather than a ministry. It is trully a great falling away. I would not buy this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover was outstanding so I bought it","review":"The cover is really hot of Susan Ashton. But the music fails to be similar than that. I only recognized one song on this album when I bought it and that is Your Lucky I love you I believe it was the only single off the whole thing. The music did not sound that country and it failed hardly to be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for Fun","review":"I can't believe some of the harsh reviews of this album. I could care less whether you want to call it Pop, Country, Christian, or anything else. It is a soothing and fun CD with lots of emotion. As for the guy who bought the album because the cover was \\"hot\\", but was disappointed by the music, it isn't surprising that the music may be a tad beyond what you expected. I would suggest sticking to your Mariah of Brittney CD's.I hope Ms. Ashton continues down the road she is on. Since the unfortunate death of Eva Cassidy, there is a larege void in adult music that Ms. Ashton could fill quite admirably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth","review":"I have followed Susan Ashton for years. What always struck me was her choice of songs. Most of her songs were written by Wayne Kirkpatrick who is a master songwriter. He stays away from cliches which is a breath of fresh air. This album seems full of cliches and without any real meaning. Even the love songs end up being trite. Susan is a gifted writer herself and I would have loved for her to have used her skills to show us what is deep within her rather than on the surface. I was deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"As others have said, this is a well done and fun album. Susan Ashton's voice is clear and strong, and it is encouraging to see a Christian artist reaching into the mainstream. I'm sure it doesn't mean that she will leave the Christian message of her previous work behind. Instead, expanding her audience will mean that many more will be willing to hear that message. Enjoy the album, it's worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susan Ashton - Closer","review":"I enjoy the CD and was very pleased w/the service and promptness w/which it arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Gospel Artist Makes the Endangered Species List","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this album. I know almost every word to every song on every album Susan Ashton has ever done. I am a huge fan of both her musical gift and what used to be her ministry. It is becoming tiring to see yet another gifted gospel artist abandon their ministries in favor of a long-shot chance for the big monetary brass ring. The songs on this record are mediocre at best - poor reason to ditch your christian fans. Perhaps the current very poor sales of this album will cause Ms. Ashton to think twice about what actually constitutes an impressive music career. I so hope her next album is another collaboration with Wayne Kirkpatrick and his awesome songs - those two are one brilliant combination. This was most definitely not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but....","review":"Susan Ashton follows in Amy Grant's footsteps in an attempt to leave contemporary christian music behind in favor of mainstream success. I have to admit that this dissapoints me, for Susan has been my favorite CC artist for years and her music has been a major inspiration for me. Her new effort, Closer, is very good, and the more I listen to it the more I enjoy it, but it is missing something special for me. The songs are great, wonderful production, and her voice is as beautiful as always, but I don't feel as uplifted as I have in the past after listening to her. My hope is that her audience grows exponentially, and that her new fans are inspired to find her earlier efforts, and are as moved by them as I have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good supplemental workout","review":"I think this workout is of value, but it's not perfect. I would give it three and a half stars if I could. You can see from the other reviews that people have some issues with it. If you have a Tae Bo workout or two and want a little variety, this might be a good supplement. That's how I like to use it. It's not as challenging as some, but I found the \\"flex\\" parts, for the lower body, to be good balance practice. I don't think it has the best warm up in the world, and I often click off the cool down to do my own and hop off into the shower, but it's a nice change for a day that one might not feel as ready to take on a full big workout but still want a little action. It is definitely not a good intro to Tae Bo. Get the Intro and Basic workouts first. The Basic is always a good workout. Check out collage video's website for lots of great workout video reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flex!","review":"I think this flex workout is very in touch with knowing how to control your body and really press and use your muscle groups.It is a nice change from cardio and I rotate the Cardio and Flex.Doing this will make you really push yourself to work out harder and to see the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Workout","review":"I bought this DVD with the plan to use it as I travel because I spend quite a bit of time in a hotel room for my job. This workout is great given the fact I have limited space. It is an intense workout without all the running around many fitness other exercise videos have you do. Like the other Taebo videos, this is also an excellent workout. The moves are easy to follow but are intense with the \\"flex\\" aspect to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Production","review":"I love Billy Blank's tae bo- but \\"flex\\" smacks of shoddy work. Billy is often off count, the camera is often off of him when he is saying something like \\"you can also do it this way\\" To top it off the instructional part of the flex DVD comes AFTER the workout, not even as a second chapter. I do NOT recommend this for beginners- not only is it a low-cardio work out with difficult to hold pilates type moves, it also may just turn you off to tae bo, and that's not necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really make me sweat :-/","review":"First, I'll say I've only tried Tae Bo a couple times. I'm not an avid Tae Bo exerciser. I'm also not in the best shape either (I'm working on it though! haha).With that said, this workout was disappointing. As someone who is looking for a good cardio workout, I did not find this to be a good workout at all. I was barely sweating.Most of the DVD is stop and go because you \\"flex\\". I'm sorry, but that just didn't work for me. I did start sweating a little towards the end (which is why I gave it a 2), but most of the workout is stop and go, and there's no fluent cardio involved.Plus, that blonde hair girl in the front is really annoying. That has nothing to do with my scoring, but I just wanted to put that out there.I'm going to try another Tae Bo video; this one wasn't good, and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not challenging; only for beginners","review":"First let me declare my unwavering devotion to Billy Blanks and the Tae Bo program. With TB I have lost all the fat on my torso and arms, and slimmed down my legs which didn't even need it. I am a dedicated Tae Bo warrior working out with the Cardio Circuit, Fat Blasting Series, and Get Ripped Series which is the best. I encourage everyone who wants to look amazing and fall in love with their workout routine to try those tapes.... Now to Tae Bo Flex. It is absolutely not for advanced exercisers. I was frustrated through the whole thing because Billy's cuing was off in a disastrous way (not the typical erraticness), and the intensity never went up. You kept anticipating something difficult to follow but it never came. If you enjoy the videos I mentioned do not buy this one. It is only for beginners. (and beginners, if you don't like this tape, don't worry. It's not as exhilarating and innovative as the ones I've mentioned)"},{"rating":"1","title":"billy blanks tae bo dvd","review":"I thought it was big waste of time---did it once and will probably never do it again--his eralier tape swere much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks...","review":"I'm a beginner when it comes to exercise, and I decided to give Tae Bo a try after hearing so many positive things about it.

I really liked volume 1 when it came out years ago. But I ended up returning this book because I was disappointed. Most of the animation \\"tricks\\" here are about character animation - mostly how to use flash's drawing tools to make the characters look 3D, and how to use code to make them move. Being a motion graphics animator, the only things i found which were relevant to me (maybe 3 projects) were frankly somewhat boring and predictable.If you're an intermediate/advanced flash animator/programmer looking for really clever motion graphics tricks, there may be only 1 or 2 projects of interest here to you.If you are somewhat of a novice and want to make really cool characters and scenes in flash and become expert with the drawing tools for this type of usage, you will probably get something out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this kettle!","review":"I am really pleased with this kettle.

This book spans two thousand years of history to show that there was a gay literary tradition in China. It is really the first work of the kind on China in English. It is full of romantic antidotes, poetry and stories from a time that China, particularly under communist influence has tried to deny or at least forget.Personally I would like to see an update of this first work or the expansion by another author on other Asian countries like Korea where their homophobia has also prevailed and they have taken to rewriting pages of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for China Scholars","review":"This delightfully accessible book on an inaccessible topic provides an appetizing read. Bejeweled with wonderful quotations which are variously elegant, erotic, bawdy, and sometimes just simply endearing, the author reviews the two thousand year literary tradition of male same-sex attraction known as the \\"cut sleeve\\" (based on a lovely story which I will not spoil by recounting). In the course of this overview, the author provides interesting evidence of the benefits to kinship groups of same-sex relationships as well as the manner in which this tradition harmonized with reproductive marriage. Lastly, he describes how this tradition was lost--though one suspects that his explanation based on western cultural influence does not do justice to indigenous circumstance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book everyone gay, or history major should own.","review":"Bret has demonstrated an academic book can be fun to read.

(2) the methodology in the book is somehow simplified and naive. it does not read through the material thouroughly enough.i agree that this book has its own historic value, but we need to expect more professional works on the field.actually many good books on the field are in chinese, and they are much more reliable. interested readers should try to approach them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good instructional book","review":"I thought this book was well written and provided good step by step instruciton to anyone who is new to cutting hair.

Al Qa'ida attacked the USA; Saddam never did. So the right US response was to counter-attack against Al Qa'ida.

(And several of those meetings never took place according to US intel and law enforcement. It's upsetting that Hayes seems to assert that both the CIA and FBI, by ommission, are accidental agents of Saddam. Those folks are not deserving of these backhanded smears!)

The C.I.A, when sent the document, said it was inaccurate and was riddled with \\"cherry picking\\".Several points have been widely proven wrong, including the alledged meeting between Iraq and al Qaeda in Progue which is laughable.If you like this book then it's probably because it said what you wanted it to say: that there was a link between Iraq and al Qaeda, so we were right to invade them.

His telling of this conflict, with the dozens of characters on both sides, the vicious bloody battles, the harrowing marches across a brutal landscape round out the story of this little known war. The text has several superb maps that allow the reader to follow the combatants. His information on the St Patrick's Battalion (Irishmen who deserted the US Army before and during the war) is detailed and interesting. Santa Ana is shown as an egotistical commander who had little regard for the welfare of his men, Taylor and Scott are portrayed as men with faults and certain military skills. Overall, an interesting read, it won't disapoint those with a thirst for this conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books on the subject","review":"This book proves to be well written, well researched and quite readable even to a casual reader. The author present his material with certain level of clarity and insights that make this book a sure fire winner.Luckily, the author does not malingered over the political correctness of the war as we see it today. The Mexican War cost Mexico any chance she had in becoming a dominate power in North America. That role went to the United States for better or for worst. As an American, I would say, for the better!!The author also wrote with amazing sense of objectively regarding many of the major characters of the war, from Winfield Scott to Santa Anna.If there was one book to read on the subject, I would recommended this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallels to Iraq?","review":"The US government hypes up a war with a smaller, ill-governed country, for questionable purposes.

We tossed out most of the trial version software) and installed our Office 2000 discs. The only small surprise was the outdated wheel mouse, no big deal, we purchased an optical mouse at Wal-Mart for under $10.

I don't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up (if I do breath of fire it helps). When I want an easy day I'll pop this in and do both sessions. Very simple. But I'm sure it's good for a beginner--a BEGINNING BEGINNER. Sara Ivanhoe is soothing though, and encouraging. But seriously, this is a very easy workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, slow, not fat-burning, ANNOYING instructor","review":"I bought the Fat Burning part of this DVD on video and it is very slow and certainly not fat-burning.

I highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relatively boring and slow","review":"I bought this dvd together with the two mtv yoga dvds - i find the mtv yoga much better. Crunch's yoga is not very challenging (even though i'm a relative beginner), the instructor is ok, but can do with fewer pretenses that she's working really hard and fewer of her unnecessary encouragements. Unless you are absolute beginner and have never attended even one yoga class, you'd hardly find it challenging or interesting. By MTV yoga instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"this workout is to yoga what cliffnotes are to literature","review":"This workout uses yoga vocabulary, but it's really just gymnastics.

The drawbacks are that it is not the best one for beginners, or for people that are pretty heavy set - some of the moves are difficult if you cannot support your body weight easily. Also, it is more \\"Americanized\\" yoga than authentic yoga - it is more like a class at a gym with little to no focus on breathing or actual hatha yoga sequences. The advantages are that for average fitness levels it is a great workout, and you will sweat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Burning, No.","review":"I bought this dvd wanting to expand my yoga library at home. I found it to be very, very slow and agree with those that say Ms Ivanhoe \\"talks down\\". I would have to say that this video is definitely for someone who has NEVER done yoga.

Great all around yoga. The second is a more active routine which is more of a \\"work-out\\" though any yoga will develop your body (in other words if you can only do the first routine for awhile, since it is a bit easier, you will be getting benefits.)All in all a good DVD to learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yoga for beginners","review":"This is a great yoga DVD if you are new to the whole yoga scene.

Sara Ivanhoe is easy to follow and pleasant to listen to. The workout is somewhat challenging but not too intimidating. I felt invigorated from the workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not flexible? Not for you.","review":"I bought this DVD as a beginner's intro to Yoga. I have done Yoga meditation before, but this was more of a real workout. Both workouts on this tape are pretty strenuous. The Joy of Yoga is pretty difficult because you have to already be flexible to do many of the positions. Even the modified version is pretty difficult. The woman doing the modified poses is obviously very advanced. I suppose it could get easier with time, but it is doubtful I will ever be able to do every position.The Fat Burning Yoga workout instructor is a little better at explaining the positions. I was able to do 90% of the poses in this part of the DVD-- at least the modified version. Still, the modifications are not that different from the regular workout.I would say this tape is more for seasoned stretchers-- You have to be pretty darn flexible to get the maximum workout from this tape.I have also bought the Crunch Pick your spot Pilates tape. That is a really good workout-- even for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, I feel toned at 38.","review":"I've been doing yoga on and off since 1978, mostly Hatha Yoga on PBS. Decided to start again. When I first bought this DVD, it seemed too tough for a beginner so I put it away and tried it a few months later. Wow, I recommend this for anyone that used to be flexible and needs to get it back. I've been doing the workouts alternating daily for a month and not only can I do all of the poses but I can concentrate on breathing and pressing into each one for strength. I feel great thanks to this DVD. I am much stronger and feel complete after the workout. I felt like the Joy of Yoga was too easy so I moved on to the fat burner. I needed variety so I tried it again and since I was stonger and more flexible the Joy of Yoga workout got harder. If you don't enjoy or can't move into Downward Facing Dog, don't bother with this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Presented - Easy to Follow","review":"Well, I decided to try yoga. As one who works out on a daily basis and has held a weight lifting title for two years running, I thought yoga would be a piece of cake. Wrong. I may be physically fit in many respects, but when it comes to yoga, I am an uncoordinated klutz. However, with practice and this DVD, I just might master the art yet. This is nicely presented, well explained, and easy to follow...and I do recommend it for those like me, who are just starting out. (But how DO these people get their bodies in those positions without toppling over?) You WILL become exhausted, however, you will also feel relaxed...and maybe a bit embarrassed when you fall on your arse for the tenth time. *Grin* Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing for intermediate-level yoga fan","review":"I thought that this would be a fast-paced and strenuous workout, but it is far too slow. Also, the instructor never stopped talking, which I found extremely distracting and annoying. I think this would be a better workout for novices, who need instruction on form and more time to get into the feel of a pose. I will try to find someone to give this DVD to; all I can say is that at least I only blew [a little cash] on this one.I far prefer my Power Yoga: The Complete Workout with Rodney Yee (flowing poses with minimal yakking)--although it is definitely for someone who is already familiar with basic yoga poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners!","review":"Sara Ivanhoe is a good instructor for these exercises. She continually reminds you to breathe and to check your postures to make sure they are correct. Her instructions are clear, and her voice is soothing while still very direct. The workouts are good for someone with very little experience. I enjoyed the sense of achievement at the end and the energizing effect it produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both yoga workouts are awesome.","review":"I bought this for the fat burning workout and I do love it. But, today I did the joy of yoga and it was by far the most wonderful yoga workout I have done. I feel like every muscle was stretched and I feel so great.

THIS MARVELOUS BOOK tells all of us, parents and teachers, alike how to NURTURE each individual child while preparing them for the future. Teaching is not just the ABC's and even though a lot of educators KNOW THIS, they get caught up in the politics of public education. This book is a reminder of the things we should all instinctively know when we are involved with kids. Susan Lipper is the teacher I wish I had had when I was young and the person I would like to be educating my own children.

It speaks of how his work differed from the surreal art of Western Europe. It even proved that no all of his work, especially earlier productions, were surreal.Still, this was a somewhat dull art lecture just put on a DVD. I think high school art students would not pay attention to it if their teachers spent a class period showing it. Most viewers will not want to sit through slide after slide and hear babble after babble. This may only be for hardcore Chagall fans or those who want to learn more about a potential idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dag Nasty meets Brown Lobster Tank, you need to own this.","review":"I've been looking forward to this for ages, but now I'm happy.

Anywho to change my workout because I was bored of the routine I purchased the DVD. Oh man is it great!!!! I sweat my butt off with this thing. It is really great some of the moves you will get lost in but I caught up really well with this DVD I really enjoyed it. My son even tries to keep up with Billy. It is really great and all the people on the video are motivational because they are real and you see them messing up and you see them sweating and looking like they are having a hard time at times.

Hope you enjoy as well as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"good exercise","review":"This exercise is great for people who are transitioning from the beginner to intermediate level of working out.

I own the Get Ripped workouts and they are definately high endurance...But like I said if you are already advanced in workout tapes, I do not recommend this workout.

Great Energy!","review":"This is the first Taebo DVD I have tried and I absolutely love it! It gives me so much energy. Billy Blanks is very motivational. I like how each step he starts off slow then speeds up. Took me awhile to get up to his speed though. But after mastering the move, now I can pick up the pace. I was concerned the continous counting 1-8 would drive me crazy. But actually it turned out to be a good way to stay focused. I can't wait to try another one, but now, which one do I choose?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am glad I rented this from the library and didn't pay for it. After 10 minutes I kept checking the time to see when the boredom would be over with. The workout is okay, but I never felt challenged except in my ability to put up with the background exercisers counting 1-8 throughout the ENTIRE workout. I've done the original Tae Bo a few times and definitely felt more challenged and the time went very quickly when I did it. This workout also seems to \\"forget\\" to work both sides of the body evenly with less repeitions on one side or completely leaving out certain exercises when they switch to the other side. Very disappointing, rent it from your local library, don't buy it, if you want to do this workout. the one good use for this video is to teach your kids to count to eight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout DVD.....","review":"When I started to work out. This was the first DVD, that I tried and it's great. I mean, this is great for someone to start out with. It goes slow enough, so you learn the moves and it's easy to do. You can follow it. Tae bo Carido is a great work out DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fast for beginners!","review":"I have never ever seen a Tae-Bo video or class before. I thought this video would get me into the loop, based on other reviews here (they all complain that it is for beginners). Well, let me tell you, it is waaaaaay too fast for beginners. Billy doesn't teach you any of the moves - he just does them (and does them fast). I couldn't even keep up wth the warmup portion at the beginning. The counts of eight take like 4 seconds, and his arms are swinging on every count. I know this is supposed to be a really fast-paced cardio workout to get the heart pumping, but I cannot even keep in synch because I'm trying to learn the moves at a ripping fast pace - it is very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This is a good starter workout for those new to Tae Bo.

I finished feeling energized but also like I had really worked. Billy is very encouraging and really got me moving. I'm going to buy the older videos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Cardio than the Get Ripped Advanced","review":"I bought this video in hopes of adding a new Tae Bo workout to relieve boredom. I found this workout to be less intense, less \\"cardio\\" than the Advanced Get Ripped workouts and it was just as long. I wish Billy would come out with a video that is 30 minutes or so and intense, but this isn't it. Look for my copy on Ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Taebo product - but it's too easy!","review":"As someone who has been enjoying Tae-Bo for several years, I put Cardio into my video player this morning and looked forward to a heart-pumping 45 minutes. Unfortunately I soon realised this tape is geared towards beginners and moderate exercisers.If you are just starting out this is an excellent workout for you. It will get your heart rate up sufficiently to burn fat and the moves are relatively easy to follow. Also, quite a bit of time is spent warming up and cooling down (The actual cardio stuff only lasts for about 20-25 minutes).If you are an advanced Tae-Bo veteran or are quite fit, this workout will probably not challenge you much.I do want to take this opportunity to sing the praises of Tae-Bo as a workout in general. Not only is it extremely enjoyable but it really works. You want a flat tummy? You've come to the right place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those already in shape","review":"I'm in decent shape and exercise regularly. I was looking for an exercise video that would help break up the monotony of running, pushups etc. The intensity of this video is fit for beginners. I think even people of intermediate fitness levels would be disappointed with this one. I've done other Tae Bo videos that are much more strenuous, and more fun. The Tai Chi type cool down on this, and the other Tae Bo videos I've tried doesn't really do much for me either. Go with this one only if you're a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Tae Bo","review":"similar to other fast moving. More advanced than basic series and longer. Again, you need Tae Bo bands and you can only get them from his site."},{"rating":"2","title":"disappointed","review":"when i got this dvd in the mail i was so excited because i have all of the advanced tae bo videos, including the get ripped series and i was hoping this would be a new advanced dvd. well, it's not. also, the music is really awful. very repetitive. i love the exuberance of his older videos, where u could see a ton of people working out behind him. there was always something new to look at. now the only interesting person to look at, besides billy blanks himself, is his daughter shelley. not that that's a bad thing. she's a walking advertisement for all the good things tae bo can do for your body.so if you're into a slower workout, go for this one. if not, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've been doing Tae-Bo for over a decade, and this has to be one of the worst videos that they've ever done. I'm out of shape since I lost interest in my old gym and I have some medical problems now, so I thought from the reviews saying that it was \\"intermediate\\" that it might be right for my level right now. Wrong. It's like they put together the most awkward routines from the old videos and slammed them together, with about fifteen minutes of warm-up and cool-down. Tae-Bo Gold (for seniors) was a better workout than this. I wouldn't say it's beginner level-- Just BAD. I ended up having to insert some exercises just to keep my heart rate up.Don't buy this one. Buy another one, maybe the Tae-Bo Cardio Circuit. I think that one was acceptable for someone out of shape, but still actually a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a \\"1\\" because it's for a Beginner","review":"I'll make this short. I am a tae bo junkie. If you are a beginner this is for you, if you are intermediate, use it on your \\"off day\\" and if you are advanced, don't buy it.

While I could not do the full kicks as high as the instructors, i was able to modify the workout to my body limts and STILL had a great workout. I am so happy I have finally found a Tae Bo workout that I can do. As far as the complaints about the annoying counting and music, i just turn the volume down low so i know when to change positions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Intense and diverse workout that really gets your heart moving.

Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow for me","review":"I was introduced to Tae Bo workout at a Club Med resort. I love it and the pace was exciting and the workout was great, I came home and still want to continue this exercise and went & bought the DVD, boy was I disappointed. It lacks the speed or the Cardio that I was looking for, maybe for a beginner it is o.k. not an intermediate."},{"rating":"1","title":"TaeDon't","review":"I bought this DVD looking forward to yet another great Billy Banks workout. This did not happen. I didn't even break a sweat. I would recommend this DVD for people who are either not familar with TaeBo or, who want to learn about TaeBo. Stick with the Get Ripped Series, much more effective workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginning Level Workout","review":"I am a big fan of Tae bo, but I am currently using the advanced level of tae bo. That being said - this video is not for me. It's for someone who is new to working out. It's definitely a great place to start. For instance, the new mom, someone who is a bit on the chunky side, or someone who just plain never did cardio before. If for some reason I can't do jump kicks for a while or do the double time moves in tae bo advanced I will definitely use this dvd to keep me in the fitness loop. Luckily for me if I end up in said situation I already have a great dvd on hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the Worst","review":"This video was such a waste of money. I've done all the Tae Bo workouts in the past and loved them. This video was a joke. I kept waiting for the workout to begin and then it went into the cool down. I couldn't believe I wasted $1 dollar on it. Billy needs to make amends for this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I consider myself a \\"skinny\\" person but I wanted more muscle tone which is why I bought this video. I did Tae-Bo Cardio 5x per week for 4 weeks and well, I saw little if any results. I didn't get as toned as I would have liked (barely noticeable) and doing this video day after day was mind numbing. I don't know how I lasted for 4 days let alone 4 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What they don't tell you on the cover","review":"I'm a Christian, but I'm not used to my workout instructors yelling to Jesus for strength and thanking him for the workout.

I wouldn't say this workout is easy; but it wasn't so hard that I wanted to give up. It's not easy if you're horribly out of shape; but it is do-able. Best of all, it gets easier and easier each week to do just a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginners' video","review":"I bought this hoping for something that wasn't too complicated and would get me to sweat without confusing the hell out of me... that's what I got. I think this is a great video for beginners, I can see where it wouldn't be challenging for someone who is experienced. I, opposed to some reviewers, really like how he does one set slowly so that you can get the movement down, find your groove, and then he speeds it up for a set or two. The moves are basic, the movement is constant to keep your heart rate up (especially if you're out of shape), and overall it's pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm-Up or Physical Rehabilitation Taebo?","review":"I agree with many other reviewers that this is a very slow form of Taebo. Calling it Cardio Taebo is very misleading, I think. The music is still bad (like original videos) and the movements are so slow. It is so boring, I have never been able to get through the DVD & after 2 times, I figure I should just donate it to the library. I bought this DVD because I wanted some variety from the other Taebo videos that I've used (and really enjoyed). If you like Taebo, don't get this, you'll be very disappointed. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout to Mix Things UP","review":"This was my first Tae Bo DVD, so I can't really compare it to what the others were like. I teach pilates, spinning classes and aqua aerobics 2-3 times per week and on my own I run and do yoga. I just wanted some other type of workout for the one day a week that I wasn't doing any of the other things.I thought it was great because it did get my heart rate up, although not like a challenging cycle class, but I knew I was burning calories. I also discovered a couple of muscles that must not be getting a good workout from the other activities. All in all, it was fun and a good way for me to mix things up from my regular weekly routine.Yes, the music is a little repetitive and the people counting to eight constantly can be a little irritating, but I also think you can find something wrong with every single video you do, so whatever. It did it's job- good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I first used this DVD when I was my fittest about seven years ago. I felt like the DVD helped increase the stamina to pursue other fitness endeavors (such as running races). After several moves, I lost this DVD and pretty much forgot about it. Fast forward to 2011...I had my first child and I had about 10 baby pounds to lose AND I was largely out of shape from being seriously sick most of the pregnancy. I found this DVD again and started exercising to it...just like old times! I really like this workout a lot. I do agree with the other reviewers that more cardio would have been appropriate and the cool-down is too long. In fact, I just shut the video off just as the cardio ends. I have tried some of Billy's newer DVDs and don't like at all. I am fairly coordinated and I just can't keep up! This is a solid workout though and would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"love tae bo","review":"i used the original tae bo when it came out on VHS. i have always loved kickboxing and took it for many years. tae bo lets you get the basic moves for kickboxing with out the bags and gloves in your own home and i love that. the workout was well paced and i loved it.

Dizzy and disoriented.I ended up buying the OEM part from the dealer, and wow what a difference. It is like night and day. I'm usually one that tries to skimp where I can (which is why I bought this part in the first place), but the higher price for the part from the dealer was well worth it.

This is a hero to our youth? Can anyone really find it heroic to flog artery clogging fast food, tooth rotting soft drinks and over-priced sports clothing assembled by slave labor? I don't think so. My favorite bit in the book is Michael's discussion of his attempts to have a specially designed microchip implanted just below the skin of his forehead so that he can actually charge a fee each time he is photographed and/or filmed. Just kidding? time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great photography","review":"This was an excellent, fun, and moving book. I agree that the writing wasn't really compelling on its own, but coupled with the brilliant photography (you'll \\"double-take\\" more than once while reading it) and Jordan's limitless charisma, this was a very fast read (for me, one evening in the local public library).However, I do agree with some who say that the price is a bit much. I'd probably only buy this book if I could buy a Porsche. That's why I only give it four stars.All in all, this is a good book about a man who exemplifies physical excellence. It's just a little bit on the expensive side."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!","review":"I think Michael Jordan's autobiography, For the Love of the Game is the best book ever written. I would recommend this book to everybody. It is very interesting, and the pictures are great, also you get to know everything about the career of Michael Jordan from the man himself, it's great. Once again, read this book or you'll regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tghe most compelling book, thid book was so exciting.","review":"I loved this book. I usually hate to read but this kept my interest"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW !!","review":"An excellent overview of the life and career of the greatest player of all time, told by the man himself. Great Photos !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Love of the Game: My Story","review":"I thought the book was excelent. It was an outstanding source of information about Michael's career. I liked how it showed all of the things that he has accomplished during his life in basketball. One of my favorited parts in the book was the picture of the center court of the old Bull's arena in his trophy room. Another part I like is the pictures of all the old apparel from when he first came into the league. It was a very outstanding book and I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit idolizing this huckster","review":"The photos are beautiful, but the appeal ends there. Anyone who thinks that this book reveals Michael Jordan's innermost thoughts and reflections has been conned (everything \\"revealing\\" about his dad's death, his baseball days, etc. has been fully reported already), just as Jordan has conned the American public into buying whatever products he has hawked for the last 15 years. The greatest to play the game? Unquestionably. But a role model? Only if your ideals are greed and self-promotion. The most telling piece of this book is when Jordan discusses the Nike phenomenon: \\"I didn't even like Nike shoes...but Adidas didn't make me an offer.\\" That's all that matters to him: Money, and being courted by people and/or companies who have money. This book isn't about any positive message or revealing inside thoughts or anything substantive; it's about Jordan building a shrine to himself. I for one refuse to worship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book shows MJ as more of a god than a basketball player. This book was also very expensive and is very unexciting. Don't get excited about buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basketball Player, Business Man or Politician?","review":"Yeah, yeah, the best basketball player to ever live. I still haven't figured out if this guy has anything good to offer people in terms of useful ideas or valuable insights. He is the best basketball player who has ever lived. Big deal!The man behaves with an over-inflated ego and vanity that I find rather repulsive. Why do Americans love this guy so much? What kind of person is he? Well, all the book revealed to me was a man totally and tragically in love with himself and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stats and Pics","review":"The book is full of great photos. I especially liked the one of Jordan and Dr. J! It also has great statistics from Michael Jordan's career. The layout is very different. I did not like it all that much. I was also a little disappointed that we did not really get to see more of the real Jordan. For a brief moment, we saw his humanity when he wrote about his father. Briefly, he mentioned his family. But mostly, he wrote about himself on the court. I guess I was hoping for more humility from this superstar. I believe he has it in him but the book doesn't show it. He certainly has much to brag about, but I thought he always let his bragging be seen through his play on the court."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Bulls or Jordan Fans","review":"An amazing symbiosis of words and pictures. The wonderful thing about Jordan is that he really is a very simple human being, and because he has kept close to that simplicity, he is able to succeed.Having just read Bill Bradley's Values of the Game, I can say that Jordan's is the better book. I felt like I was getting a lecture from a professor with Bradley, but with Jordan, it was an up-close look at a person's pure artistry and mastery of a craft he is so very good at.Will there ever be someone who will surpass his place in basketball? Probably, but I doubt it's going to come out of the Grants, Kobes, or Shaquilles. They are not the same combination of student of the game and amazing performer.Thank you, Michael for allowing us into your world, even for a precious little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autobiography??","review":"I was disappointed at this book. It's not really a true autobiography of Michael Jordan, but just a bunch of photos and statistics of his career, and just some random thoughts. The photos are nice, but there was a lot lacking. It reminds me so much of \\"Rare Air\\", Jordan's first \\"autobiography\\". And plus, it's too expensive. I wouldn't recommend buying it, just check it out from the library or browse it at the bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely, positively outstanding!","review":"As you read the narrative that is imaginatively layed out with different type and size mixed in with graphics and photos you can almost hear Michael Jordan speaking. They are his words and reveal some things about his life that I've never read before...and I've read everything written about him. As you can see I am a big fan and miss him so much on the basketball court. This book is just one of the many reasons that I along with millions of other people am a big fan of his. The book is as brilliant and polished as he is and also has the same good taste he has. Another great thing about \\"For the Love of the Game\\" is it will appeal to almost anyone of any age You can skim thru and look at the photos or read the stats or read every word. Whichever way you choose you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I found them on Amazon!","review":"Thank you Amazon for still carrying these. I couldn't find them in any stores anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Black Metal at its very best!","review":"Sigh, a Japanese Black Metal band formed in Tokyo in '89 released this truly amazing Black Metal release in Feb. '97. Its theme is focused on Japanese occultism. More specifically, the traditions of \\"Dakini\\" and \\"Izuna\\". The intentions of which are seeking \\"Nighthead\\" (occult knowledge). This album truly lives up to the Cacaphonous label prestige. With labelmates like Bal Sagoth, Cradle Of Filth, Gehenna and Bloodstorm...it takes alot of to stand out. This band does just that. If you like the above mentioned bands. I definately recommend buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't say I'll read it again...","review":"First the good news: Ms. Resnick has built her world in wealth of detail and depth. It's the sort of place you feel could really exist somewhere on the map of today's world. The bad news... the book often reads like a newspaper clipping. Page after page of how the rebellion is going. In spite of several of the other reviews, I did not find the characters particularly well drawn. I always felt some distance from them, and was never able to sympathize with them. I fact, I was often hard-pressed to determine if some of the characters were supposed to be heroes or villians. This may be real life, but when I pick up a novel, I'd like my heroes to be someone I can admire, someone I'd like to get to know and be friends with. I would have been much happier to see more immediacy in the writing, more sense of actually being there and experiencing the action and the feelings of the characters and less offputting narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Unmemorable","review":"About a week after reading this book I was trying to tell a friend about it. Halfway into the conversation, I realised that the scenes I was describing had taken place in another book altogether and I could hardly remember a thing about this one.Resnick has obviously spent a lot of time setting up the society, philosophy, and politics, but she doesn't do a whole heck of a lot with them. The religious aspects are somewhat interesting, but essentially this is another book about an amazing swordsman, a reluctant hero, and political strife. Ho-hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say BORING?","review":"This book had not nearly enough drama or excitment in it to keep me interested. I found the charactors to be shallow and poorly constucted. Resnick's attempt to make you like the charactors failed miserably. Altogether a boring and unenjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I picked this book up at the grocery store in a moment of desperate boredom. I was expecting, well... I don't tend to expect much out of books I get from the grocery store in sheer desperation of something to read.Her world is wonderfully detailed and thought out. It has a number of classic fantasy elements, and lots of foreshadowing. As I read it I found I enjoyed the foreshadowing, as it seemed intentional, as opposed to being merely predictable due to bad writing. I particularly love the fact that the characters are not black and white, but all shades of gray. They don't automatically know right from wrong. Some people seem to like that tired stereotype that can be found in almost any other fantasy novel, but I personally find it boring.In conclusion, I can't wait for her to write a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Melts!","review":"This may work fine on a small-burner or electric stove, but on my Viking range, unless one's careful to place the kettle off-center on the burner, or to use very low heat, the spout heats up and the black plastic melts to the red metal. This kettle is particularly bad for large-burners because the base is so small. Definitely not recommend! I no longer have the box or I'd send it back. As it is, $40 wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice kettle-whistles","review":"I owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once. But this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly, at first. But after only about 6 weeks of use, the flip-up spout broke off - actually just broke in half. I replaced it with a Chantal teakettle and so far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spout melted","review":"Update: I contacted Oxo and they offered to replace, refund, or repair the tea kettle one time, but told me I had been using it wrong to use it on high heat. Apparently the tea kettle is designed to be used only on medium heat. A tea kettle? On medium heat? So, basically, if you have hours in which to boil water, buy this. I will give Oxo credit for great customer service. But I bought an electric tea kettle to replace this. It heats water SO FAST and no melting!The plastic around the spout on mine melted. I was using it on my power burner, but that's sort of the point since this is a tea kettle and you want the water to boil quickly. Now because the plastic is deformed the spout will not close. This is otherwise a very innovative design but who was the idiot who thought to use plastic instead of metal in that location?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad color","review":"I bought a bright red tea kettle and after 1 use it has changed to a much darker color. Maybe I got a lemon? Would not recommend for someone who wants a red tea kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it three except for one grave factor","review":"The BO had been expecting to be taken seriously. They never were or will be but this album is full of the questions they have to ask themselves of men. To question what it is worth to live on if you have no talent. But the bizarre farce of Clipping the Wings of Imagination indicates that the rebellious riff-raffin' rebel-rahitos may have hit a dead end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspirational workout!","review":"Many years ago, I tried out the original Tae Bo tapes. I found them to be really rough, but fun. Having known previously that Billy Blanks was a Christian, I decided to try out his Believer's Workout.Now this workout is more my speed! The tempo is fast enough that it gets me into the aerobic zone without pushing me into my lactate threshold. (I know this because I use myPolar S725X Pro Team Tour de France Edition Heart Rate Monitor with Free Cadence Sensorto track every workout I do from martial arts to aerobics.) All I want to do is burn fat and calories without the pain of lactic acid, and this is the perfect workout for me. You get an adequate warmup which gets your heart rate up steadily, and a more than adequate cool-down period.The music is nice and Billy is very inspirational in this one. He gives all the credit to God and tells you to draw on Jesus for your strength in your workout.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to be inspired and get a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The workout is not disappointing, but I was disappointed with the spiritual side of the video. I thought that the scriptures used were thrown in and used out of context. I am a Pasor's wife and a twenty plus years student of the Bible and God's word should be handled with more honor and respect and only used in the context that He prescribed, not as warm little fuzzy words to make you feel spiritual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like Get Ripped Basic or Advanced","review":"I really enjoyed his last set of DVDs. They had a combination of cardio and strength workouts. These are much slower and only about 25 minutes plus 10 minute warmup and 10 minute cool down.He also preaches too much about the lord in the DVD.I will most likely continue to use the TaeBo II: Get Ripped series .. especially the advanced for a great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and Fun","review":"I am an avid tae bo fan. I have a large collection of videos and dvd's that I use almost daily. This dvd is set to a slower pace than Billy's previous workouts. I would rate the content at a basic level. This may be dissapointing to some but I found it beneficial. Billy really focuses on proper technique. There are an equal number of repetitions on each side. There is a small segment where he takes you to the floor and simplifies the old abdominal and butt moves. The benifit of the slower pace is that I was really aware of what muscles I was working. In slowing up the pace and doing the moves correctly I really felt the burn. I also enjoyed the power moves. Billy incorporates his faith by starting the workout with a prayer and encourages the viewer to reach out to Jesus when they feel tired. This dvd is inspirational and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Indian Device","review":"This is not a bad book. It is very Indian centered and is not an unbiased source.

A true waste of money..hp 56/57 ink jet cartridges remanufactured.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What they don't tell you","review":"I bought this DVD set thinking it was a great price for 4 DVDs. However, what they don't tell you is that most of the exercises are only effective if you buy their specific equipment: the \\"Sculpting Stick\\" and the \\"Fanny Lifter.\\" The \\"Sculpting Stick\\" was nothing more than an 8 pound bar and included 3 VHS's that contained the same exercises that I already had with the DVD set. The \\"Fanny Lifter\\" was the same story: it was packaged with more unwanted VHSs. The \\"Fanny Lifter\\" is nothing that spectacular. It consists of a 6 and an 8 inch step. If you want to know what you are getting, go with another exercise tape that TELLS you what equipment you need to have before using it. For example, the Denise Austin series not only tells you what you need (which is often optional), but doesn't force you to buy a specific set of equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovered an old friend","review":"I used this pack of workout videos years ago in VHS form and lost my favorites during a move.

If you are the kind of person who likes the basic jump up and down exercises, then this is not for you. I found it hard to get into the moves. For maybe ten minutes I stood there rewinding and pausing so I could get the moves down. I've tried other FIRM tapes and I have realized that I don't really like their aerobic workouts they are to hard to follow.The sculpting tapes I can live with. My boyfriend saw me trying to workout to the tapes and he couldn't stop laughing at me. I looked like a I had no rhythm. I didn't recommend this to my friends so I will do the same for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Firm 4-pack Body Sculpting System","review":"I do not recommend this product. I watched and tried all of the workouts and I am very disappointed. First of all, you need to have The Firm Fanny Lifter and the sculpting bar for all workouts on these DVD. Second, these workouts have poor transitions. Third, the trainers are not motivational. Save your money. Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to buy my copies?","review":"I love to exercise - classes, tae-bo routines, Kathy Smith, Denise Austin, hey - I even used to work out with the Richard Simmons 'Sweatin' to the Oldies' tapes, but I could not bare to suffer through The Firm routines more than once. I found The Firm to be boring, odd, and a bit cult-like. There really isn't a problem with any of the moves... I just honestly didn't like one bit of it. As an overall aerobic and weight lifting enthusiest, I caution anyone to preview The Firm workouts prior to purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Work!","review":"I have this set and have been using them for 1 month. They work! If you've never lifted weights this is a great way to get started. I found them more appealing to my age group than videos by veterans such as Kathy Smith and Denise Austin, who also have very effective workouts. The music is more modern and I actually look forward to working out, and that's the most important thing. After all, consistency is the key."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout!!","review":"I love the Firm. Thesedvds give a great workout. They really target the thigh and buttock area. You will not be disappointed. The DVDS are great for beginners and advanced because the instructors give options for the beginners or the advanced. The Firm offers the best workout with the quickest results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tapes","review":"I found this set to be challenging but doable. I use a regular step and a step stool instead of the fanny lifter, and I use a chair and hand weights to replace the sculpting stick. You have to increase the weights pretty quickly, but that's a good sign of progress. I like all the tapes, and think there is a nice variety without sacrificing quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"This controller is crap. Broke very soon after purchasing.

Any game is ruined because of this. They will stick up/down/left/right/diagonal. You can get them unstuck, but this is ridiculous to have to do EVERYTIME you play a game in the middle of the game.

Shame on the makers of this controller!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I bought two of these a couple of weeks ago without even realizing that these were third-party controllers. They look enough like the official Nintendo ones, after all. When they arrived, I was at first very pleased with them, even after I realized that they weren't manufactured by Nintendo. They felt cheaper, and the Z button could be very hard to compress, but otherwise they worked very well: for about 3 days.On the third day, the joystick on each of the controllers decided that it didn't like one of the four cardinal directions anymore, and wouldn't register movement in that direction. Needless to say, this made gameplay nearly impossible. I suggest learning from my mistakes and avoiding these things like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"a lesson I learned the hard way when I bought this controller.

The joys, the struggles, the rise and fall of a culture with all it's social graces. This book captures what I captured with my own eyes passing through those marvelous mansions of Cuba's golden age. Havana is truly a Paris of the Caribbean, although decayed and damaged, she is still beautiful, graceful and inspirational to all who visit her.

It's amuzing but pretty amateur attempt.."},{"rating":"1","title":"So it's finally come to this","review":"I have nothing against reaggae, in fact I like reagae. BY ITS SELF. now Pink Floyd on the other hand is truley great music, as are Led Zepplin, AC/DC, Aerosmith,CCR, the list goes on. but anyway, Dark Side of the Moon is one of the greatest albums of all time and to do something like this to it is a travesty, a sham and a mockery(not to copy the Miller lite guy of course) in fact I refuse to believe that this is happening.

If you like Floyd and reggae, get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stoners' Songbook","review":"I have been a fan of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon since I smoked my first joint in 1975. The original Floyd album was on Billboard's Top 100 for YEARS and is widely known as the \\"going up\\" album of choice. Put the needle on the record and light that bong please.Many people out there probably have questioned, \\"What nerve these Easy Star All-Stars have to tamper with a classic?\\" It's a legitimate question except for this album is fantastic. I just love their brilliant dub reggae twist. The standouts for me are \\"Time\\" and \\"Great Gig in the Sky,\\" but whole CD is uniformly EXCELLENT. In fact, I enjoy w/ or w/o the help of rastamon's favorite plant. It's the kind of album you can slap on at any time.For those who love Floyd and also dub reggae, this album is \\"HIGHLY\\" (ha) recommended.Siouxie, The Bronx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"At first glance, you might dismiss this album as yet another bad remake of perfectly fine classic music in an unexpected style that manages to parody both the classic music and the new style (as in Hayseed Dixie). Dub Side of the Moon, however, was clearly made by individuals who love and respect both Dark Side of the Moon and roots reggae. They manage to do justice to both in this album.If you lived in a cave for the last 30 years and didn't know anything about Dark Side of the Moon, you would easily mistake this album for a landmark reggae effort. It's fine reggae and a fine version of Dark Side of the Moon. The only things keeping this album from 5 stars is that it wasn't an original work and some of the transitions between songs lack the fluidity of the original. All in all, a very worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's for everyone who loves good music","review":"After I heard a review of Easy Star's Dub Side of the Moon on National Public Radio, I rushed out to buy a copy. Since then, I've played it over and over.Dub Side is a visionary CD. While remaining totally respectful of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, it is unique in its own right. The musicianship and artistry, by all involved, are of the highest quality and originality. In the first few seconds, you'll know you're in for an intriguing ride that satisfies over and over. I've introduced it to lots of friends and all of them love it.While all the cuts are interesting, my favorites are Breathe, Us and Them, and Brain Damage. But this is one to be enjoyed from start to finish, and over and over. Dub Side is so creative and ambitious that I can't wait for Easy Star's next production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!!","review":"I'm a Floyd Fan and am skeptical of covers, but this album is awesome!

I never thought I would hear the music of Pink Floyd in Reggae form or like it for that matter but these guys do an awesome job!

They are on tour right now so check for dates near you and dont miss your chance to see them live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinterpretation","review":"Easy Star All Stars album Dub Side of the Moon reinterprets Pink Floyd's album Dark Side of the Moon with an awesome rhythmic style and keen sense of creativity. I have to admit I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, so I was a little hesitant to listen to what I thought was a cover album. I have listened to the E.S.A.S.'s Dub Side a few times now and absolutely enjoy the way this band has remade/recreated the music in their own, unique style. The song Time has got to be hands down my favorite song on Dub Side. Anyway, if you are a fan of music in general you should check out this album. If you are a fan of Pink Floyd in particular, you must check out this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feelin Irie","review":"I'm not a big Pink Floyd fan, but I love reggae, and this is one of my all-time favorites.

I have ben listening and listening to this version, and its a lot of fun.It gives you a different but fresh perspective of Dark Side of The Moon, maintaining its original timing and intention, but now puts you in a different mood.Just Great!!!!!If you like to hear a different kind of Fusion, I would also recommend you to listen to \\"Lagrimas Negras\\", a great CD by Chucho Valdes (Cuban Pianist) and Cigala (a flamenco singer from spain)."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion its as good as the original.","review":"This whole cd kicks ass!!

GO AHEAD SAY NO WAY BUT IT IS IT REALLY REALLY IS....I HEARD IT IN COSTA RICA IN A BAR AND THE FIRST THING I DID WHEN I GOT HOME AFTER I SAW MY LOVED ONES OF COURSE WAS BOUGHT THIS ALBUM...I HAVE READ OTHER REVIEWS AND IT SEEMS AS OTHERS ARE SAYING AS SOON AS THEY HEARD THIS IN THE BACKGROUND SOMEWHERE THEY STOPPED WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND JUST LISTENED....THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID WHEN I HARD IT IN THAT BAR...YAH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I did not like this as much as I thougth I would.

A reggae version of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, but I say Who cares! This is an amazing album. This album is so amazing that if someone had never heard of Pink Floyd and listened to this, they would assume this was an original by the Easy Star All Stars. The music flows well in its Reggae rendition but never strays to far from the original. Amazing disc, great to listen to when you are just sitting around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought this CD for my boyfriend because hes a long time Pink FLoyd fan and used to be in a Reggae band (and still has a well cultivated passion for both). Its an outstanding cover, giving great respect to the original, with the new touches in Money and Time being highly amusing and with the demographic - appropriate. Try listening to it with headphones, theres a number of things you just dont hear when listening from speakers.

So it comes pretty natural to ask : Is Esther Williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook Margaret Sullavan? Was Grace Kelly's talent so overwhelming to forget that Miriam Hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as Lubitsch, Wyler, Mamoulian, Hawks and Vidor to stunning results? What was wrong with Mary Astor's acting and what is right with Kim Novak's ?Actress to me means Patricia Neal or Shelley Winters - Norma Shearer or Natalie Wood were stars....think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice book but....","review":"I received this book as a gift and starting reading it right away. An interesting little book, but there should have been other actresses added and better editing done. For example on page 95 there is a photo of Susan Hayward and Richard Conte. The caption on the photo is 'I Want to Live! 1958) unfortunatly, Richard Conte was NOT in that film, the photo is actually from 'I'll Cry Tomorrow'. A mistake like this especially from the folks in connection with Turner Classic Movies is really an insult to movie buffs! This makes the rest of the book suspect. Shame on them!

The font is awful. The size is miniscule and the color is LIGHT gray to make it even MORE unreadable. Can't review the book because I couldn't read it even with glasses on.

Would give it NO stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial self promoting","review":"The title of this book is misleading. It should be \\"The 50 Most Unforgettable Actresses of the Studio Era whose films can be viewed on cable network TCM.\\" It is by no means a definitive list of 50, because it omits the great box office champions of other studios such as 20th Century Fox and Paramount. The most obvious example is Betty Grable, possibly the greatest box office champ of all.The essays are relatively short summarising the key points of interest of each of the actresses. As a superficial volume to which you may refer when viewing TCM or as a guide for a young person unfamiliar with the Golden Years, the book has merit.

It is so informally written in such a simple way that I felt like it was meant to be a kid's book. Her constant smiley faces and other emoticons, exclamation points everywhere, and way of trying to talk to the reader (e.g. pretty bad, huh?!) is awful. I have been watching Days for 10 years now and thought this would be more about her life and the things she has dealt with then about her giving cheesey advise. At times, it acts like a self help book encouraging the reader how to be the best person they can be.

Some good acting is managed along with sporadically interesting direction, and oftimes creative camerawork, despite a trite and muddled script. William McNamara's principal expression (deer in headlights), is appropriate for his part, while Jay Acovone steals each scene in which he appears in this work, filmed completely within that assault upon the senses, Los Angeles' Skid Row. Attempts at humour are welcome, but a better script would have been necessary to make this an artistic success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"This movie is not a documentary of different explorers as the title suggests.

I followed the instructions to open the collar (pulling it apart where the safety release is). One end of the collar broke away from the safety release rendering the collar useless.

A cat could get a claw caught in there when scratching its neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"recommend against it","review":"I wasn't happy with this collar. First, I hadn't realized just how thin it would be -- I wanted small and lightweight but this is hardly wider than a rubber band. But more importantly, I think the way it adjusts for size is dangerous. When I put it on one of my cats, the extra length wouldn't tighten sufficiently so there was a gap, which she managed to get her lower jaw hooked into, so that the collar was stuck half around her neck and half in her mouth. I took it off and threw it away. Fortunately, since it's so inexpensive, I didn't throw away a lot of money.

This book didn't do the trick. Nothing that happened was funny. None of the characters were interesting, and the protagonist was annoying and one-sided at best. Once the twist was revealed, I thought the story might show some promise, but I was wrong. I'm not sure what the point of this was, or why it took so long to not go anywhere.Barry points at many of the things that are backwards in corporate America, but he does not poke fun at them. Rather, this is like an awkward list of idiosyncrasies that anybody who works for a large company has seen first hand and could probably tell in a funnier way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Overrated","review":"Barry had a good idea but the delivery is predictable, unsurprising, and not nearly as funny as I'd expected it would be based on the reviews -- the work of a young writer who isn't saying anything new. The dialogue, in particular, is atrocious -- just flat and boring -- and the characters are never developed sufficiently. If you want really smart, funny, fresh, outrageous, genuinely quirky social satire, turn instead to Thomas Pynchon, Dawn Powell, Nathanael West, John Barth, Kurt Vonnegut, even relative newcomer Jonathan Ames, or any number of other good satirists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Company","review":"I absolutely hated this book.The author is an ex HP employee and the book is a parody of that company. For my sins, I used to write adverts for HP - for nearly 5 years. Max Barry reminds me of some of the HP guys I'd be forced to spend time with - he's one of an agonisingly obvious breed of 'funny' IT guys.I can see how this book might play well in Oz and the USA. The humour is the slapstick of a third-rate sit-com. The quality of the writing is embarassing - like a teenager's blog...a collection of witticisms that Barry has overheard on the bus or worked out while playing computer games with his friends. The characters are cartoon-like, the plot non-existent and the dialogue absurd.I don't think I've ever been less impressed by the written word. This book should be burnt and Max should go back to his computer programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper-thin novel","review":"The characters in this novel are about as deep as a puddle.

However, all in all, a fun, summertime read."},{"rating":"2","title":"needs a thoughtful ending","review":"The middle of the book is very funny and, I think, moderately insightful (after the \\"twist\\" reveals more about the nature of Zephyr Holdings), but the last quarter seems increasingly pointless and unimaginative.

Needless to say I did not have high hopes, so I wasn't too disappointed.The book starts out funny and has some twists and hilarious characters, but halfway through, you find out the big secret.

I was pleasantly surprised, however, that after a couple of chapters of office humor, an actual plot kicked in.

I'm a big fan of Dilbert, and I'd say that most people who are considering buying this book also are. Now imagine a Dilbert comic (or series of Dilbert comics) stretched out to 350 pages in length. That might sound like a good idea in theory, but in practice it doesn't really work. Yes, \\"The Company\\" does contain a lot of jokes and on their own each individual joke is funny (much like a single joke in a three panel Dilbert comic is funny). However, to me it felt like the author had just come up with a large number of individual jokes and strung them together to make a story. This might work in an anthology of comic strips, but in a novel, it results in poor character development. All of the characters seemed like cardboard cut-outs to me and by the end of the book I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.

What if the corporation's whole reason for being was to test out various theories of management -- what if THERE WERE, IN FACT, NO CUSTOMERS?Barry's three novels have all sailed similar waters, but they have gotten more realistic and more believable as he has matured as a writer.

As an ardent and avid photographer of interesting women I think that Carol Mavor looks beyond the two dimensions of a photograph to see the soul of the subject...Hawarden was clearly not a woman of her time and class, but an artist beyond time. I am fascinated how well smart women can see beyond the superficial to the suprising, how emotion and sensuality is exposed through Victorian garments, or Virginia countryside naturalism.

Did not get the body cover for the phone as advertised. All I received was a car charger and a really bad headset. People started begging me to not use the headset as soon as I put it on. Neither could I hear the other person talking. I don't know how the charger works, as I never used it. The two things I bought this kit for: Headset - Extremely bad sound quality and Phone Cover - Missing from the kit; did not serve the purpose.

I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior.

You have really got to be into roots music, or be in love with the brittish blues movement of the 60's to fully appreciate this collection. Considering this music is over 70 years old, they did a great job with remastering, (which is half the fun). You can even hear when all they had to work with was an old 78 and listen as the music and vocal double back on itself. WOW!And that music-in most cases, excellent. You can hear why Clapton, Page, Beck, Mayall et al idolised these guys and gals. You'll find yourself humming Preacher gotta have some too.

Either the triangle cores are too firm or the top foam isn't dense enough to provide sufficient cushioning for my ears. I'm thinking of cutting the layer off the bottom and putting it on the top to see if that will work. I'm sure the availability of foam products has changed over the years, but manufacturers should really try their own products before they put them on the market.

However, I think it would of worked better as a loose collection of essays instead of trying to hammer everything into one main thesis.The main thesis as stated, that 1979 with the Iran revolution and the election of Marget Thatcher, is never really supported. Many of the chapters have nothing to do with 1979 being the turning point.My favorite part was the last quarter of the book, in which Mr. Wheen attacks the left defending the terrorist attacks as something that America \\"deserved\\". He draws great comparisions with the lefts defence of Stalinist russa.

It's almost a mumbo-jumbo about mumbo-jambo...The author change subjects at will, often without introduction from one topic to another.

Veronica Archer the scholar who opens an erotica bookshop is the link to the suspects. She helps him with the clues while Jack fulfils her passion. The sexual scenes stacked in a monotonous chain soon lose direction and even appear contrived, diminishing the development to the central characters. Ms. Kenner's latest lacks the chemistry sparks that her romances are lauded for and the denouement to the mystery seems far-fetched and perplexing. The romance just did not blossom smoothly with much details at hand - and also Ms. Kenner's obsession with the racy scenes. It proved too much of an overkill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"This book was worth reading. I enjoyed it very much.

I called the manufacturer to discover they didn't handle their own customer service, the folks who handle it for them had one solution: ship the entire unit back to the manufacturer to have one small, several ounce completely separate handle replaced.

I have a krups machine and the handle is much much better than this. The other problem is that it has a filter basket which is pressurized. It doesnt help and from the espressos I have been making, it doesnt compare to less expensive machines. It doesnt even come with a single espresso basket. When you use ground coffee, you end up with a basket full of water at the end because it doesnt make contact with the brew head.I wanted to like this machine because of its looks, but it really disappointed in its performance.

Cotton Malone is a wonderfully developed character and I will read additional Steven Berry books with this character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cotton Does it Again! - The Alexander Link","review":"My first go at a Steve Berry Book was \\"The Templar Legacy\\" which introduces us to Berry's newly retired agent Cotton Malone. I couldn't put that book down. Berry is a great storyteller and has become one of the books my friends and I share. We continuously introduce each other to new authors to obsess about, like Preston Childs, James Rollins, which all share a similar way to adventure, mystery and suspence.The Alexander Link once again picks up with Berry's character Cotton Malone, thrown into a grand adventure, full of clues with a few of the characters from Templar in pursuit of The Alexandria Library. Definitely a must read to keep up with the Malones if you know what I mean. *LOL*In two weeks Berry will yet again return to tell a new Tale with Cotton Malone in \\"The Venetian Betrayal\\", so if you haven't read The Alexander Link order it and if you haven't read The Templar Legacy, order both and read them in sequence. Be ready for some good fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun fast feast for the adventure lover","review":"This may not be - is not - my favorite of Berry's novels, but he's got the formula down pat and I sat there, turning page after page, and couldn't wait to get to the end of the story.

The so called historical background is laughable, as is the entire premise. All of this might have worked as pure entertainment, as in the Di vincci Code, but Berry is just not a good writer. I feel sorry for any reader that is not informed about archaeology in the Middle East or history in general. Such a poor soul might even believe this nonsense. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-Zionist rubbish","review":"Berry is far from an original thinker. His anti Israel diatribe is cloaked in a rehash of The DaVinci Code.

Maybe it is the outside pressure or time constaints put on authors with big contracts and printings.This book seems like 1/2 great idea merged with 1/2 a rush job to get out his annual early year book.It was so much a formula action adventure story. His usual thoroughness and depth is gone replaced by ridiculous double agent stuff!The story was too big and had too many players for its length.I gave 2 stars - bad book plus interesting ideas.If this book sounds interesting and you haven't read his first 3 -read any of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"The alexandria link","review":"I got this book for free when I went to a free screening of Sweeney Todd which was sponsored by The New York Times.

The story was poorly organized the author could have added some clever conversations. The dialogue was so stiff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ermmmm... No, keep your hands off that credit card!","review":"Firstly, the middle east conflict would not end if this book is true.You merely relocate the problem elsewhere in the middle east (and if I can boldly say; if this is true, the political and international crisis would be even worse!).I think I would stay away from Steve's main character in this book after this. We see him in another of his book as well (I didn't enjoy that too).The plot-within-another-plots are just too many. I doubt it's because english is my second leanguage that I lost track of the story line.At the end of my second day or reading, I gave up and jumped the pages and read the last 5 chapters. I could guess what happened in between (and I wasn't too far off after I managed to complete it).In short, not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's Political Bias ruins book with flawed historical background","review":"Blatant historical inaccuracies throw this book off-kilter right from the beginning. An unsupported reference to a contentious massacre that never happened but was attributed to the Jews sets the stage for some anti-semetic retoric, totally unacceptable in a book with a historical undercurrent. It is the first time I have ever wanted to put a book down and ask for my money back at the book store. The author does himself and his readers a disservice with this type of approach. If you can avoid the undercurrent of personal politics you might find the reading entertaining, even if a bit farfetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme pro-Palestinian antisemitic propaganda.","review":"Since the first pages this book gives you a twisted misrepresented of days prior to establishing the state of Israel. The \\"Children, women , and elders slaughtered by Jews\\" , clearly sounds like something that you could read from a Hammas terrorists web pages. I was really surprised to hear these words from the pages of accredited bestselling author. I do not understand how this propaganda was allowed to be published. Clearly someone pulled some strings... I suggest you skip this book, unless you're a strong supporter of Palestinian terrorism, and are seeking to donate your money for this cause!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"I am really tired of \\"Da Vinci Code\\" clones.

Written for a younger audience. Very shallow plot like an old serial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you ever read the Talmud?","review":"The first blunder of this book is that you can't understand the Old Testament without reading the Talmud. Here SB went far away explaining that Noah sent two different birds to check if the deluge was finished. He told us that there are problems with the story of Abraham and his sons. He hadn't have to go that far, in the first page of Genesis, the first day of creation God made the light. In the third day He made the sun so:What's the difference between the light and the sun?If you want to know you have to read the Talmud because reading the Old Testament without reading the Talmud is reading only the odd pages of a book... if you do that you won't be able to understand the book because you'll be reading only half a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"reminds me of Da Vinci Code","review":"There are plenty of twists and turns in this book to keep you guessing whodunnit till the end. Obviously it's not a good reference of \\"real\\" history but who'd read a novel to be educated, anyway? In itself, it is a fun, entertaining read. Factually, well, obviously it manipulates the truth to make the story flow. If you suffer from a constant need to read only perfectly-correct history, this is not for you. If you can set aside all previous prejudices and just let the book play out, you'll find a good ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many people wish the fiction could be fact","review":"If this had been written by a person of Arab or Muslim descent, it would probably be in the non-fiction section. Reading Mr. Card's review shows how disturbing this book really is. Especially since it is essentially the narrative of the Islamic jihadist. In reality it was the Jews in Israel that were fighting against well-equipped Arab armies. The Israelis had fewer fighters, less powerful weapons (including no heavy artillery in the start of the war) and were not backed by any other nations. They were self-reliant and this is one of the reasons they defeated the Arabs in 1948 and again in 1967."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"I really don't care about whether the book has historical inaccuracies; that's why it's called \\"FICTION\\". But what I could not stand was the plot's complete lack of plausibility. The author is almost trying to mimic the formula of the success of the Da Vinci Code but fails miserably. Da Vinci Code succeeded because it was able to interwove the historical facts and fictional aspects and made them BELIEVABLE and entertaining at the same time. However, this book does neither. Characters are very stiff and shallow, often you don't understand why and what they're doing, and the interaction between the main character and his ex wife is so cheesy that it's like reading conversations between two junior high kids. Save yourself from wasting hours of your life by NOT reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I bought this book after reading all the initial reviews (all 5-star rating) from [...] readers. After reading the first few chapters, I decided I couldn't waste anymore time. It read like a screenplay instead of a novel. Little narrative, too much dialogue with little character development, absurd plot, and the book is just not my cup of tea. Sorry, this really shouldn't even have a star at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"True to history or not - it's BORING!!","review":"Sorry, Berry, but the plot is idiotic, the research shallow, the characters two-dimensional and the writing void of literary qualities. The book brought back disturbing memories of my childhood's Hardy boys books, just like the truly silly stories from Dan Browns pen. Here we have \\"The Hardy boys and the lost library\\". Still, The Alexandria Link has one thing that these books lack - repetitions - endless repetitions. It feeds us the \\"scary\\" plot of the tampering with the original biblical texts, again and again. Who cares?! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Having read most of Berry's books, I was eager to read this one. It had an interesting sounding plotline about a topic that has not been the subject of that many fiction books - the Library at Alexandria.Sadly, it took me over 4 months to finish the books. A good initial burst of excitement and writing bogged down by about page 100, and from there on it went downhill. Characters were never really developed, the plot was very convoluted and the ending seemed way to simplistic.Luckily I was able to finish a few other books while working on this one. I think it is time of the author, whom I usually like, to take a bit of a break and come back with a much stronger effort next time. If not, it will be my last time reading his novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old thing","review":"This book continues on the same pattern as the Templar Legacy where a small bit of interesting history is used to string a whole book together. There are the same assortment of characters from the previous book including the Angry, controlling mother figure that makes me feel that the author needs more time in therapy. In this book, the bit of history is too thin to warrant 460 pages of contrived drama.Lastly, I am truly annoyed by authors who feel the need to make political snipes as part of their books. I surely won't be buying any more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story idea, weak plot!","review":"I give the author one star for the idea of turning this very interesting theory into a novel.Being familiar with Salibi's theory of the origin of the bible people, I was naturally intrigued by this thriller. I must say however that I didn't have the courage to finish it. The development of the plot is weak, with continuous shootings made the highlight, persecutions that don't make sense and rambling-ons that are even more non-sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Let The Title Fool You","review":"With the phenomenal success of the Da Vinci Code, it is no surprise that more novels of such genre surface the market. I bought this book expected to find some aspects of the Alexandria Library history, as I learnt about Da Vinci's work from the Code. To my disappointment, nothing of such nature is found here. The name Alexandria Library is mentioned only as the reference point as the origin of the Link. No other history trial is covered. The majority of the book is dedicated to the hunt of such \\"treasure.\\" The most boring part for me is when they are trying to decipher the clues, the way it was portrayed in the Code, but this time only ten percent as good. I stopped reading it after having covered about 3/4 of the book, didn't want to waste my time further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, Bad history.","review":"In just the first few pages it became clear that Steve Berry either is intentionally distorting history or doesn't know his facts. In either case, this is inexcusable. Why Berry would choose to use the historical context of this book as a tract to spew outright fallacious propaganda is really a question only the author could answer. The story itself was quite interesting but I couldn't finish the book due to the distracting and misleading historical context.For those of you who either don't know accurate Middle East history or don't care, you have a story here you will enjoy. For those who do know history as it really happened and care, you will be too distracted to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the alexandria link","review":"Great book from beginning to end.

He translates \\"The Talons of the Eagle\\" as \\"Die Klauen der Adler\\" when it should be \\"Die Klauen des Adlers\\". Also, as near as I can tell, the Autobahn which crosses the Mosel River at Koblenz is #61, not #60.His use of choppy non-sentences is quite tiresome.

A real piece of trash - spend your $$ elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Incredulous Link","review":"I like a good conspiracy theory, but The Alexandria Link is based on the incredulous theory of Lebanese writer, Kamal Salibi, who postulates that the Hebrew \\"promised land\\" is not really located in the area of Israel, east of the Mediterranean Sea, but rather further to the South, along the eastern shores of the Red Sea. He further speculates that the Jews settled there (in western Arabia) and then sometime later immigrated north to Palestine, but somehow mysteriously forgot all about it. This conspiracy theory clearly aims to discredit the historical origins of Judaism and Christianity and The Holy Bible. In Mr. Berry's attempt to emulate a \\"da Vinci Code\\" style plot, he succeeds only in duct-taping his political conspiracy idea to Salibi's ludicrous theory; and like any two things duct-taped together and left in the light of the sun, it ultimately crumbles and falls to pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written awful piece of rubbish","review":"The Alexandria Link: A NovelThe plot is ridiculous - based on a fantasy developed by a faux-historian and presented by the author as fact.

Miss Davis recorded it when she was 67 years old. I want to say something nice about this album. Ummmmm, I like the caricature of Bette on the album cover, that's all I can think of. Miss Davis has a singing voice only a drag queen could love. She can't carry a tune or stay in the right key. This album features her singing some songs from her films, as well as other material. One of the \\"highlights\\" is \\"I've Written a Letter to Daddy\\". Bette singing is bad enough, but on this song she attempts to sing in a little girl's voice.

Well, the Pumie just ate that crud right up! And it also worked wonders on the crud that was on the chrome plated sink stopper. This little thing is useful on lots of surfaces.

My toilet bowls do look brand new!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but wears out fast!","review":"Like many other reviews, this thing works on toilet rings like magic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it wears out rather quickly. By the time my toilet shined like new, a third of the stick was gone (Admittedly the toilet was quite ugly to begin with). No big deal. But buyers like you may want to know this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Vinegar instead!","review":"Think about it. If the stain is from acidity in the water taking copper from the pipes, say, and depositing it under the tap (or the like) - vinegar will wash it away in a trice. There may be other great uses for this pumice stone - but I was just scratching my porcelain bathtub unnecessarily. Someone I talked to had read a book on the chemistry of cleaning and gave me the tip. The blue washed away easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than what I expected","review":"I used a pumice stone in the past but haven't been able to find one in retail stores, so I purchased this item. It's no better than a scouring pad.With a regular pumice stone, I could easily remove a ring stain in the toilet bowl without any scratching of the porcelain. With this scouring stick, the lime stain could not be removed even though I wore down one-third of the stick just trying it in one spot. I didn't even bother to tackle any kind of rust stain.I left the stick on the shelf above the kitchen sink and, ironically, found my US Marine Corps son using it on a stain from a tuna fish can that had been left in the porcelain sink. He was putting all his muscle into it and Nada! So I whipped out my can of Bon Ami and voila! the stain was gone.He kinda took it personal. I hear him using it in the basement on who-knows-what as if he's on a mission to prove it's effective for something. If I happen to hear an OohRah! I'll let you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"I have well water and hard water. The toilets always get rings that ordinary cleaners won't take off. So i tried this and with a little rubbing the stains are gone. Wonderful product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pumice Scouring Stick","review":"In my haste to order this I did not notice it was a bar shape without a handle. These sticks were very inexpensive and I had my cleaning lady try them on the toilet bowl. She said that it worked great. We have hard well water and the minerals leave a line at the water level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for removing toilet auger scratches.","review":"I thought I'd need to replace the toilet after damage done from an auger which I used to clear a clog. Clog was gone and now the unsightly scratches caused by the auger are gone too. Great product and much cheaper than using \\"Barkeepers Friend\\" (another product that someone told me would work for this too). This pumus stick works great. The toliet bowl looks like new after only 5 minutes of scrubbing with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Stick!","review":"I had some rings in my toilet bowl and a very hard to clean fiberglass bath tub with that non-slip grating on the bottom... Well if you own one of those tubs, you know that grating starts turning dark and is almost impossible to clean. Until now, the Pumie cleaned it like new, very easily. Wow, I'm impressed! I am going to stock up on this product so I always have some around,....Love this stuff, and delivery was fast and the price is right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHAZAM!","review":"I am the guy who procrastinates. If you are too, and guests are arriving any minute, this is the only thing I have ever used that will work on almost any tub and toilette. Plus, it only takes a minute or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Save your chemicals and save the environment. This stone is making wonders to easily remove hard water deposits on toilet bowls, sinks etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked as advertised","review":"Had iron stains. Tried chemicals with no success. The pumice stone worked quickly and easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Chemicals Fail","review":"I tried using all sorts of cleaners, even using bleach to try and get the hard water deposits off of my toilet. Where those cleaners failed, the pumice stone succeeded. It did not take much force to clean the toilet like others may have said. I was on the phone with someone while I cleaned the toilet so it really was not difficult. It did not scratch the toilet and removed the hard water deposit buildup. I'd recommend this product for anyone that has an issue cleaning their toilet. I'm going to attempt to use it on my shower and expect the same positive results."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT so heavy duty","review":"I purchased this to clean my pool tile, considering the fact that said HEAVY DUTY I felt it 10 of them would do the job.It falls apart the minute that you start working. One stone lasts a minute of scrubbing, not even... I can't say enough of how it just disintegrates. So definitively NOT cost effective. I bought one big stone at my pool service store, a block like 6\\" x 4\\" and it WAS actually heavy duty that I was able to do the whole pool and have left overs. With the 10 of these I bought I wasn't even able to finish the Jacuzzi trim :("}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],O={key:0},H={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(N,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-61b1d84c"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/55.md","filePath":"glossary/55.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/55.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
