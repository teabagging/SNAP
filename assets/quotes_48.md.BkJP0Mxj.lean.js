I cannot imagine why someone would have given this book 4 or 5 stars. It is childishly written, the plot is so simplistic that I cringed and the character development (if there is any and if it can be called that)is what you would expect from a 14 year old writing this story, not an adult. I read as far as I could, 10%, and there was no need to continue as I could not stomach any longer the stereotyped, cliched characters and images and just plain silly dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing/editing spoiled a promising plot","review":"Luckily I downloaded this novel free so at least I don't feel I've been ripped off. I think the author had a great premise and the plot showed some real promise; but the thinly developed characters, disjointed construction, typos, grammatical errors, and hackneyed phrases finally got to me. I ceased hoping the book would improve and gave up at the 26% mark.I read some of the other 1 star reviews and agree with most of them, except for those which found the novel flawed simply due to course language. I couldn't care a whit about four letter words liberally used in a well-constructed book. This assemblage of words doesn't appear to have even been proof-read before it was sent off for publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious beyond belief","review":"Only good thing to be said about this book was that it was a freebie on Kindle. At least I didn't waste good money on this garbage.If the really impossible plot, hackneyed and over-stereotyped characters weren't enough, the book is replete with typos and grammatical errors that make me conclude the author is either illiterate or so eager to crank out an immediate hit in no speed whatsoever that she never bothers to edit beyond the first draft stage.When I see a courtroom quote like \\"Yes, you're honor\\" I begin to have serious doubts.Don't bother wasting neuron cycles on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned off early","review":"I was turned off early on in this book by the description of a 16 year old in jail after being arrested. First of all, they wouldn't put a 16 year old in gen pop after an arrest -- she would be in a juvenile facility or remanded to a parent. Secondly, the description of the removal of a white lace thong was gratuitous. Seriously? A 16 year old wearing a white lace thong? I skimmed some more and was totally turned off by the ongoing stereotypes. I stopped reading about a quarter of the way in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good read!","review":"I got a Kindle Touch for Christmas, and this book was my first purchase. I really enjoyed this book, and it was very difficult to put down. From the opening chapter, the author hooks you in and takes you for a ride with lots of twists and turns. Innocent? Guilty?

I went to sleep several times during the first third of the book. My husband asked me why I didn't just quit reading it. I should have. The first third was mainly narrative and boring information that should have been woven in the book itself, given to the reader a little at a time. The pace picked up a little toward the end of the book. I found myself skimming some of the boring information. Then it was mainly dialogue between the female lawyer and her ex-friend. The characters sort of blended together and if their name wasn't mentioned, I wouldn't have known who was talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"I really liked this book.

The first chapter was very interesting but shortly into the second chapter the f-bomb was thrown in my face 4x in two pages.

You could skip the first 3 or 4 chapters and not miss much. I thought the legal/courtroom part was unrealistic; how could they have gone to trial without the defense attorney thoroughly deposing all of the witnesses, the family, household staff and most importantly the defendant?This book had good reviews so I kept reading, hoping it would get better-I got about half way through the book, gave up and skipped to the last 2 chapters to find out who the murderer was. Suspenseful, it was not. Thriller, not. Just long and not very good. Frankly the ending was lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok read","review":"This story is very predictable.

I purchased this as I did not want to spend so much on the best selling authors out there so thought I would give her a try at $2.99 on my Kindle.

Forster's books before they start to charge for them!","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect in a free book but this went beyond any expectations. Rebecca Forster is clever and doesn't waste her words. Her characters and story are well developed. I don't remember feeling this way about any other book I've read but Forster describes the physical placement/movement of characters in such a simple and real way. The movement of a head, the way a person rests their hands on their thighs and leans forward, the way a person sits or stands. These mannerisms seem trivial but Forster does it so well that it gives characters more dimension.As soon as you finish this book you will want to read her next one. Get every single book by this author if you can. I can't believe that she isn't in the top 100 (paid) book list.The Mentor"},{"rating":"2","title":"hostile witness","review":"my first kindle book and i was hooked this was a good leagle thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat i could not put it down until i finished reading it.loved it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"This is a good mystery. The plot is well developed, and so are the characters, though I will admit I wasn't particularly impressed with the protagonists lawyering skills. To be able to convince myself that a pro who had once been there-done that, and once tasted heights of success as a defence attorney, could get so emotionally involved with a case, is difficult. At certain places in the narrative, she almost appeared as psychotic as the murderer!But that aside, the narrative is nice and easy to read. The mystery is intriguing enough to keep turning the page. Recommended reading for people who like legal-mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"A realistic review not based on price.","review":"This book starts strong and interesting but loses a lot ground in the middle. The story, while already a stretch, takes a detour into the ridiculous. While the author doesnt insult our intelligence by spelling everything out in great detail, they then seem to contradict that by adding scenes to make already made points. They add nothing to the plot or delivery and derail the believability even more. While lot of books seem to stall in the middle, or crash at the end. This one takes a different tact and runs off into absurd.If John Grisham books set the standard, and they're rated 4-4.5 by amazon readers, this book is rated very fairly at a 2. I think that this author shows a lot of promise but is going to need a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Issues","review":"I sadly have to agree with the more negative reviews.

The poor(or total lack of) editing, however, is a huge distraction. Misspelled words, poor punctuation, pronoun errors, etc., interrupt the reading.

Josie is a defense attorney who chucked the big time for a more quiet life. Hannah's mom, an old friend, pulls Josie back into the spotlight to defend Hannah when she's accused of murdering a judge.I enjoyed the unwinding of the plot, the characters and much of the legal wrangling in the courtroom scenes. This is a gripping thriller that will keep you guessing. Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable legal thriller","review":"This was my first book by this author. I enjoyed her knowledge of the law and the courtroom process, which were the strong points of the book. Her courtroom scenes are realistic and dramatic, and really held up the story. I also found that her characters are well fleshed out and believable. The story is somewhat unusual, in that a minor is charged with a capital crime as an adult.

The lawyer is typically either the underdog in the fight of their life or the superstar who's afraid they're going to lose the first time they actually have an innocent client. Most characters (although rarely all) are clearly on one side or the other. \\"Hostile Witness\\" adds some twists to the archetypes. Lawyer Josie Baylor-Bates is the superstar hiding from her haunted past. At first she'd rather dodge the limelight than get involved, but gets sucked in too quickly to not take the case to its conclusion. Conflicting actions and shifting loyalties keep you guessing who wants what. It's not even clear what the client wants. If this one doesn't keep you guessing you must be psychic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish, Lacking Depth, and Unpleasant to Read","review":"The diction and syntax in this novel appear to be those of a semi-educated high school student who has just discovered expletives. If you can push through the first few chapters, you will be rewarded by disappointment at the lack of depth and the continued amateurishness of both the prose styling and the story development.However, the title is in all CAPS, so, apparently, the novel is not entirely without excitement. Sadly, such excitement is autogenic and extends no deeper than the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much To Like","review":"I was looking for a good legal thriller, having been disappointed by the recent attempts by Grisham and Turrow. Amazon pointed me toward Hostile Witness, and the reviews were sparkling. There were over 20 ratings, and almost all were glowing. Plus at $2.99 (for a Kindle download) the price was right. What a disappointment.First of all, this book is in desperate need of an editor. It is filled with misspellings, and grammar poor enough to make a fourth grader blush. Then there are the characters. Most of them are painfully thin. Good, richly drawn characters can make up for a host of shortcomings; but Hostile Witness has only three characters with any depth at all. The rest are one dimensional. Lastly, the mystery itself was incredibly easy to solve. It was about as tough to figure out as an episode of Matlock.So my search for an exciting legal thriller continues. But it won't include any books by Rebecca Forster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring read","review":"This book is really hard to get into the characters are all meshed together and its boring the first 6 chapters i put it down after that. and i usually like thriller novels"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story","review":"This is a very good story.

It is full of insider courtroom details, the most fascinating of which to me was the relationship between the attorney Josie and her client Hannah. One recalls \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster,\\" as Webster takes on a case before a spectral jury, and realizes just in time that it is his own soul that may be at risk. Here one also hopes that Josie's combative and self-protecting instincts will resurface so that she can maintain just a bit of professional objectivity, and not descend to her client's addled world, wherein she could be of no help, either to her client or to herself.I rather liked Josie, a real person in a sea of Tiffanys.

The cover brags about having 11 CDs covering 19 topics. My first problem is, where is the math!? The first CD contains 3 games that deal with probability and engineering. The written explainations of the problems look they they belong on the board of a college engineering class. I searched through all the other CDs and there is no other math! What a let down.Some of the disk have programs on them that look like they were written in 1980, and geared for 6-7 year olds.

The nicely laid out subjects shown on the box (such as Pre-Algebra, Algebra I and Algebra II) had no corrolation to the titles included in the packet. Some of the disks seem geared toward 3rd graders and insult the intellect of the middle school student. Others are much more advanced (aka the Engineering (or \\"Math\\" cd) Funny the box doesn't mention anything about learning Engineering?)The graphics quality on many of the disks are very poor and do seem like they were created for much older computers. There are much more challenging and informative websites that are out there right now.

This one is by far the most clear (thanks to a very versatile adjustable boom). It doesn't hurt my ear or head like others. It comes with adapters and various sized earpieces.

Pointless high school marching band drum rolls, badly tuned toms, and an inability to get in a groove sink this record more than anything else. He simply doesn't have BIll Ward's taste or good ear. Unfortunately, the recording quality is as bad as his drumming, a muffled mess that completely drowns Iommi's guitar. The third problem on this record is that while RJ Dio did some good original work with this band, he's simply lost when he tries to do early sabbath material. His angry, all over the place style works on Mob Rules and Dehumanizer, especially the faster tempoed stuff. But for some reason, he just doesn't lock in to the old sab stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like this album, you don't know nothing about Sabbath","review":"THis is one of the worst things Sabbath ever recorded.

This is a great CD. The performances are strong. I just wish the song \\"Die Young\\" was on here. I have heard all 3 versions and to be honest nothing beats the original Warner version, 2 disc set. I don\`t like the fact that they chopped up the newer versions, taking stage banter out, removing some musical passages and fading out the song \\"Fluff\\". Plus some of the cymbals in the mix sound weird. Not much else to say. I just wanted to really promote the original mix of the warner version. The point of re-issues is to add something new to an album most of us already own.

It will not take more than one length of staples because if you try to use more than one, the slider bar that locks the staples in place will break them apart. The stapler itself will tend to try to feed more than one staple at a time and then just plane jams up. You spend more time unjaming this unit than you will using it.

Sony should be more like Koss.I gave it that extra star for its bass quality, which is deep bass, smooth & mellow. Really good, true bass can be very exciting because it is heard so infrequently. Bass depends on the speaker, the enclosure and the room accoustics for regular speakers; including where you are in the room. Headphones overcome most of these variables. When comparing headphones, I use Telarc 80235 'Fiesta'. It is a great Latin music CD. It was given a 10/10 for both recording quality and for the music quality by 'CD Mag' (now defunct) several years ago. Anyhow, this Sony has good bass vs boom, boom but unfortunately it is not of much use if it doesn't work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short!","review":"I bought these headphones to replace my old Sony headphones. The sound quality is quite good and I trust Sony brand. My main problem is that the headphone cord is too short to put your iPod in your pocket without it pulling your headphones out. I'm a fairly short person, so what the heck? They also come with a headphone extender, but it doesn't work very well. I have to fiddle with the headphone jack on the extender to make both headphones work at the same time (and generally when I put it in my pocket, one of the headphones stops working because the extender is so touchy). I will probably purchase a new pair of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item shipped is not item in picture","review":"I've ordered this twice, and both times, i received the top portion of these headphones with an absurdly chunky and obtrusive mini jack extension cable. I love these headphones to death, but to ship this monstrosity instead of the displayed item is just a cruel joke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great earbuds while it lasted - wires that is...","review":"Well I bought these 71's because of the sound quality I read about during the opinions. I planned to use these for my MTB rides and around town. Well when I got them they worked like a champ - at least for the first few months...then I noticed something happening to the wire's jacket near the buds - they were turning dirty and softer than the surrounding jacket further down the wire.A few weeks later the jacket was stretching and looks now like it wants to peel off the inner wire!That is the bad side of the earbuds from SONY.THe only good thing I can report is that the sound is the best for the price and they fit my small ear canal. I have bought others and they do not fit as well than SONYs...but with this very major issue with the wiring jacket peeling away from the wiring, I am staying away from SONY.Going to try out the V-moda Bass Freq. The cost is similar to the SONYs, I just hope that the wiring jacket last longer than Sony's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Took them for a test drive with some Townes VanZandt this AM and was very satisfied in every respect regarding performance. I have one concern, they are very fragile, almost dainty which on one hand is an attribute but they will require careful handling and should always find their way back into the cloth carrying bag after use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Durability","review":"Good sound but after very little use, the left ear bud stopped working. I used them seldom and only on airplanes but after just about 20 hours of use, the left ear bud is no longer working. I took excellent care of these, never left them in a hot car, always kept them in the protective carrying case, and they still broke. Even the hinge on the protective carrying case broke so I had to scotch tape it. Terrible durability!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for a reasonable price","review":"This is a great product. It packs a large sound in a small package. I use it when I travel. I doesn't have active noise cancelling but if you get a secure fit it blocks out just about everything, ie. loud talking, engine noise, babies crying. I also use it while I am riding my bicycle and it blocks out the wind like no other headphones I have tried.I am curious to try something from Shure but I can't rationalize it since I can buy 3 or 4 pairs of the Sony-71s for that price.My only complaint is durability which is why I gave them a 4. The wires are a little fragile. I have had the wire break on one pair but that was after 2 years and I felt I had gotten more than my fair share out of them.For the price these are great earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Clearer","review":"I find that the Headphones make the sound much clearer.. I use it both with an IPOD type music holder and with my laptop..With other headphones I was constantly having to press the headphone to my ear to get the full sound.. I do not have to do that with these..My only question is.. how do I get replacement \\"Sponges\\" if needed.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I bought a pair of these headphones based on a review I read in a magazine. It said something about being the most bang for the buck.Although I prefer the earpiece wires to be symmetrical in length, the different lengths were not a big deal for me.They look great, and the fit of the headphones themselves is very good (comfortable and will not easily fall out).The issue I have with these is the sound quality. For headphones which sit directly in the ear canal, they sound a little too muffled for my taste. I was expecting a much cleaner/crisper sound from them.Although they are not terrible, I find them to be lacking in the fidelity department.Would I buy them again? The answer is no, which is why I only gave the item 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Headphones","review":"The sound quality is great but the design is awkward. Not what I expected. They're either too short or with the extension in they're too long. Not good for exercising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones Fit the Bill","review":"These are not premium headphones, and shouldn't be compared to them (as someone has already said), but they do their job well.I bought these to replace the stock Apple's on my iPod video, and am very pleased. The neck design allows you to pull out the earbuds and leave them around your neck, and not fall to the ground, like 'y' shaped headphones will.The sound is great, nice bass, and you can hear all the details in a song that you miss with the stock Apple's.As for the complaints about fraying and durability, there are a few things you must remember in order to ensure that your earbuds have a long life. You should NOT yank them out of your ear, this leads to the fraying of the cable around the earpiece, which others here complain about. About one earbud 'going out'---that happens because it's an in ear headphone, and it will get plugged with earwax. Use the point of a pencil or other device to remove the wax blocking the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great phones, crappy hardware","review":"Over the past 3 years I have purchased these headphones 3 times. I absolutely love the sound and comfort but if you just throw your headphones in your bag or purse when not in use the wires will wear down and knot and ultimately cause one of the earbuds to stop working, happens without fail. Sure it comes with a nice little sack to hold the headphones but I use the things because I'm on the go, neatly folding the headphones when I'm getting on and off a plane or going in and out of a store just won't happen. This time I am going after another pair because I will not cough up another 35 bucks for flimsy workmanship. I never had this problem with the freebies that came with diskmans and mp3 players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I just bought a Creative Zen Micro and although the stock buds sound really good, I thought the bass to be a bit lacking and I wanted a sealed ear design for working outside . Well I put them on and immediatly noticed the volume didn't go up as loud as the stock ones which was a surprise because it isn't that loud of a player to begin with and is about the only thing I didn't like . I fiddled around with the different sizes, I jammed them in every which was but the fact is, the sound i got from these were not as clear, detailed or loud as the ones that came with my player. So I guess I'll have to move on... I really did want these to work out because I heard how well they sound. All i can say is they were pretty muddy sounding to me and my girlfriend agreed. MAybe the Shures will be next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound quality","review":"This is an amazing headphone in terms of sound quality. If you place it properly in your ears, it can provide great bass and block unnecessary noise. Normal headphones for this price do not have the same frequency range.Design of this headphone has received a lot of criticism here.. I wouldn't agree with most of them. The longer length of right ear actually allows the chord to go behind your neck instead of hanging in front of you. It frees you up to talk or walk around with the headphone in place. In addition, the short length of the main chord works great when you keep your ipod/palm/mp3 player in the front top pocket. For all other situations, you have a long extension chord that can be wrapped to desired length using the device supplied.Keeping it properly cleaned was the only problem I observed with this headphone. Since you insert it into your ear, there is a chance that the minute hole may get blocked with dirt etc. That can significantly impact sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good fit","review":"Used the first week then stopped. Not a good fit and not impressed by the sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, poor design","review":"I regret the need to give this product such a low rating, however, they have been quite a pain since the day I purchased them. In terms of sound quality, they're great. No complaints. It's the cord design and configuration that has me in fits every time I put them on. The left and right earphones are on an uneven split (the left ear piece has about 3 inches of cord where the right ear has about 12\\"). This is quite an awkward configuration, particularly considering the remaining cord length is so short that you can't actually have your music device anywhere lower than a chest or arm pocket. The extension cord is ridiculously long (so long that the earphones will actually drag below my knees when taken out of my ears even after being looped through my shirt up from my waist). The extension connection is also heavy, so it tugs on the left ear piece when not secured in some way to an article of clothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Good","review":"I love this earphones, at first the where strange to wear but I guess that i got used to it. They sound super good and are very comfortable, I use them in my bed before I go to sleep and they don't bother me at all. What i don't like is the cord, to short or too long with th extension."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good buy","review":"These headphones are not a good buy. I was just looking for somthing to replace my ipod headphones so everyone wouldn't know i had an ipod. I recived them a while ago and i was very disapointed with them. What covinced me to buy them were all the great user reviews, but i dont know what they saw in them because they didn't sound good at all. There was not much bass, and the sound quality was terrible. Plus the cord is not strong and can tear easily. Also, these dont block out sounds as much as they say it does. I've been using the ipod headphones for a while and they sound 10 times better. Im not saying these sony's sound bad because im used to better quality,but because they just sound bad period. You can deffinetly get better quality for less money as well. I used to say that sony was the best brand in headphones, but since i purchased these, i can no longer say that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extension cord is useless","review":"The actual cord on the earbuds is entirely way too short for us. So Sony added an extension cord, but when I connect it to my iPod only one ear works. This has now happened for two sets. I'm not trying for a third."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing sound","review":"Incredible how those tiny stuffs have so much bass sounds.You are completely isolated from external noises.They are especially great to listen to House & techno music.Maybe bass are a little bit too loud for other kinds of music.Anyway, I love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the purpose","review":"First of all, realize that these are not a replacement for traditional over-head phones - These are strictly for a portable player. Plug them into you're computer or sound system, and you will immediately notice how overly heavy the bass is - its like that for a reason. Most portable players have a problem with under-emphazied bass, and these headphones solve that problem. They are very comfy; after a few minutes, you will forget they are there. They also block out much of the nosie that would otherwise distrupt you're listening experience. They are ideal for listening in an airplane or car (as long as you aren't driving!). The carrying case is a nice addition (although it takes awhile to pack and unpack them. They are excelent overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply outstanding","review":"Bought these things for my mp3 player.Incredible volume level,clarity,highs are crisp, lows are punchy, midrange clear, excellent dynamic range, three different size earplugs are a plus. I wasn't sure about the wires one long and one short, actually found this convenient. NICE JOB SONY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable headphones","review":"I bought these headphones to replace the un-comfortable ones that came with my Ipod. The Sony MDR-EX71SL are not only more comfortable but also sound better, be sure to place them down into your ear canal. I would have given these 5 stars but I don't care for the design of the wires with one being longer than the other and without using the extra long extension the Ipod doesn't quite make it to my pants pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, but the wire insulation wears off!","review":"For the price, these in-ear headphones sound great. I can really hear the difference in sound quality compared to my original iPod headphones. However, the wire insulation seems very fragile. At some point, there was a nick in the insulation, and now the covering is coming off on one side. To compound this, the other headphone insulation wire seems to have gotten twisted, and now also has a nick.I really like these headphones (I got used to the over-the-neck style somehow), but using electical tape hasn't really solved the problem (it slowly comes off, scratches against your face, etc.) I use these headphones every day for hours, putting them away, taking them out, so there's definitely heavy usage. Still, I'm wondering if it's too hard to keep them in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that this product needs another review, but...","review":"I'm very happy with these earbuds. I especially like the comfortable fit and the extra long cable that can be packed away during the summer months when I basically park my iPod in the top pocket of my Scott eVest, using only the very short earbud section of the cable. I wish someone would create a decent case for earbuds though, or a retractable winding case that is durable. The case that came with my earbuds broke the second time I opened it and in any event despite its thoughtful design seemed intolerably complicated to very little benefit. These buds, especially at the sale price for which I purchased them from Amazon, are the cat's pajamas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, comfortable. Cable decaying!","review":"The sound is fine. They are comfortable.But the rubber sleeving of the cables is turning to goo. I think it's a reaction with the sun-block as it seems to be isolated to where the cable passes around the back of my neck and over my ear lobes. This is appalling for soemthing that needs to be wearable outside in sunny weather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me.","review":"After reading many positive reviews of this unit I feel my commentary is the outlier. However, I'll preface my remarks describing the music and device I used with the EX71SL earbuds as it might soften an otherwise negative review of a Sony item.Try a Palm Zire 71's MP3 capability with some Mozart or Schumann string chamber movements or a few tracks of Lohengrin, orchestral and vocal. Sound was strident, almost to the screech point to these ears. I returned them and have gone back to conventional over-the-head light headphones for a much better sound with the Palm and my MP3-encoded classical stuff.Perhaps I obtained a bad set but I wasn't willing to give a replacement pair a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I don't know if the glowing reviews for this product are Sony's marketing street team or people who have no comprehension of good sound, but these headphones are very weak and flat sounding. The ones that came with my iPod are much fuller and cleaner. And, yes, I broke them in and, yes, I inserted them correctly. Now I'm returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"They were not mean for heavy use","review":"I have used mine *heavily* since I bought them in March 2005. The fact that it has an extension cord is great: you can use the short cables to attach to your iPod in your armband without a mess. This works great for the treadmill.9 Months have passed and the left headphone is not woking very well. Just checked and it would cost me $30 to get a replacement. I guess its a bad assumtion to make that all prodcuts come with a one year warranty huh?The headphone plugs do come lose easily, so you have to watch over them when taking them out of a bag or untangling them. Sound is great, but I am dissapointed that they lasted only for 9 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound of frustration","review":"Truly the most aggravating headphones I have ever owned. The sound is really impeccable, but only for the very short time one is able to keep them inserted in the ears. They will fall out - in my experience with any of the three sizes of ear bud - at the slightest provocation. A light breeze will cause them to unseal, ruining the depth of sound immediately. Turning your head or even the weight of the cord, which is substantial with the utterly necessary extension, will pull them completely out of your ear canal in a matter of minutes. They are useless for running (I even tried taping them to my ears, which, despite not working, is stylistically ridiculous). The first headphones I have actually HATED. Only rate above 1 star because, for the briefest of moments, they also happen to produce the best sound of any in-ear style headphones I have owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound quality, but...","review":"The first pair of 71SL's I bought worked perfectly, flawless, it was like wearing a dream...until 2 months later when suddenly the left ear stopped working. I thought that I had just recieved a bad pair, so I went out and bought a new one, but lo and behold, not more then two weeks after buying the new pair, the same exact problem on the same side occured again. Even though the sound quality is excellent and it has to be the most comfortable pair of ear pieces that I have ever worn (I've slept with them in before), I simply can not recommend a product that breaks with less then two weeks of light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO bass","review":"I bought these headphones because I thought they were high quality and lightweight. I ended up having to use my cell phone wire clip to clip the wires to my shirt or else the left bud would pull on your ear. These is no bass in these headphones. Most of the reviews state good bass, but it feels like the treble is on 8 and the bass is on 2. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"More bass than my ipod earbuds, but they are uncomfortably bright. They have absolutely no midrange so vocals sound thin and sibilant. Snare drums and cymbals are so bright they cut your head off.

The sound quality was spotty, cord cumbersome and the worst was the fact that they continuously popped out of my ears. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Base response","review":"I recently purchased the above earphones as a more comfortable alternative to the standard set that came with my RIO Nitrus. The Sony earphones are indeed more comfortable but the sound quality is very poor, especially in the base range. The resulting sound is reminiscent of a 1930's radio -- Just the opposite of Sony's claim that they deliver a \\"deep bass sound\\". Even with the RIO's five-band equalizer I could not get the Sony MDR-EX71SL's to sound any better than about a \\"3\\" on a 10-point scale. To make sure the poor performance was not due to a \\"compatibility\\" issue between the Sony earphones and the RIO player, I tried the earphones on all of my portable listening devices (including an older Sony Walkman)and found that the Sony earphones performed poorly in all cases.If you are just looking for comfortable set of earphones with a nice long cord, these will do fine, but if you want better sound quality, look elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the mistake I made by ordering these!!","review":"I apologize. I should have read the other product reviews for this item before I bought them ... would have saved me several dollars and alot of trouble ... These are quite simply the most bizarrely designed set of headphones ever sold by any manufacturer. Indeed, they are simply unusable. The odd cord length makes these headphones impossible to use unless the connected player is in your shirt pocket.True, they sound terrific, but Amazon.com needs to just drop this item from the store.

I couldn't actually believe how bad they are. Do not buy these headphones. I'm shocked that Sony can charge the price they do for them. I've never written an Amazon review and didn't really imagine I ever would until I bought these.

A respectable company like Amazon shouldn't be selling these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good For Mobility","review":"I bought these and the wire leading to the left bud started coming apart. The rubber/plastic tubing around the actual wires started to get little slits in them. Then they came apart completely leaving the wires completely exposed. I thought maybe it was me being too rough on them, so I bought another pair. Same thing. Also, the wire that comes up to your head splits strangely leaving the left side WAY shorter than the right which puts the little splitter piece hanging off the left side of your face instead of under your chin - strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"great cans, _terrible_ cord","review":"Let me get this out of the way, the sound is great and the isolation is wonderful.That said, the cord is bad enough to make them all but unusable. It seems to be designed to pull the left earbud out of your ear, then the right (it's intentionally asymetrical). With the included extension it's way too long (and heavy at the join), without it, it's too short. The cord that goes from ear to ear is way too long and gets caught in things.5 stars for the part that goes in your ears, 0 for the cord. It depresses me that they got the hard part right and then snatched defeat from the jaws of victory..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valued Upgrade","review":"First and foremost, I must say that these sony's did not blow me away at first. Just as a quality home set of speakers need to be broken in to reach their fullest potential, so does the fontopia headphones. Once broken in, the sound is full and rich - rivaling my Sennheiser HD 280 pro's.I would recommend that if you were to purchase these, first give them constant play using all sorts of music for a couple of days. I didn't even use mine until I broke them in on my Zen Micro playing all genre's of music etc. Jazz, Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, and downtempo electronica.Once these are properly broken in, it's hard to beat the sony's price vs. performance value. Sure they're not true audiophile headphones, but they come awfully close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sound, disappointing durablity","review":"Enjoyed these for the brief period that they functioned -- after less than three months of gentle, once-a-week use, the right earbud quit. The sound is good, and the styling okay -- but I only got about 15-20 hours of use from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones, terrible cord, zero customer service","review":"I bought these after trying a friend's. When I got them, the sound difference from the APPLE earbuds was absolutely tremendous and I was 100% satisfied. Price to quality ratio was great. Then after a couple months I noticed that the rubber casing began to wear in certain places and then deteriorate and peel off entirely. This spread throughout the length of the headphones, exposing wire and leaving a black residue when I touched it. Apparently this is not unusual for this product. So i called big powerful Sony, thinking they would stand behind their product. The best they could do??? For another 30 bucks they would send me a refurbished comparable set. I laughed in the \\"service\\" reps ear and asked for a complaint form. I bought electrical tape and have been making bandages since. I'd like new Sony's but don't' trust them anymore. Might need to splurge for some Shurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound; horrible cord","review":"I've had a pair of EX71SL's for over a year, and the sound is great. The bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles. However, it is just right for me. I find the midrange and treble to be appropriate.I have a pair of Grado SR-80 headphones, and a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones. Each is a $100 conventional full-sized set of headphones, and yet I actually prefer the sound of the Sony earbuds.The only problem I have is that the cord is far too short without the extension, and far too long with the extension. (A free and extremely long extension cord comes with the phones.) What were they thinking? Also, the fact that the right ear's cord is so much longer than the left's is ridiculous. Don't they have a focus group review these things?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better buy some electrical tape with it","review":"Great look, very comfortable, but these headphones are disposable.

First the cable design is awful. Without the extension the cable can't even reach a coat pocket. With the extension you have at least an extra foot hanging around. But, the biggest grip from me was the weight. The cable uses a large metal oval to split the right and left earphone. This, plus the weight added by the extension, pulls the left headphone out all the time. Even if there is a fix I could try by wrapping the cord, it's really not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke 2 weeks after purchase","review":"I bought a pair of these earphones and they simply stopped playing sound out of one earpiece two weeks later.A call to Sony was of course a waste of time, as it can take hours to get through their support process, and at the end of it all you get someone who can't/won't help you.I've had enough of Sony, never buying their crap again."},{"rating":"2","title":"cord connection adds weight to one side","review":"I own both a MDREX71 and 51, soundwise they are both great, but the thing I don't like about the 71 is the connection to the cords, it adds weight to one side of the earbud. It's great for those with a volume control thingy, but if you want just a earphone to the sound device, i recommend the 51 over the 71 model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, full sound for an earbud. Less than desirable design","review":"I've been using these earbuds for about 3 months and I love them. They provide a great sound across all ranges and have a surprising bass power for earbuds. The only drawback to these earbuds is the design. The main cable is about 4 ft. long and at the end splits into a 4 inch section leading the the left-ear earbud and then another 12 inch section, meant to go behind the neck, to the right-ear earbud. I find that the connection of the earbuds to the extenstion cord (as shown in the picture) is relatively heavy and pulls the cord down sometimes and gets caught on clothing sometimes. Since the cord hangs primarily from the left ear, it gets even more awkward. Winding the cables up, such as around an mp3 player, also causes them to tangle. I have often gotten very frustrated by the annoying design of these headphones, but I can't bear to part with the compact porbale design and phenomonal sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"this buds for you","review":"I have had mine for over 2 1/2 years. Im a painter I work with lots of loud machines all day, from my paint sprayer to the sander. these buds are very good. they are comfortable enough to wear all day I generaly work 8-12 hrs a day and use them for at lest 6-8 hrs. they have one of the best sounds i have had out of a headphone. I bought some boss ear buds a while back and that were over $100.00 but the sound difference was not worth the extra cash i forked out. the long cord can be anoying ive just learned to cary a small ruberband with me and tuck the extra into the pocket with my ipod.and if you wear the headpones with the wire behind your head it dosnt bother you at all. I dont know what people are saying about the wires rubbing and making noise. mine dont. you should buy them. save yourself some cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sound, horrible quality of cord","review":"When I first got these headphones they sounded great. Fast forward six months, and they still sound great. One major problem: the rubber coating on the cord is disintegrating and turning into a black sticky goo.

These Headphones are not known by Sony to be defective in any way and we are not aware of an issue.\\"All i ask is for it to be replaced and I would be happy with these headphones. For the money they sound great. But the craftmanship is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wire insulation problems","review":"I used these headphones walking around campus and at the gym. The wire insulation around the long wire that goes behind the neck started to get really soft and pliable and eventually fell off. Some other people had been having the same problems.

I've worn for 6 hours on a plane and forget they are there. The sound blocking is excellent - great for airplanes, etc. The sound quality itself is fine (but personally I'm not an audiophile and I'm probably as happy with $15 as $80 phones). But the durability is POOR. Within 8 weeks, the thin, smudgy rubber cords were fraying and peeling BOTH near the jack and near one earphone. This is BAD NEWS. How did Sony make such a basic engineering flaw? I have $5 phones that last indefinitely, at least the basic insulation on the cord. Others have reported this too; I wonder how many favorable reviews were written by owners in the first month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality, good fit, great price","review":"I wanted one of the Shure versions of these headphones but couldn't resist the price of these. I'm pleasantly surprised. The sound quaity is very good. Others have said that Sony enhances the bass, which may be the case, but it still sounds very nice.

Other then that they are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had it right the first time","review":"I've been dedicated to the MDR-ED21LP for quite some time now, but after comparing the spec's (I admit the gold vs. nickel plug had me convinced to upgrade) it seemed the newer model (EX71SL) may offer some benefits. I like that the plugs are not L/R ear dependent and they fit snugly into your music hole.I was sorely disappointed with the sound and most especially the power (loudness). I've never reached 25 on my dial (NomadIIc) until I plugged these in for the first time. Problem really is that there wasn't even a glimmer of difference between the volume at 18 or 25, still the same. Not even close to being loud enough for me.I can't fathom why you'd pay more for the EX71SL, and the older ED21LP's have lasted me at least 4 years.First Sony purchase I've ever been completely disappointed in. I'll keep them as a backup, otherwise they're useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony MDR-EX71SL earbuds","review":"I found that these earbuds sound very good. The cord is a little of a problem keeping untangled. But I think you have that problem with most earbuds. Otherwise they are very comfortable. Just hope they are durable because I did not have them very long yet. But I use them every single day."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"I can't imagine anyone being happy with these. I did the research (Amazon reviews + the kid at the local Circuit City). I am so disappointed with the sound. NO Bass at all. The standard iPod phones sound 100% better than these. I tried adjusting EQ and the different sized ear buds but the sound was just terrible. I am returning these tomorrow. BTW, I'm not very picky and don't return items very often, but these are just bad and surprisingly so since they are Sony. Definitely avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound/Bad Design","review":"I bought these headphones in early 2004 and have wanted to write a review since I got them. This morning, I lost a final rubber ear bud cover leaving me with just the other one rendering the headphones useless... I think the set came with 6 rubber bud covers of various sizes and 5 of them came off either taking my ipod out of my bag or pocket. Besides that, the cord is too long and the piece that connects the long cord to the short cord makes it awkward to walk and bike with because of its weight. I don't understand why they even have this option of different lengths because the short cord connected to the ear buds is way to short to use alone. I would not buy this product again but would be interested on where I can get new rubber ear bud covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned them","review":"I bought these for gym use with my MP3 player, but I really didn't like them and have returned them. Bass was strong, almost overpowering. Midrange seemed quiet by comparison. Upper ranges were kind of tinny sounding to my (non-audiophile) ear.They were comfortable to wear sitting still, but the weight of the plug, combined with workout sweat, made the left phone keep losing its seal. The cord was strongly microphonic - I couldn't stand using it on the eliptical trainer without weaving the cord down my back under my shirt to keep it from bouncing around.I know these are inexpensive phones, but their quality pales in comparison to my over-the-ear open Sennheiser PX-100s, which cost just a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as others say","review":"Decent Bass, very limited high range, distorted midrange.Did improve as time when on, but not that great as others describe.better than my existing in ear headphone.Full size headphones used are sony MDR-V6, not even close to these headphones.Very stupid short cord, too short for any device or person.Excellent noise reductionIf you accidently yank out an earpiece, it is a very painfull event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Sound with an Ipod Mini","review":"When used with my IPod Mini with the equalizer set to Rock, or any other setting, the sound is very tinny with very little base. OK for listening to the spoken word as in Old Time Radio shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Houston","review":"I bought these earbuds to replace the iPod stock buds from Apple. Several people reviewed that these sounded superior than the standard iPod buds. The sound from the Sony MDREX71SL was very tinny. The base was extremely poor. I don't know if someone from Sony signed on and tried to pump these up or what, or perhaps someone was comparing them to other $35 earbuds, but compared to the Apple iPod standard buds, these are as poor as those that come with the Audible device sold for listening to voice. These are extremely poor for listening to music with deep base requirements. Save your money if you have the buds that come with the iPod, or perhaps check out a more expensive set of phones/earbuds.Brad in Houston"},{"rating":"1","title":"They were great until they died young","review":"When I got my ipod, I found the Apple earbuds to be very uncomfortable and they had poor quality sound--especially on the bass end. I upgraded to the Fontopia earbuds, and I loved them. The earbuds were very comfortable (except for the weird asymmetrical cord), and the sound was wonderful. The Fontopias had clear, crisp, full-range response.Alas...after only five months--a full 60 days after the lame 90-day warranty expired, the earbuds lost all sound in the left side. I jiggled the cord and sound was temporarily restored, albeit with static and distortion. For what these cost five months ago, which was about twice what they go for now, I am very disappointed and more than a little ticked off that they died after just a few months--especially because I only use them at home when I read in bed at night. That's hardly serious wear-and-tear. Time to shop for something new and it won't be a Sony product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sound, but WAY TOO SHORT cord length","review":"I had to replace a pair of MDR-EX51LP because one side gave out after 6 months of rugged use. Not blaming Sony for that even if many have complained about it. I thought I would upgrade to the MDR-71Sl cause the number is higher right? I have these in my ears now since they were delivered today. Sound is great! Crisp high notes and decent not deep Bass. If you get new earphones you should get in-the-ear style like these. They are VERY comfotable. My problem is that I use these at work and wear them inside my coveralls down to my pant pocket. The cord on this is only long enough to reach my shirt pocket. You do get an extension cord, but I don't want that! The jack will either get pulled out or be in the way when I carry things. If you need some cord length past your Chest or Arm, get the 51's. They use the same 9mm driver and I can't tell much difference in sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, Awful durability!","review":"The sound is great as it is described in the other reviews - but that's not the problem. The plastic encasing for the wires literally started to deteriorate on mine after about 2 months. I found out one of my co-workers had the same problem with the same product, and she had contacted Sony's customer service - where she was told that they would fix it for 30 bucks. That's more than what I paid for them brand new here on Amazon. I was listening to my iPod with my earphone wires completely exposed like some industrial high-tech design until I found a spray-on plastic coating to take care of the poor vulnerable wires. I only decided to write this review since I wasn't the only one with the same problem. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this product until Sony fixes the problem. 30 Bucks!? Get real, Sonny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Quality","review":"i purchased these headphones because i thought that being a SONY product, it would be of high quality. i have a DELL Jukebox MP3 player that has a 1-20 volume range. I usually have my volume at the 17 level, and after about a week of use, the left head phone is busted. it sounds like it has been blown out, and when i shake the headphone to see if something is loose, i can definately hear something moving around in it while the right headphone is solid. So..., i am very dissapointed. they ran me about $25, and i am not a happy camper."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy cord?","review":"I bought these in March and they have worked well until last week, when one earbud stopped emitting most of the sound. I suspect it is the flimsy cord, although I do not recall any sudden jerks and I certainly haven't abused them. I agree that the cord is too short and the extension too long and they would have done better to make a longer cord without extension. I bought previously a pair of Sony's noise cancelling earbud phones (very expensive) which have worked fine, but I wanted something a little less cumbersome for everyday use. The difference in the gauge of the cord is phenomenal, as the noise cancelling phones have a much thicker cord. Sony would do well to put the same gauge cord on these phones, but I guess they are trying for repeat business when these break down and attempting to save cost on manufacture. Not for me, too expensive to buy these every 5 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 4th time is a charm!","review":"I gone thru several brands, and a lot of cash, trying to find that combination of function and form. These earbuds come with 3 sizes of 'ear plugs', and the small ones actually fit. What a relief! I took a while, but I finally found a pair of earbuds that fit AND sound great! I have been listening to my MP3 player everywhere from work to the beaches of Cancun, and have been extremely happy with the sound quality and comfort. You won't be disapppointed if you buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it.","review":"Yes.. its Sony but still not worth it.We buy things for practical use and this is not designed with that in mind.Sound is pretty ok for the price but its almost impossible to use it in practical life.The cord is too short or too long. There is no choice but to use the extension wire and then the wire becomes so long that you got to tie it with Sony's new mechanism but then the headphone falls down every few minutes due to weight. Aaah ..The case given with the earphones is a joke. I just can't fit the entire earphone with the extension cord in it.Consider buying the lower version 51LP model. You will save $5. You just wont get that stupid case. I think that model comes with regular length wire.I have used it for a month and fed up.I am shocked and surprised Sony delivers such product !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but BROKE after only three months.","review":"I only use these earphone while sitting at my desk at work crunching numbers. No movement and these the right earbud just stopped working after about 3 months. Not acceptable at all since these things have never been strained at all....buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Flaw...","review":"Let's be clear- these are incredibly comfortable headphones that sound great.Problem is they fall apart after about two weeks of use.The first time I thought it was a fluke, and I bought another pair, then another. On all three the insulation turned to jelly after a couple weeks and exposed the bare wires... I've returned them all because they're still under warranty, but Sony needs to scrap the existing stock and get these manufactured with proper wire insulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, terrible craftsmanship! Avoid.","review":"Bought these and within three months, the rubber rotted away exposing the wiring and the sound went away in the left ear. Definite quality issues with this one. Do avoid.*I wrote a kinder, gentler review for this emphasizing the issues, but it wasn't accepted. Perhaps this one will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound but terrible cord quality","review":"I've gone through two pairs of these in about an 8 month period. I loved my first pair but within a couple months, the cord disintigrated to the point where the wires were exposed in a couple places. I thought I just had bad luck and bought another pair, THE SAME THING HAPPENDED. I held on as long as possible to buying a new pair of earbuds by trying to tape up the exposed wires, but they kept breaking. They are great buds, crisp clear sound great bass for earbuds, but the cord quality is miserable. Save yourself the hassle and money of having to buy a new pair every couple months and look at the Sennheiser CX 300. They sound better, look better, and are constructed MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for active people","review":"When I had read all of the reviews of these headphones I was pretty excited to try them out. When I opened them up and listened to them sitting at home they sounded great! Then I went for a jog.......a totally different story. Once the earphones are in place they do a great job of cancelling out sound but any movement of the cord at all (bumping against your shirt while running) transmits the sound directly to your ears. Anybody who has used a stethoscope will know what I'm talking about. While running (even walking) you hear this constant loud bumping sound being transmitted to your ears. I cannot believe that I haven't heard this mentioned before, its pretty significant. For sitting at home their great but if you plan on moving your body at all, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you exercise, this is not for you!!","review":"Great sound, but the cord is too short, even if you use an MP3 player on an armband. If you turn your head while exercising, you will pull the left ear bud right out. The right one has a longer cord and will hold. They do give you an extension cord, but it is too long and the connection point is too heavy. The excess weight will also pull on the earbuds and the left one (with the shortest slack) will come out. On a five-mile ride/run I had to readjust this set several times. If not for the amazing sound, I would have given this product just one star. It would be a good set of headphones if you listen to music while lounging indoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for big ears","review":"I must have ear canals that are much larger than average, because even the largest sized attachments for these earbuds aren't big enough to fit snugly in my ear canals. Thus, it produces a very tinny sound with no bass at all.I would think Sony would try to include attachments that would fit well in most people's ears, but maybe I'm just a freak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Based upon the mostly positive reviews, bought these. Not very good. The silicone (or whatever) earbuds are very comfortable, but that's about all there is that's positive to say.Very tinny and anemic. No range at all. Ultimately, they sound lousy.I bought these as a replacement for the phones that cames with my Iriver HP-120 Mp3 Jukebox, but these earphones are very clearly inferior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good as headphones","review":"Sorry, but if you are looking for straight up headphones go get some jbuds. The cord on these are way too long and I simply wasnt a fan of the product all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones. Great value.","review":"I think these have got to be the best headphones for the money out there. I've had mine about a year and an super pleased with them. From great sound, great comfort, I am very happy. I mainly got them to use on flights where I was sick of the engine noise breaking in to the music. I had been using some over ear headphones, but needed something smaller. Much smaller. Enter these sony's.I will concur with one review I read below - the rubber that houses the wires broke down on my and exposed the wires. Annoying, for sure, but I'm just getting another pair. It took them a year and a half of daily use for this to happen, so I am not concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it breaks","review":"This pair of headphones is great for using with an iPod remote. My left bud broke after less than one year with very careful use (I always used the case and placed the headphones in a padded pocket). After problems like that, I don't think I'll buy another pair as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound, comfortable, best value","review":"I am a construction guy with an MP3 player jammed in my pocket. My phones and player take lots of abuse. These phones are comfortable enough to leave in all day (watch your volume) and the big sound quality is the best you can get in midrange pricing. They are are positively the best fidelity for the money, especially now that the original $50 price has dropped. I've been plugged into a Sansa e260R for 9 months now and these phones make it a perfect setup. Try them out - they're cheaper now!One drawback: when I snag my earphone cord on a nail or a 2X4 it pulls hard on the little plastic Y-connector. The plastic eventually slid down and exposed the soldered wire joint. This joint has taken some strain and now crackles a little. I think the fix is to glue the plastic slide back into position. Most people won't have this problem, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well designed","review":"Noise cancelling only good feature. The shortened Left side cord and then silver ball that divides right side and left weights down the cord and makes it impossible for earphone to stay in your ear with any activity like working out. Length of regular cord far too short, extended cord is way to much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value headphones","review":"I prefer earbud style headphones, and considered purchasing very pricy alternatives from Bose and others. I settled on Sony due to prior experiences and price. I use my iPod every day, and I admit I am a bit rough on my headphones -- I prefer to wrap the headphones around the iPod vs. wrapping them up nicely in a case. These headphones sound great and put up with the abuse. I can use them daily until they finally break without worrying about the fact that it would be very expensive to replace them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Ear Bud Review","review":"I bought these earbuds in the last 2 months and one of the earbuds has already gone out. They are very cheaply made, I would not recommend buying unless you just need a fix for a few days until you can buy a reliable pair of earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones","review":"just ordered my third pair. not because they're falling apart... no issues with cable rubber for me... but because my girlfriend stole my second pair! (also love the uneven cable lengths to hang them around my neck)shorter length without the extender allows me to use my ipod shuffle at the gym by clipping it to my shirt without having lots of excess wire tangling up all over me. all in all... great for the price. also own a pair of shure e2c which are much more expensive. although highs and mids are not as good with the sony's, they're still very nice and i have recommended to many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, poor quality, not what I expected.","review":"Let me state first off, I absolutely love these headphones! The sound is great and they are quite comfortable. These particular headphones however, are not just headphones. Somewhere in the description I missed that they came with a microphone and a 2.5mm jack (with a 3.5mm adapter). The problem is, this adapter is just a short extension and the weight of the adapter pulls the cord where I plug it into my computer. So, over the past few weeks, the wires have been pulled out and I no longer have sound in the left earbud, and will soon loose sound in the right as well. If you want these great headphones, look for the true Sony Fantopia headphones, not some junk set that was built to use with a mobile phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, Not Bad At All!!!","review":"I am what you'd call a prudent consumer and I never buy expensive items on a whim. 50 bucks for a pair of Earbuds, yeah they're expensive. So after reading the other reviews (of which consist of useless information factoids formulated to whoo the reader...please) I decided to purchase them at the wonderful Amazon price I got them for. To make a short story shorter, I LOVE THEM! They are the best headphones I've ever had and I've had my share. They work best with a Minidisc player (any will do) and you don't need much to get these bad mama's singing sweet songs in your ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, great value","review":"A good fit is the key to these magnificent headphones sounding as intended. Once you have found a snug seal with the pads, the sound is amazing. Brilliant highs, deep lows and no muddy mid-range.

AND, what a great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad wire insolation...","review":"I would give 5 stars for that product till last month... Very comfortable, great sound quality etc... But last month the insolation of the wire started to come off...

The plugs did a good job blocking outside sound. But within a month, the sheathing covering the wires disintegrated where there was contact with the skin. I then bought the more expensive EX71SL and again the sheath disintegrated. I expect better from SONY. (I filed a similar review on the EX51LP.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"EX51s better and cheaper","review":"There's no reason to get the EX71s when the EX51s are $10 less, plus they come with a 4 foot cord. The 71s require an extension cord if you want the headphones to be more than 12 inches away from the source. This extra connection adds weight and decreases sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for Sony","review":"I read the reviews on his product and because of the price I thought it was worth a try to replace my IPOD earbuds. Unfortunately, it was a disappointing result. Not only were they uncomfortable, the sound was not that much better than the IPOD's and the long cord that you are forced to use, was perplexing and poorly designed. I have them in a draw somewhere and looking at maybe the Bose or higher end sound canceling headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy quality","review":"Just like several other reviewers, I experienced a sudden loss of signal in one channel - in my case, it came after about 10 months of light use.

Looks like the extensions are defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound Quality - Poor volume and comfort","review":"I bought these headphones to replace the not so great ones that came with my iPod. The sound quality is great, which is expected form Sony. However, the volume needs to be considerably higher than with the standard headphones to get he same amount of sound. Considering battery life is already an issue with iPods, whis only makes it worse. Also, after only a short while, they begin to make my ears sore, even with the smallest bud on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled again","review":"Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product. These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible \\"surrounds\\", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable. But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say. Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Comfort is tops, but I think I would go so far as to say the specs for this headphone are a lie. On none of the several players I use is there any change whatsoever (contrary to other phones) in the sound with changes in EQ (likewise for Koss' similar pair, by the way)--that's telling me that bass and treble are beyond the scope of what these can reproduce, and that's what my ears are telling me,too. Transparency is lacking, as well.They're much cheaper, and I know they don't have the glamor, but Sony's MDR-W08L phones deliver more sound for the $$$, though not at the same comfort level. I keep looking for (and buying) sealed in-ear phones that promise deliver better sound than the MDR-W08L for anything like a reasonable price, and I haven't found them yet. Look, the MDR-W08L costs peanuts--Sears has them for seven bucks in their stores. Buy a set and use them for comparison--see if you don't agree that they're hard to beat. These aren't the ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds great but...","review":"These things sound great but.. the way the wire is set up, longer on one side than the other is quite anoying.

I have been using Sennheiser HD580, an audiophile grade headphone, and its PX250, a noice cancelling headphone, a Sony wireless headphone, a high grade earphone by Panasonic, a JVC headphone and many earphones that come with the gadgets including my ipod and a Sony net MD player. The sound quality of the Sony MDR-EX71SL is disappointing particularly at this price. It basically boosts up the bass that probably pleases some but I found it annoying when you really look for an accurate reproduction of the original recording. The exaggerated bass or one note bass, whatever you call it, is not what I would recommend. Now I might try to see if Shure E3C will do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"iPod Users BEWARE!

Although this product came with some replacment buds in different sizes it came with only one each, what good is that. Ear bud headphones are a gamble, it's like buying underwear. You never know how they will fit until you get home to try them on, and then no one else will want to try them on.

But, the cord wears out quickly exposing the bare wire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound and fit, terrible build quality","review":"As far as I'm concerned Sony owes me a free pair of these. I originally bought the EX51s and they failed at about 6 months. I replaced them with EX71s and they failed in about 6 months. Both times on the left side. They just die. This is a VERY common complaint and Sony hasn't improved the durabilty. I'm tired of the Sony tax.I've noticed alot of people like me however who must be slow learners. The way they fit and isolate one from outside noise when out and about seduces one into buying another pair when they fail, only to have them fail again.Too bad Sony is so irresponsible as to (seemingly) ignore these design problems.Other comments:Annoying asymmetrical cord arrangment that (no doubt) contributes to the cord's failure.The EX71's have a too short cord and a too long extension for the cord. Neither seems a good length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value when used correctly","review":"One word sums up these headphones: Wow.All of the problems being stated by other users is strictcly because of misuse, they need to be put ALL THE WAY IN in order to get bass. Also, they need to seal in your ears, they give multiple bud sizes, try another set of buds. Lastly, about the cord, it is designed to be worn around the back of your neck, so when you take out a side, it doesn't hang down below your belt.I feel that these headphones are better than over-ear headphones in the price range of 150 dollors. They are great for use with computers, and I have been using it with my iPod, and it sounds great. These headphones are by far the best in-ear headphones i've used, and are a great buy for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in class...","review":"The best I have used in the small in-ear category, better than some very expensive ($400) professional in-ear monitors I have used. The only small criticism is the high treble is a little bright, but that could be a good thing if you have trouble hearing high frequencies. Otherwise, these phones are excellent with deep bass and excellent all around detail. The in-ear design might bug some people. I have to take them out and scratch every now and then, but all and all, worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"The audio quality was much better than my previous headphones. But after about four months of occasional use, the right headphone died.The warranty is 90 days. Judging from the other reviews, you're lucky if they last that long. Once the 90 days are up, Sony will exchange them for a refurbished pair for $28.64 (more than the cost of a new pair on Amazon). No thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like them.","review":"I bought these when I got my new MP3 player, and after 5 months of use the right side magically stopped working (after reading some of these reviews it seems this happens frequently), I say stay away from these if you're going to use them with an MP3 player. Also the chord design is stupid, like some one already stated..with out the extension..the chord is way too short and with the extension the chord is super long, very annoying.Stay away from these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Shocks","review":"First off, I am not a Sony hater. In fact, I would highly recommend the Sony Fontopia MDR-EX51LP in place of these earbuds. Although the sound quality is extremely good (same as the other earbuds I mentioned), the connector for the cord is terrible. Not only does it call weight issues when walking or jogging with the 2 pieces connected, but because the metal is exposed, the earbuds pick up static when it moves against cotton. Plus, it causes shocks. I have been shocked once on my arm where the connector touched me and 3 times in my ear. This is unacceptable. I'm throwing my pair out and buying the older model. Stay away from this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound is very good but fit is awkward","review":"I bought these after reading the Amazon reviews. The sound through the headphones is good. However, the fit with any of the three different size rubber earbud covers is awkward and the earbuds fall out of my ears when running or biking or weightlifting. Of course, all ear shapes and sizes are different, but I would strongly recommend you attempt to try these for size elsewhere before ordering online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for my commute","review":"I use these for my daily 45-minute commute on the bus. I had previously used the earbuds that came with my CD player, but I was turning up the volume so much to block out the noise of the talking and the bus engine that I thought I was going to lose my hearing.These are ideal for my commute because they block most but not all of the noise for my commute. So, I can still hear the bus start and stop, but it's muffled in the background and my music is in the foreground. I'm not so cut off from the world that I miss my stop, and I don't have to turn the volume up so loud that I'll be deaf before I'm 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"Please do not purchase this product. It was great for the first six months. The sound was crisp, bass was good, and I was for the most part shielded from outside noise. But the rubber insulation around the wire apparently rubbed off completely exposing the wires. I take excellent care of all my electronics so do not take this as an indication that it isn't a product-specific issue. Save the money and purchase something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony earbuds","review":"Great product, bought them for use while overseas, good sound/noise cancellation, great for loud airplane rides, getting sleep in crowded or noisy environments. Decent sound, good bass, well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pair of earbuds","review":"I've had these earbuds for over 2 years now and I love them. I use them with my MP3 player, listening to audiobooks mostly when I take my dog for a 3 mile daily walk. These are by far the most comfortable, high quality earbuds I've ever owned. I recommend them highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great sound","review":"Fit well but did not sound great. Cheap/generic headphones sound better but if your looking for fit vs. sound quality - they were okay.Would not recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they break","review":"I really like the sound that these inexpensive buds gave until one of them conked out. Thinking that perhaps this was just bad luck or a fluke I returned to Amazon to buy another pair but see that this problem has occurred with other customers so I'm going with a different make and model--Sennheiser CX 300 as they are similar in price, rated well, and no mention of any problems with them breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, better than Shure SE110","review":"The sound coming out of these phones are excellent, good for electronic and rock music. Clear bass and mids. The unfortunate thing is that the rubber glued to the buds eventually lose their grip and begin peeling off after over a ear or 2's use. The sound quality is much better than Sure's SE110, and half the price. The rubber tips do a decent isolation job for the price. You will still hear subway noise, but it'll be 7-15% less bothersome compared to earphones that don't go in your ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me . . .","review":"Maybe it's just me, but these haven't lived up to my expectations. The sound doesn't seem that much better than the ear buds that came with my MP3 player. On top of that, I can't get them to stay in my ears. I have really small ear canals, so again maybe it's my fault. Even when using the smallest set of ear plugs I can't get them in fair enough to block out ambient noise and they fall out every time I move my head. I would not recommend these headphones for people with small ear openings."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats the point of an earbud without wires?","review":"I bought these earbuds based on the decent reviews they got from most people. I saw the warnings about the wires fraying when you use these in intense situations like working out. I figured I only need them to listen to my computer while sitting at my desk so I wouldn't need to worry about the wires fraying on me. Wrong! I've used this headphones for maybe 6 weeks just sitting at my computer desk and I already have the insulation totally worn away on a section of wire and now its a matter of time for it to rip and become useless. Apparently the minor actions of just coiling and uncoiling these headphones for starage is enough to wear away the wires over a matter of just 6 weeks! This is in-excusable quality and I expected alot better from Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this one in Jan. 2006. The sound quality was fine then. I only used it occasionally. In May 2006 I found out that the left earbud died. It only comes with a 90 days limited warranty. I thought Sony could do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - bass ok but too much treble and NO midrange","review":"I was really looking forward to getting these headphones. The IPOD standard cans are ok but lacking in bass, and from the reviews here I thought these would do the trick.No such luck... The bass is ok as long as you push them in hard enough (I'm not sure what my doc would say about that), but there is FAR too much trebble for comfort, and where's the mid range gone???OK I listen to a lot of acapella vocal stuff which is pretty testing, and maybe it's not so obvious when listening to Red Hot Chilli Peppers. However I think this is a seriously flawed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service problem","review":"While I enjoy the comfort and clean sound, the extension cord was defective from the package. The pigtail on the speakers is too short to use exclusively. All attempts to get a replacement without delivering the cord to an authorized repair facility failed. The closest facility is 3hrs. one way from me and mailing was not an option, nor is the extension available as an option. Sony's repair service policy is unacceptable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fontopia","review":"Decent quality buds but the cord system is God-awful. If you don't use the extension, the cord is only like a foot long so you can't have your iPod or whatever in your pocket. If you use the extension, it's adds another 3 feet and it's way too long, not to mention you have to use an adapter to plug into a standard mini jack in any MP3 player. Ridiculous. Total waste of money, wish I'd bought the next model up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This earphones are awful. It's like a frigging Lego- it has 3 pieces you have to connect one into another. The phones itself have a VERY short cord so you have to connect it to the extension that is SUPER long and has a mic with a button. Seriously, when was the last time anybody needed one on earphones? But that is not it just yet, it has another small cord( couple of inches long) that has to be connected to this whole structure to be able to plug it in the player. you cannot skip any of those part so the options are either use a very short cord or play Lego (earphones first, then extension cord with a mic, and then the small connector cord). When pulled on the cord even slightly, one of the connections would go weak, distorting the sound. I can see it breaking( or me breaking it lol) in a couple of months.Don't waste your money. I wasn't able to return it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 4 ft long, more like a foot w/o da extension","review":"I wish I could use it w/o the extension, but I have to use a different extension, one without the 4th electrode, I wish I bought 3 sets of mdr-ex51, they are the best, after over 5 years of use and going into the washing machine accidentally, they are starting to short-out, I will miss the mdr-ex51"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Sounding, Horribly Made","review":"I've had two pairs of these. The sound is decent, it's a little heavy on the bass, and the highs are pretty shrilly, but they are definitely a good pair for 10 bucks. The problem I have is that these are by far the worst headphones quality wise. I bought one which lasted for a couple of months, and the second died after four days."},{"rating":"1","title":"purchase another","review":"sounds ok for the money but the thing comes in several parts to short in some areas and to long in others i dont know what they were thinking when they came up with this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small problem","review":"I got the headphones as i need a replacement for my old ones. these fit and sound the same but the cord on the headphones is very short. the extension that it comes with has a mic on it and when i plug it into my phone, it does not fit all the way and makes it so only one head phone works. i only wanted headphones with a decent length cord and this did not fit it for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terribly designed product","review":"All headphones and earphones fail, its a fact of life. And they usually fail due to stress at the connection points. So you can imagine my horror when I opened up these after getting them in the post to find out they consisted of three different sections all to be connected together to get the required length. There was the earphone bit, with a short lead and a 3.5mm jack, the next bit was an sufficiently long extension bit that ended in a 2.5mm jack so wouldn't fit any normal mp3 player so a small adapter was required.And just to prove how badly they were designed I only got sound out of one ear. Through a bit of testing I worked out that it was actually the last bit that failed as I could get sound from both ears using just the first bit, but then I would need some sort of neck strap to carry my mp3 player.I expected better from Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic...before they break","review":"I've owned two pairs of these delightful little buds from Sony. I absolutely love them, until they break. A few months into using them, both sets have cut out on me. I'm not hanging from them, using them as a jump rope, or flossing with them; I'm just using them whilst at the gym and when riding the bus. They are super comfortable, have a surprising amount of bass, and have great sound quality, but they just don't seem to last. If you can baby them and treat them like a faberge egg, I'm sure you'll love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Sound quality was great and a gret upgrade from the stock ipod earbuds, but these only lasted me a couple months. The wiring peeled off almost the entire length of the headphones. I tried using electrical tape, but it only got worse. If you like spending money on garbage then go ahead and buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Flimsy - Broke in 2 Weeks.","review":"These broke on me after just two weeks and I therefore wasted $50 on headphones with just average sound. The problem is with the very thin wires. I never pulled them out by the wire, mostly just listened to them in bed at night - yet in such a short time the right headphone stopped working. Sony must consider this to be a disposable product, it certainly was not made to last. I was trying to save some money, but should have gone with Shure. Sony customer service was of no help to me by the way, nor was Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I purchased these for my iphone and quickly realized that they were garbage. I did homework and read reviews and these were supposedly better than a pair that I had heard (which I liked). Not even close. The volume level was low, static when connector moved around, and overall sound was just not good. I'm not sure if all of these are the same, but the pair I got was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing sound - terrible usability","review":"these headphones have the best sound i've ever had in a pair of headphones - i couldn't be any happier with them.although...1) the cords tangle easier than anything i've ever had and they're NOT easy to untagle,2) the carrying \\"case\\" is a joke,3) the cord length is way too short without the extension and way too long with it,4) there's nothing that enables the cord to be secured to jackets or shirts so the weight of the cord tends to pull the buds out of the ears, AND5) after six months of having them (white) the cord is starting to dissolve and expose the wires. yeah, it's actually disintegrating... nasty.as much as i love the sound on these babies, i really can't recommend them to anyone... fix the design sony and i'll sing your praises once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Durability","review":"I too read all the great reviews on these headphones and yes, when it comes to sound quality and comfort, they were great. I bought them here at Amazon when they were going for around $40. Within a month of normal use on a laptop (no stress), one side stopped working completely and the other side gave out after 3 months. Nice sound but definitely not worth it if you have to replace them all the time. The case it comes with has worthless as well since it didn't close from the day it arrived. I have always strusted Sony products in the past but this is not the first time that a Sony product has failed me recently. Their quality assurance must be slacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"$31.95 (amazon.com) + FREE Shipping! Are you kidding?!","review":"Though the \\"Free Shipping\\" terms stated it would take anywhere from 7 to 9-Days for delivery, I couldn't pass up the fact that I might be able to pick up a great pair of headphones for far less than anywhere else I could possibly find them...including eBay! So I pulled out the credit card...and put the order through.Three days later (much to my surpirse)....I'm on my motorcycle thumping Kanye West's \\"Through The Wire\\" under my helmet!Top notch quality sound. Carrying case for the interchangeable silicone earpieces (depending on the size of your earholes), but a case for the headphones themselves.You don't want to spend $100 for an awesome set of earbuds....this is your only other option without sacrificing the sound. Bar none, the most bang for your buck.You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for working out!","review":"Wow, what a difference from the $15 pair of Sony MDR-E829V ear buds I had before. The first thing I noticed was the isolation from outside noises. The buds really seal off your ear.The clarity is excellent and the bass is deep. Another cool feature is the short length of the cord (for those who wear their mp3 players on their arm). It also includes an extension if you want longer range.By far, the best pair of headphones I've ever owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"These are great earbuds. I have alswys used Sony DJ headphones in the past, and these are the first pair of buds I have purchased - I am impressed.For the money, the sound quality is very good - full and well rounded with good bass and the treble is not too bright.They are pretty comfortable in the ears, but it does take a little getting used to. The cord is rather thin and very flexible, but seems to be sturdy enough for most use. The included 'case' is a little tough to figure out, but could be good for keeping them clean in a purse or backpack.Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product- breaks easily","review":"I used these headphones for a few months before they broke. One channel completely died, while I had to turn my volume on my zen micro to full blast to even barely hear from the other one.However, in the time I used them the quality was excellent! It takes about a week to get used to, but noise cancellation is perfect, earbuds are very comfortable, and sound quality is amazing, especially for those of you fed up with the weak bass on most stock headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these headphones..","review":"Please, refrain from making this purchase. It is better spent on a higher quality pair of headphones, than some sub-par pair. I recomend Shure headphones, if you want nice audio quality. Now, you probably are wondering why I do not recomend these headphones as everyone raves about them. This would be because I have gone through 3 pairs. I did only make the mistake of purchasing 1, but one was a replacement through Sony's warranty, and the other a gift from my family. All 3 had the same exact problem. After 2-3 months of use, the left ear bud would cease to function, while the right continued to work perfectly fine. This is, as far as I can tell, due to bad wiring where the two wires split from the one, at the silver area where it says, \\"MDR-EX71\\" and Sony on the other side. I might add that I do take good care of all electronics that I own, from my Apple I-pod to my Nikon D50, All items continue to work flawlessly. Don't make the mistake of buying these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound...when they work.","review":"I purchased my first pair and was happy with the sound on the headphones (particularly because it blocks out the noisy city so I can hear my music), until one earphone suddenly died and no sound would come out of it anymore. Of course, it was outside the 90-day warranty period, so Sony offered to replace it with a refurbished pair for almost the same cost that I paid for a NEW pair!! Well, being a loyal Sony customer, I chalked it up to being a defective pair and purchased another because I liked the headphones so much. Well, after 5 short months of normal (not heavy) use, the cord is frayed in two places and (not shocking) Sony said I'm out of warranty and offered to replace with a refurbished pair for over $30!! NOT happy with Sony or their customer service. Buyer beware of these earphones, or do yourself a favor -- buy the Amazon coverage for $6 and save yourself the hassle of dealing with Sony customer service!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IF YOU HAVE AN IPOD AND LIKE TO EXERCISE!","review":"I think these were made for a walkman that sits at your waste or inside a bag. I CAN'T STAND the asymetrical wires. Why is one side longer than the other? Someone mentioned that they were that way so that people with remotes could use them. Why does the apple store even carry these things?? The sound is the only reedeming quality. The buds are comfy but the cord keeps whacking me in the face when I run. Bottom line: it shouldn't be that hard to wear, run, and store them (the storage box is too small). I'm taking these back to where they came from!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The sound quality and noise reduction which is the main function of this head phone are very good.

Sony's earbuds deliver great sound but mine never last more than 4 or 5 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but at the cost of inconvenience","review":"Well, I bought these headphones couple of days back mainly thinking of the noise cancelling aspect. They do average on that aspect but don't have high expectation about noise cancelling. It's been a month and I frequently watch DVDs on my laptop and after half an hour it starts giving pain in the ears. This closed type design is not at all comfortable. Many times you feel the that the earphone is coming out of your ear.Sound is as usual great, no doubt about that. I guess when you are going for Sony that's pretty much assured and that's what Sony is known for. But design aspect wise I'm planning to abandon them as the long hour listening is giving severe pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for hearing music in your ear holes","review":"I needed some new headphones for playing music in my ear holes and got these for my iPod Mp3 machine. They are great, although maybe too good when commuting - I have to pull them out a bit so I can hear the people around me. When traveling on aeroplanes, they are really awesome though - cut out a ton of noise. The only trick with these is that you have to wiggle them around a bit to find the sweet spot, which is easy with the multiple sizes of the, er, ear-bud cover things. Bottom line? Great headphones for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrible","review":"I recently bought these as an upgrade to the headphones that came with my Creative Vision:M. After trying out every set of headphones I could find around the house (including some from the Walkman era), these were simply the worst. The sound is absolutely terrible - no bass at all, and horrible distortion in the mids.Another thing: the cord length is just bizarre. To use the phones without the extension, you'd have to mount your player on your forehead. Put on the provided extension, and you can put the player in your shoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use in the Gym, or for running","review":"The earphones sounded good in the ear, good bass/mid/treble, and they do block outside noise well. The weird thing those is that they create noise because now you can hear your breathing, heartbeat and while running this is VERY annoying. For light gym workouts they are ok, but not for heavy cardio. I also felt that I had a real hard time running any distance and would constantly sweat while I had them in. I talked to my running club about this, and they said it's probably because they are blocking your ear from regulating your internal body temp. So basically my ear thinks it's like 110 degrees out, and kicks my body temp up as well. All I know is that I could barly run a 10K with them in, and the next time I ran, I did the 10K training run, no problem at all.For me they were just too weird and I also didn't like how isolated they made you feel. I'm going back to my old favorite, a new pair of Koss Portapro's and for at home Grado Sr-80's(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sounds, Horrible Quality","review":"I got these headphones and thought they were great.

Let me reiterate. The sound is awesome. The design sucks big ones. First off the rubber around the wires deteriorated away and the wires are showing. Apparently the rubber is a new type of rubber that Sony uses that is susceptible to deteriorating from exposure to oxygen because all i did was wear them. I had to put electrical tape all around it to protect the wire. My headphone now look like i got them from a bondage club with all the tape I had to wrap around it.

See, this interesting version has a short cord and an extension cord, but when using the extension cord, you only get intermittant stereo in both ears due to a faulty connection that only provides stereo listening when holding really still or holding the 2 pieces together at just the right angle.

The noise reduction is at about 60% which is great for my use. These are a great alternative to the expensive ones. The cord length takes some getting used to but using a wire twisty seems to do the trick. The small cases Sony includes are not functional. The extra replacable plugs is a nice plus. The small connector on the plugin is useful for pda cases. In other words it works well with my dell x3i case.I think in future products Sony should create some easy and functional way to store the extra cord length that includes the connector section while using the headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exaggerated and muddy bass","review":"I liked EX51LP a lot but its cord was too long when used with an MP3 player with a neck strap.

EX71SL has too much bass that it drowns other frequencies.

Kids can also use a mouse to direct some vehicles or aircrafts to accomplish a task.

If you set it for a longer time to get the light side done right then the other side gets burned. I don't see how it could do otherwise because if you look down into the slots at the heating elements, you can see that they are more numerous and closely spaced on the outside walls than on the inner.

Because it didn't cost much, you won't be as upset when you have to toss it in the garbage. It does not toast even a basic item like an English muffin on the very highest setting. Then, if you want to try to get the muffin more toasted by running it through again, you have to stand there and manually hold the lever down, who knows why? Conversely, if you want to remove something before the cycle finishes, the only way to do it is to unplug the toaster. If you like pop tarts, forget it; the instructions say you can't use this toaster to toast them. My last toaster lasted 36 years and performed satisfactorily right up until the day it failed to heat.

The biggest complaint is that it toasts very unevenly. It tends to scorch the outside tops and leave the inside bottoms undone. You also have to decrease the setting for subsequent toast or you'll burn it. The down latch mechanism tends to no latch after getting jammed with crumbs, requiring you to clean out the toaster before you can use it again. Once the lever is pushed down it is impossible to raise up again; you have to wait for it to release by itself. The too-short power cord stupidly exits from the control side. The adjustment knob has little friction and is easy to knock to the maximum setting. The toaster housing gets REALLY hot.I'm disappointed with Proctor-Silex for marketing this piece of crap.

Right or wrong, I don't know, but Sabbath (like so many other bands) had already been through different line up's so maybe it doesn't matter.The songs are good indeed, and Glenn Hughes (ex Trapeze, ex Deep Purple), who likes to call himself \\"the voice of rock\\" is doing a great job as usual. Best songs are \\"In for the kill\\", \\"Danger zone\\" and \\"Angry heart\\".For the interested there's a follow up called \\"EIGHT STAR\\" (recorded in 1996) but it was never officially released. I got my copy at a \\"record seller convention\\". \\"Eight star\\" sound a bit more like Glenn Hughes \\"Addiction\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Hard Rock!","review":"If you are looking for classic Sabbath tunes you will not find them on this album. However, it's one of the best Hard Rock albums of the 80's. Glenn Hughes just do what he knows best: sing rock n' roll like very few do. Tony Iommi riffs and solos are very different from what you find on another Sabbath's releases, but are absolutely beautiful. Eric Singer deserves special attention, delivering thundering drums all over the tracks. If you like true Hard Rock, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear-minded analysis....","review":"If this album had been released as the first TOny Iommi solo album, it would have been considered an amazing solo debut for him, for his fans and for the media, no doubt about that.But, since the record company insisted in releasing it as a Sabbath record, the album got lost amongst all the releases bearing the name \\"Black Sabbath\\" on it after 1983, and those records, shall we be honests, were not top class material.Of course SEVENTH STAR suffers from a kind of \\"hey, we are not out of fashion\\" style, be it, a certain glam and pop-metal atmosphere (check the videos from the album and the \\"hair-cuts\\" of the musicians!!). But it's not sufficient for saying that this is not a very solid recording, full of plesant moments, Glenn Hughes singing as ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glenn Hughes with Black Sabbath","review":"Glenn Hughes ex Bass and vocal of deep Purple Mark III/IV kicked arse,....joined Sabbath in 1985. my fave is no stranger to love and Danger zone,....I love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it even Sabbath?","review":"I give Iommi credit for sticking with it after everyone ditched, but considering everybody else on this album is Whitesnake alumni, it just doesn't have a sabbath sound to it. Not the writing, the tone or even the guitars. Very weak. It disappointed me when it came out and I still try to listen to it every few years and I can never get throught it without skipping.Iff you want some non-Ozzy Sabbath, get Born again, Mob Rules or Heaven and Hell...or even anything after Eternal Idol. This is the weakest Sabbath album ever, only barely worse than Eternal Idol. Just pretend it never happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good album","review":"Seventh Star is in the category of 'forgotten' Sabbath albums that include 'Born Again' and 'Never Say Die'. This album features Glenn Hueghs on vocals, Eric Singer( later with KISS) on drums, Eddie'Spitz' on bass, and of course Toni Iommi on guitar. Geoff Nichols the fifth member of Sabbath rounds out this album with keyboards. You'll be hard pressed to find better musician ship from Toni. He gets away from his bar chord riffs like Iron Man and War Pigs and really lets loose. 'Turn to Stone' is a good example of this. The title track 'Seventh Star' takes you on a trip to God knows where. It's really out there. Glenn sounds good on the album, but unfortunatly, the lyrics are sometimes weak. I always liked the chorus for 'Angry Heart' though. I'll put this album against anything put out by the on again off again Tony Martin era."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I Got the Funk..........I Got the Funk.........la la...\\"","review":"There's really only one way to desribe this album: funkalicious. With Hughes at the helm, the band finally sank into a blues-funk stupor, spawning uninspiring songs and unmemorable riffs. Hughes isn't a bad singer, but he has no business singing for Black Sabbath. This is probably the release with the heaviest \\"huh?\\" factor of all the Sab albums. Buy this one only if you love funk and you feel like making a mockery of the Sabbath name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than given credit for.","review":"This was not meant to be a Black Sabbath album.It was originally a Tony Iommi solo project.That is why it doesn't really sound like a Sabbath album.The record co. decided that they were going to call it Black Sabbath.However,this is a very good album.An \\"Ozzy only\\"Sabbath fan won't like it,but someone interested in hearing something a little more diverse will thoroughly enjoy this CD.

I recently dug it out and listened again, for the first time in years. It holds up a LOT better, at least to me, than the three albums that came before it (I LOVED Heaven & Hell, Mob Rules, and Born Again back then, but they haven't aged well with me..). I waited forever for a follow-up, and finally Eternal Idol came out, another great album!The best songs here are Danger Zone (LOVE it!!), Turn To Stone, and In For The Kill. The two ballads are my least favorites.There was a certain \\"formula\\" to Sabbath albums in the 80's. Killer opening cuts, short instrumental segues, albums ending with ballads.... This one fits right in with the formula!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YEaAH!!!","review":"Buy this album its GOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!

I love all the eras, Ozzy, Dio, Tony Martin and the one album with Gillan. I tried so hard to like Seventh Star but I just cannot do it. Iommi sounds good but it's not his best work. And Glenn Hughes sounds just god awful on this record. I can't listen to it all the way through without cringing to his lame vocals. I don't think there is one song on here I enjoy listening to. This is not a Black Sabbath album and it was never intended to be one either. I cannot believe the record company talked Iommi into putting the Black Sabbath name on the cover...I don't get it. I just thank the lord things did not work out with Hughes and Iommi back in the 80's it could have been disastrous. The recent stuff like the Dep Sessions and Fused is not very good either.

Hindsight being 20/20, I wish I would have spent the extra money up front for a good stapler and a good brad nailer. The cylinder wouldn't seal when you hooked it up to an air hose, and I would have to continually hook it up/disconnect it until it would finally seal. The other problem, and it might be related, is that even when I put the compressor at the max pressure (100psi) it wouldn't countersink staples even in 1/2\\" plywood. The last problem is that if you could get it to countersink a brad, the footprint is the size of a staple. Leaving an ugly mark on your project. I returned the tool and am ordering a separate stapler and brad nailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well as a stapler.","review":"I bought this 2-in-1 for convenience (it's a 2-in1!) and because of a very good past history with other Stanley-Bostitch tools.

All-in-all, of the 200 staples I tried to sink, I had 30+ 'mis-fires'; or ~16%. I tried varrying the pressure between 80-110 psig (even though the tool is clearly marked do not exceed 100 psig) but the problem never got better. Every 5th or 6th staple would be a problem. Clearly, this is not good. I was left with no other option but to return it (and used my neighbor's Porter Cable to finish the job).

Shooting plywood veneer to the backside of cabinetry with staples gives great holding power. Also great for stapling carpet and padded fabrics to \\"home made\\" storage ottomans.

AWESOME, only if you intend on painting your trim work ! ALWAYS TEST your dual purpose gun BEFORE you shoot in a visible area to see what your final result will be. All in all, this gun is great for the average user, but NOT for the SERIOUS cabinet maker where stain and lacquer will be used to finish, as ANY fastener must be concealed to let only the beauty of the wood to be seen...

I will recommend this book. If you're very new to psychology, I will recommend you get a copy of 'How to Prepare for the AP Psychology with CD-ROM (Barron's AP Psychology Exam (W/CD)) (Paperback)'. This is very elaborative and has about 400 practice questions.This will help cement a lot of Psychology concepts down and guarantee you a near perfect score.I love you all and wish great success on your exams.

The cheapest we found the KY was around $16, so this $20 pack is practically worth it with the other items, even if the mini massager is just used on sore feet. However, with that in mind the KY, so far, has really been only better than regular lub. for her and it doesn't seem to keep the 'lub-ness' as long as regular lub. either. This would have got 3 stars if the lub. was better, but the rest of the pack is 'take it or leave it' sort of things, we simply never used them. If you're looking for something new, lub. or otherwise, this is a good little pack to check out and cheap enough to do so.

At first when I heard this CD I was disappointed they weren't the original recordings, but then almost immediately I began to hear how beautiful his voice was. These recordings are of all the favorites, even the ones you never knew you liked so much. They have new orchestration, much richer and fuller than the originals, and I can't help but think that this is the way he would have loved to have presented these songs if he had had the technology and money back then. He had a beautiful voice that did not diminish with age, as many other pop singers' did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tumbler Sucks!!!","review":"WARNING!!!

This book elegantly captures the growth of this tradition into a dicipline through the stories of the great nature doctors. This is not a dry history. It is a telling of the principles and methods of naturopathic medicine through life stories of the men and women who developed it. What I appreciated most about the book were the quotes. These nature doctors were colorful characters who didn't mince words with the medical establishment--\\"the pill jesuits and poisoners\\"-of their time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful but rare history","review":"There is so little available on the history of naturopathic medicine, this book is a great gift.

There are absolutely impossible coincedences that never fail to happen over and over again that place the main characters in (literally) comprimising positions. Although this manga has a 16+ rating, being 16 myself I felt that it deserved mature because just about every single page the girl was bordering full nudity.I'd also say that a low point is how all the women are portrayed as loose and always skimpily dressed. Showing my feminist side here, it could really be offending!I would not recommend this manga to anyone, not only for the reasons listed above, but it's extremely predictable and the artwork isn't anything worth mentioning. If you want to read a good manga, I'd recommend Trinity Blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good keyboard","review":"A nice keyboard if space is limited. Keys laid out well for the small size.

This book is powerful in many ways, but the best chapter for those of us in the field to read is the one that explains how cultures educate their children. We have some things to learn about children. I hope the book, tied to Dr. Gardner's theory, will continue to open minds. Without his insights the National Board process would have been far more difficult to do. It was his work that opened my eyes to the needs and styles of my students. I learned to assess their personal growth and became a more reflective teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable and unworkable.","review":"This is the new \\"less is more\\" bible, taken to comic extremes. Worse, I found this book almost unreadable, mainly because Gardner is so full of himself. Witness his comparison of the wildly successful Suzuki approach with Spectrum schools that use his multiple intelligences ideas--a comparison surely used to imply that the Spectrum approach is similarly successful, without any evidence. Sadly, no matter how hard he tries--and he's trying hard--his multiple intelligences end up being used as excuses for failures more than guidelines for success in the real world.Most amusing to me is the notion that this plan is workable. Who does Gardner think can follow this plan? Those that emerge from schools of education have the MOST undisciplined minds--in his sense--produced in the universities: their time is dominated by methods classes, not training in the disciplines. A genius like Gardner, with a class of five, could make a go of it--in the real world, there is no chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"If you're interested in Sidaris films, you're obviously not looking for quality, but this one doesn't even live up to Sidaris' standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time available since Spice Islands stopped producing!","review":"These very hard to find shredded green onions are excellent.

Unfortunately it was 2-weeks past my warranty period. Their malfunction may have been a coincidence, but under the circumstances I cannot recommend these. Even when they did work, the sound wasn't up-to-par.Do yourself a favor: look for an alternate model (there are many choices out there, in prices that range from $30 - $80).

Sonil finds the perfect escape from her mother's lack of affection and passion, by involving herself in a scenario that is almost identical to her mother's ill-fated affair with her English father. Her affair provides Sonil with an opportunity for self-discovery and she is able to understand and eventually forgive her mother. The plot is predictable, much like a soap-opera. The author portrays India as a non-forgiving society. The impressions of India are much too negative, especially considering the author spent very little of her life there. The island, which is a haven for Sonil, provides a direct contrast to the harsh India. The title refers to her inheritance, which is actually the repetition of history throughout her life. The book is entertaining but without depth. I give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is better than the book","review":"This story is told from the perspective of a 15-year-old Indian girl -- but it lacks the meaning and perspective a writer should bestow to make it a novel, not just a series of events.

Why doesn't the author write of a place she has actually experienced, not wishes she had? I look forward to mature fiction written about what Ganesan really knows, not adolescent stuff about what she imagines she does.

I should have studied this more carefully but Koss is clearly trying to blur the line here between these headphones and true noise cancellation headphones.Second, what is with the inflexible metal band?!

The headband is not adjustable, and it was so tight on my head I thought my eyeballs were going to burst out of their sockets. As for as blocking out outside sound, they didn't fare well there either. I had to turn my music up unbearably loud just to block out low voices. I would not suggest this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a TERRIBLE buy!","review":"I purchased the Koss QZ-5 Headphones.THESE ARE NOT ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES!!!I was duped. I believed these were active noise cancelling headphones, but they reduce noise by adding a ton of padding. These headphones are HUGE. The picture displayed is very decieving, only showing you the profile of the headphones. If you wear it and look in a mirror, you will look like a geeky mickey mouse. They stick out of the sides of your head making you look like a weirdo.In addition to that, the sound quality is extremely poor. At the moment I am listening to the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack, and any bass makes the headphones crackle. Bass performance is absolutely poor. Do not get these headphones, they are a waste of money. Do not get these headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blocks Most Noise, Are Comfortable","review":"I bought these headphones to help me study in loud enivronments. They block the majority of noises, including traffic, people yelling, stereo/television noise from next door. They won't block out loud noises in the same room (e.g. loud TV or person yelling), but I think that's good because you want to be aware of dangers nearby!I'm no audiophile, but the sound that comes through these headphones sounds just like the quality that comes out of my stereo.They fit a little differently from most headphones, with the connecting bar fitting behind your head rather than sitting on the top of your head. I don't know if this would affect people who wanted to use these headphones while moving (e.g. commuting or exercising), but for those of us sitting down while wearing them, they are very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for mowing the lawn, part duex","review":"I will echo vander-reviewers comments about this headset. They don't cancel the roar of my Deere, but they attenuate it to a comfortable level making it possible to enjoy music while I mow.

Alot of the tracks weren't memorable or catchy. \\"God's Kitchen\\", \\"I've Seen The Word\\" & \\"Feel Me\\" are good songs, they have that Talking Heads vibe to them.

Probably because I got it at Fry's for $199. I have it connected to the TV so it runs almost every day but it just died tonight with the 'F61' error (power supply). I can't even find the SC-HT650 model on the Panasonic web site, so I assume they are pretty much ashamed of it. Not buying Panasonic again. Sony has a new system that ships with wireless rear speakers and 1000 watts. It's the Wireless DVD Dream System DAV-FX100W and it's $900 retail. If you call the Sony business number and ask for the 'employee discount' I got a quote of $670.

It gets way too hot, and about 2 hours in to playback it starts to destroy the DVD. DO NOT buy this player unless you want to replace all your DVD's. I've lost about a dozen DVD's so far not realizing it was the player. Take your money elsewhere and get a good machine! Customer support with Panasonic sucks too.

There is nothing wrong in principle with this mix, which could make for a very entertaining story. Except that the scholarly stuff is poorly explained so that the nonspecialist has no idea what the words and concepts mean, while the gossip is mostly parochial and unilluminating. Reading this book is like being married to an ambitious linguist: through repetition you become familiar with the names but, at length, couldn't care less about this irrevelant war between tiny piranhas in an academic fishbowl. All in all confirms my general belief that, in the social sciences, eloquence, charisma and the ability to bully others into submission matter more than being right, assuming such a thing is even possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tool","review":"Great tool, does everything I have every needed it to do.

Once you get the hang of placing the nail on the magnet side, you can literally drive a nail every 5 seconds.I'm not sure what the dude who said \\"wear ear protection because this thing is loud!\\" was (or is) smoking, but this nailer sounds about as loud as a baby blowing raspberries (as in Bronx Cheers).I give it a 4 because the instructions are for crap. The leather glove that comes with this kit took almost 30 minutes to figure out how to attach.. and I can do a Rubik's cube in 3 minutes!Otherwise, damn fine tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived not working.","review":"I ordered this to have it for a weekend framing project.

Everything was in the box and very quickly delivered from Amazon, but not in time to finish the gutter work. Gave a four star rating for quick delivery, price and appearance.

Seems comfortable, but heavier than I anticipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it will make your palms hairy!","review":"Right-handed? Left-handed? Both? It doesn't matter! This thing will get the job done. It's even better when my wife does it! She absolutely loves this thing as much as I do because it is so easy to use.This is a well-made, convenient, useful and powerful tool. It can sink almost any nail in the tightest of spaces. Most recently I used it to install windows because it allowed me to get precise nail placement even in some super tight spaces. It's also awesome for installing Simpson Strong Tie products.The only thing that will take some practice is that it can be tricky to get the nails to drive in perfectly straight. After a few practice runs though you'll have it down. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better palm nailer.I really like the fact that it's made in the USA too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile alternative","review":"Great alternative to a hammer or nail gun.

No, but really...","review":"This palm nailer is without question the nicest I have used. I have used Senco, Porter Cable, and Dewalt palm nailers on various job sites and for my own personal tool arsenal, I choose this based on a number of factors:1.) the leather tool wrap is the tightest, most secure, best handling I have used. Granted it takes a pre-snapping of the snaps to get the general shape and intentions of the thing, but it goes on without issue and stays on!2.) the thing hits hard.3.) the nail guides are great for fascia finish nails, but you do have to be quick on the withdrawl, otherwise, get a good caulking gun.4.) easily servicedAre most palm nailers really that different? No. But if you are looking for versatility and quality, this is a good solution. Other cheaper nailers good too? Sure, but remember you get what you pay for sometimes. This is one case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible User Manual for Bostitch Palm Nailer","review":"The user manual and accompanying information with the Bostitch palm nailer that I purchased has got to be the worst that I have ever gotten with a tool. It's so vague that using this tool without other instructions from another palm nailer manufacturer may actually be dangerous; had to download the Porter Cable user manual. In fact, if you need a good palm nailer I would suggest looking at the Porter Cable; at least their user manual tells you how to use the darned thing.

My review however is not going to be very kind. This nailer works when it wants to, and it is disappointing and frustrating to wait for this nailer to start driving the nail.

Without this tool this job would have taken much, much longer and surely resulted in stress injuries from hammering and pain for all. This tool just worked flawlessly saving probably more than 75% of the time that hammering would have needed and producing a more consistent and neater result as a bonus.

I am a foster mom and sometimes one must caution playing a song that says, I'm squishing up my baby bumble bee.

In response to the appearance of the current Republican Speaker of the House at a Catholic commencement ceremony, which occasioned an epistolary rebuke from some academicians, he is sticking to his defense of a Catholic version of Atlas Shrugged. Whatever the cinematic virtues that a movie like this conceivably might have, for anyone to know that a mind some benumbed to basic intellectual sense and human decency, like Sirico's, is behind it should make it only approachable with extreme caution and revulsion.

Not an easy task.The problem here is that at least when looking at the Kindle edition on my iPhone, there is no Hebrew character set, so there is a lot of confusing gobble-d-gunk. Beyond that, scrolling from page to page on a screen is not the same as thumbing back and forth between, say, page 16 and page 20 of a book.

The virgin birth and birth of Isaac are two instances of divine intervention--you'll see how God courts Sarah to birth a child with Abraham!

And, oh yes, a love story or two. The tech described is fascinating, too.But reader, beware! Unfortunately this brief (340 page) book stops in the middle. You will need to read the \\"sequel\\" (aka volume 2) to learn the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sci-fi high-tech/space opera!","review":"This book almost stands alone due to the fact that it combines everything true sci-fi fans love in books from the super high tech bordering on the cyberpunk, to the very tense and very human element regarding the struggles of some of the greatest space operas of our time. It definitely ranks with \\"Foundation\\", \\"Ringworld\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"I,Robot\\", \\"2010\\", \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\", \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Virtual Light\\", \\"Mona Lisa Overdrive\\", \\"Snow Crash\\", \\"Cyber Hunter\\" and many more. Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a book","review":"Unless you're willing to buy at least another book don't bother buying this. It really does end in the middle of the story. Imagine the movie \\"Independence Day\\"... Now imagine it ending right as Will Smith took off in the alien ship... That's this bookThe book was decent but not worth the $20 in order to get both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Overall","review":"I love good Sci-Fi: books that realistically explore what humanity can and might build, and, more importantly, show the continual struggle to define what it means to be human, a struggle that no amount of technological sophistication can make lighter. This novel is most definitely \\"good sci-fi.\\" Westerfeld weaves multiple complicated sub-plots clearly and elegantly. My only gripe is that nowhere on the jacket cover is it made clear that this is but the first in a series (it is). The second installment cannot come soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic first two-thirds of a book","review":"I've been looking for a new sci-fi author and Scott Westerfeld is at least in the running after reading this; he has assembled a creative and unusual galaxy for his Succession trilogy(? I think it'll be a trilogy) and has good characters, technology, and background. My only complaint about this book, and I've seen it echoed elsewhere, is that is it doesn't have a really gripping climax and denouement at the end; the end feels somewhat chopped off. I expect SOMETHING to serve as a hook to the next book in the series, but it really feels like he's still just warming up the story. Having said that, it's a ripping good story so far; I've already ordered the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a book","review":"This might have been fun. Instead, it stands as an example of the worst kind of attempt to double sales by marketing half a book at a time.The elements of adventure and political intrigue are present. By the end of the book, however, only one lame subplot has been resolved. The end result is an entirely unsatisfying read and a sense that your time has been wasted by a marketing gimmick.I'm sure TOR expects us to come back, but it wasn't all that compelling in the first place. This consumer's dollars will go to a book that I can enjoy as a complete work. Maybe it's time for all sci-fi readers to demand at least that much consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not complete the book","review":"long time ago I purchase this series. At the time of purchasing the first book, I tried to read it. For me, the book lacked flow. So,I put the book to the side. I thought that another attempt in the future would be more successful in at least finishing the book. I tried again and that did not work out.Later, I visited a convention in Michigan with appearances from Westerfeld, Scalzi and Rothfuss. I had brought all the books I had of the above authors to be signed. Mainly, I enjoy and admire the writings of Scalzi and Rothfuss.(really enjoyed talking to Scalzi and Rothfuss too) When signing this book, Westerfeld stated \\"that I was a completist\\". I assume for I had some books to sign. Unusual out of the blue comment. I consider everyone to be in the catagory of a \\"completist\\". (Think about the life cycle)With all the wonderful authors out there, I believe I can find other books to complete. I will give him credit it seems he has done better with the YA genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Risen Empire Falls Flat","review":"As I neared the end of the book I wondered how many of the issues presented would be dealt with in the small number of pages left. Well, they weren't. Nothing was concluded. It's as if the editor at TOR lost half the manuscript on the subway.Nowhere on the cover, flap, or back of the book did it say that this was a serial novel. Nowhere did it say \\"a great uncompleted novel.\\" I'm not so naive as to believe that most trashy SF novels can conclude their sagas in less than three books. I do think, however, that the author and editor should make some attempt to allow the book to stand on its own. Consequently, this book fails in the worst sort of way in every way possible for a book to fail.This book certainly warns me off of ever reading anything by Scott Westerfeld again. It also warns me off of the TOR imprint, which I used to trust more than the other imprints in the spined SF section."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sci-Fi Lovers Dream Come True","review":"The Risen Empire is exciting from page one to its cliffhanger ending. If you love real super-tech science fiction with battle cruisers, cyborgs, nano-bots, and the bizzare cultures which have to go with those things, then this is the one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent half a book","review":"While I am rating this book as only 2 stars I firmly believe once the second is released and combined they will make a great four star book. That being said this is a book that only starts to get interesting only to abruptly end in the middle of a battle of all things.While I love serial books and have no objection to having to wait for a second to see how it turns out I didn't expect to be buying half a product at the price it is being sold at.That being said the story IS interesting in only seeing how death is perhaps the one thing that actually motivates us to \\"making life just a little better\\" and the end result of a system where death is no longer a concern. Would we stagnate? Would we become something else? Hard to say but the true level is probably yet to be revealed.To me it was less sci-fi and more opera which in this day and age isn't a bad thing at all but the jarring end still grates on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Your Mexican Theme Party","review":"We use this for Mexican Fiesta party music and it helps set the tone for a nice gathering. Nice traditional Mariachi Mexican music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Condition","review":"It was exactly as advertized and it was delivered in a timely manner. Overall a good expirence. Would order from the seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS EXPECTED but usable","review":"I was a little disappointed in the condition of the book. I think it was rated much too high in the description. It is quite worn, wrinkled, dog eared, and the cover is in rather poor condition BUT the upside is that it is usable. Shipment was made in a reasonable time and we received it in just over a week. Price was OK but probably just a little too much considering the condition of the book. Would I purchase again from this seller? I might if I really needed a book badly (for school) and no one else had the book at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"memories","review":"Terrific! Brought back many memories of growing up in CatholicSan Francisco. Gives a fine feel of mid/late 50s, and theanxieties of early teenhood. The author seems to have a goodsense of depreciating humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for my 14 foot kayak","review":"Installation was relatively simple, hardest part was finding the studs in the ceiling to anchor to. My kayak is 14 feet long and probably weighs around 65 pounds. It takes a bit of pulling to get it going but I feel very secure in its ability to hold the weight. I'm ordering a second one for my other kayak (an otter which only weighs in a 38 pounds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"200 lb Garage Hoist System","review":"It was listed as a \\"200 lb\\" garage hoist system but the one I received stated on the box and instructions that it was actually a \\"100 lb\\" system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is without doubt the best framing nailer I have used. It will shoot into engineered lumber all day long without jamming. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this gun","review":"I am a semi pro/home enthusiasts. I bought this gun to frame a basement. I have to say that thing rocks. It drives nails cleanly every time into engineered wood as well as the thickest stacks you can make. I a impressed with its weight and power. I will definitely be buying another bostitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Nailer!","review":"This nailer is the backbone of my framing work. I am a not a professional, but I have used it to build a 10'x12' shed, finish a 800 sq. foot basement, a 720 sq. foot workshop, and a 650 sq. ft. apartment. In total, I'm estimating that I put about 10,500 nails through it. Total jams -- Zero, Nada, Nil! Now that's reliability! The only downside to it seems to be that the plastic-collated nails that it uses seems to be going along the same path as BETA VCRs. You REALLY have to look hard to find them. I was able to buy another 2 boxes at a closeout at Lowes, so I've got enough to do me for a few years, but make sure that you can find the nails locally before you buy the gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"good solution","review":"I've had this on my macbook pro for 5 months--looks a lot better than the wrist rest area would have looked by now if I had left it unprotected. My previous powerbook had ugly, deep scratches from my watch and/or bracelets dragging across it. Apple should make the area out of something tougher (like this rubbery stuff from marware)--but this is a good solution. Only small complaint (thus 4 instead of 5 stars) is that it is curling up ever so slightly on the top corners--but I don't expect it to get worse, so it's ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't remove easily...","review":"Like some of the users here have said, it doesn't remove easily and leaves a whole patch of sticky gum that takes forever to remove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never take it off!","review":"Another reiteration of some of the other reviewers -I have a Macbook Pro and it is my favorite computer in the world, so I am usually pretty finicky about its care. I didn't want to get scratches on it so I bought the Marware skin for the palm rest. Anyone who has ever owned a Powerbook G4 or a Macbook Pro knows that these machines tend to run pretty warm when they are being used for a while. After about a week I decided I didn't like the way the skin looked on my MBP so I went to remove it and *ALL* of the adhesive glue that kept the skin on the palmrest remained on my notebook. It took me close to an hour using copious amounts of Goo Gone to get the glue off of it. I'm just glad I didn't get any of the liquid cleaner inside my top case! If you want one of these skins, you'd better be pretty darn happy with it because it will take a lot of work to get it off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the trouble or money!!!","review":"This product is not worth the money or trouble. I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up. It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up. Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sticky problem","review":"Rather than being a 'protection' for your MacBook Pro, this product will gum up the works. I applied the pad to the handrest and not only did it not go down smoothly, but when I tried to remove it, as the product promises is easy to do, it left a glue residue over the entire area. Also, the vinyl pads edges curl up exposing the glue below. What a mess. I am now looking for an adhesive remover that won't do more damage to my computer. Marware should improve this product or warn people that its use can cause problems- not what we want when we spend money for 'protection'. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"look at all the pretty bubbles...not.","review":"Simply put, the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely. There are always bubbles. If you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you. The keyboard soft material cover is not so bad, but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard. So, when you close the lid, the material then transfers some of that dirt right back. My resolve...just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft, clean, semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once you put it on, you better leave it there!","review":"To echo one of the other reviewers, exact placement of the wrist rest is near impossible. Two days after I thought I had done it perfectly, a bubble appeared. I tried pressing it out, but within a matter of hours the bubble back. So, I decided to remove the wrist rest. To my disgust, the adhesive had (in the space of a few days!) begin to cling tighter to my laptop than the pad. It took me about hour to get the last of the gummy adhesive off.Avoid the wrist rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money","review":"I was referred to the MarWare by a friend of mine who had the same product only for his MacBook. I didn't have a problem putting the cover on, and it fits perfectly when it's closed. The only problem I have is keeping the keypad cover over the keypad because I'll misplace it and forget to place it back over the keys. Shipping was very fast and easy as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out the S&H!","review":"I was buying an eyebrow tinting product that this was linked to. I almost added it as an afterthought and then noticed the S&H; which is as much as the product! Geez!You can pick these up at your local Sally (or any) Beauty Supply store ladies (and gentlemen). I believe they may even be cheaper there too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I personally think this album absolutely RULES!","review":"Contrary to what a lot of people say about this album, I believe \\"Live At Last\\" is a prime slab of Sabbath's best work. I found it at a bargain basement type store, and it was by far the best CD they've ever have had there.Although the album doesn't have such great pieces of work such as \\"Iron Man,\\" \\"N.I.B.,\\" \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\" and \\"Electric Funeral,\\" It makes up for it with rarely-heard-live Sabbath songs such as \\"Cornucopia,\\" \\"Wicked World\\" and the jam of \\"Into the Void\\" and \\"Supernaut\\" which comes after it, as well as the short, medieval-sounding instrumental \\"Embryo\\" which opens \\"Children of the Grave.\\" Truly great stuff.Overall, I think this album is one of the best Sabbath albums out there, and should be placed as one of the famous \\"first six Black Sabbath albums\\" as the 7th. If you can find it, it's definitely worth whatever price you have to pay! Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest Sabbath album","review":"This is little more than a bootleg, and of less than exceptional performances to boot. The entire album is poor on every level and isn't recommended except for completists like myself. This travesty floated around K-Marts for years as a horrendously packaged bargain-bin item before someone got the idea to 'remaster' it and mark it up. There is little discernible difference in the easily found $5 version and the reissue. So I say, look for the cheaper old one if you must have this. I got burned by also buying the reissue, you don't have to make that mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"The quality of this cd could be better","review":"If you can find the Nems cd or record you are better off.The cd on the castle label is not as good. The intro has been cut, and the sound quality is muddy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful...","review":"I hate to say anything this badabout a Sabbath cd. But as anobjective reviewer I have no choice. This is terrible! The band, with the exception of Iommi, is not in their best shape. Ozzy is just horrendous, worse than I've everheard him sound live from back in the '70's. Just about any bootlegfrom this era is far better than this disc.Don't bother with this unless you just have to have it to complete your Sabbath collection, and make sure you buy it last.Thats what the title must mean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems at all","review":"It arrived safe and sound in a few weeks time.The ipod notes of this cd says its cd 1 makeing it seem as though it is part of a 2 cd release?? But still an awsome live recording with with wicked world going for 20 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironically about integrity-but not the publisher's","review":"The theme of this book is integrity. Rather odd, considering that the book has been put together in a rather questionable way. The book was apparently published previously under a different title in 1982, but has been edited some (to include such things as references to the Internet to make it some more modern). Somebody other than William Coughlin did this, presumably, since Mr. Coughlin has passed on. As in the case of another recently published \\"Coughlin\\" book, the publisher is apparently unhappy that Coughlin is not around to write new books and has decided to fill this gap in other ways. The editing was done very sloppily and the book is riddled with typos. The book does not have much of a plot but is reasonably well written and some of the characters are interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly misleading","review":"William Coughlin was one of the finest writers of legal thrillers around and I have always enjoyed his books very much. When two years ago The Judgement was published I assumed it was done posthumously, but still written by the author himself.This is certaily not the case for The Court. Yes, I know that it is based on one of his earlier novels, but the many references to the Internet, the Reagan years, the Clinton administration and so on cannot, of course, have been written by William Coughlin.I think it is a very sick marketing policy of the publishers to refrain from ANY refernece on the cover that in fact the book has been written and/or edited by somebody else.I hope this will stop quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Court","review":"Very rarely do I not finish reading a book. But after enduring all the confusing references and typos, I got to page 150. They changed the characters name from Jefferson to Jackson without missing a beat. If the publishers won't bother to proof read their books, I won't finish this one, or buy any more from this publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"first time reading William Coughman","review":"I found it difficult to stick with this book in the beginning. I actually had trouble staying awake but I was glad that I did stick with it. About midway through, it became more interesting and I enjoyed the ending. I am more of a Grisham or a Scottoline fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"messy","review":"As an \\"introduction\\" to GIS this book is muddled. It will begin an explanation very simply and then jump off the deep end, going into complicated, erratic explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplicity is much needed...","review":"Simplicity is much needed, and much needed, for an intro that is. Any regular person new to the field of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) would find that this text, though containing lots of information, is poorly written and definately makes the beautiful art and/or science of GIS seem rather lumbersome. The author is clumsy, and often goes into tangents - that only those in the field would already be familiar with. I gave this text/book two stars, instead of one, cause the author does make an honest attempt to explain the subject matter, but falls short of making it a good intro."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"the author teaches in UCSB,I took his class last quarter. it was useless and wasting time. the book is expensive and useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic styling","review":"While searching for some plain, but pretty, slipcovers I realized this was a near impossible task until I found these. The fabric is a bit \\"soft\\" so it doesn't press out quite as firm as I'd like but they are neutral in color and classic in style so you can use them with almost any decor. They don't have that awful country look like so many other slip covers. I would definitely buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok for the price","review":"I would prefer a better quality fabric (thicker), but this chair cover is affordable and does the trick for now. I will have to have some made in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too pricey for the quality","review":"Maybe my expectations got in the way. I ordered the dining room chair cover. Usually dining chair covers are made of thick material to withstand being sat on, pulled by behinds, repositioned, stained, etc. This chair cover is made of fabric that could be used for regular clothes, and will not last long on a chair. For the price, I expected a strong chair cover, not something that I could sew together from regular fabric."},{"rating":"2","title":"WallMagic Kit","review":"I used the WallMagic RagRollers. I couldn't believe how easy it was and how professional the results. I highly recommend practicing on extra drywall or behind the fridge until you get the effect that you like.

It was well worth the effort and I love the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"and it started of so great...","review":"We've used this product before at a previous home and it was excellent. There is no better faux finish than with this roller and marble sponges. So, we order it for our new home to paint the living room. It started out so beautiful, just like we remembered, then it happened. About a quarter way into the process, the handle broke from the bar that holds the rollers. I ty-wrapped and taped it back on so we could finish the job. Then, about a half hour later, one of the rollers popped off, broken on the inside. At that point I had to go to HD and get two small roller handles. We had to finish the job two-handed. It looks ok, but the original rig was junk. I was going to return it all, but it ended up in the trash instead.

I was amazed at how beautiful our Dining Room was starting to look. The kit and the video were very helpful and the way the first wall came out was amazing. However, the double roller head broke off of the handle right as we were getting done the first wall. There was no way to fix it at all. So with 3 walls left and some quick thinking, I put the 2 roller covers on a regular old single paint roller. It was a lot harder to work with, but it got the job done. The roller that came with the kit made the work on the first wall so easy. My advice would be to buy more then one roller from the start (or that the manufacturer design a stronger roller). The handle really did just snap right off. We would have finished the room in half the time had we not run in to this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have had this item sitting on a shelf waiting for me to use it for months so it is too late to return it or request a refund but I certainly would if I could. I had a lot of square feet to cover when I used this product. I had one 8 foot wall done and moved to the next. I was only about 6 feet along when the handle just snapped right off! It is metal so it isn't something I could pop back on - it was just broken off and that was that. What to do?! I had no choice but to finish the room (VERY large room) by rolling the end piece by hand! The effect was the same but the work was SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT! Also, the tray that holds the paint has a divider for the colors that is only about 3/4\\" deep - what's up with THAT?! I remember using this product years ago when it was all the rage and it seemed to be a much better product then. I wouldn't have used this technique at all (it's a bit dated) but I am going for a Tuscan decor in my home.

As usual, with painful results. The author ought to be writing sitcoms, because she shouldn't be writing books in sitcom style. They're rather different media, sitcoms and books, but the author is blissfully unaware of this. The heroine is not very likable, and the neurotics around her are over the top -- too, too much.

But in HEAD FIRST, they stepped the commercialism a lot of grades higher, making a totally pop / hair metal / mainstream composition, clearly succumbing to pressures from the record company, like so many matal band did in the eighties...

Being a vital part, you must replace it- and they're expensive! This way the company continues to drain your wallet.It is also underpowered and will often \\"spit\\" the paint out instead of spraying it. It is best to just do it the old fashion way with rollers and brushes; it's cheaper, more efficient, and good exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that it doesn't work","review":"The problem is not that this product doesn't work--it's just that it only works for a few minutes. As another reviewer noted, critical components are made of cheap plastic. The paint tends to sputter very easily, and the compressor is prone to seizing up. Disassembling and soaking the various parts tends to restore matters for a small while, but the same problems tend to recur after just a few minutes of spraying. I found that on average it took about four to five times as long as a roller to paint to paint a section of wall. Consequently, I've had to ration the precious few minutes between soaks to paint hard to cover areas such as corners and vent grilles. If this product could paint reliably for even ten minutes I would have found it very useful, but the two or three minutes of effective use between soaks is not very cost effective. If you need to use a sprayer, rent a much more reliable one.

However, if you can get past this disappointment, it is an excellent compilation. Though there are few explicit sounds from the AON's catalog, this CD as a whole does as good a job in sketching a landscape in sound as the best discs of the real AON, such as In No Sense? Nonsense! or their newer Seduction of Claude Debussy. In fact, it may be the most imaginative CD of its genre I've ever heard, managing to be evocative while conforming to the rather strict DnB form. AON fans tend to be the kind who don't want to listen to the same trite sound over and over again anyway, and this disc is no less original or interesting than one written by AON themselves.

I'm told that this track is \\"Peter Gunn\\" and that track is \\"Something Always Happens\\". Sure, OK. As a huge fan of the originals, I shouldn't have to be told - but I need to be.

I was, however, disappointed in the fact that there were more for men than for women, so more than half of the book was useless to me.

The supposed \\"comedic\\" monologues sometimes start off with promise, but then usually fly off to left field and always fall flat by the end. The \\"serious\\" ones don't really relate to the human experience as most of us know it, so if you use any Method acting at all, or want to move your auditors, forget it.

If it doesn't bother you, then this is your book.I can see how this book could land you a lead role. It does have some good monologues, but they aren't for everyone.

We also have an HP printer in the office, which is considerably more reliable and never drops the IP address. Come on Xerox! But for this issue, Xerox has put out a pretty good product.

They love to make milk shakes, and the big blender is noisy and a big mess. The HB65111 all metal drink mixer seems to be solidly made, and it is very quiet and easy to use. As other have noted, pay attention to the fill lines on your malt cups. I was the first guinea pig to try it and...yes, I made a mess. The milk will splash out if filled too high, and the ice cream tends to sink to the bottom. If you leave the cup hanging on the clip, the mixer rod will not get the ice cream at the bottom, so you have to kind of move the mixing cup around to get it all mixed well. The mixing rod does not come off, so you will need to use a spare malt cup or plastic cup with a soapy water mix to clean it...or just use a wash rag (yuck!).

I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a wireless phone system in their house that doesn't have a huge ugly antenna sticking out of it.This phone has incredible range compared to my Motorola 5.8ghz system. The clarity of the phone is what I would expect - the speakerphone is even better. It is actually loud enough to hear the other person (most speakerphones - you can't hear anything in my experience).I love the fact that it doesn't have a huge antenna hitting my head when I'm holding this up to my ear. The way this phone feels is A+. It fits in your hand perfectly and still feels ok after holding it to your ear for a few hours.My only complaint about this phone is: The buttons do not light up and the volume is a wee low when you're holding it up to your ear.Things I found out later: My cell phone's headset works on this phone. That is a big plus as I talk a lot with family in another state.Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with this phone","review":"Easy set-up, extensions work well, good sound quality. The only reservation from the friend who received this gift is that the speaker phone could be louder, ditto with the digitized voice on the caller id.

This phone wall mounts at about a 45 degree angle, just drops into the cradle (careful not to knock it out), and is hard for my shorter wife to see the caller ID screen. However, it does announce the caller with a voice, pretty amazing technology...overall a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"The phone operates as advertised. Talking caller ID is a great feature. Sound quality is very good and it is easy to use and program. This really is an excellent phone system for under $75.00.

Overall quality is very good and I highly recommend this phone for those who want talking caller ID feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good phone system","review":"My wife and I aren't really big talkers and only have need for a basic cordless phone. We don't use a lot of the features on this phone system but a summary after 1 month of use is that this is a pretty good product and we are satisfied with it.Pros:-good sound quality-good battery life (we dont talk all that much and generally leave the phones in their cradle)-can listen to messages on the handset even if you aren't near the base stationCons:-none really so farAnnoyances:-You have to hit the talk button to answer the phone, I think if it's in the charging cradle and ringing, when you pick it up it should automatically turn on."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD PRODUCT - EASY TO USE - SOUNDS GOOD","review":"I am pleased with this phone system. It is easy to use and the sound quality is good. The \\"talking caller ID\\" feature is really a lot more useful than I expected. The only problem is that all inbound calls show up as \\"missed calls\\" even if you answer them. Other than that, the phone system works very well. Also, it is well priced when compared to other similar systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"The book should have been titled the life and times of MR. and Mrs. Joe Kennedy. The first five to six chapter are primarly about Joe Kennedy Sr. and how he made his moeny and his many trips and what not...you rarely got much of anything about Rose at this time so they probably should of just done one chapter saying that she stayed home most of the time while joe worked and traveled and when possible she would travel with him, that would have saved a lot of wasteful chapters that weren't about Rose at all. This book was not written very well either which could also be why it runs on about the wrong person for so long at the beginning. This book is not something I would recommend to anyone not even my worse enemy let alone to the general public. Do not waste your time..there are many better books out there that are better written, more acurate and is acutally written about the person that is says its about on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait","review":"(...)As far as the saw goes: it ofers everything a DeWalt does for (...)less.

The reviews so far have been raves from the little one (and from us). The animation, music and sound are first rate, but more importantly, the challenges are appropriately measured for a pre-schooler. This program stacks up well against the Knowledge Adventure titles like Reader Rabbit. Skills such as sequencing, color matching, memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments. Plus, there are three difficulty levels, so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level, you can adjust accordingly.The program works great using the Classic environment on our Macintosh G4 laptop and G3 desktop computers. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT For kids under 5! TOO HARD!","review":"My son is 3 and a half. He has mastered many games like Jumpstart Preschool, etc.. This game is way to difficult for him.

Otherwise, steer clear. Here are my reasons:*There is not much replay value in the game. It is the same set of tasks to perform each time you play and they always come in the same order.*There is not a large variety of things to do (Discovery Airport was the same price and it seems to have a lot more to do).*The tasks that are performed do not seem have much educational value when compared to other software like the Jumpstart line.*The product seems like it was put together quickly so it could be rushed to market in order to capitalize on Dora's popularity.Having said all of this, I will admit that the graphics are nice. It does look like the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 yr old played through this game in 20 minutes.","review":"There is very little interaction so it's more like a cartoon with four short activities thrown in.

A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for active children","review":"I bought this software for my nieces... and they were pretty excited to see Dora on the box. They ripped it open with glee and we installed it.Well, I guess Quality Control is missing in the Lost City - the software simply wasn't translating my mouse clicks in a standard way, and so interacting with the software became a adventure! The software worked great in terms of seeing and hearing Dora... but when we tried to interact with Dora and her friends, well, that was an exercise in frustration!As a software developer, I found it unusable. Totally unusable. It was so wrong, I sent a note to tech support.Tech support responded in a day or two, but unfortunately their reply didn't offer any advice in correcting my usability issue.I suggest something else - my nieces were very disappointed. I was disappointed too."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price, we expected much more and it failed!","review":"This game was no where near challenging enough for our 4 1/2 year old.

Should be marketed to 2-3 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gameplay is OK - but Dora's voice is annoying beyond belief","review":"My 4-year-old has this game - and she likes it OK, even though this is not her favorite game by far. Actually, there is one main reason I gave this game just two stars - the voice and speakig manner of Dora, the main character is so annoyingly whiny and affected, it embodies everything I hate about the way certain people (typically female) are speaking. This unnatural, annoying voice grates on the nerves so much that I'm seriously considering removing the game from the computer so that my daughter won't speak the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAC Users Beware","review":"I bought this product because it specifically stated that is is supported Mac OS X 10.1.x and above. Turns out that there is a problem with the mouse tracking on OS X 10.2 that makes the game unusable. I went to the company's website for a patch only to find out there isn't one, and there will not be one. Their solution is to install it in 0S 9 and boot into OS 9 to play it. I checked for OS X support specifically to avoid such nonsense.I am very disappointment in this product as a result and would recommend looking elsewhere for both Windows and Mac if a company such as this cannot properly fix their bugs. $15 wasted and one very unhappy Toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok","review":"My daughter is 4 and loves Dora. The game is short and not interesting her. Also it's seems there are a few glitches in the game. Trying to get the stars into backpack is nerve racking.

Don't waste you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I have a 3 year old, and after a week, she is already bored with this game. For $20, there should be more to do.

This particular cable is thin, has a wonderful woven exterior, and nice connectors.However, the connectors do not swivel like the $40 Monster Ultra cables. I like the woven exterior on this cable more than the mesh the Monster cables have, but I suspect the Monster swivel will protect my gear more and reduce strain on connectors.At the end of the day though, this is very nice cable. If you have high end components that cost a lot of money, reconsider what happens when cable connectors break.

It started slow, with a few eye-rolling moments... but by the middle of the movie I was hooked. I think Vanessa Hudgens is an underrated actress, which probably puts me in the minority. I hope she can shed her HSM past and take more adult roles. This is also the best performance I've seen from Alex Pettyfer. His \\"ugly\\" self must have inspired him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"There is very many words to describe this movie, all of them are synonyms for the word bad.I feel bad for the actors, because this probably pushed them down in there career. You have to wonder if the actors even tried though in some scenes... I know the writing was what made this movie bad, but the acting was throwing salt on the wound, and then squirting lemon juice on it too. All in all this might be one of the worst movies of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I usually love a sappy teen romance, but this movie is AWFUL. The message: Looks don't matter, but money sure does, especially if you plan to hold the girl you've been stalking prisoner in your mansion. I didn't believe for a minute that these two fell in love or lived happily ever after. I thought the \\"Beast\\" was a self-centered jerk both before and after his transformation, and was convinced he'd go right back to his old ways after he got his looks back. And I'm supposed to believe a 'happy ending' where the girl accepts without comment the fact that he lied to her about his identity for a year? I watched the movie with my teenage son, and the best part was when we paused it to make fun of how stupid it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy handed sloppy verging on campy","review":"More than transparent patronizing and ploy that should never come to screen.This really does not have any resemblance to the classic \\"Beauty and the beast\\" nor the T.V. program.

With the exception of Alex the acting was atrocious, the script felt very stale and there was just nothing to hold my interest. Maybe this film is more for the 15 and under crowd. I can't imagine anyone much older than that enjoying this film.

Beastly is a story about some stuck up private school snot who becomes a Beast after insulting a witch. He needs to find someone who can truly love him.

I never saw Vanessa in HSM, but know most of those Disney kids are talented musically...she is actually a decent actress as well. Alex was hot in this (tho' hotter in \\"I Am Number 4\\")and you got to see a tender side. I LOVED Mary Kate Olsen as Kendra!!! I didn't recognize her at first, but she totally rocked the witch role!

The film seemed real fast pace in the first twenty minutes, from this to this like that! After it slows down and it's just him trying to get the girl while dealing with a blind tutor and his house maid who's trying to get her children into the country. It was an ok film and funny enough, the main guy actually looked cooler and way more interesting after he was cursed, like don't get ride of the curse, you look much better.. haha..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I watched this expecting a frothy little film that played on the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" theme. Instead, I saw this. The two leads have about as much chemistry as a dish of soap and a fork. It wasn't there. Vanessa Hudgens's idea of acting is to make \\"cute\\" faces and stand around staring, trying to look thoughtful or meaningful. There's no explanation of why there's a witch in the school. She's just there and casting spells. Huh? The blind teacher is another loose thread. There he is...but he does nothing except make \\"profound\\" statements every so often. Of course he has to have a happy ending at the end.This could have been so much better, but the dialogue was cheesy, the acting was bad, and so many things seemed to be thrown in to see what would work.

The only possible positive regarding this movie is that it proves that everything and anything is possible in this life, including the making and releasing of this dire movie. Watching this movie also brought to my attention that airplanes nowadays don't carry vomit bags. The plot was nauseating and quite possibly created by an elementary school drop-out with a Beauty and the Beast fixation. Maybe the movie would have been saved if it had decent acting, humor, drama, effects, witty dialogue or anything that would remotely be considered art or entertainment. Unfortunately, this movie had nothing to offer other than childish dialogue and a premise that would make any movie starring Rob Schneider a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Nothing to do with the book!

I also did not read the book before seeing Beastly. If you take the movie for what it is, it's actually quite good. I don't spend my time hung up on plausibility and what the book says. It's not high brow it's mindless entertainment.The actors were pretty good. Alex Pettyfer has raw talent. It would be interesting to see how his career will turn out as he matures. Story reminds me of Beauty and the Beast. They should have given more time for character development. For instance Lindy's father was barely seen.I do think the alternate ending was better than what they ultimately used but again, we're dealing with continuity issues with the second ending because the bad guy showed up from nowhere.

For some inexplicable reason, it has suddenly become fashionable to offer new twists on familiar fairy tales. There's nothing inherently wrong with that idea, but Beastly is a film which delivers a concept at the expense of...well, everything else. This is one of the most maddeningly incomprehensible films I've witnessed lately; a movie which plays as if a 13-year-old girl and a sentient copy of US Weekly joined forces to write a screenplay via text message based on a trending twitter topic. Admittedly, I'm not the target audience for this film. However, those who dig this sort of thing really deserve better than the sort of half-baked garbage Beastly delivers.

I just finished watching it and though it took a little while to get going, when it did - I was surprised; by Avery Brooks infectious joy, by Scott Bakula's down to earth honesty, by Kate Mulgrew turning the tables on Shatner and asking him the question she did, by Patrick Stewart sharing his feelings about being remembered as Captain Picard. This didn't feel staged. Instead, it felt like real people sharing themselves - both joys and sorrows. Yes, perhaps Bill Shatner began making this film as a self-reflection, but it ended up becoming something deeper and larger than that. Thanks Bill and all who participated."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really about Star Trek","review":"This isn't really about Star Trek. It MIGHT have been interesting to listen to interviews with the actors portraying the captains but it wasn't. Shatner interrupts his subjects regularly. The Avery Brooks segment was odd. The Kate Mulgrew segment was misogynistic. It was awkward and uncomfortable when he put Patrick Stewart on the spot. I did enjoy hearing Stewart and Shatner discuss their feelings about being forever linked as Star Trek captains but it wasn't worth watching for that part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable to watch","review":"I love Shatner, but I could only watch the first 20 minutes of this.

I called Yamaha, finally (I really couldn't believe the problem was there), got a very helpful agent who gave me a Return Authorization number, sent the machine to Yamaha and waited.

I actually don't mind religous comics in fact find them interesting but this isn't comics it's dense not very well written text- if you are interested in Cerebus and comics this books lacks a lot of the quality comics found in earlier volumes.

Also, for those of you who (like me) like to label your discs using snazzy, custom-designed labels, the branding on these discs is done using a matte silver finish, so there's no dark printed logo to show through your labels. I've already ordered a second spindle of 50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality, Especially for Labels","review":"These CD-R's came highly recommended by a friend who records lots of DJ mixes. He was right -- they work perfectly every time. The best part is that Imation has kept it's branding on the CD to a minimum so that it doesn't show through a white CD label. Most other CD companies put color logos or black text on their CD's, which show right through white CD labels. Now that's smart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imation respects its clients.","review":"I bought 2 spindles. Had a problem with one of the spindles. It peeled off after awhile.

I bought a spindle of 50 and now less than half of them work. The top layer of the CD-R, the actual part that music or data is writfen on simply peels off of the plastic base. If you take your finger and brush up on the edge of the cd, like you were trying to peel a sticker, it will come right off, I promise. No other brand of CD-Rs that i've used do this.

I applied it the other night before bed, using the gloves as recommended (several pairs came with the product)and woke up in the morning with a beautiful even, natural looking tan. I loved that the lotion is tinted so that you can see where you have applied and make sure you have it all rubbed in. It looks just like the spray tans that you get at tanning salons, only better because you can cover your feet and hands more accurately. The only drawback is that it develops a very strong odor after a couple of hours just like the booth tans do, so I highly recommend that you do it at night so that you can wash it off the next morning! Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: THIS IS DARK, NOT MEDIUM AS PICTURED","review":"I ordered this thinking it was the medium and not the dark one because the picture clearly shows the word medium on the bottom of the front of the bottle. however, they shipped me the \\"very dark.\\" I know someone who wants to buy the dark bottle from me so I don't have to ship it back but now I have to re order and wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this product.","review":"It might be because of my very pale skin but I did not like this product.

I threw it away after using it a couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"This product is amazing I love it!

I hate to buy something and then be so sorry I did. I read the other reviews for this product, I liked the price and took a chance, and I was glad I bought it! I rate this product right up there at the top. It goes on easily, smells good for a self tanner, has good color and lasts on me. Some other brands wash right off it seems when I shower, you know you can see the water slightly discolored going down the drain, but not this one. Now I have to decide if I'll get more of this or my other fav brand when it comes available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Itch","review":"This product made me itch so I only used it once.

I usually have pasty white skin that does not tan very easily and this stuff really worked. It lasted a long time too even thought I did not leave it on overnight like it said to do. I left on for a few hours and washed off. It looked very natural, not orangey at all. I saw other reviews that said it faded patchy, but I did not not have that happen. I will definitely buy again. My only complaint is that it says its paraben free, although one of the ingredients is a paraben."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books out there on body language","review":"I read this book and felt unsatisfied.

Horrible purchase, I'm trying to figure out how to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and clever sponge holder","review":"I love the practical design of this sponge holder. It is wonderful for hiding my grubby looking steel wool scrubbies as well as for keeping my sponge up off the sink, allowing it to dry faster. I also like that the metal top has little feet and could be used without the bottom box; it is really cute on it's own. I like this sponge holder so well that I have already ordered another to use on the opposite side of the sink.The bottom is not big enough to hold myDawn Polymesh Scrubbers, 3 Count (Pack of 6)which are 4 inches in diameter but I suppose if it was, it would be a little too big to fit so attractively on the back edge of my sink.I have only owned this sponge holder for a couple days so I don't know whether or not it will rust, however I will try to remember to update this review if rust does appear or in a year or so if it remains rust-free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reductionist Rumi","review":"I am not sure I should write this review, since I have been unable to finish the book so far. The author's pedigree is also intimidating. Yet this book is a cold emotionless dissection, mostly uninteresting except for an academic who has long lost the sense of who or what he's studying. The book takes Rumi apart like a corpse on a slab. To get through it so far, I've escaped periodically to Coleman Bark's Essential Rumi. His brief introduction and forward alone provides more insight into what Rumi is about than the three-quarters of the book I've managed to struggle through so far.Prodded on by the other reviews to the suspicion that I may have missed something here, I plan to finish the book and reread it again. Yet I should warn others that reading this book as an introduction to Rumi may be like viewing a bearskin rug as an introduction to wildlife. After a reread, I will revisit this review, perhaps reedit it at that time.Sept.07"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the work of Rumi, it's only the author's interpretations and historical recollection","review":"I expected to get a transcript of the actual works from Rumi to read and interpret myself. That is not the case with this book. While it does provide the historical context (that's why I gave him 2 stars instead of 1), the author feeds his views and opinions in front of the actual text by Rumi. My opinion of the author's style is poor, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic MP3 Player","review":"This is basic MP3 player. I use this for listen to music till I fall a sleep at night.

J.D.'s book answers these and more questions about how one's style influences the quality of your software program, and the pleasurableness of the users experience. His rules or guidlines are simple but effective. You could spend 10-15 years learning the same things the hard way or you could read his books. Many of the issues he raises which would lead to higher quality products are, unfortunately, still not widely practiced today."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need battle tips...","review":"If your going to play the American version and want to find all the secrets then this books IS NOT for you. If your lost in a deep dungeon, the maps might help, however don't take them to heart, you'll get lost. I have to admit that the battle tips are good, they will teach you techniques that will give you the edge on the battle. As for boss Stats, I have to say they are wrong, while sometimes they say ''You should have no problem with this boss\\" it turns out to be very hard, and when they say \\"One of the hardest bosses you've faced so far'' turns out to be easy.. In conclusion, use this book as a reference not a guide, so if your not good at RPG's don't use this book. One more word of advice, don't read the text next to the pictures of the Heroes unless you want a spoiler.... I think the book tells you a little to much about what is to come.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank GOD I got a discount on this book.....","review":"I bought this at the exact same time I bought the game and only paid $10 for it. And it's worth less. The maps don't have a readily available map key(there is one in the front of the book, but the symbols used are BAD), and the entire book is black and white with small text and small pictures. It is somewhat helpful, provided you read an entire section BEFORE getting to an area. If you have a choice, go for the official guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a terrible book... but far from the best.","review":"This guide is good enough if you just need some help struggling through the game the first time, providing useful strategies for defeating bosses and such. But it falls short when one would like it to go beyond the bare bones -- the pictures are small, black and white, and of the JAPANESE version of the game. Not much help. The maps, too, are crudely drawn and difficult to interpret. This is strictly for RPG novices... who can't find the official guide, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"This certainly WAS unathurized -as the company would NEVER allow something the bad to be official!!

I'm tired of hearing complaints.","review":"I found the book itself to be very useful when I got lost. But, if anyone has read the reviews before this one, be warned. Read through the game manual first. The stats in the book refer to the base stats, not the actual ones. The actual ones are taken from a combination of the base stats and the stats of Alex, the hero. So, quit yer bitchin'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, like THIS author ever played the game...","review":"Well, maybe she did, but not too many readers of this guide would disagree with that statement if they have tried to use it. Inaccurate lists (as they refer to equipment found in the Japanese version of the game), incomplete (and confusing) maps, plot spoilers, and tons of white filler space are what this \\"guide\\" is riddled with. Most everything all the other reader reviews have said about this book is true. I couldn't suggest you buy the official guide (which is EXCELLENT) or even the July 1999 issue of Expert Gamer magazine, both of which give you something that qualify as a strategy. An obviously rushed job, expect no boss or fighting tactics to be found, nor any of the game's secrets. It's not the worst game guide in existence (believe me, I've read hundreds)--that honor still goes to Prima's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night guide (check my review for that as well for a good laugh). Still, avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prima's unoffical Lunar guide is a bad buy!!!","review":"The main problem with this guide is that is based on the Japanese version of the game. Working Designs spent alot of time changing the game for an American audience, so the guide is basically worthless for the American version of Lunar:SSSC. Not to mention the poorly described dungeon maps and the poor black and white photos. The guide looks like it was done by a kid on his home computer rather than done by a professional publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Strategies and Incomplete Item and Weapon Lists","review":"Prima is usualy a good source of information when it comes to game guides but in this case it was very poor. The guide is difficult to read with black and white maps and the guides heavy use of symbolisim which is very anoying. It is missing chests on maps, numbers and item names are wrong and it does not tell you where to find everything like most Prima guides do. Not only is it incomplete it is also wrong. I do not recomend this book if you have already beaten the game but for first timers who just need to get out of a tight spot and to advance in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"I was lucky enough to get this strategy guide for free when i bought the game. the maps are very confusing, the symbols are annoying and it is not in color!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking (This book sucks)","review":"Come now this is one of the most poor exuses for a strategy guide, which is surprising cause Prima isn't that bad of a company for making guides. For starters this book is (for some reson) based on the japanese version, which (sorry Japan) is much much worse than the American. (Thats a first) Secondly, there is no maps and no color, sorry I prefer my books from OZ but thats the way it is. It is also poorly written and dosen't even apolagize for being wrong. If you want a strategy guide for Lunar, get the official working designs one, which is in my opinion the coolest guide ever made, and if you want to know how to play the Japanese version, then Prima is just your book, actually it still sucks for that, learn Japanese and get a guide from there, you will be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst strategy guide ever made!!","review":"For starters the so called \\"guide\\"(I'ts so worthless I do not think it deserves the name strategy guide)is based on the Japanese version of the game(What the heck?That's real smart[I said that sarcastically];how could someone be stupid enough to release a guide based on the Japanese version of the game in the U.S.?)!!Second,it has close to NO maps!!Please whatever you do;do not get this guide.At least I don't think you should,but if you absolutely must get it,go ahead and waste your money.It's worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came broken","review":"The rings are cute and will look good on the cupcake and I know the kids will love to play with it after eating the cupcake, but I received the ones that I brought with broken and missing rings.

Those who have read A Course in Miracles have a better chance of making sense of her New Age language than I did. Also, what is the Unity of Greater Cleveland, of which she claims to be a minister? I appreciate a diversity of religious faiths--being a seminarian myself--where does she fit in? And having James Redfield endorse the book on the cover gives away the intended audience.

I also had a hard time taking in the overall impact of Luke and Catherine's relationship. I did like the exchange between them and the inter play of their family and friends. I especially like the way Mrs. Ray portrays loving, supportive and happily committed men who \\"take care of thier loved ones\\". All of her books have unique qualities that make them special.

I was expecting a happy ending to include Catherine's ability to have children which would have really been a happy ending. Also, what happened to the vet and his newly hired assistance. Maybe there is a book waiting to tell us about their happy romance since her ex-husband is no longer a problem. Also, what about Luke's brothers and his sister. While I enjoy some suspense, I do read romance books because of the happiness that is part of any great romance. In reading several books by Ms. Ray, I have come to expect a happy solution to every problem. I have truly enjoyed reading about Daniel and his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Until there was you","review":"Francis Ray never disappoints her readers. This is a part of the continuing saga of the Taggart/Falcon families. This story has a interesting twist and a surprising ending. The book is full of suspense and adventure and of course hot, passionate love. Once you start reading about these families you want more and more. If you need a good place to start read Forever Yours, by Francis Ray this will aquaint you with the families. After this you will anticipate the next story.

It worked good may be for few days. Now only thing works is Radio. Other functions like CD, USB and SD card works rarely and have their own timings when to start working and when to quit. I opened the system so many times and played with this and that, plugged and unplugged internal connector cables, basically opened up the whole system from A-Z and closed it back for many times and still have the same problem. I will work on this piece of garbage for some more time whenever I will be free and try to figure out where the problem is. I like its functions but quality is zero out of ten.

The real \\"proof\\" (disproof) is that the man whom Schneebaum claims to have eaten part of was alive and met by an anthropologist (T. R. Moore) during the late 1960s, more than a decade after Schneebaum's visit. (No one doubts that he was there, but those who know something about other peoples of the area doubt what he wrote about a homosexual idyll and the cannibalism he writes about.)Schneebaum writes well, but reading all his books show him to be obsessed with primitivist fantasies, which he dates back to seeing a circus \\"wild man of Borneo.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work for me as fantasy, either","review":"i had to buy this for a course in mesoamerican religion. there wasn't any in it, nor any anthropology either. just a lot of lame existentialist homosexual fantasy. probably when it was published in 1969 (and when it was written even earlier) it was a lot more interesting and thought-provoking to point out that the christian religion practiced by the priest at the mission did not make anyone any happier (or any better people) than whatever cultural norms being practiced by the more \\"primitive\\" peoples; that's old news for most of us today. there is no mention of any other spiritual beliefs than christianity, therefore no objective comparison can be made. i haven't seen the documentary yet, but proving that he really went somewhere, met someone, and visited a tribe doesn't come close to proving all the incidents described in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"I was interested to see if some Amazon reviewers had twigged on this mildly sappy series of inventions and musings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"this is like a straight from china, poor quality, waste of space.

These don't have the same kind of seal inside the ear, so they don't produce the same level of bass, but the audio quality is very high. With the in-ear buds, it sounded like the music was originating from the center of my head between my ears, which is pretty awesome.

The sound quality is perfectly adequate. I have had more expensive products (Sennheiser OMX70 Clip-On Stereo Sport Headphones), of which the sound quality was insignifigantly different. These earphones provided at least a year of good performance for under $10.00 - the Sennheiser OMX70 Headphones began breaking the first week of use (one of the phones went out) and they were over $30.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for small ears","review":"I got these so I could jog and still listen to my ipod- bad mistake.

The first time that I used them they didn't stay in my ears, and could barely hear my music. They have weak bass, and don't have a very good range. I bought some behind the neck ones instead, I am still waiting for them, but I know that those are of a higher quality than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"They shocked my ear","review":"They fit fine, the sound was fine.

A definite DON'T BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok ergonomics, terrible sound","review":"I bought these to use when running, and they do fit on my ears (though they're a bit big) and stay in place. However, the sound on these is truly terrible. Tinny like an old fashioned AM radio. Very disappointing. And I don't think my expectations are too high. Comparing these to other $10 Sony headphones I've had (the kind with the earbuds that look like these, but with a headband instead of the around-the-ear clip), the sound is nowhere near as good.They get two stars for being cheap enough to be virtually disposable, but for listening to music these headphones border on unusable. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Absolutely Terrible!... First, they do not stay in your ears like they claim to be designed for and second, all you can hear is the wind when running. I would highly recommend choosing a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fit, works great, breaks in less than 6 months, wash, rinse, repeat","review":"Like others have said these are GREAT headphones. Up until the left ear breaks and is no longer usable. I've purchased them 3 times hoping the problem would be fixed, but each time I'm fooled. I guess I keep coming back because I like how easy they're to put on, they stay in place, and are comfortable. I forget I even have them on when working out.Sadly, each time the left ear breaks.

Hopefully I can find another product that can actually stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a while, won't stand up to high activity for long","review":"This is the second pair I've owned that have stopped working on one side.

They seemed to stay in play under heavy activity (running, mountain trail hiking) better than others, but won't hold up over time.I got a good 8 months out of this last pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad fit. Didn't like them. Sent them back.","review":"After reading reviews about how great these clip-on headphones were, I was rather disappointed to find how uncomfortable and ill-fitting they are. I don't think my ears are any different from the average person, and these headphones just refused to fit properly or comfortably. Perhaps if they'd been bendable, they'd have been okay. As it was, however, the actual piece that I thought was supposed to fit into your ear ended up sitting right outside of it. It was more like having little tiny speakers sitting just behind the opening of my ears, as opposed to the way normal earbuds are supposed to fit. This caused the sound quality to deteriorate to a level similar to what you get when you hear music blaring out of normal headphones... when you don't actually have them on.Needless to say, I returned these and went with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"These will break","review":"I've had about 3 pairs of these headphones, and I like the design and the feel of them. Unfortunately, one headphone always stops working after a couple months. I wouldn't recommend these for anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Durable","review":"As you work out and sweat, these headphones will move around, but not nearly as much as other ear-wrap headphones on the market. Great sound, plus, they allow you to still hear traffic and other outside noises. No headphones last forever, but I've had mine for quite a while now, and they're still going strong. Very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!! :)","review":"Since I'm in a college, I'm very tight on my budget and didn't want to spend more than $30 on the headphone. I've tried many types of headphone/earphones around that price range and I can say this one is my absolute favorite among the ones I've tried.It is affordable and VERY comfortable. You don't get any pain you would get if you use the earbud type earphone. And if you own an iPod and you are suffering from the pain from the earbuds that came along, I recommand this earphone for everyone. I'd give 6 stars if it is available, seriously. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad headphones","review":"Think twice before you buy these non-slip headphones. I was very disappointed with the fit of these headphones. They are design for specific type of ears and if you don't have those ears, forget it! How do you know if you have the right size ears? You just don't know until you try them on and realize they don't fit. They are truly uncomfortable and not very flexible. Save your money and find something else. Don't buy them because of the low price. There is a reason for the low price. Who wants them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a CD instead.","review":"These looked cool for those walks around the block, and the price was right. But that's as good as it gets. They may not bring down the neighborhood, but they bring down the once-proud name of Sony. Not only is the sound of music sharp, tinny, and bass-deprived, but the pin never seems to lodge securely in my player, leading to distortion and the cutting out of sound in one of the headphones.My wife recently purchased a comparable pair of Brookstones at the airport. They cost three times more, but they sound at least three times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound without trying","review":"Stays in my ears fairly well, which is not something most headphones of this type do. Also, the sound quality is great for activity or outdoor use. Good for the morning run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful and bad sound.","review":"Hurt my ears and sound awful. When running, they literally bounce the sound and it is nauseating. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for my ears","review":"I am a fairly petite female, and these headphones were much too big for my ears. I got them to wear at the gym, and they were bouncing around on my ears as I was running. I constantly had to adjust them. I returned them after the first time wearing them. The sound was good and for biking or sitting at home they would probably work but they did not work for me for active fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groundphones","review":"Saw the reviews here, figured 4 stars means they work.Nope. They slide out within the first few steps of running. Try jamming them in your ear, and they fall out after a few more. Garbage for their purpose. The box says the 'clip on style provides secure fit'... except they don't clip onto anything, certainly not your ears.Save your ten bucks and get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"This would make my forth attempt at finding some headphones that wont fly off when I go jogging. Not only do they stay put while jogging, running and riding my road bike they are super comfortable. These are probably the best ones I have bought yet and will keep them in my list just in case anything happens to these babys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best headphones on the market","review":"I bought this product for a great price but I really don't like the product. Only because it's awkward and I don't have big enough ears for them. The speaker itself is fine if I push it in my ears but who wants to spend time pushing the speakers in their ears to improve the sound quality? Because they are too big the sound suffers. I've already tossed the box so I guess I'm stuck with them. The company itself did a great job getting it to me but I probably will not be using the these headphones because they are uncomfortable and I would not recommend them to anyone. Sorry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"Don't purchase this item. The negative reviews are spot on. These worked great for about 3 weeks. Then one side started cutting in and out. It will fade in on one side and then back out. It does it at random times. No pattern about it. I can run a half mile and it will start or sometimes I may be a couple miles into a run. It isn't just one side either. Both sides do it. Luckily, they haven't been doing it at the same time, that is until today. The last two miles of my run this morning were quiet. Both ear pieces decided to quit at the same time toady. So this cheap option may seem worth the risk, but its not. Just move on to something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Decent sound quality. U get what u pay for. A bit more expensive than some other brands, but Sony is my favorite for its quality, style, and endurance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose ears are these made for?","review":"Cheap and still not worth the money I paid. When you hook them over your ears, the buds point to the front of your ear (picture the light on a miner's cap) not down to the inside (ear canal). I tried them on every way possible and couldn't make them point where they were supposed to point. The product description says they isolate sound, but there is no way that can happen without fitting in to your ear canal so the description is not truthful. I recommend buying a non-slip design that is adjustable in some way and not to waste your time or money on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"There's nothing at a local store for this price that comes close. I got these for long-term wearing with a small clip-on MP3 player that plays pink noise at low level while working. Set the volume low enough, and ambient sound comes in fine. This type of design intentionally lets in ambient sound, which is safer for biking, running, walking, etc.They seem to be very secure over the ear and don't pop out like ear buds. They'd be less obvious if they didn't have the silver part as the bottom that seems to be there to re-direct the wire and maybe to help take them on and off. That's my only small complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"These are great headphones, they don't fall off my ears and are pretty durable.

I like the kind that hooks over the ear, because I find that they stay put better than the little knobby ones. I got these because I really liked the color =P and because I trust Sony as a brand.Unfortunately, these didn't fit my ears at all. The plastic is pretty hard and had some rough edges, so I was afraid I was hurting my earlobe when I tried to put them on. Once they were on, I bounced up and down a few times, and that's when they just fell off. That's no good, I wanted to take these on longer (bouncier) runs!I ended up getting a pair of Phillips headphones instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I've purchased several pairs of these headphones because they're cheap and will stay in my ears while running and doing yard work. The sound quality is decent at best but wasn't a problem since this wasn't very important to me. The real problem with these headphones is that they're seemingly programmed to break down after 90 days. Each pair that I bought stopped working after that amount of time. And for the do-it-yourselfers, they're not easy to fix. I'm pretty good with a soldering iron but it seems that once they break down they won't work ever again.Final advice: don't buy these headphones if you plan on running with them because they WILL BREAK DOWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears must be too small","review":"My husband loves these head phones so I finally bought my own pair. Unfortunately they don't work for me. They won't stay in my ear even with the band that fits behind. I guess I will keep looking for the perfect ones for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Running","review":"I had a pair of regular ear pieces before I purchased these. They were always falling out of my ears while I was running, which majorly interrups your flow. These stay snug in my ears, they are a little big, but that doesn't seem to interrupt anything. Great quality and great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They won't stay in!","review":"I bought these for running. Not a good idea. They won't stay on/in my ears for more than a few steps. Granted, my ears stick out a bit, but it's not like I'm Will Smith. Don't buy these for running. The sound is great, so if you're not going to move at all, feel free to buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay on.","review":"I was wanting headphones that would not fall off during exercise. I have never had much luck with earbuds, so I found these and thought they would stay put. I was about 25 feet into a moderate paced run when they fell out. The problem is they aren't adjustable and don't fit snug to your ears...and the cord is waaaaaayyyy too short too. Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for activities","review":"These Sony headphones are great for running or biking because once on your head they almost disappear and become a part of you. Their sound which is very good, (less bass than noise-isolating units that fit into the ear canal) but still allow you to hear outside sounds like cars for safety. Good price for a well designed unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I was looking for a non-slip headphone to wear while jogging. Reading some of the reviews, this seemed like a good and inexpensive product. However, one week into the use, I find this headphone to be poorly designed. The grip does not fit well over my ears and the headphones stay outside of the ear canal. Also, the sound is directed towards the front. So, I will have to raise the volume to hear the sound. The sound can be heard by those standing next to me.The headphones also gave me constant shocks when I used it with my laptop, although this did not happen when I used it with the MP3 player. The sound quality is great. But I am discarding this headphone for reasons stated above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones review","review":"It was nice and cheap, what is not great about it is, when I am running hard it slowly slips out of my ear and kinda dangles.

Also, the main reason why I brought these were because they were the wrap-around version, which I hoped would have helped them stay on while running...no such luck. After wearing them 2 times, I have to return them. Not only are they bulking, they don't stay on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not stay on ears","review":"Good sound, but these do not stay on my ears.

The earphones sent are a dark blue not what is shown in the advertisement. This has happened to 2 items on my last order. I am not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good all-around","review":"I went through quite a few inexpensive headphones before settling on the MDRs. Other headphones would hurt my ear (earbuds), fall out of my ear, sound terrible, or the cord was too short to have my MP3 player in my pants pocket. These solved all those problems. They have a nice long cord, stay in my ear, are very comfortable, and as an added benefit they don't block outside sounds.I thought the sound quality is excellent, but I listen almost exclusively to spoken podcasts, so I admit that frequency response isn't that critical for me. Sometimes you need to jiggle the speaker part more snugly against your ear canal to get the best sound.The biggest drawback to these is that when they've been stored and you're trying to unravel the cord, the ear hooks act like grappling hooks and really get tangled up in the cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best headphones but useful","review":"I bought this headphones because the ones that came with my mobile, slip when I do any cardio exercise (except static bike =p).I read some reviews and some people said that they were almost perfect because they didn't slip.Maybe are my ears (one of them, they are like 3.5cm) but they doesn't fit very well, they kinda slip even if I adjust them.Sound quality is great but not excellent, is not that you're going to have a 7.1 on your ears!, not even a 5.1 (some people expect almost that on headphones) but works fine with stereo and surround or DNSe. I repeat, is not that they are perfect but for the price, I think that you can't ask for more.For the price I think they are right: sound quality and design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"I bought these to go with a new .mp3 player (when they were full price no less) and they did not last a day. The clips are uncomfortable over time, they hold in an odd position, and the speaker is at an odd angle, where they point forward of you, rather then in towards your head.

However, I have used Sony earphones before that are similar to these with vertical ear pieces, but go over the head, instead of just slipping over the ears. Beware these are not comfortable for smaller ears. They did not stay on or in my ears. These also let in a ton of ambient noise. In other words, using these was completely annoying, especially since I got these to use at the gym, which involves a lot of movement and noise. I was constantly having to rehook them on my ears and move them so I could hear my music. I'm going back to my ear clip headphones.

My normal, non-sport earbuds stay in my ears longer than these did! I didn't need yet another pair of regular headphones. I needed some that would stay put when I run. These do not. The ear loop is too big and the actual earbud does not go in your ear (which I liked in theory so you can hear cars, etc), so it just slips off. :(If you have big ears, they probably work just fine, but they were way too big for me and no way to compensate for that.

The sound is alright and they stay on my ears while running; I wish the buds stayed tightly in my ears rather than \\"floating\\" just outside the canal though. Otherwise, they work well enough.Then -- ALWAYS 3 or 4 months after I buy them, one ear bud stops working! This has happened with at least 3 pairs in a row now. How cheap. I am very disappointed that Sony would make a product that systematically fails after 3-4 months... which is suspiciously just long enough to make the warranty invalid.Do not buy these unless you want to buy new ones every 4 months.

At first I thought it was just the headphones moving around in the headphone jack, so I ignored it. A little later I start hearing these loud sparking noises coming from my head phones and take them off, I don't know what may have caused this but I thought I was going to be shocked in the inside of my ear.

He really likes them. They are comfortable in his ears. They seem to be sturdy too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke Quickly","review":"After about a week at the gym, these headphones broke. They did the thing where sound only comes out of one side. There was no sort of traumatic impact with them and I think they are just cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better earbuds","review":"Sounds the same as the earbuds that came with my Ipod Nano. Since these hook over the ear, they don't fall out. They are as light weight as the original earbuds. This is the second pair I've purchased. This pair will stay with my additional MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought these because I wanted something cheap to run with that would be comfortable, so I got these. I knew straight up that the sound quality wouldn't be great, but it's satisfactory; I'm able to listen to music with them and that's about it.But when I opened up the package I read a notice basically saying \\"There's going to be static with these headphones. To reduce it, wear natural fibers clothing\\" or something like that. Wait what? If I don't want static, I need to wear different clothes? Look, the reason I bought these headphones was because I didn't want to spend a lot of money. So I disregarded the notice and when I wore them...static. There was a lot of static. I just ended up throwing them away.You pay barely anything for headphones and you're going to get cheap quality headphones. I'm just going to buy some different ones that are better quality, it'll be worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5th or 6th pair...good general headphone","review":"I keep buying these because they're cheap, sound fine, and I keep misplacing or damaging them. They are easy on, easy off, sweat tolerant and pull off your ears easily when they get tangled during activities or at the gym. Since they're $8 you don't have to worry about them.Sound quality is ok and they let sound through when biking or at the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay Headphones","review":"These headphones work fine. They don't sound fabulous but not at all terrible. I've tried many other earbuds/headphones and have been significantly disappointed. The worst were the sometimes highly rated MEElectronics M6.

They get the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as loose as earbuds","review":"I am one of those people who cannot wear earbuds. My left ear opening is apparently too big to hold one in, and my right ear barely gets by. I bought these hoping I could wear them while jogging. However, the hook over the ear is too loose, and gravity is not enough to hold them on, and I swear I do not have a bouncy stride. I can wear them around the house, but that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying fit","review":"I can't seem to find a pair of earbuds that will stay in my ears while I am jogging. I bought these hoping the design would stay in place. Unfortunately, they flop around, even when I am just walking. They also produce less volume than other earphones I use. Unless you press these up against your ears, the sound is tinny and lacks bass. Besides that, because of the design the cord does tend to get tangled up withe the earpieces. I will stick with earbuds for stationary listening and have purchased a set of headphones (Maxell HB-210) that wrap around my head to use while exercising."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"These are horrible.

The clip is one size fits all. If your ear is not this size, too bad. The earbuds are not designed to fit snugly in your ears. If the clip doesn't fit , then the earbuds will constantly and annoyingly slide out of your ears. When I held my hands to the side of my head, it sounded great. Otherwise I couldn't hear even with the sound turned completely up. If you buy these keep the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Headphones are Junk!","review":"I purchased these headphones because they were supposed to stay clipped to your ear during exercise. I couldn't even walk around the room without one of them falling off. The sound quality is awful and the cord is too short.

Someone else wrote a review and said \\"You get what you pay for.\\" Never more true than with these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice ear phones but WRONG color !!!!","review":"I ordered the green earphones but got a dark pair. You would think you would get the color you ordered. I am not so happy about my order. I just wish I had gotten the correct color."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I've had a pair of these for about a while now, they'll last a long time because i don't use them. They are fairly comfortable but not great for long use as the bud which is in close constant contact w/ the inside of your ear is made of hard plastic. The other downside is that they produce very little bass unless you hold them right in side the ear opening, other than that you're only going to hear mids and highs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Headphones by Sony","review":"I am very particular about my music quality and I thought that buying thes sony headphones might be ok and possibly the only ones that stay in my ears. How wrong I was. They are uncomfortable and the quality of sound is apalling. Don't buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Returning after a couple of hours","review":"These are the worst headphones. After a couple of hours, I am already going to return them. Th sound quality is terrible and there is a static background noise. Also, because they are so large and heavy, they begin to hurt your ears after a while. I did not want expensive headphones before I bought these, but if this pair portends the quality of cheaper headphones, then cheaper is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible running earphones","review":"These are giant earphones.

HOW can sony make a product and not test it well.Please dont buy these.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Athletic headphones start good but end bad","review":"Just like another reviewer, the EXACT SAME PROBLEM has occured to me in EVERY SINGLE PAIR I'VE OWNED! For about $10 lowest retail price, $12 dollars highest, these things have lasted at least 3 months, and at most a year, until the LEFT earbud simply shuts off. The wire leading in to the earbud either comes loose, or dissolves with use. If I held the wire at odd angles, the earbud would work, but otherwise it is simply finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky if they work for you ...","review":"I bought these hoping to have a back-up for my current favorite headphones, which are so comfortable I didn't realize how spoiled I had been. I couldn't wear these, they were too stiff (I like the flexible plastic ones) so first off they hurt my ears = no good, second due to the bad fit, I couldn't hear anything. Now I rated this with two stars because my husband actually uses them. They seem to fit him. So I'm glad they are getting use, but I am still disappointed. I'd suggest looking at other, softer plastic headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than desirable","review":"I bought these earphones because I wanted something non-slip and without a headband. They meet that requirement, but that's about it. The sound is quite tinny and there's very little bass response unless you shove the speaker-portion further into your ear, and even then it's less than I want.I also noticed that if I smile, the shape of my ears change enough that they don't fit right, and actually hurt my ears. Sure, they stay on my ears, so they fit that bill. Other than that, I certainly wouldn't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three pairs, same outcome, these suck!","review":"My husband and I purchased these earphones after reading the great reviews on this product, and after 6 months, the left ear went out on BOTH pairs. Of course, I figured, since my husband is bad on products, perhaps it was something we did. Later, I purchased another set, specifically for my office at work. In 6 months time the left ear went out again. Ridiculous. Since they were only used at work, I CAN'T imagine that it was fault of the user this time. The only conclusion I have come to, is that these earphones although look fantastic, are not great headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Earbuds EVER","review":"Hated them.

I've since bought two other brands in hopes that they might work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over ear clip-style headphones","review":"I have been buying these or equivalent Sony headphones for years. They don't fall off, are comfortable and work well. After awhile, given enough trips and slips, the wire seems to pull loose. That's OK because by then I have gotten more than $20 worth of listening. The design places the speaker in a unique comfiguration so they don't get shoved into the ear canal.Also, I'll be darned if I ever bought the pink ones! I bought white, silver, and blue ones, NOT pink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"These headphones are terrible! I bought them a few days ago to get rid of my crappy ear buds that don't stay in when I run. First step on my jog, these fell out. They do not stay in your ears unless you have enormous ears. sure they're relatively comfortable and probably OK for walking but not for running. The sound is also terrible. Don't bother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice headphones","review":"Good quality headphones for the sound and the design which makes them fit well. However the fit is slightly loose at times and needs to be pushed in but again everybody's ear is structured differently.I paid $6 for these Sony headphones, at this price I would say its worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"for some ears only","review":"The generally positive reviews about sound quality and fit spurred me to buy this product, and I found that they were much too loose for my ears. I'm happy with the sound quality and whatnot, but I've gained minimal utility from this purchase, perhaps because my ears are not of the standard size. If you suspect your ears are similarly non-typical, I suggest going with something else. I did give these to my boyfriend, who has lovely, and probably normally-sized ears, and he commends their quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time to buy these","review":"I like these personally, not for the high quality of the sound or the product but because even when I am running into the wind they don't move. I have tried other headphones (even ones Sony called sports headphones) but they move with a slight breeze not to mention running. These hurt a little b/c they pinch the back of your ears but I say as long as they do not move who cares!Hope this helps you in your search for good headphones. . . Enjoy and keep the fires burning (if you know what it means then we are automatically friends)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable","review":"These have beeen around for a while from Sony. I've had a pair since around 2002ish. They *finally* gave up the ghost about a week ago. Average sound, but for lasting about 5 years, you really can't beat it. And yes, I abused the SNOT out of them, too.My only real complaint, and why I haven't replaced them with another pair, is that like any earbud-like headphones, they get tangled really easy when you're not wearing them, so I moved to something quite a bit bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Headphones","review":"These headphones feel comfortable and stay on. They sound very good. Good for the gym or for running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the $10 I paid for them","review":"I bought these off Amazon for $10 to use as my back up headphones for exercising. My pair may have been defective, but the product did not stay in my ears even with the wrap around addition. The volume was not great, especially if you are using them for running in a congested area. I would spend 10 more dollars and get the pair ofSennheiser PMX70 Sport Line Stereo Neckband Headphonesfeatured on Amazon for just under $20. The Sony are a little more durable because they have bendable parts (I broke my first pair of Sennheiser's by jamming them into my gym bag each day), but the Sennheiser offers a way better sound and feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking if you're looking to hear your music","review":"Now granted, I didn't expect perfection.They're headphones.But it's SONY for crying out loud, you'd think you could expect at least decent sound...Well, to be clear, the sound is *fine*... if you cram these as far as possible into your ears and turn the sound waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay up.Bought these for my iPod, and they're not going to work, but working just fine for listening to the radio at work without the earbud popping out every 2 minutes, thus the 2 stars.Keep looking if you're looking for good music headphones though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, reliable, decent sound for low price point. Great Buy!","review":"I use them daily for drowning out the noise of the office around me, and the first pair held up under daily use (8-10hrs a day) for almost 3 years. Before that they were used for jogging/workouts, they fit comfortably and wont fall off your ears while running or laying down for ab workouts/bench exercises.This is my second purchase of this model of headphone. Until these things prove me wrong, I'll keep coming back for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor headphones","review":"I shouldn't expect much from $10 headphones, but these are really, really bad. I am not an audiophile beyond any stretch of the imagination, but music just sounds awful, like listening to a mono speaker. It's more annoying than enjoyable. There is absolutely 0 bass. And I can't wear them for more than 5 minutes sitting at my desk before my ears throb in pain. They do seem durable though, so that's why 2 stars. But I do NOT recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"i bought these headphones especially for the purpose of running, but they're too big for my ears and keep falling out. plus, they're not great for casual music listening--they're too bulky and awkward to put on and take off. i am returning them to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Sound Quality, even for something this cheap","review":"The sound quality was much lower than I expected even from an inexpensive pair - there isn't much base and it sounds pretty hollow.To top it off, there is a consistent static in the background when these are plugged into my computer - there isn't any with other headphones.The cord is much shorter than I expected, on the order of half a similar pair of headphones I recently purchased.The only real pro I see is that they stay on well, but this can be found with other pairs. These seem to sell very well, which is why I bought them, but I fail to see why.My experience: You're better off paying an extra few bucks for a nicer model or just going with a cheaper model and expect poor sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crime against bass","review":"These earclips fit nicely around the ears and perform that function well. However, to play any rock music, or music with bass, soft or low sounds through these headphones is a crime against humanity. I purchased these at a brick and mortar store and the moment I played one title from Godsmack through them I knew they had to be returned. The bass is is almos non-existent and soft sounds can not be discerned. The OEM headphones that came with a Creative Zen V Plus far outshine this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I give these headphones a good rating. They are an exellent value for the money.The sound is a little cloudy. Although I have tried the higher priced models and brands and honestly fine these are the best value."},{"rating":"2","title":"good headphones","review":"For the price, these headphones are hard to beat.

After reading the reviews on this product I decided to purchase. I have not been disappointed. The sound was very good for the price and they fit snugly in the ears. I like the fact that the small earbud speakers are positioned toward the eardrum for a clearer sound. Just exactly what I needed and wanted. I'm considering buying a couple more pair for back-ups. Plus my teenagers like them too and sneek them away from me. So when I'm looking for them they are not where I left them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non Slip?","review":"The chord is entirely too long for an active set of head phones. Who needs 4 foot total length. I'm not wearing my MP3 player on my ankle. This is especially true if you wear your media player around your neck. I don't know how active others have really been while wearing these but they did not stay in my ears. I have fairly large ears as well so I was really surprised by this one. I figured they would be bothering me by being too tight! Do not get these if you are planning on really running around. These might be ok if you are just walking or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"best\\" buy!","review":"the head phones that come with the ipods simply are a pain in my ear but these are wonderfully comfortable and I'm on my second pair (the first pair had one side that went out after 3 years of use -- I still have them - simply cut off the bad 'cord/earbud' and still use them when I want to be more aware in my environment!). They fit my ears, they don't block sound (so I can still hear a car approaching while on a walk or someone calls my name at work) and people around me don't have to 'hear' my music or podcasts! I love the flexible cord and that it's really long (so my ipod can sit on my desk, be in a coat pocket or in my hand with no issues of knocking the headphones off my head!) The sound has been excellent and stands up well to high as well a lower volumes for music (nothing tinny and no echos, pretty true sounds over all) and I find them great for the spoken word as well. At this price, I don't mind replacing them every three years as they get almost daily use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running!","review":"So, I still have these more than a year later and they are still working great! These have been great for outdoor running, running at the gym, or just doing anything that involves moving. I use 'em when I cut the grass, walk the dog, or take the bus. They don't slip out, they're fairly comfortable, and they look good. I was tired of my original iPod buds slipping out of my ears. If you're serious about listening to your playlist while jogging, this is it. For the price, it's fantastic! The sound quality has slightly dipped since I first bought them, but I'll probably just order another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"These do NOT adjust","review":"I thought I had done my research and assumed those that give these headphones a really low rating just had no idea how to adjust the ear pieces so they properly fit. Well shame on me - because these headphones do not adjust. Either your ears fit or they don't. Simple as that. Guess I'm a part of the group with weird sized ears - can't wait for my membership jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"great, if only i could hear the music to keep me going.","review":"I bought the headphones for one reason,to workout. I like my music loud so i can feel motivated. The hooks stay on my ears great but one speaker wouldn't stay in place inside my ear.

Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"Bad sound quality and very little blocking out of external noise. They also shocked my ears a lot.

I'd advise spend a few more dollars and get something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I bought these hoping to have a good pair of headphones to use while running. They do stay on while I am running, but the sound quality is pretty terrible. The way the earbud is designed, the speaker barely projects into your ear. Also I feel like the size of the headphones were made for someone with giant ears. I would say I have average sized ears and they feel really big on me. I suppose they get the job done for $10, but I wouldn't buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for running... period.","review":"I got this because of the reviews saying they would stay in place...well, i tried them for the first time 2 days ago and I spent most of the time putting them back in place than actually working out (just running and walking, nothing too crazy). They seem to be too big for me, not that my ears are tiny, but they definitely don't fit.Sound is just OK, you get what u paid for. I don't mind too much about the sound quality, but if it would only stay in place!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these","review":"I had these headphones years ago & they broke after years of use & I bought a different brand which I ended up hating because they hurt from the way they sit inside my ear.

So glad I got these again in time to run my 4th Boston Marathon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This earphone is much useful while Running and doing excercise","review":"I wanted a small, comfortable pair that wouldn't leak any sound. These are definitely small, and I like the design. They hook completely over your ears, and the ear piece goes inside your ear.

So I don't need symphonic sound quality, but I do need headphones that will stay on even during strenuous physical activity, allow me to hear ambient noise (like the phone ringing), do not make my ears sore after the first couple of hours, and are loud enough to be heard over various types of machinery noise. These are perfect for those needs, and I can take them on and off without having to adjust them every time the way you have to do with over-the-ear headphones that are malleable. Do not buy these headphones if you are looking for a sublime musical experience or if you expect your headphones to last a lifetime. But if you want headphones that are comfortable enough to wear all your waking hours and cheap enough to lose or break, then these are great. I've owned 8 or 10 pairs, and I hope they never quit making them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality...","review":"Bought a pair of these earlier tonight in Best Buy for a few bucks more than listed here. Sadly, it still wasn't worth the price!First off, the fit is good. They stay on your ear really well. Having said that...The sound is AWFUL!!! Really awful! Do not buy these unless you want to waste money on shipping them back.For what you spent on an iPod or MP3 or whatever...spend a little more & get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One size does not fit all","review":"This Sony earphone is a nightmare to use.

I bought these headphones for jogging but upon trying them out it was immediately apparent that they were far too big and would have trouble staying on even if I was standing still, let alone doing something active like exercise. But then again, my ears ARE smaller than the norm so I'll just say that if your ears aren't average-sized to large, I wouldn't recommend this product. The sound quality is fine, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts my small ears","review":"I thought that these earphones would just sit outside your ear so that you can hear what is happening around you as well as your music. That is not true with this particular earphone, the speaker is perpendicular to the hook which goes around your ear, so the small part must be put in your ear canal to be comfortable. These earphones are great sounding, but beyond that I can not wear them for more than a half an hour at a time. The piece that must sit within your ear canal to get good sound is very large, and if you have small ears like I do it will stretch and pull your ear.I do like that you don't have to turn the volume up much to hear what you are listening to well. You can also turn the volume up very high and use them as speakers on your desk, but that does sort of defeat the purpose of earphones.Good for some people, but terrible for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good for little-eared people","review":"POSITIVES: sound is decent, they stay in my ear better than earbuds, colors are fun. adjustable cord is nice, since i can wear them with the cord behind my head. long enough for room, but doesn't get tangly.NEGATIVES: i don't know if i have a small ear or what (I'm a girl), but the top of the thing doesn't actually hook on my ear because it's too big. it just kind of sits there sticking up. they would stay on better if i could somehow adjust it so it was sitting ON the top of my ear instead of hovering. really the only thing keeping it in is the earbud part, so they sometimes come loose when running or come out when stretching."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Pair Avaliable","review":"These are the best headphones and here is why.SOUND QUALITY: The sound is amazing on these.

My tragus (small bump in front of the ear canal) is sore for about an hour after using these headphones for maybe... 2 hours. I have thrown these out and have bought different headphones. I highly reccomend people to NOT use these.Also, it might be environmental, but I was constantly getting static shocks from these headphones. ...as I said, it might be environmental, but I've never had this problem before and it's really annoying (and slightly painful) to be shocked on in the inner ear.Worst pair of headphones I have ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"These headphones are not so great. I've had them for quite some time, but I sill can't get used to the discomfort of having them in my ears. Sometimes it's fine, but other days I can't stand them.

But I bought these for the sole purpose of using them to workout and had issues on my first use with one of the earpieces cutting in and out. I had seen reports of a poor design around where the wire enters the earpiece and I am not sure that is exactly what I had, but it was frustrating. It only seemed to cut out as a result of my movement while doing cardio. Now I can only use them while not moving around. Given this problem, I would not buy them again.

I guess my ears are too small, b/c they didn't fit snugly and I could hear a lot of outside noise. Plus when I move the cord around, I got some static... They are quite in-expensive, but that's about all that they have going for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound, good fit (for me)","review":"In-ear \\"headphones\\" are kind of a personal fit. I imagine that ears and heads are shaped and sized differently enough that some people would hate how these fit since the business end is hard (but smooth) plastic, not foam or whatever soft material. For me, they fit my ears perfectly. They are very comfortable since I barely feel them when I wear them. The over-ear portion fits under my glasses, keeping them snugly in my ears. I can hear sounds around me well enough while wearing these, yet they supply nice, full sound. The cord length is good (longer than average I would say). For the price, they are a very nice set to have for walking or bike riding or other activities where you want something light that won't fall out of your ears as you move around.I would consider these 2 or 3 times better than the JVC Marshmallow, Gummies, and Ipod ear buds that I have bought my kids over the last couple of years, and they cost less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for 7 months","review":"These earphones were good only for 7 months.

Sure, they look nice, and for some, will fit perfectly on your ears. But, do they work properly? NO.I purchased these headphones because I misplaced the original pair that came with my discman, and for about 2 weeks they worked wonderfully.

As a result doesn't have a good quality.The construction is not good, giving a feeling of some very cheap plastic.The sound quality is flat, not appealing for any kind of music.It is loose. I don't understand how such a designed for sport headphone cannot stay on my ears firmly; it cannot fit into ears well either, 1/3 of the \\"head part\\" is out of ear.However, for such a price, this headphone is ok. I just use it for working out at gym so I wouldn't tear up my good one.The shipping is really good! It's free shipping and arrived within 2 days. Amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is miserable.

But, at this price, who can complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Fit My Ears","review":"I bought these because of the good reviews and because the price was great compared to what was available in my stores, but they were too big for my ears.

I really like the way they look, but cannot wear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay on.","review":"I give these 2 stars only because the sound quality isn't bad. Otherwise I'd only give one star because they WILL NOT stay on my ears even when I'm not moving. They just drop right off. I've tried to twist and bend them to fit better but they really aren't malleable and I have no success. At the recommendation of the sales associate at Target I am now trying Skullcandy earbuds which are much better, but still not the perfect solution I'm looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sturdy headphones","review":"These are great headphones for the active person. I use them all the time when exercising or doing yard work. They have been accidentally pulled off my head quite a few times and have not broke and the wires have not torn. The sound quality is not bad but it isn't perfect. You shouldn't be getting these headphones anyways if you wanted perfect since that's not what they are meant for. The only improvement I would give these headphones is an optional clothing attachment on the wire so that the wire doesn't flop around when you are doing things. I jury-rigged a safety pin with a twist tie on the wire so I could pin it to my shirt and that seems to work fine. They worked so well for me I bought my wife a set for when she works out and she liked them a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for running ... if you don't care about music","review":"The Good: Sony MDR-J10 Ear Headphones are comfortable (to me) and stay put while running. The cord length is generous, for example if you clip the player to your waist belt.The Not So Good: The wires are thin compared to the iPod ear buds, but they are standard for typical ear phones in this price range.The Ugly: The sound of these ear phones is extremely thin and tinny. There is little to no bass or treble. The range that is emphasized is the upper midrange.Previously I bought the Panasonic RP-HV094 Simple Ear Buds from Amazon. The price today is less than half the Sony MDR-J10 but the sound is more than twice as good. They don't fit over the ear, but they stay in place when I run. I'm pretty sure the Sony MDR-E818LP ear buds that I bought from Amazon years ago were way better, too.In short, the MDR-J10 is a comfortable design with lousy sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, hard to use, too big!!","review":"1.

Horrible purchase that I immediately returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for working out","review":"I got these headphones so I could listen to my MP3 player while working out. I use them on the elipitical and lifting weights. They do move a little when I put my hair behind my ears, but other than that they are great. Also, I have really small ears and they fit comfortably. The sound isn't amazing, but for working out they are very funtionally. Also they are quiet, meaning the person next to me doesn't have to listen to my music. For the price, I think they are great! I recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me.....","review":"I swear my life's quest has been finding a pair of suitable headphones/earphones to excercise in. I saw these and I thought...oh SONY! Perfect. Except no. The entire time I ran/moved I spent with my hand on my ear to ensure the bud wouldn't fall out. They were so bad. This is probably my 8th pair this year. Maybe one day I will find some headphones...."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I needed to replace my iPod earbuds - I'm one of those people who can't keep buds in their ears. I was willing to pay for a headband or clip model with good sound, but everything for sport use seems to be in the $10-$20 range. I tried these and compared them to the Apple earbuds and to an old Sony headband that came with a cheap Sony Walkman radio. Of the 3 sets, the best was my old Sony headband model MDR-W10. Second best were the stock Apple earbuds, and a way distant third was the Sony MDR-J10. The sound was terrible, very tinny. While they will stay on your ears because they clip on, they only fit right if your ear is the size Sony thinks it ought to be. Don't buy these. Whatever you've already got is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought these would be good for running...","review":"I thought these would be good for running, but they aren't if you have normal size ears.Pros:-long cord?Cons:-hard plastic that goes in your ear-the ear pieces are way too big-always fall out, and are looseThese headphones suck, just don't buy them. I was trying to use them for running and biking (both outside and stationary) and the headphones would fall out constantly. Also, they were always loose, so I could never hear the music anyways. The inside of my ears would also tend to get sore since they're pretty hard plastic ear pieces--come to think of it the outside of my ears would hurt too. Luckily they were cheap, but do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"inexpensive, but poor quality","review":"This is my second pair of these headphones; both suffered exactly the same fate. WIthin a few months of ownership, the left channel just stopped working. No, I didn't drop them or sit on them or wash them in the washing machine by mistake -- they were either in my ears or in a drawer in my desk.

Most of them last around a year at the most and the left side always just shuts down.These are very comfy and fit snugly in your ear. It also doesn't pop out when you go running so that's why I like them. Some other ones (Panasonic in-ear) always pops out and I end up not wearing them anyways.Even though this is the best sport ear phones I've had - it's also the worst because of something faulty with it in itself - the left earbud.

I'm not an audiophile, so I'm not going to opine on the sound except to say that I can hear music from them and it sounds comparable to what I hear on my car stereo. What makes these headphones stand out for me is that when I put them in my ears they stay there, and they're not too bulky. I can wear them around town and I don't look like silly. And when I go out for a run, I'm not worried that they're going to fall out of my ears like the standard ipod earbuds do. As a bonus, they actually go a little into the ear hole, and because of that they do block out a little more outside noise than earbuds do. The only complaint I have is that if you wear them for too long, they kind of hurt a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound, terrible fit","review":"These headphones have excellent sound quality, if you can get them to stay on your ears.

Very disappointing.

I don't subject my headphones to harsh wear and tear, so there's no reason for these to break except for a manufacturing defect, which I suspect all MDR-J10's probably have.

Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for running....","review":"These are decent headphones if you don't plan to workout with these. I am a casual runner and found these extremely uncomfortable while running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"The sound in these ear phones are exceptional. The only problem is that they do not fit right in my ears so I cannot fully enjoy the high quality of sound. I tried to put them on as many different ways and they just didn't feel or look right.

So it either fits you are not, and not adjustable. So my ear was too small for it therefore I immediately returned the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good fit and sound quality, but lacks durability","review":"I must have gone through 7 or 8 pairs of this model in the past couple of years, and am done with them. There is a clear manufacturing defect. I guess I kept replacing them because I got them for cheap and they were usually the lightest-weight most compact headphone sports headphones that would fit.The problem I ran into was always the same. After a couple of months (maybe a max of 6) of consistent use, mainly for working out, one earbud would invariably short out. Either the sound would cut off completely or I would get intermittent sound. Often by adjusting the position of the wire, the sound would be restored, but only if I kept the wire in a certain position manually. Having only one headphone working out of two, although annoying, was acceptable for my purposes. Usually, however, the other the headphone would quickly follow suit, rendering the product useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"New purchase, but already regretting it","review":"I've been using this product for about two days now and already I regret it. My biggest issue is with the comfortability of the headphones. The portion that goes over the ear is fine, but it's the actual earbuds that are killing my ears (one side more than the other, so maybe my ears are shaped funny?). I wouldn't recommend these for anyone with small ears like me. Also, the sound quality is only ok. There's virtually no bass, and the volume output seems moderately low on these. I get better sound quality and comfort from my clip-on earphones from 5+ years ago. I bought these in green, hoping they would be a bright green color, but it's more of a sage green. If you don't have a problem with earbuds, these would probably work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"No bass but plenty of treble...","review":"Even with songs that have a lot of bass, you can barely hear any with these headphones...but afterall they are only chump-change worth compared to the beats...they fit perfectly during workouts and do not slip out at all.."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy sound","review":"these headphone had a horrible sound and no bass and not comfortable in the ear.But what did i expect for 7.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"too big","review":"maybe i have a small head.. i dont know. but these are ill fitting. glad mamazon gave me a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't stay in my ears","review":"I have a hard time finding earphones - buds don't stay in my ear for a second, so I was hoping these would work. They are pretty big on my ears, even though I have big eras. Maybe my ear holes are small. For running, they don't stay on whatsoever. I had a pair of monoprice hook on earphone that I loved but they no longer make them. If you have trouble keeping headphones in your ears, get an inner ear style, not these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinny and no base","review":"I have been using the Sony MDR-J10 for at LEAST a decade. I have owned many many pairs of them. They go by the wayside in typical ways. Kids break them, earphones short out, cord gets caught on something and gets yanked out of the bottom, etc...This pair of green ones that I just got are so tinny and have so little base, that they sound like a pair of .50 cent headphones instead of a pair of $10 headphones.I don't have high requirements for headphones and I don't expect the world from a $10 pair, but these are significantly worse than they use to be.I have an old pair here at work where the right ear has shorted out after a pretty long time. When I compare the two listening to Alan Parson's Jigue, there is a clear quality difference.I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice headphones","review":"I thought these headphones were very comfortable and sounded great.

Quality is pretty decent but wish it had bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while they last, which is never for long","review":"I too have had the same annoying experience as most of the other \\"one starers\\". And I keep buying them again anyway. They are ideal while they last. They are the most comfortable, best sound (for $10 earphones), and they are the only compact earphones that stay on my ears. Within six months the left one starts to short out. I wish I could find some similar earphones that lasted, but I haven't been able to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh, they're ok","review":"These headphones fit very well on my head, and the sound is good. But, mine keep dying on me (I'm now on my third pair in a year), so if you're looking for a long lasting set of headphones, you've come to the wrong place! The bass is ok in these, but it's not the greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than Maxell brand, stays on ear too!","review":"I had an older pair of the same style Sony brand headphones. I loved them but they finally had become unreliable because of cord damage - they lasted almost two years.This pair is AWESOME. I though my previous pair had good bass, this pair outshines the older pair absolutely. The Black Eyed Peas were great before but with these phones in my ears they really funk now!The design stayed comfortablly in my ears before but the size of the speakers must be slightly smaller or angled better because they fit into my ears better.The only downside is that since the speaker does go into the ear slightly, I eventually end up with some ear wax residue on the speaker grill. That issue is easily and quickly resolved by using and old toothbrush (not to be confused with the current and in use toothbrush) and lightly brushing away the residue while hlding the speakers grill pointed down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the non-died Tic Tacs","review":"Tic Tac's in most parts of the world, (I have purchased them in Europe, Australia, South America and Asia) are not colored orange, they are an off white color. They come in an orange colored plastic box. In the US, the box is clear and the Tic Tacs are died orange.I personally think the whitish colored, orange flavored Tic Tacs are the best. They have a more subtle flavor that I prefer. Also, why do should I eat the unneeded food coloring. I will admit that eating the food coloring is not a real big issue for me, but the taste of the non-colored tic tacs is what caused me to seek out the non-us varieties.At anyrate I look specificly for the orange contaiered off white colored tic Tac.

I would definitely order from the again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty","review":"Despite the bad reviews mostly due to the color of the tic tacs I placed an order. My tic tacs arrived orange, but horribly stale. I was able to crush the tic tac between my fingers with little effort and they had a funny metallic taste to them. I am something of a Tic Tac connoisseur and these were just uneatable. I desire the crunchyness of the first bite into the tic tac and these severely lacked this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tic Tacs","review":"I was pleased with the fast shipment, however, they were supposed to be orange tic tacs and they were all white. I didn't know this until the bridal shower when people opened them b/c the package was a dark orange and made the tic tacs appear to be orange too. Too late to send back at that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book!!!","review":"This book is the type of Regency that I love to read. It had the language, the beautiful clothing (with descriptions), and a mystery to be solved, with the heroine becoming endangered. The beautiful heroine, Fantine Delmere, that doesn't realize her own beauty; and the arrogant Earl, Nicholas, Earl of Ashcom, who needs to be brought down a peg. Add to this, a London Season being forced upon the beauty, who despises the arrogant earl for supporting her family for three generations and we have a delightful Regency Romp. I really enjoyed this book and it definitely has a place on my bookshelf. This book is definitely a keeper and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys Regencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning- Duplicate Album","review":"I only recently discovered this band.

I used to go home after a show and still here davids guitar playing the next morning.this release ( ticket home on sector 2 label) if i am not mistaken ,ended up scaming the rights from the band. making it unavialable ,out of print.Thats why this is going to be the most valuable release to date.Its to bad that someone took advantage of the band.

I was hoping this would be an adequate over-the-counter temporary cement for a maryland bridge that had come out (after ~10 years). It was not.

It is not advertised as a cement for this purpose, but does mention bridge replacement in its instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of the time it took","review":"Recapit and recapit and recapit is what it should be called.

This proved to be an excellent resource for finding a restaurants for meals with clients. I also found some restaurants that I would like to take my family to on my next visit to nyc and a great hotel for us to try. I found the establishment descriptions incredibly useful. It was refreshing to have an overall description as opposed to one person's opinion. When I am choosing a restaurant, I want to know the facts not some random person's point-of-view. This book is a great tool for new yorkers and visitors to new york alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly useless","review":"This guide will only serve you well if your sole interest is French cuisine. Il Mulino, perhaps the finest Italian restaurant in the city, receives no stars. Peter Luger, arguable the best steakhouse in the word, receives a single star. The \\"more\\" ethnic, the less likely this guide is to have something nice to say. For example, I didn't see a single sushi place that received a star. Meanwhile, dozens of French restaurants that most New Yorkers wouldn't dine at unless they live on the same block are given 2 stars.Sure, tastes differ. These ratings, however, are not at all in line with the preferences of most New Yorkers, myself, or my many out of town friends (including some who are French) who have dined in NYC.The only positive thing I have to say is that the book is well put together and pleasing to look at with its color photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Skewed Irregular Representation of the NYC Dining Scene","review":"This is one of the worst food review books to date on the subject of NYC. This is strange considering that usually I like Michelin Guides. But...looking at this book and seeing the best Italian restaurant in New York (agreed on by every other dining book in New York, mind you) Il Molino, snubbed with no stars by these critics, yet this book gives one of the, in my opinion worst restaurants in New York, Craft a star.

It forces one to consider the downplaying of humor and the emphasis on seriousness in the Christian tradition - for myself this brought up interesting issues with regards to the Holy Fools tradition and the Laughing Buddha tradition.The joy of reading this book is even greater - the reader gets a bonus in postmodern literary analysis in the book's interpretation of Eco's The Name of the Rose. Again, one may not ultimately agree with the book's conclusions but you will be nudged to think about issues rarely raised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing is outstanding, unfortunately you can't hear!","review":"For those you of eagerly seeking recordings that validate the incredible Miles concerts of the late 80s, you might want to pass up on this one. The mixing is so bad. Adam's keyboards, which are often used to fill in the sound, are so prominent you can barely hear Kenny (sax) Daryl (bass) or Ricky (drums). I am telling you, the mixing really sucks. Obviously an amatuer production. Stick to Live Around the World until the rest gets released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight from the board","review":"The audio quality is quite bad, as mentioned by the preceding reviewer.For those willing to put up with a \\"board\\" mix (ie, a recording made straight from the FOH mixing board's outputs) this might be an acceptable trade-off, considering the material played here is unpolished, musically (not just sonically) speaking, and thus presents us with a fresh perspective from which to rediscover unexplored nooks and cranies in the standard repertoire of the last Miles Davis touring band.The solid performance from said band is the saving grace for this \\"Live by Miles Davis\\" CD (or whatever the actual name of it is, or ought to be).Bottom line: not just for die-hard fans and musicians, but pretty close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing to the mystery lover.","review":"What is it about the British that has so soured Truman? I have not read a book by her in which any of the British characters were nice. Here the prime nasties are all British, from the murder victim ~ the Ambassador ~ to the planner and executer of the cover-up and the people who end up giving our protagonist clues. The only Britons of any attraction are incidentals who wander in and out of the book in a page or two. Sadly, this is not my only complaint about the book: I don't like Truman's insistance on some details ~ locations, specific stores, clothing ~ which she uses to establish her credibility. Nor has she invented an even plausible plot ~ the British Ambassador to Iran knew weeks beforehand about the Ayatollah's takeover in '79, including the plan to capture the American embassy, and the only use he made of the information was to plan a smuggling operation? Please. Stick to biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Ms. Truman Get Tired?","review":"The story line was interesting, the characters were well developed, some details were fuzzy, but I enjoyed the story up until the end - but not the end. There was no denouement, it just ended right after the climax; then it skipped ahead months and became a wedding announcement. It seemed that the author just wanted to be done with it, and never tied up any of the loose ends. Bad guy shot & killed a good guy - The End. There should have been about 5 pages more to close the story. Either she was tired of the story and just wanted to be done with it early, or thought the wedding announcement would be a \\"cute\\" finish, but her readers deserve better.

Unfortunately with this book he tended to pick the low hanging fruit and gave us more of the same old stuff, the \\"shocking but true\\" and the \\"they don't want you to find out\\" info. He rattles off some well-used stories about many of the last holders of the office meant to show that power corrupts etc. The only thing I found new was some of the descriptions of the everyday employees of the White House and their daily jobs. Overall this is an average book.

It's pumped full out of hot air and is totally dated besides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but untrustworthy","review":"This book keeps your attention, but the section on Clinton is so overtly biased that it calls in to question everything else in the book. Not only is it extremely slanted, but the author spends a disproportionate amount of time picking apart Clinton regardless of what he does, and commenting on his policy. Also, interestingly, the author paints an overwhelmingly bad picture of the democratic presidents since Johnson, and a generally favorable picture of the republican presidents in such a consistent and emphatic way that it seems unlikely that it is really accurate, particularly once he gets going on Clinton.I was completely loving this book until I heard the way he treated Clinton, and it became very clear that the author had his own agenda, which was much more important that a fair presentation of life inside the white house. Worth reading, but not worth spending money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trashy, but makes you think","review":"I'll admit, this is a gossipy, trashy book. I'll admit Kessler's writing style is uneven - he often jumps topics with little warning. But I'll also admit I couldn't put this book down - and it really made me think about the too-high standards we often set for presidential candidates. Did Bill Clinton do anything different that LBJ or JFK? No, it's just that we live in more open times now, and the press isn't as willing to cover information up like it did before. I look forward to reading more of Kessler's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"You would've thought I country bumpkin wrote this book.","review":"Johnson's part was hilarious.

Like others have said it is dated and corny. The corniest in my opinion is in the lunch room where a boy that Danny is witnessing to says \\"Jesus, man\\", across the lunch room to Danny. However, that just shows how there are people that are hungry and searching who don't care what others think of them. This movie should be shown in adult as well as youth groups. It is inspiring and does a great job of showing what a lack of Jesus can do in not just the believer's life but the lives of everyone the believer has contact with.

However, families are different so there is instant friction. Overcoming these barriers is a difficult task as everyone has doubts. At one moment, the wedding appears to be off but finally, its on again.Again, nothing special. You get some good laughs, you'll enjoy the acting. Nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a $1 rental","review":"Even with a spectacular cast, the filmakers tried to mix stone-cold sentiment with over-the-top, would-never-happen-in-a-million-years jokes and none of it works .... not even in the slightest way. The other \\"good\\" reviewers must work for the DVD company or Amazon or some such because this movie has no redeeming qualities at all. There is zero chemistry between any of the cast members.

It tried way too hard to be funny - and it missed the mark completely. I never laughed once during this film, and the scenes that were supposed to be \\"touching\\" were stale. I spent most of my time looking at my watch and waiting for the movie to end.Centering around the surprise, impending marriage between a nice Hispanic girl and an African-American soon-to-be doctor, the movie tries to expose the humor between the two cultures when they attempt to become family.

Unless you are in a quiet environment, you will not be able to hear the timer alarm. In itself, the timer's concept is great. The fundamental problem is that the alarm is faint. With the refrigerator motor, perhaps television on or perhaps the microwave running you cannot hear the timer ringing.

One allows the user to control the light alarm, another the sound alarm, another the vibrator alarm, and the fourth controls the choice of whether the timer is set for hours/minutes or minutes/seconds. It is so refreshing to see a product in which the designers haven't tried to cram every last function into a maze within the main display. There is a clip on the back that is magnetic and also folds into a little stand to display the timer on your desk. The design of this timer is elegant in its simplicity. My only criticism is slight--when I cut open the package, one of those formidable package designs that requires a scissors, I also unknowingly cut the manual.

I found the Polder also rang louder and longer than desired if sitting nearby. HOWEVER, I took it home and found it makes an ideal alarm clock. On vibrate, I set it for specific numbers of hours and minutes, and it makes enough noise to wake me. Since I don't have to worry about power going off and or the complexity of setting a battery-operated alarm clock (you need to be a rocket scientist to figure them out), I'm very happy with this tiny gadget. For short periods of time, ex. to check something in the oven, I'd love a loop of some kind at the top to wear it on a neck lanyard. If I don't stay close by, I can be out of hearing distance when it rings. Though the Polder does have a sturdy clip, it's oddly balanced to hang on a shirt. The Polder is a mainstay of my everyday life and I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good timer!!","review":"Could be louder and batteries run down a little fast but it is the best one I found for the price.

These may be set to be hours:minutes (max time 19:59) or minutes:seconds (max time 99:59). The timer counts down to 0 at which time the alarms go off and repeat for at least 30 seconds. After you hit the stop button, the time returns to the previous setting. You may choose any combination of sound, light, and vibration. The combination of flashing light and vibration works perfectly at my desk, and for meetings I stick it in my pocket and use vibration.

Well, I got what I paid for!Not a lot. This timer is extremely small and light weight. I can completely cover it in my hand. Once you have set the timer, you have to be extremely careful how you handle or carry it. The start/stop button is the same button and if you accidentially just barely touch it, it will stop the timer and you might not even be aware you did it. You also have to change the setting on the back of it if you want to set it for one hour or more, or chage it if you want it set in minutes only. If you forget to make this change, you will mess up the time. This is very easy to do as it's hard to tell how it's set just looking at the front of it. Also, it doesn't show the time counting down so you can't tell how much time is left before it buzzes. I now realize that just because a product gets good reviews it can be completely wrong for me.

This was one of the worst movies that I have seen in a long time. Amazon sells tons of great movies: this isn't one of them. I cared about the plot of the movie for approximately .13 seconds before I gave up. The acting reminded me of a \\"PBS\\" special, and the rest of the movie was so bad that we skipped a few chapters in the middle just to try to get to the end. I would have had more fun putting me hand in a blender for 82 minutes then watching that movie. I plan to send the producers a bill for my time, but I'll never be able to really recover it. The ending of this movie was more predictable then Titanic. Don't buy this..in fact, don't even rent it. Tell your friends not to either.

I found his thesis for this book of essays fascinating--a cultural connection of Jewish heterosexual males comics of the 1960s (though I believe Bruce experimented sexually), and the pushing of the comedic form as it has influenced the evolution of comedy/satire of today.His essays on Lenny Bruce and Nichols and May are some of the best writing on these comic/social satirists in print, and great reason to buy this book. His analysis of Elaine May's subtle character work I found extremely insightful, and proved her impact in this male dominated world of humor in the 50s and 60s; she has influenced many through the years, yet is rarely applauded in recent years for she her brilliance and contribution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book appears to be directed at the PhD, scholarly crowd.

I actually read it already a year into my first voyage. Yet, the chapters on managing fear and interpersonal dynamics were especially useful. You can't take enough skills along with you.

Am still looking for the book someone has written, that deals with the single person who chooses a compact life living on a boat, much like we did when in college.

I got through half the book only to learn it repeats itself, its data and its findings over and over again from one survey respondent to the next. If you're into research, this appears to be an incredibly well researched book (five year study), but the author fails miserably to make it interesting.

I can keep the dongel in a USB multiport device along with my external drives and printers, etc. without a hitch, freeing up on-board USB ports. It's comfortable. I have dropped it numerous times and it just keeps on working. Tool-less battery changes. I have purchased additional Logitech V320 mice for my other computers.

And I have to say this model, the V320, is even better then my last one. It fits the hand nicely, has side to side scrolling, and as much as I love my Wireless Bluetooth Mighty Mouse, this one is much better.

I especially like the on/off switch Logitec thoughtfully provided on the bottom. Conversely, on Microsoft's little mouse, it is necessary to remove the receiver from USB port, and then insert it into the bottom of the mouse - what a kludge - just to turn off the mouse. Also, the Logitec left-right mouse buttons are much smoother in both touch and action than the Microsoft equivalent. The Logitec mouse uses two AAA batteries. Overall operation is very smooth. Note: guys with big hands, like me, might find the right-mouse button a little on the light side - I sometimes accidentally click it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Product","review":"We loved the fact that the power button couldn't get accidentally hit draining the batteries when the USB device was plugged into the back of the mouse.

Easy to use, outstanding ergonomic design. Very long range, up to 10 mts and very high accurancy. The optical sensor works practically in any surface.

Just one con, the price is little high, but seems ok when compared it with the others more expensive brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"This mouse is just wanted I wanted as far as it does what it advertised to do. I like the ability to turn off the batteries when not in use, and when you put the USB connector in it's place on the back, it automatically shuts off the batteries.

It seemed to be fine for about the first week. After that, the timer started working intermittently, so that every once in a while, but with increasing frequency, what ever was in the thing would simply burn to a crisp. More recently, it started toasting unevenly, so that half the bread or bagel would be quite dark and the other half would look like it had never been in a toaster. I went out and bought a 4 slice Cuisinart toaster, which is what I should have done to begin with. It is considerably more money, but at least it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - Do not purchase","review":"This is a terrible product. The toaster does not toast evenly or consistently.

It does not brown evenly 1/2 dark the other 1/2 perfect brown, but we are not perfectionist. It does have a few perks that I do like. You can set it for bagel or toast. It browns hamburger rolls nicely. I like the \\"stop\\" button and that you can also lift up the toast higher so getting it out is much easier. If you are looking for a 4 slice toaster that is inexpensive and aren't fussy about even toasting, then you will like this. The perks to me out way uneven toasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"toaster review","review":"This toaster is made cheaply of lightweight plastic.

The downside is when toasted bagels. Every toaster I have had that had a bagel feature toasted only the sliced side which I thought every at home bagel eater would want. When I put my hamburger buns in it toasted both sides actually burning the outside of the bun. Like most people I wanted the sliced side toasted but wanted the outside untoasted.

The lever to drop the toast does not latch easily. If the temperature gauge is set above 2 (out of 6), the bread burns. The \\"bagel\\" button does nothing.

By the time users experience the long term durability of a product, it is out of production. Hopefully, potential users can glean information on brand quality and the quality of lower-end products by specific brands if long-term reviews are available. In the case of the Samsung 225BW, the monitor failed 46 months after it was purchased -- less than four years. From the dim flicker and rapid extinguishment of the picture, it appears that the lamp has failed. In general, I have not been happy with low end monitors by Samsung or Dell. My suggestion is to avoid such products because there is no way to evaluate what will fail prematurely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung 225BW Black 22\\" Widescreen LCD Monitor","review":"This is a great monitor.

I returned this monitor and purchased the 24\\" Dell, and I noticed a huge difference in build/picture quality immediately.

Unfortunately as many people have written; this system is unnervingly loud!

The volume is completely off at \\"0\\" and is loud at \\"1\\", very loud at \\"2\\", and continues up until it is ridiculously loud. I tried fiddling with all of the settings, but I could not reduce the volume to a moderate or soft level.

So loud actually, that we can't even use the system because it is TOO LOUD. We might eventually be able to adjust the input volume level but we will need an instruction manual to do it.

I like \\"Kill/Ride Medley\\" a lot because it combines six great songs into one. And it is live, and, of course, Metallica is the best band when it comes to live music. I do not recommend it so much for \\"Hero of the Day\\", since you could get that one on \\"Load\\". But if you collect singles, like I do, then you should get this single even if you do have \\"Load\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song plus bonus song","review":"Only a two song CD single but I actually enjoy the Hero of the Day song, plus you get the bonus song The Kill Ride Melody a mixture of songs put together during the tours.

Of course, there is that group that doesn't like their newer stuff. They might not like this, as IT'S THEIR NEWER STUFF... Now, while I say this is great, I don't listen to it that much at all because I don't like to put a single in my CD case, plus I like to put a CD in and listen for a while, not just a couple songs. Of course, I did buy it knowing that it was a single, so I can't complain about that (wait...I just did). If you're a Metallica fan, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont be an idiot!","review":"i love metallica. but look at the facts here. ...

The more they played for the radio and not for their longtime fans, the more of the original Metallica was lost. They used to be a great band, this is not one of their best ep's by any stretch of the imagination. If you liked the first 4 albums, don't bother with this. If you like their recent stuff have at it. They've slowed down in their old age and this was the omen of things to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive, too little, look elsewhere","review":"This expensive ($23) Japanese import is a big disappointment. First, there are only 7 tracks, less than 30 minutes of music. Second, the CD is labled \\"Live\\", but only three of the seven tracks are actually live. The music is good, but the CD feels like it's unfinished, like part of it wasn't included, like it's actually a bootleg album. From the title, I thought it was a concert recording, but it's just a random collection of live or radio or studio off-cuts. The music is good, but for 23 bucks I feel cheated. I recommend you spend your money on other Corrs albums first. Their music is very worthwhile, but this CD is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Not Enough Content for Your Money","review":"The music on this cd is good. \\"Rainy Day\\" is a fun musical rarity and the other songs are all very well performed but with only 7 songs on the cd I think it's a complete rip off--the songs are good, but not THAT good. For $$ you'd expect to get at least a full concert of live songs but this feels like an extended cd single. I mean I know imports cost more but this simply doesn't have enough music on it to be considered a full length cd. Furthermore, it's called \\"The Corrs Live\\" yet some of the songs aren't even live.This purely seems like a mercenary venture. Andrea and Caroline Corr were listed as two of the richest women 30 years old and under in Ireland--now I know why. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantastic","review":"The fact that only three of the tracks on this album are live is a slight let down, given the name of the album.

The DVD has a warning as to the type of DVD player you need to play this on, and I have the correct type, but could find no kickboxing. The other reason I bought this was to get nutrition tips and recipes. There were three recipes (one breakfast, one lunch, on dinner). I feel the advertising for this was way over-stated. Also, I did not like that this information was in PDF format. There was an article on the DVD, but again it was in PDF format, and was not very interesting or helpful. The exercise tips were pictures, not a \\"workout\\". The point of this DVD was to get you to the website to purchase other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was defective","review":"I'm sure this would have been a good work out DVD however it was defective (perhaps that is why it was only 8.97?) The strange thing was it was packaged as new. I ended up throwing it out, skipped all the way through, even though I cleaned the DVD thoroughly. When I looked at the DVD there was streak all the way through it.

Yet another hastily put together piece of junk by Jillian Michael. These videos are starting look as if she does no prep work at all. I watched the video once and immediately was not impressed with her attempt bring yet another Big loser boot camp style degrading workout to the mainstream population.

Still a great workout and gets your heart rate up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick [...] Workout!","review":"I've had the 'Shape Up Complete Front and Back' DVD's for a few weeks now, and i find them amazing! I'm pretty new to exercising, and especially new to Workout DVDs, but i find these a great way of doing some weights in addition to my cardio workout.To the beginners out there who might be unsure about purchasing these DVD's, they are hard, they will kick your butt and they will push you, but if you want a DVD that will really challenge you and get you to sweat i would recommend it.I only gave this 4 stars because you do need some additional equiptment (an aerobic step and hand weights), the workouts are only 30 minutes long (but you do get a good sweat going) and i personally don't really like the people doing the workouts along side Jillian, but i think everything else is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Booty busting workout!","review":"I set out searching for a REAL booty kicking workout. I found it. Sweat was pouring off of me in the first minute and my muscles were trembling when it was time to cool down. This is an amazing workout, but not really for those who are just beginning an exercie regimen. Someone new to physical activity might become discouraged because it is so intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I am just getting back into the workout scene and wanted to something I could do at home. These DVDs are each 30 minutes and kick your butt all the way to the end. You can do them at your own pace and build up the stamina to go at Jillian's level so they haven't gotten boring yet. I would highly recommend this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have been working out to Jillian for a while now and I love this complete set of 5 workouts. I can change it up each week and I always get an awesome workout each time. I would suggest reviewing these before working out to them, just so you know what to expect. This isn't for someone just starting out, but the more advanced. Love these and highly suggest to anyone that wants to tone up, melt fat, and wanting variety with their weekly workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT for beginners","review":"I am in fair shape, and not beginner myself, but this workout was WAY over the top. I'm not sure how her \\"warm up\\" fits any definition of the term. The point of a warm up is to get you moving, start working your heart rate up, and warm up your muscles to avoid injury. This woman has you jumping up and down on a step almost from the start. Plus, as another reviewer mentioned, she spends almost no time emphasizing proper form. This is the kind of workout that sets a beginner up for disappointment, frustration, and potential injury.Unless you are already in peak shape and looking for something to push you to your limit, I would avoid this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD quality BAD","review":"I love Jillian, but I think the distribution company was in such a hurry to release this DVD that they didn't QC them well. I'm sure the work out is great, but I haven't had the chance to do it becuase as soon as the beginning warm up is over the DVD pauses and it brings me back to the main menu. It would be fine if the work out was separated in the main menu by chapters but it is not. If I fast forward past the problem spot that seems to work but who would want to do that each time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"cardio kick box DVD","review":"i did the cardio kickbox one, it was a real full on work out, fairly low impact, but man do you work up a sweat!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too short","review":"With the hype about her TV show, I thought I'll give this one a try. I like kickboxing, but I should have known better, because I didn't like her weight workouts either when I tried them some time ago. It appears she gears toward overweight individuals that are out of shape, but there are many advanced exercisers out there that want good, fun, challenging and LONGER workouts because after a while exercise becomes addictive and no pep talk is needed. This one does get your heart rate up somewhat, but it's over before I feel that I got a real workout. I think it's only about 20 minutes at the most. The rest on this DVD are testimonials, recipes, advice, etc. I just don't think it's worth the time and money when there are so much better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic Kickboxing","review":"I'm not saying this is a bad DVD. However, it is VERY basic cardio kickboxing and its very short in duration. I understand now why it was cheap. I wouldn't purchase this again as a single DVD. I might purchase the set, but not too sure about that either.Anyway, this workout involves a simple warm-up, very basic moves, and then a cool-down. Again, I'm not saying the technique was bad. I'm just saying this was the type of video best used by a newby to the world of cardio kicboxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"I like hard workouts where I am deep in sweat, and all 5 DVDs provide this for me.

The instruction is virtually non-existent and her camera presence will not get her an award. The workout is very short and although I'm not a conditioned kickboxer, I didn't find it to much of a challenge. Her \\"giggles\\" are really a distraction and the \\"I can make you work harder if I want to\\" attitude is boring. Don't waste your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels Cardio Kickbox","review":"This workout is so awesome, it's a shame that it's hard to find it!

I love love love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too much warm-up","review":"I really like this collection. These workouts really kick your [back]! The only thing I don't like is there isn't much of a warm-up, you can always do your own. It is quick and effective! She is a little annoying, but it does make you work harder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"When someone buys this DVD set, it usually means they are weak and overweight. I was physically unable to do half of these exercises, not because I was lazy or unmotivated, but because of my body limitations. For instance, I had to do a plank exercise that made me raise my knee into my chest in a push up position. Well, if you have excessive fat on your abdomen, this moovement is physically impossible to do. I am unable to use this DVD to get fit. I do not recommend it for those who are obese."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good......","review":"ALL of her other DVDs are much better!

What I really like is that they are fairly short (total of about 30 minutes each) and they don't require a lot of equipment (bench, either weight or step--preferably step, and light weights). It doesn't seem like you'd be able to get much out of a 30 minutes, light weight workout, but once you try it you'll believe it. I anticipate using these workouts a lot, especially when I don't have a lot of time. I don't care for some of the silliness, but if that can be overlooked, I'd highly recommend these workouts. And the price of $29.99 can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like elementary school gym class","review":"So boring. Kick to the front, kick to the back, do some jumping jacks. Reminds of elementary school the way this is done. No combination moves that you see in kickboxing- jab, knee, front kick, etc. If this was an unknown, it would not have made it into the marketplace. Avoid this only if you want something super easy. I'm glad I got it cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review","review":"The tape set I am sure would be great if I could get a set that had both dvd's that worked.

THE WARM UP ARE AS HARD AS THE REST OF THE ROUTINE AND YOU ALSO NEED A STEP TO DO A LOT OF THE ROUTINE. I LEARN THAT WHEN I SAW THE FIRST VIDEO AND NO, I DON'T HAVE A STEP. I COMES WITH 5 DIFFERENT ROUTINES SO IT IS GOOD FOR THE MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I hardly broke a sweat with this DVD! Michaels doesn't count or keep in beat with music, or even keep you moving the whole time. And she's too busy laughing and flirting with her crew to even keep you interested. She is definitely not good at leading a cardio workout whatsoever! Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus JILLIAN!","review":"As always Jillian knows how to rev it up from the start. My only complaint is she tends to joke then pause to laugh, yell at her buddies, then laugh, etc...way too much for my liking. I tried to ignore it but by the time I got to DVD 3 it was annoying the heck out of me. I'm very close to getting these dvds edited to cut out her constant goofing. I rather get an instructor that is focused on the most important person, me, the consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Workout","review":"I worked out for 2 weeks with Jillian's 30 Day Shread and needed a change. I am a working mom who is also studying for the CPA exam so I only have a limited time to squeeze in a workout each day. This video was so much fun but also hard work. I really got a great workout.

And she kept saying how hard this work out was and by the end of it even one of the girls doing the work out with her on the DVD was like \\"That's it?!\\". If you are just getting into kickboxing this would be a great video for you if you have been doing it for a while- go for something a little more challenging.

I was up to 135 pounds. I have been working out for the last 6 months straight and I am down to 117 pounds. I feel like running and doing kickboxing has made me lose the weight, but not tone up. I got these videos hoping to get some definition. Well...these video's rock. I have noticed a difference in only a week and a half. These video's are definitely not for out of shape overweight people. I struggle to get through them, but when you do...you feel so good about yourself! She is tough. She does constantly laugh in the video's which is kind of unprofessional and annoying but other than that..these are great videos that really push you to the edge. Once again...do NOT buy these videos if you are overweight, just beginning,have previous injuries, or are too old to jump up and down a lot and really push yourself. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This video kicks butt","review":"I was a little hesitant to purchase since each DVD is only 30 minutes but it is the most intense 30 minutes of workout that I have ever done.

I love these DVDs, efficient and very effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to sweat!","review":"These DVDs are great. They are challenging and fast moving so you don't get bored. I've been doing them for almost 4 weeks and I am definitely seeing results. I like Jillian's no-nonsense attitude. My only wish was that they were a little longer. The actual workout time ranges from 22-26 minutes. But during that time it is intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!! What a workout!!","review":"This workout is amazing.

Unacceptable for a professional instructor/trainer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Winner = A Loser","review":"I have many exercise tapes, but because I like Jillian Michaels I bought this set. The exercises are not organized so you end up wasting time. I don't enjoy her continual laughing and forcing her exercise team to try harder. I had hoped that since these were new tapes they wouldn't include jumping jacks and other older exercises. Since I was new I was following the easier person and sometimes she wasn't even visible until the entire exercise was OVER. Not well thought out. She spends more time talking and walking around with little explanation on how to do the exercises CORRECTLY. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Winner is a disappointment.","review":"I bought the DVD's since Jillian seems to be so motivating on television and her workouts on tv seem to really work.

There wasn't a smooth transition from one move to another. Not very impressed. I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she high???","review":"This was my first (and last) purchase of a Jillian Michaels workout. I was very disappointed, and found many of the moves to be ineffective because of the pace at which you have to do them. For example, doing bicept curls while simultaneously doing jumping jacks just doesn't allow for an effective pace. It felt like I had to rush through the moves just to keep up (and, no, I'm not unfit). I found this to be a problem for a lot of her exercises. Beyond that, I just found her annoying... the way she asks, \\"Are you DYING yet???\\" And she repeatedly laughs for absolutely no reason. I seriously think she smoked something before filming. What a waste of money (luckily I bought this at Ross for dirt-cheap!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have had better","review":"a whole lot of hype without substance behind it.

Jill's got a bit more work to do in this dvd & so do we if we want results from a real cardio workout....dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"First of all, 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks. Second of all, I missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain. Also, regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises, it is still moderately difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too much giggling","review":"This DVD is ok but I wish I had the chance to figure out what the next workout move will be before we go into it. A lot of times she'll call out the next move, and I'll have no idea what she's talking about until she's actually doing it. Also, she does a whole lot a giggling..It's kinda annoying...but maybe that's me. Still it's a good DVD workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Deep Breath...","review":"So first off, I absolutely could careless to write reviews - but I had to chime in on this one. I binge-bought about ten workout DVD's a few months ago, and could say I wasted my money or got a great deal. I probably use two of the DVD's, one being this one I use almost everyday. If I go to a gym I can be on an elliptical for two hours and not break a sweat. In this DVD, I am sweating profusely after ten minutes. It is fabulous because you are getting such a powerful workout within a period of thirty minutes (I lead a busy life and cannot hit the gym for two hours every other day). Beware though that it is very tough, there are no rest periods, and have a bottle of water (or two) ready to go. This is what you should be spending your money on folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout video- I saw results!","review":"This workout DVD gave me results. I really love Jillian's 30 minute shred and saw results so I ordered this set to mix up my workout. This one is a little tougher for beginners. I am in pretty good shape and have worked out my whole life. I recently went back to work full time so this DVD fit into my new workout schedule. I don't have the time to visit the gym for the 1 hr. workout classes so I break this into 2 days- about 30 minutes per day to keep me in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging overall workout !","review":"I realize Sharon Mann and Amy Dixon's workouts would get your heart pumping but Jillian Michaels' really pushes your limits. This set is about 25 minutes each for each DVD and very effective in generating results for 25 minutes daily. You have to stick to it daily and not cheat your way through - I feel great doing these workouts and am looking foward to a more toned upper body though I've been seeing results in 3 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing !!!!! (Kickbox cardio)","review":"I'm intermediate when it comes to working out. I love kick boxing and this video was a joke. First of all Jillian seemed like she was on dope, giggling away for no apparent reason. If you are Jillian Micheals fan then I would suggest sticking to 30 day shred. That is a great workout dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get any kicks out of this workout","review":"I wouldn't call this workout \\"kickbox.\\" It's more of a bootcamp class with some kickbox stuff thrown in. It's pretty boring and the music is lousy. The instructor is a bit full of herself and she doesn't give any sort of safety or form advice. If you want a great workout with a great instructor try Silk Manning. I wish he made more than one video. Plus Kathy Smith's videos are always great."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY VERY GOOD EXERCISE","review":"This package of dvds has exelent exercises, I lost 8 pounds in 2 weeks. Of course I'm doing the exercise 4 to 5 days a week and eating with less carbs.At the same time, I am doing the 30 day sherd by jillian Michels that is also an execelent dvd.I recommend it 100% if you are willing to loose weigth and change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Amazing Workouts!!","review":"I really don't have a lot of time to write out a long review, but these workouts are hard as hell!! Keep in mind that each one doesn't go past 30 minutes, but you do get a heart pounding workout and you feel it the next day!! That sore muscle feeling is the best! These workouts are great for me since i have a 1 and 1/2 year old and can get away for short time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cardio dvd isn't that challenging! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lesliev","review":"This is a good workout, Its challenging. One day do the front and the next do the back. It has a beginners also but the camera does not stay focus on everyone so sometimes you have to guess what the beginner person is doing. Jillian herself does not workout but walk around the others to explain the workout. i would like to see her last through the workout. Other than that its a really good work out. For those who are looking for a tough challenging workout. There is no resting in between so you have to move quick and have everything ready. and I ercommend lots of workout space for a step platform and a mat beside it. you also need hand weights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I bought this because I really like the idea of boxed sets. I read the reviews regarding the instructor's presentation, and thought I could handle it - but I can't! She is sooo annoying and for that reason alone I often opt to choose a different DVD. Surely she doesn't talk like that in real life! The workouts are okay if you like jumping jacks, no warmup and moving quickly while holding weights. All in all, I really wish I had spent my money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent, but nothing special","review":"This is pretty much the very standard Cardio kick workout. Anybody that has ever seen it done, could invent this workout on their own. The girl that is running is cute, but she brings nothing new or interesting to the workout. Also, the editing style of the video often causes the visuals to get out of sync with her count, so that if you're just watching trying to follow along, you get messed up.Don't let the name brand suck you in.. there has to be a better video out there somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Already lost over 40 pounds!","review":"This DVD set is terrific! I started using it in January and am still doing it 5 days a week. I've lost over 40 pounds using these videos. One word of caution, the exercises are not low impact. There is a lot of jumping, lunging and sqatting involved.Each video is approximately 30 minutes. You WILL sweat the whole 30 minutes. Hand weights and an exercise step are needed for all except Cardio Kickbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I should have looked ar the review a little closer. This only has one work out and the rest is Jullian talking. The work out is good but not that hard. She acts like it is the hardest work out ever. I have almost all of her video's, and lover her.. This was just a let down for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dvd for home workouts.","review":"Jillian Michaels is known for her tough training--this dvd doesn't show that side of her very much. It is an excellent workout, easy to follow, good cueing. Jillian spends time showing the proper form, but almost too much so. Still, a good home workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off!","review":"Each DVD has one 25 min. workout. Note that nowhere on the packaging or even of the info her at Amazon tells you the DVD length. Good hard cardio, but I felt nothing from the added weights - maybe if I used weights heavier than she says to. There is not bonus meal plan or recipes, unless you consider ONE breakfast, ONE lunch, and ONE dinner recipe a plan. The 6 week bikini workout bonus is a copy of an article she did for a fitness mag. and you have to read it off a computer.I can't believe someone of her reputation would do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardio?","review":"I have the Cardio kickbox dvd and was very disappointed. The pace of the workout seems very awkward, the instructor doesn't really know what is coming next, and most of all in between each different exercise, she just stops rather than keeping moving during the full amount of time. I did like the different kickboxing moves she used, but they were in such short repetitions- I barely felt that I had been working on it before it was onto the next one, I think I'll just write down the different exercises and do them to my own music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt kicking workout!","review":"I am so impressed with these work out videos, Jillian knows what she is doing! To do the workouts you do need some lightweight dumbells and a little bench step thing, which I didn't know until I started doing the workouts. And probably a sweat headband because your heartrate is up the entire time, the quality of the workouts are definately worth the price of the dvds. Jillian has a team of people in the videos, and one person does a beginners version to the exercises which is still pretty intense, and I am in pretty decent shape so word of caution it is a nonstop workout so yeah...I'll definately buy more of her dvds in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite for when I Skip the Gym","review":"For those days you want to break a sweat, but are limited on time, or just don't feel like driving to the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I really have enjoyed all of the videos in this DVD set. The workouts are challenging. I consider myself to be in pretty good shape as I workout every day - most days twice a day. I was looking to change up my cardio workouts and this is a good way. She incorporates light lifting along with cardio for a nice workout. The only thing I would wish for is a longer workout - these are only about 25 minutes each. Overall - I really like getting up in the morning and workout out with Jillian!"},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to follow but not super hard","review":"I was expecting this to be more difficult as I have taken cardio kickboxing classes here and there over the years. It's easy to follow and will be challenging for beginner exercisers but not a killer workout for those in decent shape. The other Biggest Loser Cardiomax tape is MUCH more intense."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Dont buy this product. The one I got lasted for 3 weeks before I started getting I/O errors. In my opinion the thing runs way, way hot and thats why the disk failed. Case in point: after working on a MS word doc with autosave set to 5 min intervals for several hours the unit was almost too hot to touch.4GB may sound great too but formatted as NTFS I only got 3.78 GB of space on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA after less than six months of use","review":"I work in the IT industry and am familiar with the use of and handling of PC hardware and accessories. The 4GB Gigabank was my first experience with mini hard drives, prior to the Gigabank I used flash RAM devices.Pros: Came with a nice little sturdy ballistic nylon keychain case and backup software. The USB plug is adjustable and rotatable for hard to reach USB ports.Cons: Would get extremely hot after sustained hard drive access. Inoperable after only 5.5 months of use!!I am glad that I did not store any vital data on my Gigabank. I took very good care of my Gigabank drive, even went as far as disconnecting it from my system when I did not need it to avoid overheating. One day it worked fine the following week it was dead, used three different PCs and none could \\"see\\" the Gigabank anymore. I had no warning, no errors, no odd behavior leading up to the day it gave up the ghost. From now on it's strictly flash RAM devices for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't risk it!","review":"I must concur with the majority of comments here. It's a cute little number with a nifty little carrying case... but that's all I can say for it. This product died on me after exactly one year and 13 days of ownership (of note: the warranty expires at the one year mark... hmmm... curious, no?). The first warning that something wasn't right about the Gigabank was it's alarming tendency to overheat during use - sometimes to the point of actual discomfort if you touched it. Within six months, the product was spontaneously disconnecting itself from my system on a regular basis, culminating in absolutely zero disk activity and failure to be recognized by my system at all a couple days ago. Do not... and I repeat... do not fail to *regularly* backup the contents of this drive if you do foolhardedly buy one. Me, I'm going back to a smaller, but reliable flash disk instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this product","review":"It only lasts for one day,I can't believe how fast it dies. The first time I used it, it got very hot and for some reason it caused my machine to run very slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!","review":"DIED AFTER 1 DAY AND USED XP TO SAFELY REMOVE USB DRIVES AND GOT HOT AND WHEN I TRIED TO USE AGAIN NOT RECOGNIZED....THIS SUCKS DONT BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interesting Mess","review":"According to the NY Times Dunne died when this book was in galleys. I find this hard to believe, as the book is a sprawl of undigested plot devices, confusing narrative POVS, three or four characters all with similar sensibilities making it hard to tell them apart. I'm sure John, had he lived, would have tightened the book before it got to galleys.But even for its problems it's a J.G. Dunne book, and a pleasure. No novelist knows his way around a courtroom better. The story of the racially charged murder on the prairie is very good (though the book's extraneity makes you wait a long time for the good parts). Recommend with serious reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Lost except the time to read this book","review":"I really thought the author had a terrific idea in writing a send up of our modern world plotted around a sensational killing. All the elements were there, the media, hollywood, gays, etc. However, he missed the opportunity to paint the characters and the plot in broad satirical brush strokes. Often you could almost take these characters seriously. The dialogue, which is probably typical for Dunne, is too clever by half. This book certainly did not make me want to read any more of his writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect size, weight and price","review":"I have had this pan for almost a year and use it almost daily. I bought it because it was the only mid-size \\"saute\\" type non-stick frying pan that came with a lid. I have also enjoyed the lighter weight and stay cool handle. I have learned from experience that no matter how careful you are with non-stick pans, over time, the coating deteriorates. So I feel much better about having paid a third the cost of a high-end non-stick fry pan and won't feel guilty when it's time to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and obvious","review":"Characters were cliched, jokes were dumb and obvious. Plot line was non-existent.

There are a couple of mistakes and whatnot and confusing areas (due to lazy translation) but overall it's a beautifully written story (mainly contains everything in the Manga of the same title) and the images are gorgeous.It's a light BL Novel atm, doubt it'll reach a Yaoi Label. And goes for 4 volumes.But this is a deffient buy for anyone who is looking for a Novel to add to their Yaoi/BL collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is not recommended","review":"The narration of this version is over-acted, lacking the quiet contemplative atmosphere fitting a text of this magnatude and importance. The speaker seems to be more of a \\"new-ager\\" type than a spiritual seeker. The narration tends to distract from the message of the text. The translation is a bit over the top as well, being done in an old time King James-ish style with lots of thy's and and thou's thrown in to perhaps make it seem more legitimate to western ears for the time that it was translated (1940's or 50's?).

It's truer to the message of this holy book"},{"rating":"2","title":"MS98002T","review":"Great gasket set that comes with everything you need. Price was great and quality is pretty good. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because they are not quite as good as GM gasket sets but they also are not far behind.

If you are interested in antique boxes recommend Debby DuBay's third book: Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain: Boxes to Vases"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK ON ANTIQUE LIMOGES BOXES!","review":"If you want info on antique Limoges boxes-highly recommend this book. I love the fact the author colaborated with several antique shops where I have purchased several antique Limoges boxes. Highly recommend Limoges Antiques Shop in Andover, MA for wonderful antique boxes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book on Limoges boxes is great specifically if you are interested in ANITQUE LIMOGES boxes!! Great reference book - I have found several dealers of antique Limoges boxes! (I recommend Limoges Antiques Shop, MA) Great collaborative effort with other dealers and authors; rare in the publishing world - but helpful to collectors!

Enhanced with a Value Guide and a Manufacturers' Marks Identification Guide, Limoges Boxes is an essential, core reference for the serious as well as the casual collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment. Save Your Money.","review":"This is a very silly book, with really no insights into the quality of decoration or how one should really go about selecting Limoges boxes. The photographs are just awful--many are out of focus and the author chose, for the most part, boxes of very poor decorating quality. The text for each box is just descriptive; in other words, the author just describes what you can see in the photos. There are no company names and measurements. The text is written at a level to appeal to young children. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I have most of the Limoges books available and was anxiously awaiting this one. I am so disappointed in the quality of this book. The pictures are terrible, many completely out of focus, and there is little information about the boxes that are pictured. My recommendation is to buy the Waterbrook-Clyde book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"As a theology minor during university, I was assigned to teach this text for a women in northern american religion class. It so moved me, that not only did I go on to study Judaism, both on my own and with a rabbi, I also converted. Truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A milestone in women's Torah study.......","review":"One woman's journey into Torah study as vehicle for touring the world of modern Torah study in the late 20th Century. Vanessa Ochs tells of her quest to discover on a very personal level if women have a place in Torah study. Nearly 20 years later, many of these issues seem dated. But Ochs' story is so intimate and so well told that I doubt one can read this book without coming away with a burning desire to study Torah for one's self. On another level this book is a treat simple for the people Ochs encounters in her journey. The book is worth reading for her portrait of Aviva Zornberg alone. Also featured are: Pardes Institute, Nehama Leibowitz, Matan, Malke Bina, Batya Miller, Chana Safrai, Judith Lieberman Institute. This book is a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Find this lady a producer","review":"There is no doubting the talent Jane Monheit possesses. She has a very lovely voice, and is surrounded by great musicians. I take away one star for some gaffes in conceptualization and production, such as the emphasis placed on novelties and musical trifles such as \\"Squeeze Me\\" and \\"Tea for Two\\". Another example of producer stupidity can be found in the glacial tempo of \\"Haunted Heart\\", which I suppose is intended to convey gravity, but which only manifests lethargy. For an example of a slow tempo song produced with finesse, one need only hear \\"Love Letters\\" from the latest Diana Krall release. In short, what Jane the Singer needs, Jane has. What Jane the Professional Entertainer needs is competent management, and that will probably only follow her defection to a major label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing sounds","review":"I got this CD (In the Sun) along with \\"The Very Best of Jane Monheit\\". It is a very nice CD, good for long drives in the car.She has a nice mellow delivery that is very easy to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misstep","review":"Unfortunately, not the breakthrough one might have expected after the moving and well-balanced \\"Come Dream With Me\\".

She's way overrated and belongs on broadway, not a jazz recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty and Eratic","review":"Many will say this is the bold and daring effort of a jazz singer coming into her own. Standard critic speak for a spotty effort that is a great disappointment. The song choices are all over the board, there is no sense of cohesiveness, and please, please leave Linda Ronstadt songs for Linda, you just don't have the chops for her tunes.Don't buy this one, wait until she matures and realizes her true strengths; and has the artistic wisdom to return to that which she does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"sorry but this one is no winner...Jane needs a lot more time to become a vocalist i can take seriously"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, but BORING album","review":"I enjoyed most of the songs from her first two albums.

After a promising start with her debut CD a few years ago it seemed like Jane Monheit had a promising jazz career. This CD is horrible and certainly makes one wonder what she and her manager were thinking about when she recorded this. There is little to nothing redemable about this recording. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be Krall..Not Jazz here....","review":"Ms Monheits previous recordings showed true potential. Unfortunately this disc follows in the too familiar (and boring) footsteps of Krall and others trying to cross over into mainstream pop. Not really a Jazz vocal CD more easy listening and at that is succeeds. Little to no passion or depth here.Ncoded continue to offer well recoreded discs though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again","review":"I used to be very excited about this new talent. She has a voice that never misses a note, a rarity now. I saw her perform in Boston in a small jazz club, and even spoke to her briefly after the show. Unfortunately, just her vocal chords have grown up. Her performances show her age, maybe even younger. I think she has a beautiful voice, but still lacks a certain maturity, espcially with bossanova cuts. Her heart is not there, only her voice, and in jazz, the two go hand in hand.The CD is nice enough, thanks to the incredible musicianship behind her.And a note to the first reviewer who mentioned her selling out at Tanglewood. I happened to be at that concert, and she was actually an opening act for the John Pizzarelli Trio. While her name does have a draw, more and more, she was not the reason the place of packed. I hope she gained some lessons from the completely adult and professional act that followed her. Give her 5-10 years and she will be dynamite."},{"rating":"1","title":"She makes Diana Krall sound soulful","review":"Having heard much about this young singer, I was looking forward to hearing this CD....maybe I shouldn't have started with this one, but after doing so, I've lost the urge to go back to any of her previous albums.The song selections are eclectic, and a singer with more depth and originality might be able to pull it off. Sorry, Ms Monheit can't. She sounds more like a Broadway bitpart singer than a recording artist, oversinging what little role she's got, and completely tiring out the listener.There are a few exceptions here and there...Tea For Two is a nice treatment, but hope is raised only to be crushed at the next instant, in this case by the worst version I've heard of Love Has No Pride. (BTW, Bonnie Raitt, NOT Linda Ronstadt, did the definitive version.)I think the production by Joel Dorn is competent and the musicians are fine. It is actually quite a good album if you listen past the vocals, which makes it kind of pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNFORTUNATE","review":"There are so many other jazz singers that surpass Ms Monheit not so much in vocal ability but more in feel for the songs and the music. She just leaves me feeling so very cold. I got this one on the second hand option with amazon so glad I did I would have been dissapointeed even more if I had paid full price.Her high pitch tone on this cd is hard on the ear, also the slang lazy sounding diction that she uses gets very annoying, maybe she is trying to sound cool im not sure. If u like the songs on this cd search them out by by better vocal interpreters..If I had ms Monheits address I think Id be happy to pay the postage and send this one back to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sweet voice but no soul","review":"Good sweet voice, but no substance.Actually I think Ms Monheitmight be a better country western singer then a jazz singer.This CD left me cold.

The orchestration, far from being like Mantovani, as some poor reviewer suggested, is sensitive and sympathetic to the vocals. How brave of JM to tackle this song - more like it please - we really don't need any more MOR versions of standards. Great album, however the jazz-heads moan about it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice!","review":"Simply the most beautiful jazz/pop voice on the planet today!

Jane is at the top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't get enough of this one. . .","review":"I have all of Jane Monheit's CD's, love them all, and find this one to be spectacular. I disagree with the other reviewers about her choice of songs; I wouldn't change a thing about this CD. Sounds fabulous in the car. I have a hard time listening to any other female vocalist after hearing Monheit; she's more interesting, more talented, and can make any line of any song uniquely her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset, but here's an important tip...","review":"This is a great headset in terms of comfort, sound quality and value for the price. I definitely recommend it.Here's an important tip: I kept experiencing trouble with people telling me I was very faint, sometimes much more so than others. I was just about to return it as defective when I decided to play with it some more. I ended up adjusting both the headband as well as the mic itself to get it so close to my mouth that it was almost touching. That resolved the problem. It's just highly directional and requires close proximity to the sound source -- which is actually a good thing in terms of suppressing background noise. So just make sure you have the mic adjusted close to your mouth, bending it into much more of an arc than the way it comes out of the box, and you should be all set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound","review":"I wanted a wired headset for my cellphone.

The more time you take to study the details, the more amazing it becomes. It is especially interesting to those who have worked with wood and know the possible, and impossible ways he has created the joinery. It is more a book for adults than for children, though they can understand the simple alphabet and the picture for each letter.

These pictures are gorgeous and mysterious, with their Escher-like perspective tricks.

I have to say I do wish that \\"G\\" were not for \\"gun\\" (an old-fashioned shotgun, looks like something out of Jane Austen), but the beauty and engrossing depth of the pictures makes up for it.

The questions are asked in such a way as to reflect many different thinking levels (basic knowledge, application and interpreting). The extensive use of sample test items help students evaluate and show their comprehension. Mr. McGuire's several editions of this book provide excellent insights into New York's challenging and stimulating Regents Earth Science program.

This book accomodates this style of learning/studying, which is necessary for academic achievment in Earth Science. Buy this book before the other regents reviews out there. You wont regret it.

At any distance greater than 3 or 4 feet between the camera and receiver, the image becomes so unstable as to be barely discernible. Marked by white interference lines, static and jumpiness, the image quality of the installed system was not acceptable for my application in my environment.I did try unplugging all of my cordless phones as well as my wireless router and all wireless PCs but there was no effect on the signal quality.Obviously this unit works well for some people in their environment if the reviews are to be believed.

As a first try I set up everything in my living room, with the camera on the fireplace mantel and the receiver box on my TV stand and connected to the TV. The setup was extremely easy, but right away I got intense white stripes rolling continuously across the screen. The camera was 7 ft away from the receiver box with nothing in between, and all 3 channels had the same problem. Eventually I figured out that the receiver box needed to be closer than 1 ft from the camera for the stripes to go away! This is insane! My guess is that it was caused by inteference from wireless networks around my apartment, even though I myself don't have wireless, and turning my cell phone off did not make any difference.

The shackle is thick enough that most bolt cutters won't get through it (limit to their effectiveness is about 10mm) without muscles-McGhee on the operator side. To cut it, you'd need a saber saw and a few good diamond tipped blades.If you need a lock to hold up against physical punishment, I'd suggest one of these.

I found this book witty, informative and would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about astrology. Although it's worthwhile for the student astrologer (like me) who needs real examples to understand the subject, it's also a great read for non-astrols because the author has researched the lives of many popular entertainers and gives dates of important life events. What he's done is to add astrological commentary so the astrology provides insight into the personalities of the famous. I loved the introduction, where he gives each planet's association with entertainment. It's obvious he's done his research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate","review":"Does what I need.

The bad language was not used for color or to underscore a point, but it was used so much it lost its punch in overkill. Besides this the book was way too bloody for my taste. I will never read Charlie Huston again. It is my fault actually.....I should have downloaded a sample of this book to my Kindle before paying for something I really hated reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cartoon of a book","review":"The level of violence in this book reminds me of Daffy Duck-Elmer Fudd cartoons, and the hero of this story (a child-man who can't get over high school disappointments) does a pretty good Daffy.I get the sense the book was written in a week or two, by a bunch of people drinking beer in front of a computer, laughing and asking each other, \\"So, what should we make happen next?\\" Think, Jack Kerouac goes hard-boiled, and you'll have this book . . . which is quite a complement if you liked On the Road.But I got bored by the whole single-sheet of paper challenge, and long before Caught Stealing was anywhere near resolved I gave up on the and-now-guess-what-happens approach.It could be my problem. I read too many student papers with the first-this-happened-then-this-happened-then-this-happened as the structure to read it in my leisure time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the General Public","review":"I thought this book had the most vile language than in any other book I have read. The author is certainly well versed in four letter words, at least one that begins with \\"F\\"The only saving grace was Bud, the cat, who brought civility to the main character, who also loved his parents.I was looking for an amusing escape similar to Hiason's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced, Gritty Thriller","review":"If you like Elmore Leonard or James Ellroy, chances are you'll Charlie Huston's debut effort.This is a great vacation book, where you can read a dozen pages or so, and the jump in the pool or head out for dinner if you are on the go a lot. Also good for the nightstand, though you may stay up later than you'd planned. It's gripping enough that you'll probably blaze through it in under 6 hours total.Huston doesn't take 100 pages to develop the characters. You dive right into the story and learn about the dark, oddball, quirky people who reside in the underbelly of society. Their actions tell us as much about them as a long monologue ever could.This book pays off instantly and never lets you go. If that isn't what you want in a crime thriller, I don't know what is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride","review":"Hank does a favor for a friend and ends up in the middle of a big mess. This book is like a snowball rolling downhill. It starts out small, and picks up momentum and weight as it goes. Hang on for the ride.

By turns funny and disturbing, and sometimes surprisingly touching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught Stealing my Attention","review":"There's potential in the writing, but the numbing, random spiral of violence and lack of character development and plot is exhausting; I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught Stealing - free download","review":"Caught Stealing by Charlie Huston. I downloaded this book free to my Kindle in hopes of finding more authors whose work I like. Unfortunately, this book falls far short. I certainly won't be reading the two others in the series, even at no cost.This book's language is foul and repetitive. Constantly F this and F that. I'm a corrections officer, and my inmates don't speak that badly. The plot is beyond far-fetched. The writing style is staccato, with some sentences consisting of only \\"I. I. I.\\" This book was a struggle to get through, and wasn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"No elaborate plot here.","review":"Although I did enjoy the witty and somewhat comical thought processes of Huston's Hank Thompson in the beginning, the language and violence were too over-the-top as the book progressed. Having the main character constantly getting the hell beat out of him and having his closest friends killed around him did not make for the thrilling plot I was seeking when I ordered the book. Huston's Hank Thompson went from likable, to pitiful, to pathetic ... In the end Hank turned into a mastermind avenger that wasn't \\"caught stealing.\\" Elaborate plots, twists and turns were replaced with unnecessary violence and language. I have definitely read much more thrilling thrillers. I didn't hate the book, but I doubt I will be reading any more of Charlie Huston."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Octane Crime Novel","review":"Very very impressive book. One of the blurbs on the backcover \\"reads like The Maltese Falcon on crack\\" is prettyaccurate. High octane book where a nice-guy bartender, Hank Thompson, through no fault of his own (or maybe because he mixes a bad cosmo) is first tortured and then on the run from a gang of ruthless thugs, including one of NY's finest, all in pursuit of the 4 1/2 million bucks. Lots of twists, lots ofinteresting little mannerisms such as when Hank is on the phone with the corrupt cop trying to work out a deal, and then you have the awkward moment at the end where Hank finds himself having to say \\"good-bye\\". The writing in this is near pitch-perfect, and what make this even more impressive is that it's Huston's first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No value even though book is given away","review":"I can usually get through any book and find something of value in it. Not this one. It was what many other reviewers have said - pointlessly violent and crude and stupidly plotted. For me though the surprise was how annoyed I became at the main character/author while reading this book. I had absolutely zero interest in things working out for the main character, and I just could not wait for it to be over. Why didn't I just stop reading? Given the number of books by this author which were free Kindle downloads, I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. I guess if you are in to the Quentin Tarantino blood-guts-violence with little or no plot, go for this book and author. As for me, I am glad this was a free download. I will surely not be spending money on this author in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty ugly stuff","review":"Actually, the F word doesn't bother me; the animal torture did. The main character is indeed a self-absorbed jerk. I am certain there are plenty of real-life killers out there that like cats, and call mom once in a while. A better yardstick might be to take a look at what has happened to Hank's \\"friends\\" by the time you turn the last page. The writing is pretentious and vicious. And boring; I ended up skimming the last 100 pages. However, there are clearly some people who like this \\"flawed\\" hero stuff, so more power to them. I tossed the next two Huston works in the trash unread. Back to SJ Rozan, Sean Doolittle and Michael Connelly for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got thru it...","review":"This is my first Houston novel and likely my last. I liked the start but the writing style wore on me as it continued. As others have mentioned the violence was a constant flow to the point that it was absurdly overdone. It was a story that was myopically focused with not surprises, twist to turns. It doesn't lead the reader into contemplation or thought. In that regard it was an easy read - too easy. I was looking for a new author but Houston is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Ride!","review":"This is a really fun romp through the seedier side of the NYPD and the russian mob! There is a great chase scene through the NY subway system. A great beach read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Crime Noir","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.

All books in the trilogy were unbelievable...plan on reading the Joe Pitt series next..."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick, enjoyable read","review":"Caught Stealing is a quick, easy to read, novel. The flawed main character gets tangled up with the criminal underworld and well... really just gets by on dumb luck.The violence has been laid on a little thick. The language, well, I didn't notice.Really, my only problem with the book was the seemingly split personality of every \\"bad\\" guy. It happened again and again that characters were portrayed as calm and/or friendly only to go off on tangents shortly afterwards. Without giving away too much, the last encounter at the bar really sticks with me - as if the author didn't know how to transition from the car to the final outcome. This chain of events just didn't make sense. I suppose you could argue that the characters weren't thinking logically, but for everyone to act this way was just unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King was right","review":"I read Stephen King's summer reading recommendation of Caught Stealing in the NY Times Book Review on 6/3/07, picked it up, and ... wow, he was right!!

Love the cat (he should have had a bigger role)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Very Long Car Chase","review":"There's this guy named Hank who a bunch of people are trying to kill or maim for no apparent reason. So, most of the book is a tale of how they keep closing in on him and he keeps eluding them. The temptation is to ditch the book because all this chasing and eluding is getting monotonous, but the author is so creative and the dialog and characterizations are so compelling that you keep reading. Just like you would stare at a car wreck. But toward the end, there is a tremendous payoff for having hung in there. The book goes somewhere. It's all worthwhile. So, I'm now gonna read the rest of Huston's books. There, wasn't that easy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me...","review":"This book just wasn't for me.

Very limited writing skills is a generous euphemism for someone who must fill page after page with the F word and whose action line is entirely predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I see one more Shakespeare reference...","review":"The good news is that this book contains a wealth of knowledge, and you'll definitely feel like you've learned a lot upon completing it. Harold Bloom is extremely knowledgeable and has to be one of the most well-read people alive (at least as far as the Western canon is concerned).The bad news is that this book is really tough to read. Bloom often goes off into little tangents (about G.W. Bush, the collapse of modern culture, his religion, etc.) that distract from his overall message. I also found it especially annoying that he seemingly can't go more than a page without mentioning Shakespeare (however irrelevant he may be to the topic at hand) or without using the word 'daemon'. Overall, I'm glad that I read this book, but mostly I'm just glad that I've finally finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought-provoking, passionate, brilliant","review":"your view on this book will track with your appetite for erudition, academia and intellectual challenge. the criticisms that this book is \\"ivory tower\\" & arrogant are right!Having said that, I enjoy the challenge, entertainment and new ideas Bloom always brings to the table. Some of his more esoteric trappings -- such as the Kabbalah-based framework for the book -- I simply ignore. But I think his love of the classics and belief in deep reading as a source of humanity are thought-provoking and much needed.if you love literature and are willing to work a little, this is great book to read slowly and savor."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The book is a compilation of the works of 100 great literary figures, ranging from Shakespeare to Dostoevsky, with many obscure figures in between such as Hugo Von Hofmannstahl. Each chapter is devoted to one person containg brief excerpts from his or her work together with Mr. Bloom's comments purporting to show why that person is a \\"genius.\\" Mr. Bloom's comments are random, pointless, and, in at least one case, internally contradictory. Nor does he ever clearly define the word \\"genius\\". Mr. Bloom's comments appear to be primarily designed to demonstrate his intimate knowledge (usually since childhood) of the literary figure's works. The purpose of the book, however, is clear, to show that no matter how big a genius these literary figures may be, the biggest genius of all is Harold Bloom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown style","review":"The concept of the \\"genius\\" continues to resonate in the popular imagination. Bloom is now a one-man industry, sort of the Stephen Ambrose of literature, and this book is likely to sell well. I don't find his insights into individual authors very insightful, or his Kabbalistic categories helpful. His choice of authors is also fairly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pound is missing...","review":"Where is Ezra Pound and also T.S.Eliot?How can he put Cames and forget Pound?Pound is one of the most significant poets ever and this \\"critic\\" forgot him?This man is a joke as critic and as a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pump!!","review":"I've had a water garden for 15 years.

My food is not that greasy to run and collect. Instead, I cook eggs, pancakes, French toast, and such. Instead, the eggs, pancake batter, etc., run into the grease troughs of these other griddles and make a mess.I've been using the Calphalon griddle now for a few weeks, and I love it. The only complaint is that like most hard anodized, the exterior easily absorbs/stains with oil and is difficult to clean. Unfortunately, no one makes a stainless non-stick griddle.

Unfortunately, the analog joysticks on the Nintendo-brand controllers tend to wear down and get sloppy after a lot of use.One of my friends recently bought one of these Hip Gear controllers. It looks a little strange: with the curved pointy 'wings' it looks like something from Batman's utility belt - but it actually works fairly well for a 3rd party controller. For games that require precise control it is a little too sensitive, but the analog works perfect for driving games where you are just steering left/right. The buttons have a nice clicky feel, and the construction is really solid. If you want a second controller that you can use for games that abuse the controllers (Mario Party?) the Hip gear controller is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and unlucky Annamaria","review":"Annamaria Pierangeli, know in usa only as Pier Angeli, has been a very troubled woman.

Great classic - great quality and excellent delivery time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See for Moral Truths","review":"Harper Lee's novel, on which the screenplay for this film is based, is one of the very finest American novels. The film is as fine as the book. The storyline follows the lives of three children, playmates in an small fictional Alabama County seat town (Maycomb in Maycomb County) where Atticus Finch, an attorney and father of two of the children is working to defend a black man who is falsely accused of the rape of a white woman. The story deals with honor and dishonor, racism, hatred, bigotry and redeeming love. It treats with gentle irony and profound moral insight the legal, social and spiritual issues of cruel poverty and heroic moral courage when that poverty, together with stupidity and moral cowardice call for taking the right course even when there is no possibility of victory. It is a story of the triumph of decency and grace where both are out of keeping with old codes and evil assumptions. It is a call for courage and a call for courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Adaptation of a Classic Novel","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent novel, and this is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent adaptation. Almost everything about this film is flawless. From the script and the acting, to the cinematography to the music, it deserves its status as a classic monumental film. There's no doubt that Gregory Peck reveals his timeless acting abilities as Atticus Finch. It's a stunning performance, and this performance alone will never become extinct in the legacies of motion pictures. Like the book, this film teaches a very important lesson on racism old and new. Some changes had been made, but I hope readers won't mind, since this IS a film adaptation.To Kill A Mockingbird stands on its own as a classic film. Mixed with dark humor and very fierce drama, this is a film that will never be lost in the shadows.Grade: A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Explain My Reason For 2 Stars","review":"The reason I only give this film 2 stars is that so much important material from the book was left out that I didn't even enjoy this film.

The movie is an excellent adaptation of a book that was way ahead of its time. Although it leaves out what I consider some pretty pivotal points from the novel, it does well with what it can for lack of time and space (if it included everything from the novel it would be 4 hours long!)My only gripe is not about the film itself but about the listing. Amazon.com lists COLOR as a special feature format of this collectors edition. I think it is excellent as a black/white film but thought it would be interesting to see it in color. I was disappointed to find out that actually, viewing it in color is NOT an option at all. I'm sure no one would mind if it wasn't in color but Amazon should not falsely tell people that color is a viewing option when it is not.This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"To kill a mocking bird dvd","review":"This video was excellent.

Peck, a consistently fine actor, has frankly stated that this was his favorite role, and his performance is one of the most outstanding even given on film.

Not only does the story itself intrigue the viewer, but the acting is completely top rate and Gregory Peck alone is remarkable in his role (in my opinion, it was made for him). What makes this version different than the rest, it has to be a combination of the high definition that the blu-ray provides but also on top of this all of the special features that have been provided for the viewer.

Gregory Peck gives the single greatest acting performance of all time as Atticus Finch. He expresses Atticus's virility, confidence, and modesty, as well as his struggles to raise two children without a mother with unparalleled complexity. His performance captures fully the essence of Harper Lee's Atticus: a kind, caring man, split between an inherently racist town and an obligation to raise his children as best he can. The ensemble acting is also especially good, especially the children's, and the score is terrific. Also, Mockingbird has possibly the best, most riviting court scene of any movie. Simply a great movie that stands up to repeated viewings. It's a shame that it isn't at least in the top 10 of AFI's top 100 movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Did They Do It?","review":"I'm not sure how they did it, but to restore and old movie and make it look as sharp and clean as this one is amazes me.

In addition to the classic movie (which we never tire of), the special features are very interesting, including interviews with \\"Scout\\" (Mary Badham), and \\"Atticus Finch\\".

I'm 16 and a fan of Gregory Peck and I loved this movie. I recommend the book first because this movie cannot even compare to the novel. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best books I've ever read. I don't think my entire english class has ever agreed on loving a book that was an assignment."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"I was very pleased with the condition of this movie; it was in perfect condition; quick delivery was greatly appreciated. To Kill A Mockingbird is a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill A Mockingbird - Excellent Classic!","review":"I saw \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" several times on TV. Still, I had to buy this DVD. I watched it yet again, and it was still fresh and enjoyable. (\\"Enjoyable\\" might be the wrong word, here. I think \\"disturbing\\" might be truer.) Gregory Peck plays a widower with a young daughter, who live in the South. As an attorney, he is defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. The story is hard to watch, at times, but it delves deep into the best of men and the worst of men. I think the movie is a realistic view of the place and time, perfectly cast, not corny or sappy. If anyone hasn't seen this movie (and I supposed that some younger people may not have), it is well worth your while to do so. It is definitely a keeper for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic!","review":"This movie isn't old, it's classic. And timeless.Based on the pulitzer-prize winning, bestselling novel by the same name, this original film is a good rendering of the book. Gregory Peck is fantastic in the role of Atticus Finch and you'll even spot a young Robert Duvall in his big-screen debut (though he doesn't get a lot of screen time in this one).Admittedly, the effects are dated compared to today's movies, but if you want to see the book come to life, this is a fine version.Of course, the book is still better. But then again, that is nearly always the case. But if you have the time, you really should read the book instead . . . the film has cut a lot of the novel's fine nuances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal ripped me off!","review":"This is a great movie, but this review concerns the packaging that the DVD comes in. Right on the cover it states that 12 reproductions of the original movie poster is included with this \\"special edition.\\" Well, when I opened mine all I found was an empty sleaze! I was ripped off! And speaking of ripping. The cover came covered with stickers for some bizzare reason. A advertisement for other Universal DVDs was glued onto the front glue and held on with several large round stickers. When trying to remove the huge ad, the front cover art was torn off and ruined.I will be returning this DVD for a full refund, and suggest that other collectors look else where for a DVD copy of this great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legacy of defects!","review":"Nothing to do with the film itself, just the product packaging.

The 'To Kill a Mockingbird' blu ray has been up for pre-order since January. That is deplorable. Universal continually does a bad job with their great classic catalogue. From the Hitchcocks to the Monster movies of the 30s and 40s will be neglected because Universal doesn't believe in upgrading these treasures to blu ray. They don't think old movies will make them money. Shame on them. Amazon, you should pull this from pre-order.

It showed America the way the judicial system was and how people felt in that era.We can still learn from this movie today!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Movie!!!","review":"This movie is one of my Top 10 of all time. The portrait of the South, the courageous look at racism that was very contoversial in the days this movie was made. And the human relationships that included Boo the man that saved the children.

Too bad...it's a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is ALWAYS better than the movie","review":"Actually, I was rather disappointed by this movie. I read the book before watching the movie, and I thought it was much, much better. The movie left out several principal characters or made them have very minor roles, such as Miss Maudie, Mrs. Dubose, and Aunt Alexandra. It also cut the story up and mixed it around, leaving out important events and making it less meaningful than the book. All in all, I would highly recommend the book To Kill A Mockingbird over the movie. I am an eighth grader who was required to read the book for class; I dreaded it at first because I hate reading long classic books, but I thought the story was wonderfully written. This movie just confirms my idea that the book is always better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see film!","review":"The setting for this movie is a dusty southern town in Alabama during the depression and is shot through the perspective of a child's eye. Mr. Gregory Peck does a superb job of playing a southern lawyer who defends a black man who is accused of rape by a white woman and her father. There is no question as you watch the movie of two things; the outcome of the trial and the fact the man is obviously innocent.In this movie we have a great example of a man, Gregory Pecks character, setting a good example of a parent and of being a good member of a community. He instills good values in his children, shows tremendous courage and strength of character. He teaches that you cannot judge a person until you can see the world through their eyes. He is a peerless man, in that everyone is his peer. This is a film whole families should watch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie","review":"i think that To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best movies ever made, it has it all.

Harper Lee's novel of racial and class divisions in depression era Alabama has been translated to the screen with sensitivity and understanding. Gregory Peck gives the finest performance of his distinguished career as Atticus Finch - a truly good man trying to guide his children through life's harsh realities. I believe this extraordinary novel and film actually hastened the civil rights movement by showing us the awful truth. But I love \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" because it redeems the South and gives me hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird","review":"Loved it!

It's not worth the money if you already have the Budokan DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Dissapointment","review":"I should have paid attention to the other reviewers but I just wanted to see and hear Karen. The Japanese sub-titling and closed captioning is very distracting. It can't be turned off and would be distracting even if it were in English. The quality of the video taping is extremely poor. The lighting is insufficient, the images are grainy/fuzzy and there is often distortion in the audio. It looks like a 5th or 6th generation copy from the original. Having said all that, I still must add that it was good to see and hear Karen in spite of the poor quality. She was gone far too soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"This is perhaps the best Raider book that I've ever read.

If you like old-fashioned, verbally witty movies, then you will enjoy this. Jack Lemmon became cast in dramatic roles in his later films, and it's good to see him cut loose with a comedic role akin to his earlier films with Billy Wilder.

I started reading it to my daughter and could not beleive it and how it was written. I though it was going to express who to handle yourself with dignity - not to get encouraged by a little sister who tells you to punch em!! Now my daughter is 4yrs old and doesn't have a bully issue but even if I did have a child that was a bully or being bullied, I don't think I would offer this book. With that said, I do believe this world is now becoming too \\"politically correct\\" and some of the negative reviews here are a little much. I would not want to have my daughter/son in a situation as this and hope they go to an adult but if they are backed into a corner, by all means they should punch back. I think kids need to learn how to handle themselves but I do no think this book portrayed what could possibly happen and isn't a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Horrible","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. I am an Elementary School Counselor. When I read the book I wanted to throw up. It ends with the little boy who has been bullied beating up the bully. When he gets on the bus everyone cheers and his sister beats up the bully. The book ends with him talking about his sister being tough and how the bully should not bother him again. So, I guess the author thinks that violence is the best way for kids to stop bullying. How inappropriate, how sad and what a waste of money. This book will never be used as a teaching tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe this book was written by Mercer Mayer!","review":"I strongly disapprove of the message this book is sending out!

It does not offer any other solutions to the problem of bullies. I will not read this book to my sons again."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS ON THIS ONE!","review":"Actually would give no stars if that were an option. This storywas so poorly written to address the issue of bullies. In the story,the \\"critter\\" being bullied goes to an adult for help and the situation gets worse until things escalate into a fist-fight! Can't believe this is a \\"new\\" book. Reads like something that might have been done in the 50's. Parents should think twice before having children read this story. I'm glad I read the book alone first! My daughter never saw it - it was that bad! Not the kind of \\"help\\" kids need for this issue.

Shame on Golden Books and shame on Mercer Mayer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Message for Target Age Group","review":"I have to say that I agree with the reviews that condemn the message in this book -- it is completely inappropriate and contrary to what we should be teaching our young children. In response to ...it is certainly the case that we sometimes have to stand up for ourselves and in theory it is not bad for books to address this, but the lower end of the age group that these Little Critter books target would NOT be at the age when bullies would enter into their lives.

Quimby was a clockmaker who experimented with mesmerism, clairvoyance, and finally developed the mental healing techniques that later gave birth to Christian Science and then New Thought Christianity.The later founders did not have access to the entire Quimby manuscripts, which we can now benefit from. Althought the writing is repetitious ( a collection of many short articles) there are gems throughout the pages.It is fascinating to see the development of Quimby's thought, and also to realize that he was a more profound and original thinker than most of the people who were later influenced by him, directly or indirectly.For a good introduction to Quimby, see Erwin Seale's \\"Mingling Minds\\".

Now it's her favorite pass time. We tried several other \\"gadgets\\" before discovering the jumper. Now we can accomplish simple things like cooking dinner or washing dishes and our daughter stays happy because she feels like she's a part of what's going on.

She already had a baby einstein jumper that she LOVED, but I wanted something portable to take to grandma and grandpas, and another place to put her. She loves that she can jump and move it all over, I love that I can get some stuff done while she's entertained.I only use this in our double doorways because she moves so much and her arms hang over that I'm afraid her fingers would get pinched in the door frame if it were only a single. So if I only had single doorframes I'd probably stick with a stationary jumper. It is also a little akward to put her in and out of as other posters mentioned, but not impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product if you need to get something done!","review":"My 5 1/2 month old loves to bounce! We have the Fisher Price Jumperoo which we love but that's down in the family room. We needed something that was easy to transport to grandparents houses and easy to move through the house- this fits the bill! She loves to jump in it while I'm cooking dinner. You can easily adjust the length depending on how tall or short your baby is and the height of the doorway. It comes with two little toys that velcro on- my little girl can now take them off and chew on them. I love that she can take them off as she gets interested in them. However, you don't want to deal with them falling off- be sure to remove them before you put your child in the jumper. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"6mo old son loves it!","review":"Purchased this as our 6 month old son was getting comfortable with sitting up and needed something new to keep himself entertained.

There are no instructions on how to shorten it, and as far as we can tell, it's already as short as it can go.

I wanted a new one and Amazon seemed to have the nicest one for the best price, so I took a chance. I couldn't be more pleased. I got in on a special for free shipping and it arrived within a week. It is well made, safe and a very good value. This type of jumper hangs in doorways. Be sure that you have doorways with wooden trim above them or you won't be able to use this kind of jumper.

He even fell asleep in it once! I only have two problems with it, but they are easy to get over. One is that the leg holes are a bit big, so he kept slipping too far to one side and looked very uncomfortable. I fixed this by rolling up a hand towel and sticking it behind him to help him to stay put. The other is that it is hard to adjust the height. You have to loop this cord through and without tension it can loosen again. It was hard to get used to.

We started using this when he was four months; because he still could not control his head well, it was limited. Well, he is 6 months now and 29 inches long and almost 20 pounds, and now that he can control himself better, he is almost too tall for it. The picture in the instructions show that the baby should be on the pads of his feet, not flat footed. He is almost standing in it and we have it adjusted all the way up. My only complaint would be that Graco should have allowed for more room to adjust it shorter for taller babies. Otherwise, my stinker loves this jumper! It's the only way daddy and I get a break. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump","review":"Purchased this for my 6 month old grandson. He loves it. It doesnt raise very high off the floor though.

I researched many other jumpers that aesthetically looked better in our home. Many were too expensive or unavailable, only found in Europe, or had ridiculous shipping charges. We had been trying to avoid too many baby items that were bulky and made from plastic, but we settled on this one. Our 5 month old loved it and used it until she was about 8.5 months. She was an early walker at 10 months, so she reached a point of wanting to move around herself. It could last longer depending on the baby. Look online to see the exact distance the feet should be from the ground when bouncing. The bouncer is pretty light and easy to move from door to door. The toys that come with it to hang from the rings are pretty cheap with velcro that doesn't stay when pulled. I just attached different toys or none at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not fit for \\"taller\\" babies","review":"My four month old loves this thing! The minute we placed him in this jumper, it was a hit. He can spend more time in this than in any of his other activity toys (gym-mat, exersaucer, etc...). However, I don't expect him to be able to use this more than a couple more weeks even though he's only been using it for a 2-3 weeks at most. Here is why...My baby weighs about 18 pounds, and is 27 inches (68.5cm) tall. As another reviewer mentioned already, this jumper's straps do not allow you to adjust it much higher. I find that my baby already has most of his weight supported on his legs, and he definitely touches his whole foot to the ground. If I could find this same item designed for taller/heavier babies, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.So, if you have a baby who is relatively short but is already able to hold his/her head, then this is a great item... Otherwise, look for something that will be useful for a longer period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute","review":"Easy to put together, I'm comfortable leaving the baby in it and doing housework. It's adorable and has been a lifesaver. The seller got it to me promptly and it was definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco Bumper Jumper","review":"My Son LOVED it!!! It cam in handy on a trip to visit family. It kept him busy when everyone else was busy. It is safe and has a wide leg opening, this product can be used well beyond 6 months old (if the child is interested) It can be used if you have a high or low ceiling. The only con is that the toys are kind of lame and they seem to hit my son in the face and come off easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun then Dangerous","review":"We bought this product and loved it for months. I thought it was great, easy to set up and move, and my daughter loved it. Then one morning I put my 8 mo old in it so I could make a bottle. As I was standing at the sink filling the bottle I heard my daughter hit the floor. She had managed to tip herself over the side. She hit her forehead on the floor. Thankfully, I think her legs got tangled in the straps and slowed her fall. She is alright but I put the jumper away for good. The jumper was correctly adjusted for her height and she had her legs through the holes. Until this incident I would have highly recommended this jumper. Now I would advised not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! BUT defective...","review":"We received this item as a baby shower gift. Now that our baby is almost 5 months, She LOVES it! The problem is she is almost too tall for it. We have a standard size doorway so it should be fine but the strap is as high as it can go and she is still too low. We just contacted Graco about this problem so hopefully they can send a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tall for doorway","review":"Our doorway is 82 inches tall and at its shortest setting this jumper hangs to the floor. Our baby is just barely big enough for it and it's already too long. There is no way to adjust it any shorter, but it can be extended about 18 inches longer. Who has doorways this tall?"},{"rating":"1","title":"kindof dangerous","review":"We were so excited to try a jumper for our son, but were very dissapointed in this product. First of all, he tipped himself right out of it! With the three strap design, it's unsturdy in the back, which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor. He seemed pretty intent on jumping, so now we've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he's nice and snug, but it's still unstable and wobbly. I don't recommend this product, and in fact, we are going to try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Older Homes!","review":"This looks like it would be great and a lot of fun, but unfortunately we never got to use it. We had to return it because the clamp was too small for our doorway. Our house was built between 1900-1912. I have heard that the Sassy Jumper works for older homes, we will give that one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute success","review":"There are several things that impressed me about the Bumper Jumper. It was basically ready to go right out of the box, you only needed to insert the seat, which was very easy. It was also incredibly easy to install. The clamp gave me plenty of room to get over our double sets of moldings. The clamp strength is perfect: good enough to keep it in place, but not so strong that I couldn't easily pop it off and move it. The jumper was really easy to adjust to my son's height so that he wasn't too far off of the ground. The spring was just the right springiness so my son could bounce without too much effort but not so springy that he was taken off balance. The bumpers are perfect to keep him from slamming against the door jamb and he loved it when I put the little toys in the tray so he could grab them and play with them. I am 100% pleased with this purchase. I love it and more importantly, my son loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first granddaughters jumper","review":"my first granddaughter loves the jumper except it is not adjustable for the door frame. it fits the door great but as she grows it can not go up and be adjustable.

Its nice and simple also putting it together took no time.Glad I brought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bounce, nice tray, may not be for heavier babies","review":"Pros: I like the tray around the bouncer, the neutral colors, the toys attached to the bouncer, and the ability to rotate the direction the bouncer is facing without having to take it off the door frame.Cons: The diagrams in the instructions show how the baby's feet should rest on the floor. My little one is heavy for her size, but not close to the max weight for the jumper and her feet will soon be flat on the floor. I've adjusted it all the way and it can't be raised any further. I don't think it's terrible, just not ideal.I do think I would buy this again. Great value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect little jumper","review":"This baby jumper is perfect!

I think her walker and play center are more interesting to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!","review":"My mother bought us this for our 8 month old and he LOVES jumping and being able to look outside. He finds it very comfortable, and likes the excercise. My only complaint is the toys that come with it do not stay on very well, which frustrates our son a bit. I am glad for the bumper, it does serve a purpose. All in all I would tell every parent to get one it helps baby excercise, and gives your arms a rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby LOVES it","review":"I purchased this for baby 4 months ago. He was very young for it at only 3 months, but he was so active and always trying to stand so I thought he would appreciate it - and he did. This quickly became his favorite activity. He started trying to jump even when out of the jumper if we were holding him in a standing position. He is very tall at 95% for height, yet even at 7 months, it is just now at the highest adjustment for him and he can still use it. It is very easy to adjust (when the baby is not in it at the time of adjustment). The only thing I don't like is the cheap toys that came with it - those loops for the toys get in the way and can bump the babies head if not adjusted properly. Other than that, this jumper is great. My son is so active and strong yet it holds up to his very strong jumps and twisting. I plan on keeping this around for my next baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short","review":"My son is in the 90% for height and grew out of this before he could even learn to crawl. There should be an easier way to shorten the length of the strap other than adjusting the short little loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby likes this","review":"Our baby likes this jumper. I like that it has a shelf around it so he can't hurt this hands in the door way. He likes to pull the animals from the side off. I put other toys on there as well. My baby has been playing with this since 4 months and is now six months and still likes it. However, even now I need to put a blanket or towel around him because it is too spacy for him. With the blanket it is better. Our only real complaint is that it is tricky to shorten when baby grows. It takes some skill and you need two people unless you continue to take baby in and out to measure where his feet are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy to smash little hands","review":"Too easy for baby to smash hands between door jam and tray. Returned it after one try. Baby caught on to the jumping right away and was not afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful if your little one is tall","review":"My son loves this jumper but we had to attach it to our balcony on the second floor because when it's hanging from the door it sits to low because he is tall (26 1/2 in). I can't adjust it any higher and he is only 5 months. It works great hanging from the balcony though."},{"rating":"1","title":"not adjustable enough! have to return it!","review":"I was so excited to get this jumper in the mail today. When I tried to set it up in our doorway, I realized that it was not going to work in our house and am very disappointed! We have an old house with 10 ft ceilings, and high doorways and aside from the straps not being long enough -- the clamp doesn't fit around the molding. So it still won't fit in the more standard size doorways in my house, like a bedroom doorway. So, it doesn't work in 2 ways - straps don't adjust to be long enough, and clamp doesn't fit around the molding. I don't think our molding is anything that fancy, but maybe this jumper is just made to fit in a standard cookie-cutter house! We are bummed, but have to return it. Would be nice if they made a jumper that was more adjustable. Anyone have any recommendations?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TooLong!!!","review":"This is a fun jumper, but it is too long. Even when I adjusted it to the shortest level possible, my daughter's legs were too low. It's like she's almost sitting on the ground. Our doors are standard, and my daughter is under 20lbs. so I don't know why it hangs so low. It would be a lot more fun for her if she sat up higher and was able to jump with the tips of her toes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring","review":"I guess every kid is different. I bought this due to the rave reviews. I thought my daughter didn't know she was supposed to jump in it. Eventually I realized it was just too boring and the toys were boring as well. A friend gave us a used FP Ocean Wonders Jumperoo. She LOVED it! She jumped in that and it was great because the reward for jumping is certain sounds, music, and lights. This item is another to add on the list of baby things that just gathered dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"This is our favorite. We could sit and watch our son bounce in this all day long. He loves jumping, and it's also building his leg strength. I just wish we would have bought this sooner so he could have enjoyed it longer as he is almost to the weight limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the jump-up!","review":"We bought this for our 5-month-old son a few weeks ago and started using it right away. He loves it! We don't leave him in it too long, just about 15-20 minutes at a time, but he bounces the house down and loves chewing on the little toys. It's a great way to keep him occupied for a short time before he can sit up and play on his own. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long for standard door frames!","review":"My three month old absolutely loves this jumper. I purchased the hugga bebe for him to be able to fit and it works great. Definately recommended.UPDATE::I purchased this about 4 months ago for my three month old and it WAS great for a while. When he was actually big enough to fit in the thing properly, there was no more strap to take up and he practically sits on the floor. I wish it was designed for standard door frames so he could actually use it. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measure your doorways....","review":"I live in a 100 year old house and this just did not work for us.

It is the only toy/chair that he will stay in longer than 30 minutes, and we have them all. He loves jumping up and down on his own, and even when he isn't jumping he enjoys the freedom of standing on his own. My only complaint is that it's a little hard to get him in and out of it by myself. Otherwise, this is perfect entertainment for my 5 month old. I don't know what I'm going to do when he reaches the weight limit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was devastated when he grew out of this, I got so many good months in this thing.

What a blast watching him in it too :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fun for baby but be warned","review":"I have a version of this jumper and used it for both of my children. My daughter loved it and had no problem with it. My son did well with it until just recently. He is 8 months old now and under the weight limit. He had dropped one of his toys that he was playing with while in the jumper. He leaned over to get it and leaned a bit too far causing the seat to turn over and he was dangling by his legs, I thought perhaps that it was because I had the seat down too low so I raised it as high as it would go and kept an eye on him. Within 10 minutes, he dropped another toy, leaned over to get it, and just about flipped the seat again (I caught him this time).I really hate to give this product a negative review because both of my kids loved it so much, but it is potentially dangerous even when used properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might not work with large door trim","review":"I received this jumper as a hand-me-down. I think my son would really like it, but it doesn't fit over our door trim. Our trim is 5/4 x 6. We have regular height doors (6'-8\\") in 2x4 and 2x6 walls. It seems like it would probably work with 1x4 trim or smaller. I looked at Graco's product instructions and they do not specify trim size (other than it must be at least 1/2\\" thick), so if you have large or deep mouldings you might want to check it out in a store before ordering."},{"rating":"2","title":"bumper jumper","review":"My 6 month old grandson loves it. He could bounce for hours. Very portable and well constructed. The toys could have stronger velco, they tend to be easily pulled off the toy. He will just pick them up from the tray with his month.

Lady Jane, Tink and Eric are concerned because Lovejoy seems rather depressed and not accepting help from them. He goes to an auction and find a series of watercolour in the cottage style.

There are not many country waltz DVD's and this one has given us enought moves to look forward to the next dance.

If this happens, it sloshes boiling water all over the stovetop, yourself, or anybody nearby (God forbid you have a little one underfoot). I'm a pretty careful cook, and this has only happened to me once, but it's also happened to my husband and my mom the first time they used the pot.

It is extremely complex and often avoids cliches and very much growth and healing oriented. A nice orphan's adventure. Read this - it is a lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melanie B shows off her soft side","review":"\\"Lullaby\\" is written about Melanie's young daughter, Phoenix Chi, speaking of her unconditional love for her. The track warms up with a child's toybox-like sound and continues in a mid-tempo ballad style. For r'n'b lovers there is also an \\"India-1\\" remix which really enhances the track and gives it an urban kick, whilst not changing the vibe of the song completely. Also included is a bonus remix of Melanie's previous single \\"Feels So Good\\". This dub mix would probably sound better in a club as much of the vocal has been removed. However, as it is still pretty funky it is still listenable without being annoying (as I find some \\"club mixes\\" to be). You can also view the beautiful video on your pc. The video was shot in Morrocco and features both Melanie and Phoenix. \\"Lullaby\\" is the 5th, and last, single to be released from Melanie's debut solo album, \\"Hot\\". Melanie has now left Virgin records as a solo artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"i disliked this book.","review":"i was appaled to think that someone who was born in that period of time could actually interest the likes of the people now, it was not only boring but i wish what i had read would have been more sightful into his experiments than his life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just like cheap chinese product","review":"From the company website:...\\"the artisans at the Johnson Products Company handcrafted custom products with pride.

A Live Coal in the Sea introduces new characters and reunites us with old friends. Written in the style of A House Like a Lotus, with flashbacks every few pages, the reader will never be confused about the time. The main character is Camilla Dickinson, who is happy until her granddaughter, Raffi, comes to her home asking \\"Are you or aren't you my grandmother?\\" Camilla is forced to deal with something that happened long ago. So she tells the story of her life, beginning at her senior year of college, when she met her husband which all lead up to the discovery of Raffi's father Taxi's parentage. There is a surprise twist at the end of the book. Ms. L'Engle deals with complicated issues in a subtle way.

These men are quite easy to identify with if you fancy yourself this way too, even though Cook doesn't seem to try to do a thorough character analysis on them, you sort of figure out what kind of lot they are through their mouths and their actions.I also liked the fact that Cook came up with some totally new stuff-like the Taken for example, and others. And he didn't give the Company the best resources either. Unaccomplished wizards that would rather quarrel and play pranks on eachother than work. And the little romance between the Company's annalist and the omnipotent and beautiful Lady was one of the reasons I kept reading-just to see if Croaker had it in him.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty","review":"This is not your typical unicorns and rainbows fantasy that some of us find dull.

It was very different from usual fantasy fare.Dark magic, grim reality, corrupt cynical soldiers slugging through mud and dodging death blows at every step. Reminded me of Moorcock."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series is about charactor, not setting.","review":"Looking over the other reviews, I have seen the words war and hero too often. This series consistantly is about the charactors. Glen Cook has created a company of charactors [the black company] who are complex, interesting, and individuals. This is their story. It is not about the great conflict between good and evil, it is about the men and women [men mostly] who are stuck in this particular corner of the conflict. The world this series is set in is rich and imaginative, yet the world is just a setting for the charactors. Dont look for Galahad or Arthur, Frodo or Galadrial, Corwyn or Covenant. You wont find them. Croaker, [actually the sarcastic nick name of a competant medic] Goblin, One Eye, Raven and the rest are a lot like people most readers can relate to. They have been placed in extraordinary circumstances and this is the story of how they react, and relate to one another in those circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, strap in.....","review":"I've read my share of fantasy/sci-fi in my time, and some are good, some are bad, but this is an atrocity. I cannont believe for a second that this book was even considered for publication much less even published. There is no excuse for the writing style in this book. Little to no description of anything, land, cities, charecters nothing, and what description exists in the book is compleatly unnessecary. The charecters are shallow, empty and feel like they belong in a teenagers DnD game. The diolouge is immature,inaccurate to the setting and feels like it was written by an 11year old. Through out this experiance in this book I was never abel to follow what was going on once. There is zero direction and even less sense of whats going on. May God forgive you Mr.Cook, for I cannot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fantasy book I've ever read - hands down...","review":"Well, I just read what I thought was the impossible - a negative review of Black Company. Go figure?!? Moving on, this is clearly and undoubtedly the BEST fantasy book I have ever read. By the way, I've surely read it at least 10 times. My copy of Black Company dates back to high school and the mid-80s. It is like an old friend. Whenever a new book to this amazing series comes out, I generally start from scratch and read all the previous books to fully enjoy it.Glen Cook has written a story which should be around for decades to come. Not wordy, or lofty, or ovetly dramatic -- rather the opposite. His books are dark, realistically ambiguous in portraying the characters, and completely riveting. The reader immediately begins associating with the main characters and becomes engrossed in their adventures and interactions, and the setting. To conclude, if you like fantasy novels, try the real thing. One last thing - no elves!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"The book is very poorly written and very disjointed. Major parts of the story background are missing and the book seems to move too fast through the plot. Some back story would have been nice and some reasoning behind why the characters are doing what they are doing. Also, it seems like there is a mix of high fantasy and modern warfare here that just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book rated so high?","review":"I've seen this book almost always listed near the top of many book review lists, and I have *no* idea why it deserves so much praise. I wanted so much to like this book when I started reading it, but there was no way that I could convince myself it was as great as everyone makes it out to be. Then I thought it was just me who didn't care for it, until I found another die-hard book reader who considered it one of the worst books he's ever read. It's not MY worst book I've ever read, but I fail to find any merit in The Black Company worthy of the clout it has generated. It definitely had its moments, but so do most other books. This is one of those classic times that one needs to simply read the first chapter to realize if this book is for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn out","review":"I had really high hopes of reading this book after reading the other reviews. The premise is very interesting but the story is so rushed and the plot flies by and the book is over before you really have an understanding of what is happening. The charcters bring new meaning to the term \\"one dimensional\\" in that any description or personality does not go beyond their name. Then new chracters are introduced in a way as you are supposed to already know them. It was frustrating i really did enjoy some aspects of the book which is why i did not give it a 1. But I ahd to really struggle to finish it, I did not care enough about the series to even start the second book I had already bought. Moral: save your money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite series.","review":"I first read the original series in the early 90's, after a friend loaned me his first editions. I read them twice and hated the fact that I couldn't find them all. When they were reprinted, I bought every book.Let me just say that this is not the most eloquently written or most epic of fantasy series. It is, however, one of the most enjoyable. The original Black Company series of books have to be taken as a whole, and they're very entertaining and satisfying. As dark fantasy goes, even in one as militarized as this, the characters are quirky, gritty and memorable. Goblin and One-Eye alone are enough to keep you reading. You'll see the series through the eyes of the narrators and see many characters come and go as the conflicts go on, the enemies change, and the origins of the Company are revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"an ok read, but...","review":"...I understand that his characters were mercenaries. However, I truly dislike, Glen Cook's casual treatment of rape in this book. I will read no more books of his because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like a Childrens Book","review":"I'm not exactly sure why this isn't a picture book. Maybe I am too used to reading the likes of Dragonlance or A Song of Fire and Ice (both wonderful series), because there is little to no description of the characters or what world they are living in. At about 100 pages into the book you don't know much about the characters to form a mental picture of them. You don't really know what they are like or what they are doing. It seems like they are just wondering around killing things. The plot is pretty loose. I would say a 30 minute episode of Pokemon has more plot than this book.The thing is you expect a battle to be more detailed, but it isn't. Most battles come off in 1 paragraphs and then it's over. \\"Suddendly we retook a fortress.\\"The events are like this as well. No description of the bad guys or who this Lady is.

But I just don't get it. To me the novel seemed directionless and confusing, the world in which it takes place not very well defined. Unlike novels by some of the giants of fantasy - Tolkien, Goodkind, Jordan - I didn't feel like I could grasp the characters or their world."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing and pointless","review":"This book was really confusing and I couldn't really get into it at all.It seemed like the author was trying way too hard to make it have some sort of 'gritty' feel to it, and in the end there was so much slang and jargon (considering it's the first book in the series) that a reader couldn't possibly know what the hell was going on without reading a summary of it on Wikipedia afterwards.The book was certainly unique as it had a modern feel to it despite it being a fantasy setting, but I wouldn't say it turned out well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glen Cook Ruined My Life","review":"(or at least a couple of solid weekends)A friend at work mentioned this series, so on a whim I found it on amazon.

I thought I'd post a dissenting review anyway, though, just to show that it is possible to not like this book, if nothing else. I thought the characters were week and hard to identify with, the plot wasn't even worth caring about, and there was no underlying point or redeeming value whatsoever. This is military fantasy, and that's a very specific field that maybe not everyone would fully appreciate.

Despite its incredibly shallow charecters and its indifferent writing I enjoyed it. Despite the fact that the bad guys were known by such names as Nightcrawler and Shapechanger I enjoyed it. But after reading this book and several of the ones that come after it I was left with the feeling that I wasted my time. if you are looking for a trashy piece of fluff to get you through the night read this book, but if you want something remotely meaningful my advice is to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for.........","review":"I've seen this series many times at bookstores, and have been intrigued to say the least. So I finally picked it up, and low and behold, it was the worst piece of fantasy I have ever read.The characters have no background or depth, and their names look like they were made up by group of gamers in a tree house.The story is so weak, and the action scenes offer zero explanation for results. I was suprised that this even made it to print.

It read more like a plot outline than an actual novel, with thin characters, sketchy descriptions, little sense of mood or atmosphere, and a plot one finds it hard to care two cents about. Too bad, as I really wanted to like it. The point of view of Croaker is mildly interesting, but never really developed into a character driven piece that engages the reader. And all that silliness between One-Eye and Goblin... puh-lease. I guess if you've read every other fantasy \\"formula\\" out there, you might find this one diverting. As for me, I'm still finding much more interesting fare to read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark...deadly and very funny.","review":"What I enjoyed most about this book was it's sence of humor. It's not an Anderson type funny but a more dark and pesonalized one. The different charectors constantly put down each other with a dark gallows sence of humor that is more realistic with fighting men struggling in difficult times they would rather not be a part of but who are constantly pulled to do the one thig they do best, war. It's an excellent read far different than other novels. It's message is not about good or evil it's simple...carry on and hope your fighting for the good guy's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, Realistic Fantasy for Adults","review":"I've read a ton of fantasy, and in recent years have moved towards the grittier, adult fantasy. Where stuff like R.A. Salvatore's books were beloved when I was a teen, I now need something more complex and realistic. Many fantasy readers are only interested in the status quo of Victorian mannerisms and dialogue along with heroic sounding names performing epic feats against an unknowable absolute evil, and if that's you then this may not be your style. This series has real characters that real men can relate to: they don't always say or do the right thing, they don't project emotional brotherly love, and they like to horse around. There is a reason this is popular among servicemen, and it's because this series shows how men of war often act. This puts you in the shoes (first person) of an elite mercenary unit and takes you through an unforgiving, realistic world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olymput 200372 CB-USB6 USB Cable","review":"I wasn't to sure about this when I ordered, but it was exactly what I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"You need to have this cable to connect your camera to the computer, get it!

Besides using it as a basic fry/saute pan, it's deep enough for frying chicken too. I've even done baked ziti that I served right at the table out of this. It's clearly a \\"try me\\" piece with the great price. This is probably, out of all of the Calphalon Tri-ply try me pieces, the most versatile one, seeing as how it can be used as a saute pan, a deep fryer, a casserole pan, and even a braiser. You get true bang for your buck. And like the rest of the Tri-ply line, it heats evenly up the sides of the pan and cooks beautifully. I find myself reaching for this pan more than any other that I own, and I own almost the entire tri-ply line. You can't beat the price, especially if you purchase it from BBB and use a 20% off coupon. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I recently moved into a new rental with a glass top electric stove. Unfortunately my cheap old stainless pots and pans, which have served me well, are slightly warped these days. It's enough that the pans don't heat evenly on the flat glass top. So, I thought it was time to buy some real cookware.This heats very evenly, and rather quickly as well. I find generally I have to use a lower temperature setting than I'm used too. The size is perfect, and I like that there's side handles instead of long handles. The slopped bottom keeps things from getting caught up in the corners, and the drip edge on the rim works well.My only criticism is that the riveted handles, while probably more durable than bonding them to the outside, do leave rivet heads on the inside which I'd prefer to not be there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Pan","review":"I agree with every positive comment on this pan.

Flat bottom is large enough to saute veggies and aromatics, while the sloping sides are great for stirring in a sauce, al dente pasta, or whatever you're adding.

There's no reason whatsoever to go to the much more expensive All-Clad version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic pan!","review":"I just finished washing this pan, which I choose to use at an increasing rate.

I will, however, add that the background score used during much of the DVD is both beautiful and haunting. I've heard the piece since on Minnesota Public Radio, but haven't been able to identify it. One of the most unique contributions of this DVD is the interviews with former members of the SS who staffed the camp, especially Oskar Groening. Listening to these elderly and apparently very normal men recount how they paticipated in the daily operation of this place of death should serve as a warning to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Insight","review":"We actually borrowed this selection from our local library.

It was just recreated history absolutely, the producers I guess think people are just so naive to just accept everything along with whatever recreated episodes of reality that they choose.

Instead of photos and film clips from the era, we mostly get actors doing reenactments. One example: the film makers spend an inordinate amount of time trying to engage our sympathies for the poor women who populated the camp's brothel. True, they lived in comfortable rooms and had nice clothes and plenty to eat, but they (sob) have to have sex (sob) with men! Give me a break. I kept wondering about all the women who were being gassed and cremated next door, and shouldn't we feel worse for them, but the actual killing of people was one of the icky parts the documentary doesn't talk much about. Candy-ass tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State (BBC) 2005","review":"What a terrific documentary this is. It's based on a collection of newly released documents from Eastern Europe, period video footage and photos, eye-witness accounts and personal interviews with survivors and former SS guards. Many scenes are re-enactments with men in uniforms. The use of CGI technology to recreate the camp and underground gas chambers and barracks is very illustrative and powerfully evocative. Informative interviews with survivors punctuate the DVD, reinforcing what the narrators say, and remind one of the 1970s documentaryShoah [A History of the Holocaust] 4 DVD Set , Import, All Regions. There are things in this video I've never seen anywhere else. This 2-disk documentary is a very thorough and professional treatment of the subject, leaving one feeling informed and rather disturbed when it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auschwitz - Inside the Nazi State - Long Time Overdue.","review":"Besides being the greatest government organized murder campaign throughout the history the Nazi regime instituted the highest robbery in the name of the law. This series points out the corruption of the perpetrators of the Nazis \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\" who tried to get rich on the dead bodies of their victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Read","review":"This book was a fascinating read for me. I have always been vastly interested in history, but it seems that most formal education really does not touch a whole lot on the holocaust or Auschwitz. (I am 25 and have only a slight recollection of being taught about it) It is disgusting to me that people could behave in this manner and treat fellow human beings so horribly. I feel it is important for information such as this to be available for people. While reading this book at work in the breakroom it shocked me how many people would see the title of the book and ask \\"What is Auschwitz?\\" That tells me that a place as important in the history of mankind as Auschwitz does not have nearly the power in conversation as it would have 60 ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Truth","review":"The hypocritical, programmed and maniacal Nazis, duped and led by the ruthless, demonized Adolf Hitler and his obsequious henchman and the evil they wrought against people is illustrated and evidenced clearly throughout this double DVD production. It is a critical and brutally depicted visual discourse. I appreciate it and recommend it to all who want the truth about what people in power will to you when they gain total control."},{"rating":"2","title":"little chef","review":"Just perfect for a todler who is excited with cooking with mom and dad or with the Tv.

I look forward to reading the next book in this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EEUW","review":"Ugh, this was the most awful Tamora Pierce book! I always ignore it when reading through the entire series because I find that I haven't missed a thing when I do so. The plot stinks because it goes so slowly you feel like Pierce was writing only to accomplish something by a deadline. The supporting characters aren't as likeable as you wish they were, and the wolves are just.... weird.Don't bother reading this book when you go through the series--you honestly won't miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was alright","review":"It was slow paced.

For a $7 download, the formatting is atrocious : lots of weird text artifacts and mis-spellings, not to mention the bad paragraph formatting with no indentations! Looks like someone uploaded a raw scan of the text with zero proofreading. That may be excusable with a copyright free novel, but not an official release from the publisher. The shook cover doesn't match the other books in the series either. Very disappointed, Simon & Schuster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This series was so compelling, I couldn't wait for it at the library, and had to buy it. This book is not just for young adults, it is for all readers who enjoy a good series. Do not be put off by having to look in the young adult section. A good story should be enjoyed by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first book called an Addy book!","review":"This a wonderful book where exciting things happen. Not at all the worst of Tamora Pierces books. Daine and Numair travel to Dunlath valley where Daine discovers more of her magical powers, and helps her friends, the wolves. When she pays a visit to Dunlath palace she meets Lady Maura of Dunlath. If you want to find out the rest, you have to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf Speaker","review":"This sequel to Wild Magic is wonderful. Daine is called on to protect the wild animals of Long Lake.She learns to shape-shift and becomes friends with Maura, the sister of Yolane, the lady of Dunlath.Soon however, she finds that Yolane is in cahoots with the Emperor of Carthank. The ending of this book is very good, but I can't tell you the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better than Wild Magic!","review":"OK< I have to admit,I thought I'd like Wild Magic better than Wolf Speaker, because I love horses. But this one is better...Daine gets a new grasp on her wild magic, and I love the setting, peaceful (or formerly peaceful) Dunlath Valley. My favorite part was all the animals (wolves, ponies, bats, um, was Quickmunch a hedgehog?). So if you love animals, pick up this one! (After, of course, having read Alanna's series, and Wild Magic.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite up to standards","review":"This is a teriffic book, but it's not quite up to the standards Tamora sets for her amazing books. It had a great plot, with a lot of new Immortals and a new setting, which I liked a lot. I really enjoyed when Daine became a part of the animal she was talking to. This is a great book that I would reccommend to any fantasy lover- just as long as you read Wild Magic first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Young Adults","review":"This series was a nice surprise for me, lent to me by my best friend. This, the second in the series, proved just as well-written and engrossing as the first. I am fascinated by the character development in the series, and am anxious to finish reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading for all ages","review":"This book is a great read for any aged fan of animals and fantasy adventure, especially if you're female. Even though this is the second book in a series, it can also be a stand alone story. Although these books are meant for young girls, I am a 37-year old mother of four and I just LOVE reading Tamora Pierce's stories. They are so full of strength and action which is encouraging to young ladies. I can't wait to read more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zaftique.com great but dress sucks","review":"I got this dress the other day and I was very disappointed.

The blindness of the participants to the events swirling around them in Europe was startling. Their concerns with business and success overrode any concern with the outside world. Marriage between cousins, uncles and nieces, was common emphasizing the clannishness of the Jewish population. This world ended with the commencement of WW II. The book definitely has a limited audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice.","review":"Good quality, handsome product that does what it's supposed to do and does it well. Shipping was prompt, and I would recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mojito Madness!","review":"If you make Mojitos you MUST have a muddler. There's no other way around it.I started with a wooden muddler, but it started stinking after a few uses. Sure, it only smelled like rum & lime, but was bacteria living in the wood as well?This Swissmar muddler is well made and balanced correctly for hand use. It makes quick work of the cane sugar and mint leaves. It cleans well in the dishwasher, and is small enough to take on road trips.Mojitos Rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works :)","review":"It does the job as it is supposed to. The end in sturdy enough to nicely crush mint leaves (for Mojito :)) but soft enough not to damage the glass.It's very light, but not in a way that would give you the feeling that you will deform it with your hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I was happy to see we werent the only one ending up with charcoal bricks after using this toaster.

Only good thing is that it failed so quickly I can easily return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within one week of use","review":"My mother purchased this item from a local department store and gave it to me for my new house. I used it probably 5 times before it started to break. One of the brackets inside the toaster that lower & lift the bread/bagels broke...does not move with the lever. And the past 3 times I've used it for bagels it takes about 15 attempts before the lever actually clicks in the spot to be held down. Because of this malfunction, the bagels pop up too soon and I have to try again, repeating the many attempts to get it to actually work. And if I'm not standing right there watching they will burn very quickly.I will be returning this piece of garbage to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Avoid at All costs","review":"This toaster constantly burns and unevenly toasts bread.

I read the reviews and felt this one would work well for me. Was I wrong. I have not had a consistently toasted piece of bread or bagel yet. My advice: Don't purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-lived toaster","review":"This was a great, simple toaster... for the first couple of months I owned it. Just four months after purchase it is unusable.Construction seems extremely flimsy. The metal 'carriers' for the bread bent out of shape from normal use. Generally at some point during the toasting process the bread falls off this carrier (either when putting the bread in or when it pops up). This means that the carrier pops up at the end but the bread stays at the bottom of the toaster and requires a fork or something to get it out (with toaster unplugged of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the old one was much better","review":"I had a white sunbeam toaster I dearly loved for years, til I dropped it.So, I decided to stick with the tried and true and get another one.Well, that is a mistake.

I thought...hey its cheaper than the other ones, but doesnt look too cheap. It just stopped working about 7 months after I bought it.

I would say just invest in something a little nicer that will last you a couple more years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad toaster","review":"I bought one of these from Target several months ago, and I must agree with the last reviewer. It burns the toast if it is set any higher than 2, and if you have recently made toast (i.e. it has not yet cooled down) it burns it even on the lowest setting. Under no circumstances should you consider using the bagel button, because that also guarantees a burnt bagel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Toaster Ever!","review":"Worst toaster ever!

Ran a cycle without bread on the highest setting to get rid of the awful plastic smell. The toast came out fairly evenly browned. The problem is with the design genius that thought the front corner is the perfect place for a 24\\" cord to exit the toaster! This means the unit either has to sit sideways to the plug or the lever/dial has to face the plug, depending on how much counter space you have available. Definitely returning it to the store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classics","review":"We greatly enjoy this set of Classics from the past!! They are remixed & fun to listen to!!

O'Rourke and having read almost everything he has ever penned, I can say without hesitation that this is his finest work yet. If anybody is hoping to acquire some verbal ammunition to fire back at their squishy liberal friends while debating social issues such as overpoulation and the environment, this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not PJ's best, but thought provoking.","review":"P J O'Rourke has always made me laugh. I've never really considered him a \\"conservative\\", just someone who enjoys poking fun at people. Liberals just normally have more to ridicule and don't normally have that great a sense of humor. (Witness Al Franken who had the broadside of a barn to hit with Rush Limbaugh and missed almost completely). The problem, if you can call it that, with this book is that it isn't funny enough. The travelogue through the most hellish places on earth is sporadically funny, and often hits many targets, but only really caught fire when he visited his alma mater and made fun of the groups that he saw, especially the men against pornography. At any rate, PJ comes off pretty balanced in this book, and one suspects he may be more of a \\"liberal\\" than he admits. But I was still waiting for more of the wit that made Give War a Chance and Holidays in Hell so amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"P. J. is a Genius","review":"P.J.

O'Rourke gets it right. First time and everytime. I appreciate the logical perspective he puts on his selected issues. From population to pollution, he shows the liberal slant in reporting is not reality. Funny how the population of Bangladesh is frightening, but not in Fremont, California, though both places have the same density. O'Rourke has a fun writing style and a propensity to use words that makes many readers cringe as they reach for their dictionaries. The man is truely a master of his craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Around the world with your libertarian guide","review":"Like him or hate him you must admit that P.J. O'Rourke's writing is always outrageous and never boring. A spokesperson for wealthy, satisfied, middle-aged white guys everywhere, P.J. travels around the world and along the way makes you happy you're an American. His amusing takes on the planet's trouble spots are actually quite informative. There is a lot of truth in pieces like \\"All Guns, No Butter,\\" which gets to the heart of starvation in Africa, for example. P.J. is one of the few writers who actually makes conservatism fun (even if you aren't one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet again, he comes through","review":"I am a vegetarian. I disapprove of the death penalty. I am a feminist (with a small f). You could even say i am a liberal. Yet, i defy all stereotyping, because i love the writing of P J O'Rourke. Yes, his writing is biased.(show me writing that isn't) Yes, he can be bombastic.

The players include Curtis Joseph, Martin Brodeur, Jarome Jagr, Mike Modano, Jarome Iginla, Paul Kariya, Joe Thornton, Steve Yzerman, Joe Sakic, and ,urs truly, Brian Leetch of the Rangers.

I finally broke down and bought it after renting multiple times since it's release."},{"rating":"2","title":"They did it!","review":"What can be said about this amazing, well written, laugh out your chair movie? It's clever and shows that the Kids can go from the TV screen to the big screen. I've been a KITH fan longer than I can acurately remember, and after hearing about Brain Candy, I was a little skeptical (especially after reading some of the reviews.) But one day I decided to cough up the 20 bucks to get it and it's one of the greatest things I could have done. I really hope the guys find time to do another movie, but I'm sure nothing at all will ever beat this masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best movie ever, but one of the funniest!","review":"this movie generates lots of laughs when a \\"happy drug\\" traps people in their best memory forever. The plot's a little choppy, and a bit slow in parts, and it's certainly not for the easily offended, but the whole movie's worth repeated viewing when Scott Thompson's character comes out of the closet in a prolonged musical number. Or when Bruce McCulloch's depressed rock star turns into an Osmond-wannabe. Yes, Brendan Fraser's in a cameo appearance, but the Kids are the real stars. Definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the Kids Became Men","review":"KITH were always extremely talented. But \\"Brain Candy\\" marks their transformation from talented comedians to comedic geniuses. Many critics have compared them to Monty Python, and with this movie, they finally deserve that comparison. This is as brilliant as great satire gets. My only hope is that they will soon make another film together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Candy from the Kids","review":"I was a huge fan of the Kids in the Hall. That series proved in the late eighties that sketch comedy had life left, even after SNL had drug it through the mud for a decade. I was excited by the idea of a long format sketch but I think it proved to much for the Canadians.The story, of a greedy drug company releasing an untested drug on the market is weak, yes, but that doesn't matter so much. The story is just an excuse to get the various Kids dressed up and making with the funny. My problem with Brain Candy is that the acting which is so endearing in a short sketch is annoying for an hour and a half and the movie is just ugly. I wish I could recommend this flick but I can't. Maybe just watch Animal House again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kids drop the ball","review":"Don't get me wrong--I love the Kids in the Hall. My wife and I never miss them on Comedy Central. We have tickets to see them in LA on their 2002 tour. However, I was amazed that they produced such a dull film. The premise, a new drug that makes the taker deliriously happy, would have made for a funny skit, but here it is inflated to a length that cannot be sustained. The Kids' forte is sketch comedy; they are every bit as good as Monty Python or the better SNL casts. I wish they had played to their strength here and done something more along the lines of \\"The Meaning of Life\\" or \\"And Now for Something Completely Different,\\" Monty Python's classic big screen collections of hilarious skits. I hope they get another chance to do it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MOVIE SO UNFUNNY I FEEL SOMEONE OWES ME 90 MINUTES BACK!","review":"Dear God what happened here? How do you go from creating some of the funniest characters of all time...On one of the funniest shows of all time....By 5 of the funniest guys of all time... To creating a movie so UNfunny it literally seems to know it and ooze sad resignation.Now don't get me wrong: I am the biggest KITH fan there is... In fact, I just saw them 3 times a month ago on the new live tour. But BRAIN CANDY is just awful.Plain and simple.It is painful to watch. We are teased with small snippets of the best charcters of the show...And left with a movie full of new not funny characters and a script that actually tries to be a SCRIPT!God, I would have rather they released a theatrical version of the show.BRAIN CANDY? No. BRAIN DEAD is more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Candy more like Brain Fart","review":"I loved the Kids in the Hall T.V. series. There was almost not a single skit that wasn't funny. I didn't think the Kids in the Hall could make anything bad, until I watched Brain Candy. This is by far the dumbest movie I dare say I have EVER seen EVER! I sat watching with amazement, not at how good the thing was, but at the incredibly stupid movie I was devoting two hours watching. This movie is NOT for the uninitiated, nor is it for die-hard KITH fans. Avoid this misconstrued mess like you would the whooping cough.

It is genuinely funny and yet at the same time has the blackest of black hearts. I truly believe this film is up there with Doctor Strangelove as one of the greatest comedies ever crafted for the big screen. The performances are perfect and the characters are brilliant exercises in the minutae of life. The film also has a strong and potent message. I am not sure that another cinema outing for the Kids in the Hall would be as strong despite their brilliant TV show, possibly if only because they have such a lot to live up to. I only wish more people could have seen this film at the cinema but I'm very pleased to see this film coming out on DVD and will buy it the day it is realised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satirical Farce about an Unfortunate and Serious Problem","review":"The movie is funny, but not the type of comedy that will have you rolling out of your seat, perhaps because the subject matter deals with such a grave problem. It combines both farce and satire to bring to light crucial points about our society and its blind acceptance of an industry interested in one thing: money. People will do and say most anything to keep their job and corporations will sell their souls to make a profit. Drug companies are not nearly as regulated as one might think and won't hesitate to distribute faulty products for a buck.The plot depends on a skillfully exploited and highly improbable situation. Cross-dressed characters are exaggerated, which adds to the derision of the pharmaceutical industry. Enjoy. Worth a view."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all that","review":"I love kids in the hall, but this movie is not going to get a sequel. They stretched a skit to fill a movie, and it just ended up feeling thin. It just wasn't that funny. I think I laughed outloud when the german model said \\"folk art\\" and that was it. It's humorous of course, just no where near as hysterical as some of the episodes. I would have MUCH rather seen a compilation or \\"best-of\\" from the television episodes. They'll always be priceless, and I'm sure the next time we'll get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kids in typical KITH form, eh?","review":"I'd have given it four stars, but the Kithie in me demands I give it five. What can I say? I thought it was hilarious. I love The Kids, and this movie is basically one big in-joke that non-Kithies won't get. Love the cameos by Melanie and the Police Department cops, and how the Bigot Cabbie serves as a sort-of narrator. If you're a fan of the show, you'll love it.

Did anyone catch Brenden Fraiser's cameo?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurray for Kids in the Hall!","review":"Okay I really really loved this movie. I must pass on a piece of advice. If you're thinking about watching it, don't watch it until after you've seen the Kids in the Hall TV show. I watched it pre-KITH, and I didn't understand a lot of it. I thought it was moderately funny. I have been watching KITH daily for the past two months now, and I rented it again about a month ago, and it was a lot better this time, and I recognized some of the characters (the cops, Melanie, Raj and Lacey, etc). I would definitely recommend it though!!! The only non-funny thing was Cancer Boy. I didn't find it particularly offensive, just unfunny. Otherwise, I love this movie!!!

The digital disply is easy to read and can be changed from grams to ounces easily. The weight of a bowl or container can be zeroed out (tared) as well, which makes it very useful, especially for measuring out ingredients for baking. The white finish cleans easily as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after a few months","review":"I also purchased this product thinking it'd be a great low-priced scale. I consider myself to be gentle on my kitchen appliances and though I use it once a day or once every other day, I expect it to last more than a few months.

I'd recommend other brands unless you want to have to replace yours in less than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working out-of-box","review":"The scale does not come with a battery, even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging. Scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it. All of this I can live with, the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself. When turned on, it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds. I timed it -40g for one minute (and after hours... just keep on going...). The box had no signs of damage, so I'm guessing the load cell was bad. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even at this price, it's still a good item to have","review":"If portion control is important to you, this is a great item to have in your kitchen. Really functional, and small enough that it fits into a kitchen drawer. Seems to be accurate, and it turns on and off very easily. The scale itself is about 8\\" wide, and the buttons allow you easy access to how you want weight displayed and whether you want to tare the weight (i.e., you put a plate on the scale, then tare it, to bring it back to zero and then add the food to the plate).The only drawbacks - the digital display is a little small, and can be hard to read in low light. Otherwise, this is a terrific item to have and has helped me tremendously in obtaining my fitness goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!","review":"I love my new scale. I can put a bowl on it and tare back to zero. Add my ingredient and tare back to zero and continue adding and taring without ever removing my bowl.

I would recommend this scale to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but I'm not sure about the precision","review":"The size, capacity and functions are just what I wanted. I've mostly used it to weigh out coffee. The only thing that concerns me is that it is not really precise to one gram. For instance, if I put my measuring cup on and then zero the scale, then measure out 50g of coffee, after I dump the coffee in the grinder, the weight of the empty measuring cup is consistently a few grams less than it was initially."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunctional","review":"Sent it back.

Now I have a $200 coffee maker that only grinds!Made great coffee, but over priced and UNDER ENGINEERED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big big disappointment","review":"I bought this coffeemaker and for the high price, I expected it to work perfectly. Wrong expectation. For a mere 6 cups of good coffee, you need have the grinder set to brew for 10-12 cups. The biggest issue is the condensation that runs down the front of the machine when you have the temperature set on the highest setting. During the brew, you need to monitor this water and wipe off the hot plate 1-2 times or else you end up with a flood on your countertop. Very disappointed for the price of this appliance. Better than the Cuisanart grind and brew but not by much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe those negative reviews","review":"Had the Capresso for two days and returned it. I should have listened to the reviewers who said it doesn't make a hot cup of coffee. They were absolutely correct. I am not one who needs a burning cup of coffee but one that in summer does not start out much above body temperature and when you add milk, goes down to downright lukewarm. I am discouraged by all the grind and brew pots having tried both the Cuisinart and Melitta. Neither one of those could make a decent cup of coffee unless you liked it so weak that it was almost clear. The Capresso makes a just ok cup and is not worth the 199 dollars for a warm ok cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must Read Before Buying","review":"This coffee maker was great for about 6 months. After that the grinder stopped working properly and the filter got jammed so the coffee couldn't go through to the pot. I tried everything to fix it, but it still won't work properly.

Like many other reviewers here said, it is impossible to get a strong cup of coffee out of it.

I had to buy a new coffee maker. 8-("},{"rating":"1","title":"More Problems Than It's Worth","review":"The Coffemaker never really worked very well. We had to start helping the basket swing over and lock after only a few weeks. After about a year, water flooded the counter-top when the water was pumped into the basket. Customer service provided some replacement parts and was very pleasant to work with but the problems were never really fixed, or the fix was short-lived. On the positive side, I like the fact that you don't have to measure coffe beans every night from a seperate container. $200.00 is a lot to pay for this \\"quality\\" of product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bad reviewers are using the wrong kind of beans...","review":"I have used my Capresso daily for about 5 years. I love it and have never had any problems with it! Burr grinders are the best way to grind beans. The water is hotter than in my old coffeemaker, also contributing to a better cup of coffee. The people who are complaining that they don't get strong enough coffee are using beans that are too oily to go through the grinder fast enough. I have experienced that myself. The solution is simple: buy beans such as Eight O'Clock brand of Colombian Supremo, one of the best coffees around for just $2.50 per 13-oz. package. These beans are a great medium roast resulting in a non-oily bean so your coffee will be strong enough and a great flavor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I loved my Capresso grind and brew for the first six months. Afterwards the unit stopped brewing. The grinder works, but the coffee would not brew and the heat plate did not warm up. Capresso sent me a UPS tag to send in the unit for repair. After receiving the unit back, it worked for three days and then stopped brewing again. I called Capresso back and they are sending me a new unit. I can't complain about Capresso standing behind their product, however I'm anticipating more problems. I'm also concerned that the replacement unit will have problems after the warranty expires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine engineering, but too much fiddling for strong coffee","review":"My wife & I have found the coffeemaker to be reliable and effective, here after 4 months of daily use. Reterating what others have said here, our only complaint is that we have to put in less water than the amount of coffee to be ground (e.g. 5 cups water but tell it to ground enough for 8 cups). We like our coffee European strong.

I'm the only coffee drinker in the house so I tend to make small pots. Within a few months after getting the 453, I noticed that the grind times were very erratic. In the 2-4 cup mode the grind would run from 3-25 seconds, making either very strong or very weak coffee. I reported the problem to customer service, and the unit was repaired and returned in 4 days. (great service). Unfortunately the problem reoccurred within a week. Then Capresso sent me a new unit. I programed it to make 4 cup strong coffee, filled the grinder and fired it up. It proceeded to grind all the coffee in the grinder, enough for about 12 cups. I now use the unit manually and only put as many beans in the container as I need, and grind them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"this coffee maker worked fine for a while and it brewed fine coffee. The grinder broke within a couple of months. The carafe is shaped in such a way as to promote down-the-spout dribbling; very annoying when a clean pour is the only goal of the carafe.

Now, after developing the spilled water problem that many have written about, the heating element/water pump is broken. Of course this is not under warranty anymore. While we were happy with it while it worked, I think this is too much money to spend for the lifespan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best out there for drip coffee, but quality issues prevail","review":"This was x! coffee maker for me, and was one of the very few which adequately addressed the requirements of auto grind, timer, and no handling of the coffee grounds.It worked really well for about a year, and then parts just started to fall off. First the drip stop and pour, then the LED Panel, the water lid etc.Overall, it is a great machine, vastly better than the Cuisinart model, makes really strong (if desired), very high quality coffee and is completely intuitive to use, but you might want to budget for an annual replacement cycle.The other thing to take into account is, if you make different varieties of coffee throughout the day, such as decaf, dark roast, light roast, you can only have one coffee at a time in the grinder, you will have to grind other coffees in a separate grinder and use the Capresso Team as just a regular drip coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffee Maker I Ever Owned","review":"This was the most expensive -- and the worst -- coffee maker I ever owned. Even on the strongest settings, with the darkest French roast, brewed coffee was weak. It was difficult to get the filter basket in place. And it took an enormous space on the counter.

The first one I received leaked and filled my counter with water the first night. The second one has no defects - but we can't grind flavored coffee (it gets caught in the shoot) and the filter basket frequently clogs, either causing the no drip not to work (it gets stuck open), or the basket to fill up with water (it gets stuck closed). The gold mesh coffee filter (supposed to eliminate paper filters) allows a fine dusting of grounds to get to the coffee.

Just don't expect anything fancy on this copier. It does its job, but nothing above the basic stuff. Would I recommend it? Yes, but only if you can get a good deal on it.

It makes very clean looking black and white copies. If you can think of a question in the form of \\"Does this copier have _____\\" chances are the answer is no. It can do double-sided copies, but only manually. There is no multiple-original feed. No shrink/enlarge options. It does have auto-exposure with a manual override if it's needed. Knowing all of this I think it's a steal at the $25 AR I paid. Otherwise you're probably better off with a scanner and printer for most uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for copying pages from books","review":"This is a cleverly designed compact copier, but don't buy it if you think you would ever need to copy a page from a book. In order to copy a page from a book one must push down on the book to flatten out the part of the page closest to the spine, and this copier would probably break under that kind of pressure. In addition, the surface (platen, I think they call it) where one places the book to be copied moves back and forth during the copying process, and even if one doesn't push down on the book, a considerable amount of patience and manual dexterity is needed to hold the book perfectly on the surface while it moves. We immediately saw that we would not be able to use this copier, since we occasionally need to copy pages from books, and Amazon was very nice about taking it back even though we had already begun to use the toner cartridge. Amazon even paid the shipping charges to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PC 170 - love it!","review":"This copier replaces a personal Canon copier I had for at least 14 years. Over the years I have found it very handy to have a copier at home and have used it quite often. The Canon PC 170 takes up very little space and performs very well. It makes excellent copies quickly with no warm-up waiting time. An additional feature which I did not have on my older copier, is that the PC 170 has a paper feed which allows one to make multiple copies. You can also set the number of copies to be made. On my old copier, each paper had to be hand fed. Another nice feature is that one can adjust the paper feed to make copies as small as an index card. I have used this feature many times over the years on my old copier and was happy to see this same feature on the newer model. This copier is an excellent value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I will not place an order like this again through Amazon. There seems to be no recourse if there is a problem. This copier was ordered from \\"Adorama Camera\\"in New York City through the Amazon site. Unfortunately, upon installation it became apparent that the toner cartridge was defective. The customer rep at Adorama said that the copier was \\"dropped\\" to us from a distributor and referred me to Canon for service, but Canon said that they would not help because Adorama was not a Canon dealer. Now, over one month after the original order, I am still waiting for a promised replacement from Adorama."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS LIGHT","review":"Arrived in timely, well-packed fashion.

The performers who appeared with The Band will certainly fill a complete wing in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Martin Scorcese's interviews, creative camera locations, and beautiful set provided the backdrop for a farewell tribute to one of the most professional bands ever assembled.

Every song played here is sheer honey, and then you have the Waltz anthem playing at end. The best part is the music sounds original right out of the oven and no technology or modern machine can immulate this music, and the movie which was made then with so little of technical support. This DVD is a must have for all classic rock lovers and equally important for other passionate music lovers...never know you may just knock back on the Last Waltz again !"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST ROCK CONCERT EVER","review":"I'm 30 years old and grew up in an age of terrible music and without any role models that exposed me to any classic rock I fell into the world of pop :..( A friend of mine showed me this movie when I was in high school and it changed my life.

Musicians who have change my appreciation of all genres.

THIS IS IT. Yeah Woodstock was a landmark film. Music wise, this is better in so many ways. Performance, sound quality, and Martin Scorsase's brilliant filming. In blu-ray video, it's like a time capsule. The fact that I was a part of this generation and the music it produced makes me proud. My favorite part? Joni Mitchell in her prime.

What happened in the mix? Everything else is stellar (nice separations, a not-too-intrusive audience, etc.) but it was strange to watch RD work the neck so expertly but not be able to hear it. Anyone know what gives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I can't say many more positive things from what has already been said in other reviews. I will comment that the film transfer and sound revisions of this new DVD are reference class.The more I watch this movie - the more I realize how good Martin is. The way this was put together was brilliant. One of my favorite parts is where Joni does her thing singing Coyote. What an incredible professional and talent. They just don't make them like her anymore.It's amazing, but watching these guys in interviews makes you think you were more likely to meet them at a truck stop. To think that heart-felt music like this can come from such ordinary guys blows my mind. These guys write and sing from the heart - something that most modern music today really lacks. (Not to mention what great musicians they were)This film gets better with age. You can't watch this DVD without being moved. Martin is right - this DVD needs to have the volume turned up to really appreciate!Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Richard","review":"I was going to add my own somewhat cynical 2 cents worth, but the review by Mr. Bede pretty much sums up what I had to say. I will add, though, that it's sad and somewhat haunting to see the \\"I Shall Be Released\\" finale when Richard Manuel comes in on the second verse, the way he's hidden off-camera until we get a shot of ... Ringo on the drums. Overall, overwrought, overrated, somewhat shameful at times the way Scorcese tries to make a star out of his coke buddy Robby Robertson. After all, there were no stars in this Band. But certainly redeemed by the music and performances and a great time capsule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Waltz -- An Absolute Classic!","review":"By far, this is one of the best rock'n'roll movies ever made. Come on it's The Band! This film reminds me of every reason I love rock'n'roll so much! My best friend even modeled his hair after Rick Danko! There are tons of guest apperances, and memorable moments. There are also many hysterical quotes and one liners, that will leave you on the floor laughing. This is the type of film you watch with a few buddies and a few 12 packs of Strohs. Always a great time watching this amazing film. You'll never forget the first time you see this film, so why not make it soon? Absolutely of its time and timeless. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just adding to","review":"There's enough reviews of this Classic. I'm 50+ and showed my copy of this DVD to my teenage kids last Thanksgiving. They were enthralled!

That about says it all I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Waltz","review":"Excellent \\"rockumentary\\". Many do not realize the impact The Band had on several song writers and musicians. We've watched this numerous times. The trailers/behind the scene talk are also very interesting.

I have seen it well over 100 times and it is still as fresh as when I first saw it in 1978. Although it is over 25 years old and much of the music is almost 40 years old it still sounds great. Sorsese pioneer documentaries with this. The interviews are still funny and sad. The performances are on target. To really get a whole view of The Band after watching this, get Levon Helm's \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\". Too bad they lost Richard Manuel and Rick Danko-both great musicians. Show this to your kids or grand kids to let them see great music before it was a commercial product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get The Hype","review":"This is a dreary and depressing DVD. I have tried to watch it several times with an open mind and I still can't understand why it has such a high rating. The performances are mostly too laid back. In my opinion, this is what was wrong with most music from that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"You better like this band.","review":"I read the reviews and bought this based on that it was a behind the scenes band interaction and then some of their concert. The bulk of it was their concert and songs - which I didn't care for and the movie was so boring, I got halfway through and stopped watching.

It really wasn't worth it to return it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Presentation overshadows music","review":"I must say I'm not a huge fan of The Band, but I like \\"Before the Flood\\". However, I was amazed at how poorly The Band played, and sang even worse, in this, their farewell concert. It is hard to believe they had played together for 17 years.Even the guests, such as Bob Dylan, seemed to use their worst voice. Only Eric Clapton was really any good, though Van Morrison was acceptable. Otherwise, fairly embarrassing musical performances. At the end, *everybody* is onstage singing \\"I Shall Be Released\\" - killing an otherwise nice song.Obviously Scorsese got all the good film people and photographers to work on the project, and it was well done. So well done that the presentation outshines the music.There are some nice extras, including multiple commentaries. Hard to recommend it unless you are truly a Band fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it, don't buy it","review":"This \\"movie\\" has taken on a life of its own and for what reason I do not know. It is average performances by everyone involved except for Richard Manuel, Garth Hudson, Levon Helm and Rick Danko. Those four were the backbone to Robbie Robertson's spineless behavior, then and now. I personally would not put another dime in Robertson's pocket and anyone who believes he is a songwriter, a singer or a guitar player hasn't a clue as to what any of those things are so buying music is a waste of your time. After all, it was Robbie who stuck Neil Diamond into the mix that night. That should have been clue #1..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...not GREAT","review":"Let's get something straight. The Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock movies are far superior concert films. This \\"greatest concert film of all time\\" hype was cooked up by the producers of this film and critics, the same bunch who are complicitus in fanning Michael Jackson's ego as the self-proclaimed \\"King of Pop\\".There are three great moments in the film:1)Neil Young2)Van Morrison3)The Band singing \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\"The rest of the film is a little too reverential for a band that had only two classic albums. For guys in their thirties, the band move and talk like weary seventy year olds. If they were so tired of \\"the road\\", why did they continue performing after this film was made. Get a real job like everyone else!The symphony additions and the cheesy trappings of the \\"Last Waltz\\" set up is a little too stuffy for a great bar band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Plodding","review":"Granted it is difficult to take old footage and successfully wrap it in today's DVD technology. I give the producers credit for having done a good job with what they had to work with. I found the performances enjoyable insofar as they were passionate and did a good job of capturing the era. I found the simplistic format of performance, simple interview, performance, simple interview.... to be boring. Some of the spoken audio was poorly captured and hard to understand. It succeeded as a documentary (documenting an event) like a single camera stuck on a tripod at the back of a church could be said to document a wedding. The performances are truly left to stand on their own as the filmmaking itself was lifeless. As another reviewer commented, this soundtrack would prove a decent music CD. It was fun seeing old footage of Robbie Robertson, Bob Dylan and the others. But to rate this 5 stars is a big stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"overblown","review":"The Band simply were not big enough or good enough to warrant a full length Scorcese movie. The movie is plodding and there is a certain smugness about them all. None of them can claim to be a singer and there's a dreary seventies feel about it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Window to 1970s Rock n Roll","review":"This is the best rock concert film made.The Band is to the US what The Beatles, The Who and The Rolling Stones were to England. Viewers in their teens and twenties will not only learn about some of the greats (like Van Morrison, Neil Young & Joni Mitchell) but will accidently learn a bit about the history of rock and roll.This was an amazing era. The 1976 concert was a who's who in rock and the top ticket price was $7.50. Concert goers got a Thanksgiving meal, ballroom dancing, and live music from 9 PM to 2 AM by some of the biggest names of that era.Neil Diamon looks like he wandered in from a realtor's convention. Neil Young looks like he wandered in from an AA meeting. Eric Clapton still played blues rock rather than pop rock. All look more interested in music than apperances -- fantastically refreshing compared to MTV. A must see concert that still sounds fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets!","review":"Every Baby Boomer should see this DVD. I've watched parts of it over and over.

Since then it was released as I recall on a 2 DVD box set that I gave to a friend of mine. When I saw that a new reissue had been done with extra features, I bought it. Upon the first viewing, there were two anomolies: one where the disc got \\"stuck\\" on a song and locked up my dvd player. The second one were some minor photographic type things, like seeing green bars on part of the picture, which only lasted a few seconds. This is not the first time that I have purchased a \\"new\\" item that had similar issues from Amazon. I don't know what the deal is, but the movie is so good, that I am repurchasing the dvd in hopes that it is 100%, and I gave the first purchase to a friend who also loves The Band and he didn't care about the anomolies.In all, this is one of the best documentary/concert movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure classic","review":"Saw a flyer for this movie being shown in public, decided to purchase it on Amazon instead for less than the cost of the ticket.

Glad we were able to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video Commemorates the End of An Age of Music","review":"One of my favorite movies, the Last Waltz is the perfect blend of live recorded concert footage and interviews with The Band. Scorsese pulls it all together masterfully and the soundtrack is a must have. Artists such as Dr. John, Muddy Waters, Neil Young, Van Morrison, The Staple Singers, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and others join The Band for their final concert tour with amazing live and pre-recorded sets performing The Band's core songlist as well as the other artists material.

I am not generally a journal or diary keeper, but I really felt that I wanted to record this moment in my life.

They are numbered and also show the Chapter number in which the word was first introduced. However, you must separate them from the pages yourself and I found the perforations to be insufficient. I spent many hours getting them separated and making the two little boxes from the pages provided. All in all I would recommend against these and suggest you get a standard set of pre-made Latin flash cards from Vis-Ed or Sparks Notes and just remove the cards you need based on the Wheelock vocabulary. I can't imagine paying this much, doing all the work, and on top of that laminating the cards for an additional expense. You'll have more time to study Latin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous Price","review":"The price for these cards is outrageous.Do a comparison to a similar product put out by Zondervan. They publish Greek and Hebrew cards for their textbooks. The Basics of Biblical Greek cards are $15.29 for 1,000 cards (their Old Testament Biblical Hebrew cards are $12.22 for 1,000 cards). They are also clearly printed on a card stock that is superior to those of the Vocabulary Cards for Wheelock's Latin and they come in a sturdy attractive box.What makes this comparison so odd is that the Wheelock Grammar itself is sold at such a reasonable price. I hope that the publishers will simply choose to copy the approach taken by Zondervan.

I have Greek vocab cards, Hebrew vocab cards and have seen vocab cards for most modern languages - all in card form. Amazing. But not Wheelock's Latin cards. They are in a book, not readily usable and a time consuming pain to manually tear out and put into usable form.

Several of the design features are very nice - very quiet, light, ergo friendly. The problem is the shave quality is not as good as I am used to and it PULLS HAIRS. I can live with the so-so shave quality but this hair pulling is ridiculous and something that I have never had with other shavers. It doesn't matter if it is fully charged or not and it doesn't matter how long I go between shaves - it always grabs some whiskers and yanks them out. A real eye opener.

I had an older Panasonic linear shaver before, and it served me well for quite a while. The newer version tends to shave more closely in a single pass and holds a charge for at least an entire week's worth of shaves. I like being able to wash it with soap and water and not have to deal with those expensive alcohol based cleaners like the Brauns use.My one complaint is that the newer shaver does not have a charging stand; you simply plug the cord into the bottom of the shaver to recharge. The base on the older version gave you a place to keep your shaver dry and made charging an automatic. On the other hand, having a simple cord is easier when you travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shaver for the price","review":"I had a Panasonic Linear shaver for several years with good results. I replaced it with the Pro-Curve because of the pivoting head and have experienced the same quality of shaves. Pros of the Pro-Curve: pivoting head, better shave than blades, ability to shave in the shower, good price. Cons of the Pro-Curve: doesn't have the induction battery charging, takes longer to get close shave than blades. Helpful hints: use a liquid pre-shave (the gooey kind works better than lectric-shave) or shave in the shower and use shower gel instead of shaving cream. As with all electrics, you will have to \\"chase around\\" a few stray hairs.

The Panasonic does provide a smoother shave with much less irritation--I have yet to experience red neck. I've been using it for nearly 30 days now and it does require multiple passes to get a clean shave, but it does a better job than rotaries I've used. It is loud, but that's not a problem for me. It also will not shave while plugged in, which bothers me a bit, but really isn't an issue because it charges fast and holds a charge for several weeks. The cleaning is really simple.

I'd used shavers in the past, but the shave never seemed to last past noon. So I've used blades for the last 15 years. I decided to gamble again, given I was about to purchase another 15 pack of blades for $40+ at Costco. So I figured it was worth a try since after about 6 months the costs would come out about the same as using a blade a week. I'm definitely satisfied, and not looking to go back to blades.

I've now had this razor for about a year (revised). I looked up online reviews and liked what I saw about this razor. I was not particularly interested in lots of extras, just a razor that would give a very close shave, quickly and quietly.This razor does the first two significantly better than the Norelco (even when it was new) and the noise factor, while not nearly as quiet as the Norelco, is acceptable to me. The razor head is a bit wider than I would like but it is not a major problem. The narrow trimmer seems silly, not sure why they didn't make it a bit wider, though it isn't a problem for me. The razor is comfortable in my rather large hand. Occasionally, I find that the charge won't last a full week, even with my fairly light beard.

I haven't had a single problem with the skin irritation and the shave is much closer than I ever remember going around in circles.

Torre Bermeja is the worst recording I've heard of the Albeniz classic. The booklet is a complete joke, containing absolutely no information whatsoever, track listings (composers, dates etc.). The 'rare photographs' touted on the front amount to one pretty standard pic of Segovia in middle age. I paid about 5 for this in a remainder sale at HMV, and that was about 4 too much. Do yourself a favour & buy The Art of Segovia, or Spanish Guitar Music by John Williams if you want an introduction to guitar transcriptions of classic spanish piano music like Albeniz.

On the plus side the new characters that were introduced were good, and actually had some depth (particularly the bad ones). In fact, it was a little strange to be more interested in the development of these characters than those associated with the main characters, and it was these minor characters that made the book more interesting. For example, I felt that Dietrich, the German general who eventually takes over the army of the Third Reich, is actually a better character than Rommel.In contrast, I found several of Rommel's reactions to the horrors of the Nazi's to be a bit much, and out of the character of the time.The only real problem is that it did move very fast at times. Turn your back for a second, and the US army is in Berlin. Further, the end was just a little unbelievable and a bit unsatifying.Still, I would recommend this book as a fun read that certainly gives an answer to at least one \\"What If?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.","review":"I enjoy a good piece of military alt-hist, which this, unfortunately, is not.

The book reads like an Arnold movie, with the hero saving the day, and the noble bad guy switches sides, and the good guys win in the end. This second part is no different. It's pretty much just the same story as the first novel, wrapped up in a different package.

The first are the personal essays that are autobiographical and often very funny, and the second are the literary essays that are rather dark and certainly sobering. In these stories Epstein manages to combine elements of both the funny and the dark in a way that resembles Chekhov, without, obviously, rising quite to that level. He does, however, rise well above the many recent American short stories that seem to present little more than puzzling ephipanies. Instead he describes, with considerable respect, characters from ordinary bourgeois life in Chicago, and he actually tells stories about their lives.

The whole point is, put yourself in their position...imagine what the 2 people were thinking for the whole time being stranded in the middle of the ocean. Simple as that. It was apparently based on a true story... so, that's all I have to say. Its scary, but not so much jump-out-of-your-seat. Just imagine you are them...how would you feel? Scared? Or would you simply complain about novice-made films you've seen the night before at your hotel room while floating around in desolation as great potential shark-bait?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Effectively chilling","review":"If you liked Blair Witch Project and My Dinner with Andre, you'll probably like Open Water. Not that you will 'enjoy' this movie; it's not supposed to be a pleasant experience for the audience. But it's definitely chilling. I personally think that low budget (i.e., amateur) films achieve this sort of thing better than slick, big budget movies, which typically aren't intimate enough. Open Water isn't Jaws, but so what? Do all movies have to be grand in scale and scope?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeveloped","review":"Dragging, disconnected and sadly underdeveloped. From a technical standpoint, it was an interesting challenge but beyond that, nothing to get excited about. Better suited to a \\"Shark Week\\" offering, it would have been more compelling to focus on the events as they transpired without any attempt to build a story around them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I first bought the DVD, the cover said based on true events. The only thing that was true about it was that theywere left behind. All the rest was fictional, since there was no way of finding out what actually happened in the water. Plus, I think the nudity was gratuitous. There was absolutely no reason for it whatsoever. It didn't add to the story. Just to see them laying in bed naked??? Give me a break! I thinkit was just thrown in hoping the movie will sell better. I thought it was exciting in parts but then realized that it was all fictionalized. I expected more from a story that was supposedly based on 'actual events' the only 'actual' thing was that they were left behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"open slauter","review":"this movie was pathetic. my best friend's mom reccomended it and we gave it a shot.IT STUNK!!!! basicly, all it is is two people floating around talking.there is no suspense.the acting is horrendous.and the ending was stupid and disturbing.when they see this big tanker ship,why dont they swim to it. overall, this movie is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"I thought this movie was really boring and it was shot poorly. My mother, who loves Jaws and movies of the like, really disliked this movie as well. Save your money, don't buy or rent. Thank god it was only a rental for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Water.......","review":"Although I enjoyed this movie, I gave it a 2 star rating only because I've seen much better movies that I've given 3 star ratings. I know this was a cheaply made and filmed movie and can get boring at times, however I can't say that this was a waste of time. I love shark movies and NO, you can not even begin to compare this movie to Jaws... but I enjoyed the fact that this movie keeps you guessing as to what will happen to this couple who get left behind in shark infested waters by a tour boat while they were going scuba diving. I found the ending quite sad.....with him dying and she ended up giving in and taking her own life rather than be eaten by sharks. Although not a non stop suspense film, it was worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"BASICALLY, 2 DIVERS LEFT AT SEA","review":"I'm sure this is every diver's fear, to be taken out to sea and left behind. This is an indie film effort that is short on story, short on plot, and not all that scary. There are some tense moments with the sharks, but there is nothing else going on. The view is dumped in the water with the divers and that's all that happens. There is anger, denial, and acceptance. And ought to tell you all you need to know about the ending of this movie.Look for something with greater length and plot if you're looking for scares. You can get the same sense of discomfort from Discovery Channel.The extras were pretty dull and ho hum. They should have cut a lot more out and added a story. Not recommended, even for hardcore horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the price to rent this movie.","review":"A friend bought this movie based on the media hype surrounding this movie. 15.00 at Wally World what the heck....WRONG!!!!!Two people stranded in the middle of the Ocean....sounds like a good plot....plus it's based on a \\"True Story\\".Well guess what, the stranded part is the only true part. This is truly a boring movie. Very little plot, and the most exciting part was when the lady showed a little skin in the beginning.4 Adults watched this movie and wondered why we wasted our time waiting for the good part. It never came. Please, do not even think about buying this unless you are a fan of plot-less movies with sorry endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness for fast-forward!","review":"When this film was first released theatrically, most of the reviews raved about \\"suspense\\". I personally found it dull and absurd. I wasn't expecting \\"Jaws\\" but I wasn't expecting this dreck (and beleive you me, I have sat through some real stinkers!). I fast forwarded through much of the movie and was glad that it was a free rental (Blockbuster Rewards). I would give this movie ZERO stars, but will graciously give it one because of the nude scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could easily happen again","review":"This movie is based on a true story. There are many reputable dive companies, but there are also many \\"fly-by-night\\" ones. The events depicted in this movie have happened and to a less dramatic extent, still happen today. That aside, let's get to the movie. It was as much about relationships and handling stress on a relationship as it was about being left behind, alone in the open ocean. The movie was mostly shot with handheld cameras to have a more \\"realistic\\" feel. So, if you don't like this style of filming, it will be a long movie for you. There also wasn't much action and not constant tension. It was a drama. Overall, it was a pretty good movie. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it didn't end the way that I expected. The ending action was logical, but came as a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"total waste of time and money","review":"I would not even waste your money on a rental. Total waste of time. I would have been more entertained pulling weeds in my lawn. If anyone wants my copy, I will send it to you for free. You pay the postage and you can have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be in the $3.99 bin at your local car wash...","review":"Actually that would be giving this movie more honor than it deserves. There's no story, no plot, and the soundtrack sucks. (Irrelevant pop songs would make a better soundtrack.) It is compared to \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" but there is some development of the story and the characters, and one of the best scores from James Horner. This one is like a paragraph written by a first-grader, except the material might be a bit disturbing for them. \\"Two people went on a vacation. They went scuba diving. They were left behind. They died.\\"When I saw the that the sequel was released, I showed it too my mother and we had a good hearty laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhm . . . no!","review":"A husband and wife team are left behind after deep sea diving in shark infested waters.The film offers a couple thrills, but that's about it. Lots of floating around. Either fast forward one hour or pass on this one--seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worste movies I have ever seen","review":"The movie is very bad. There is no entertainment in the movie. Moreover it was not worth watching. It is very short. Has one nude scene that is totaly unnecessary. The story was obvious that a couple goes to scuba dive and then get lost. After a while they get attacked by sharks and then die. If you talk about Jaws, or Deep blue sea, then those are good movies, this one was absolutely horrible movie. There was even a part where the screen was dark for a while. I don't know if it was the teaters fault or the movie was like that. If it was the movie, it is what I believe in, then it was horrible. I would not suggest to watch this movie, moreover buying the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time","review":"have been diving for a while and expected that this movie would make me feel uncomfortable diving again... but instead it made me uncomfortable thinking of the hype this movie got... truly boring and without a plot (other than to lure people in shelling money out for the film)I'd say it is almost as bad as Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm ticked, and want my 2 hours back!","review":"Not prone to writing movie reviews, but in this case I felt a need to vent a bit. THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I've ever seen (a title previously held by Blair Witch Project). I honestly was so mad at myself for wasting a couple of hours on this. I have to admit I was curious how anyone could make a movie about 2 people left out in the ocean. Well now I know, put 2 people in the ocean and film it for one and a half hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"drowning in boredom","review":"Nope - this movie didn't work for me. Clearly a cheapie indie flick, there is a cast of two and most of the shown set is in the water. The director tries to build the suspence by raising the volume of the soundtrack at key moments but it comes across as contrived.Truly, wasn't frightened at all and in fact drowing in boredom. If you want a suspence flick, you can surely do better elsewehere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Blue Sea was much better","review":"potentiol...this movie had probably the most out of any movie this year...but it failed, in my eyes, miserably! this is supposed to be a shark movie but we are only encountered by a couple of scenes with a couple of sharks...disappointed. I was so eager to see this movie and i get it home and i get into it and my hopes are high by the time the couple are left in the sea...but im so angry that there are so few shark scenes in this movie! and the ending just killed it for me! I understand it but..i dont like it. It could have been developed more and stretched out and this movie could have been great! I do, however, give massive credit to the scenes shot at night in the thunder storm. You see lightening flashing and you hear voice overs of the characters panting and saying something rubbed up against their leg and its just a great scene and i loved it. thats the only reason this gets 2 stars from me...otherwise...this is a 1 star, easily forgettable, cheap movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen!","review":"All I can say about this movie is that I find it interesting that the movie bigwigs are letting the mentally retarded direct movies and write dialogue.Everyone involved in the making of this orgy of stupidity should be taken out and beaten with really hard sticks then tied up and forced to eat ratmeat.Dull,intellectually empty,and with an unconvincing cornball ending that will make you want to puke.I totally regret that the real actors were not actually eaten by sharks.A better punishment would be to force them to watch this movie repeatedly.If you are so stupid that you actually buy,or even rent,this movie,I hope you also are eaten by sharks,or at least maimed by hungry gorillas!DON'T DO IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood and CGI TAKE NOTICE","review":"Tired of boring stories from mainstream Hollywood with computer graphics interface-to wow you into numbness? This movie will be sure to scare, especially if you scuba dive, snorkel, sport dive or just have a healthy paranoia of sharks. After viewing, be sure to check out the bonus doco, of JUST HOW THIS FILM WAS MADE. It will give hope to just about any filmaker or novice. So, if you are weary of computer backdrops and weak storylines (Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, comes to mind) buy up a DVD and lend it to your friends. Hollywood, take notice. A good story (especially a true one like this) can tumble big budget yawns, and computer desktop artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst moview ever made","review":"Poor acting, writing, editing and especally directing make for one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The director had no idea what he wanted to do with what could have been a good movie. Very low budget and looked rushed. Something a college student might have made. Think Blair Whitch meets Jaws III and you have a good idea what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under no circumstances should you watch this movie","review":"Many reviews involve a plot synopsis of the movie. I will give you something of an unorthodox one. Rather than tell you the movie's premise, I will tell you what you can expect out of the movie.Two badly-acted people bobbing in the ocean for an hour and a half. Nothing happens. Occasionally there are sharks.There is nothing scary, nothing tense, nothing worth watching. it's jsut watching two very badly acted people bob in the water. it is possibly the most boring film you will ever see, as a grand total of nothing happens in the course of the movie.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"really really REALLY bad","review":"i find myself asking why this movie was even a thought in someone's head. i understand that it was low-budget, but it was also low-fun. i've seen better movies made from even lower-budgests.the basic idea was good, but it lacked, um....everything. it's about a couple who take a rushed vacation and end up scubba diving. there is a miscount on the boat that they are on, and they are stranded at sea. the rest of the movie is about how the couple float around in the ocean with sharks circling them. will they live or die?the movie lacks events. you only see a shark face once and a few shots of it's fins. the movie would be a lot better if something other than floating would happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"I thought this movie sucked ass because it didnt have a good ending. It left a empty feeling in your stomach after you watch it. I mostly didn't like it because of the ending, no happy ending. They didnt get saved.. nothing. I mean, I know its based on a true story but still. This movie sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"shark movie?","review":"What the movie had verry litle to do with sharks only a few scences had some sharks but they only lasted 2 minutes the rest was people in the water talking about how they made a mistake coming on this boat from the comercials i was thinking how could they make a movie about people stranded in the sea it sounded like a short films you know the ones that last like thirty minutes i was wondering it dosnt sound verry action packed but i still got it and it was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Thinking back on it now, I can't even begin to fathom why I sat through this horrible excuse for a movie. The plot sucks, the characters are laughable (not to mention extremely annoying) and, well it's just plain......boring. So here it is, in a nutshell:1. Overworked couple decides to go to a tropical vacation spot.2. Overworked couple arrive at said tropical vaction spot and decide to go scuba diving.3. Overworked couple go diving, are miscounted by the diving guide and spend the next hour floating in the middle of the ocean, bickering and getting picked at by various sea creatures.4. After getting picked at for a while, the overworked couple dies. He gets eaten and she drowns herself.So there you have it folks, one of the worst films ever, reduced down to four (yes four) easy to follow steps. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring!","review":"This film is basically just 2 people having a domestic in the middle of the ocean. There is absolutely no suspense as it's pretty obvious what's going to happen - I just wish the sharks had finished them off a lot sooner.Also from a scuba diver's perspective, I found there were a lot of niggly mistakes that soon became very irritating.A poorly made film - don't waste your time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this should not be called a movie","review":"this is worst movie i have ever seen. worst acting ever but i guess you dont need acting skills just boobing in water.i wish i could give this a total 0 stars that how bad this is. i wont call this a movie. sont waste money or time. best acting was the sharks i was rooting for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks!","review":"The first twenty minutes of this film reminded me of a poorly made \\"B\\" movie, and then it's all downhill from there. There is nothing good that I can say about this movie except that it does finally end, after sharks eat both the stars of the movie. I'm just glad that I didn't spend $10.00 to see it while it was in theatre release, that would have pissed me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash...just trash.","review":"I don't recall who said that this was better than Jaws, but they were wrong. I watched it and was ashamed that I had spent 2.99 on the rental fee, because this is not worth a penny. Jaws is great cinema. This doesn't qualify as a film or even a movie as far as I'm concerned. Between terrible writing, horrendous acting and pointless nudity, this film is just offensive. Don't waste your time here. Just back away, because any sensible person would wish he or she did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse movie ever!","review":"The people that compared it to Jaws was deeply wrong. This was the most horrable movie ever. I would not recommend anyone to buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of potential here","review":"Unfortunately,not much of it is tapped. I don't want to say the film is terrible; it does have its moments. But as a whole, I'm afraid a number of others are right; it DOES get boring and/or disjointed in spots, and after a while, you begin to stop caring. That any charter could be THAT incompetent is implausible. Still, despite its flaws, you do find yourself wanting to find out how things end up. The ending is definitely a bit of a twist. BUt it's not the kind of film you'd ever watch again, simply because it's not that good. Bottom line: the acting is horrible, and that what ultimately kills this. The little tantrums, the calm resolution, the \\"maybe maybe not\\" scene. all were extremely amateurish and sometimes almost laughable. If you want to see this, rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was...I have no idea","review":"When I first saw this movie I was in shock of it and how things like this could happen. I really hate this movie and everything about it. I know many people who love it and I didnt even buy this movie for me, I bought it for my sister because she loves it. I cant stand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you think!","review":"This movie is the ultimate proof that big budgets, expertise and writers can't top the real thing. I was shocked to read the critical reviews on this film. I didn't know anyone was more critical than me, but these winers are just way off!The movie is filmed so well, few would guess it was made by a couple and their own digital equipment. The acting is better than most of the cheesy big-names we're usually forced to settle with. Watching this movie truly feels like you are there--but thankfully, you're not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you smell that. * Its this stinky movie","review":"You have got to be kidding! This is the worst movie ever, if someone ever ask me to watch this again, I'm going to punch them.Who ever gave this movie more than three stars, you either did not watch this movie, you're a cast member, or you were paid for a good review.Things I'd rather do with my time than watch this movie again&#9679; Eat yellow snow&#9679; chew a piece of cow manure&#9679; kiss Monica Lewinsky after what she did to Bill ClintonThis movie spent more money for advertisement than it did to make it.I must extend my apologies to the actors who got caught up in such a horrible movie. I hope it doesn't ruin your acting career or you personal career .My rating, five very smelly socks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was horrible","review":"This movie had not plot and no action to it.it was the same scene throughout the entire 79 minutes then to add insult to injury the ending was really bad they both end up dying the her boyfrind from a shark bite on the lake and her from just going under water and they go a scene on shore where some one cuts open a shark and finds a camera-this movies is definatley the worst by far and not worth renting or buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!","review":"What can i say apart from that this film has about as much entertainment in it as watching paint dry! 3/4 of the movie is watching two people doggy paddle in the ocean bickering at one another \\"not very well\\", with a shark every 10 mins making a 5 second appearence then going away.The ending sums the film up and that is all you can take from this movie, it does end! Thank god. After watching it you will think \\"is that it???\\" and im affraid it is.This film is simply terrible and i feel sorry for anyone who has purchased this, or for that matter even rented it!!! DONT GET THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was very disappointing given the reviews","review":"All of the great reviews this movie received raised my expectations. However, I have to tell you that it really never lived up to anything the critics said. Oh, there was some quirky photography, and there were sharks. And I am willing to go along with the progression of the couple in the water as they struggled for survival, but it never ever got to the level of fear the reviews led me to believe was there.Worse yet, the end of the movie is just a botch. I will not spoil anything, but I would be surprised if you like it. The movie is less than 90 minutes and it still loses its way in the middle, but right before the end it seemed to be gearing up for a big finish. Instead, it just gives up. Awful.There is a lot of talent that went into this low budget film and I respect that, but this was a huge disappointment for me.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow..................... but good.","review":"I have to say this wasn't the best shark movie ever..... It was very slow....... Besides that...... It was good! It wasn't as good as Shark Zone or JAWS or any of those Shark movies......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average movie watcher","review":"My wife & I expected a lot more - perhaps \\"entertainment\\". After 80 minutes it didn't deliver, poor music, shots to make you dizzy (I had to look away often), and just a real let down of an ending. Afterwards a movie should make you feel like you enjoyed something, this made me feel like I wasted my time. All the rave reviews on the box! I don't feel the movie lived up to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Water","review":"I wish I had read the reviews here instead of going by the media hype and spending good money on it. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. Another that goes in the \\"trade it back in\\" stack. Save your money. The one thing I have learned from this movie is to rent first before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its The Blair Witch Project....in the water.","review":"Two scuba divers get left in the ocean and float along hoping that sharks don't eat them. Wow...thrilling. Nothing happens in this move...the plot is paper thin and the acting is even worse. Not to mention the sea sick feeling you get from the $100 camera that they strapped to a raft to film this piece of garbage. Don't waste your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy was I scared...of how bad it was","review":"First off, the screenplay is weak, if not downright nonexistent. The cinematography and camera work of the pseudo-home camera variety was annoying at best, insufferably nauseating at worst. Was it scary? If you consider two marginal actors with no depth and no screenplay to work with floating around in the middle of the ocean being chased by sharks to be scary, then yes. If you have half a brain, then no.Perhaps the only saving grace is that Blanchard Ryan is a hot number and makes viewing this drivel for the wasted 81 minutes somewhat tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the WORST Movie I've EVER seen","review":"OK - maybe the Blair Witch project got away with this attempt at movie making, but please... enough is enough. This camcorder production may explain the poor cinematography but what excuse do they have for the 90 minutes of the movie that should have ended in 20 minutes? Watching two heads bob in and out of the water and listening to the grumbling dialog between the two characters in this movie for almost 90 minutes was more than I could tolerate. The promotion and advertisement for this movie was VERY misleading, which REALLY pisses me off. I can't get my money back but I sure can help others from making the same mistake. I went to the theater to see this movie. The best part of going to see this movie was listening to the complaints of the audience as they were leaving the theatre. DON'T spend your money - its now on TV, and I still don't recommend watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"I taped and watched this movie because I used to dive and thought it might be interesting.It's not.Bad filming,bad acting and a boring movie.Even the bedroom scene is lame.They talked about getting married while walking the beach but back it the bedroom she won't make love because she's too stressed . With your fiance on the first night of your vacation and you're too stressed and shut him off.?? Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!","review":"Apparently this movie is based on true events of a husband and wife who get left behind on a scuba diving trip, and are stuck in the ocean by themselves.This movie reminded me a lot of The Blair Witch Project, in the way that it was filmed (looked kind of like a home movie) and also because the majority of the movie was just the two people in the ocean screaming, complaining, crying, and comforting each other and that the ending was very abrupt. The movie did have some semi-intense scenes, but overall, it wasn't even that scary or susupenseful. This movie wasn't even worth the matinee price."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a low budget indie movie, this delivers! Excellent!","review":"This was a very well done film, given the low budget constraints and minimal parties involved in both production and acting. Kentis and Lau pulled it off perfectly, especially given the unbelievably horrific predicament the two main characters were in. So what if most of the scenes involve the two main characters having a dialogue while treading water. What do you expect from a low budget indie? They got the most mileage they could out of their resources, and yet retained believability and fear via a gamut of human emotions displayed in the main characters. 'It's the fear stupid'... and the existential mind numbing horror of their unique situation drove home the feelings of despair and angst generated in the viewer who empathized with them. The movie builds up a crescendo until the end, where what you may think happens does not. 4 and a half stars out of 5!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring","review":"Feels like a low budget film. Not much imagination or creativity in making it. I can see this really happening, but it's not something I would make a movie about. Maybe a documentary. Feels very much like Blair Witch Project, except a lot slower and more boring. I guess I've seen worse, but not too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"OPEN AND SHUT WATER","review":"I couldn\`t vote with less than one star!Well this was so gripping that I fast forwarded the movie until predictibly the sharks got them. You cannot even put it on the same shelf as a film like \`Jaws\`The acting is so amateurish, the script too boringly dull, the movie is painful to watch, the soundtrack was atrocious, the picture quality cheap because of digital video.This is a contender for an Ed Wood award as one of the worst movies.By the end I wanted to go feed the sharks that got them and say \\"There\`s a good shark have a fish\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"I saw this movie on TV and I thought it was really stupid.

It didn't.This movie (a-la-BLAIR WITCH PROJECT-style-film making) offers no real fear or scares in the water (with the small exception of the lightning storm in the middle of the night). Between the couple's constant bickering and the beautiful sunny day all around them, it leaves very little to the imagination in creating the idea of what to be afraid of in the open water.One little piece of JAWS-related homage I will offer that I have not seen mentioned by other reviewers; in the scene where the boat master pulls out the couple's identity cards from the their pack, the fulls names on the cards are Susan WATKINS and Daniel KITNER. Watkins and Kitner are the last names of the first two characters attacked and killed in JAWS, both book and movie.Am I the only one who noticed that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"you can not acually think that they can get away with this right?","review":"It was so stupid.They used more than one kind of shark.I love sharks I have studied them and even my little brother and sister who know absolutly nothing about sharks could tell that they used bronze whalers when the camera showed on top of the water and bull sharks in other parts of the movie. you did not get to see them being eaten by the sharks nor did it make any sence why the man counting did not reconize the man and the woman that almost did not go in the water.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IT IS A RIP OFF!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz..........................","review":"WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND OF 5TH RATE JAWS 3D?!?!?!?!?HOW LAME CAN A MOVIE GET?!?!?!?!?!?OF ALL OF THE DULLARDS THAT WAS EVEN REMOTELY SCARED IM SURE 99.99999999999999% WERE WOMEN(WOMEN SQUEAL AT A BUGS SHADOW SO THAT EXPLAINS IT)sorry for the cap's but i cant get past the FACT that no one got hurt in SHARK INFESTED WATERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!so whats so scary about this movie?!?!?!?!?!?!?why are critics falling over themselves is a rush to be the 1st to praise this garbage?!?!?!?!?!?!?!and why is this rated R?!?!?!?!?!?OH,THATS RIGHT.BECAUSE OF FOUL LANGUAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!if the roughest part of a''horror''movie is its language........then women should never leave the house.why are women so damned fragile and easy to scare?!?!?!?!?!?they probably hid under their seats if they went to see shrek..........LMMFAO@easily scared women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two IDIOTS floating in the ocean...","review":"For the love of God.

SO AS SOMEONE ELSE COMMENTED, YOU HUNG ON TO THEM FOR NOTHIN' CAUSE THEY JUST ARE KILLED, THEY PROBABLY GOT ATE BEFORE THE BOAT EVEN TOOK OFF. HOW LAME TO SAY \\"BASED ON TRUE EVENTS\\" COME ON! I WANTED, NO NEEDED TO SEE THAT SCUBA COMPANY GO DOWN A FEW MILLION OR SO AND CLOSE DOWN AT LEAST!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond all belief.","review":"I have seen very few movies in my life that did not have at least some value, probably less than you can count on one hand. I am not hard to please in that respect. This movie might top them all for no value.About 95% of the movie involves a husband and wife left several miles offshore from a diving expedition. The other 5% is them loading their car for their vacation and the trip out for the dive. There is no scenery except, as the movie title shows, open water. During their few hours in the water, they go through all the emotions from fear, anger, regret, joy, etc. They blame each other for their predicament and fight and then they remember that they love each other. Then it ends. If a one-and-a-half hour soap opera with only two characters, no scenery and a bad ending appeals to you, get this movie. If not, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"to all the idiots in these reviews who expected jaws in cgi, get real. you're totally missing the point of this film, mainly that a movie does not have to be about special effects and brad pitt to be successful at unnerving its audience. this movie proves that the effective pacing of desperation of everyday folks being trapped in extraordinary circumstances can make for believable and often terrifying watching. when people expected a shark biting off a limb or gorging on one of the actors in gory detail, what can you say of people's willingness to be patient and appreciate quality film making? in my opinion, it is more difficult to pin this feeling of impending doom down without special effects than with them. then again, i'm preaching to morons who probably thought that the ring was a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to rate","review":"I found this movie interesting. I can't call it entertaining. It's not scary. I guess it could be classified suspenseful. But the suspense wasn't enough to carry the film. Was ready to give this film a 1, but decided that it was typical of a low budget, independent film and has a certain strange appeal. It kept reminding me of those \\"I Shouldn't be Alive\\" shows on Discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"This movie is so quiet. There is so little overt action and yet there is more to frighten and make you sad than any movie I can remember. The circumstances around which the couple is left at sea are horrifying in how they unfold. Didn't anyone miss them? I guess not. No one knew them so no one knew they were not on board on the return trip. But the real fear and sadness is when they're alone. And the fear of the sharks, while vivid, wasn't even the scariest thing. The worst thing was knowing they knew no one was coming back for them. They could do nothing to save themselves. I was hypnotized by this movie. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing movie - rent it maybe, don't buy it","review":"Here was a film that hyped enough to get initial sales but no word of mouth follow-up ... I thought I would love this movie and I was VERY disappointed. The movie is clever and fairly well made for the independent genre, but the ending SUCKED!spoiler alert:If you're a Stephen King-type fan that likes to see all the stars die in a movie, you'll like this film. But the stupid idiots GIVE UP ... gee, good film about the ability of people to FAIL under extreme pressure. If I wanted to see that on my TV screen, I'd forget the movie and just watch the local and national news. It is what I'd show my kids NOT to do in life.One nude scene that little to nothing to do with anything, other than a draw for the teenage male ... it's about \\"coitus interruptus\\" and the plot makes you feel the same way ...The only people who like this film may use it as a style of learning how to shoot digital movies ... as far as substance goes, waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"A couple is stranded in the ocean by an inept scuba tour and find themselves harassed by sharks and jellyfish. This goes on for about 90 minutes, and there is very little in the form of a storyline, and even less substantive dialogue. I mean, there isn't much your characters can discuss when they're bobbing in the open water for 12 hours. But the intensity picks up when one of them discovers some hard candy in her dive vest. Hopefully, you won't be in at the snack bar during this monumental moment.My advice is to skip this one and rent Jaws instead, even if you've seen it a dozen times. Your 13th viewing of Jaws will still be better than this movie. But if you do decide to see this one, then bring along something for seasickness, because the camera is constantly bobbing up and down with the actors. Aside from nausea, there was nothing that I got from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAIR WITCH Shell Game","review":"Going into this movie, I thought it was going to be about two self-involved yuppies who are taught by Nature what's really important in Life after they're accidentally left out to sea.But it wasn't. Unfortunately, it wasn't anything really that good either. This couple goes through the stages of disbelief, dismay, turning on each other, desperately holding onto to each other, struggling to survive--all that stuff, but with no major or interesting revelations.The film had a cheap camcorder look to it, so I was thinking (because of its critical praise) I would something special through the writing or acting. But no. Another BLAIR WITCH shell game.The ending made me feel like I had just wasted however many minutes I'd put into this movie.The wife looked great naked though."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!","review":"Okay, people, I have a quick story to tell...My significant other came in with this movie, we popped some popcorn and poured ourselves a few drinks to go along with it. My daughters came upstairs and we thought, what the heck, let's make it a family movie night. Within the first thirty minutes of watching this, I seriously thought it was a joke. We all burst into laughter and waited for something that was going to make us, \\"jump out of our skin.\\" As the credits rolled up at the end, I was stunned. More so, in disbelief. This was the worst movie I had seen throughout my entire thirty-seven years of living. The one star is for effort, which there was very little. The reviews and cover is designed to hype you up and make you think this movie is the bomb. Trust me, it's not. Save your money, and save the popcorn and drinks for a movie that's worth it.
