How evil can one old man be? What deceit can lurk in the hearts of those who are supposed to love us? The dangers of rape, abortion, worker's rights, and organized crime all play a role in this wonderful show.You do miss a lot from the original series that gets shown to you in flashbacks. I did not see the original, and I do not speak Spanish well at all, but I could tell the subtitles weren't perfect. Despite the faults, I really enjoyed this program and recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE GRIPS AND COMPANY","review":"I purchased child grips from US Glove Inc. and the finger holes are massive on me, an adult. When I contacted them about returns/exchanges, they informed me I must purchase a \\"$10 exchange credit\\" in order to exchange them or pay a 15% restocking fee. This is ridiculous, especially for grips that are so poorly designed they would NEVER fit any child correctly. What a waste of money! I will have to throw these grips away because I am not going to keep paying them to correct their own problem. I measured my daughters hand to the millimeter and the length is fine but no child with this size palm has this big of fingers! This is their error, not mine but they do not accept responsibility for it. Terrible customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instructions and examples, but very few pages","review":"I was surprised at how much they packed into this book. The examples, steps and instructions are very well done, but I have another series of how-to-draw books, one of which is for trees, and it has more than twice the pages in it with the same amount of information on each page. The author is a very talented artist, but I wish the book were twice as thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mockery of real jonny quest","review":"When thinking jonny quest one things of great animation, quality work, story's that make sense.This re-incarnation of Jonny Quest has none of these things. The cgi art is terrible and painful to watch. The 2d work was no better. The dvd it's self it fine but the contents should be burned for making such a mockery of a good thing. The story lines were nothing like anything that would have appeared in real jonny quest.I was surprised at all the positive reviews for this show. I urge everyone to watch the real jonny quest (1964) and then tell me that this is still a good show.jonny quest fans have been writing this show of for ages and it will continue to happen because it's a bad show. It follows nothing about the original and should not be jonny quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cartoon!

I enjoyed the shows, especially since they were more fantastic than the original, but I would not say it has replaced the original series in my mind as the real Jonny Quest. For me I probably would rate this a four star, but my son (who is about the age now I was when I watched the orinal series) absolutely loved it. Based on my son's wide eyed response it earned a five star rating from me. The Jonny Quest torch has been passed to a new generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I used to watch \\"The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest\\" on Cartoon Network when it was still airing the show. The series was one of the best on the network. I'm happy to have found this compilation from Season 1 and introduce this series to my kids. I am hoping Hanna Barbera will release the succeeding seasons. I will definitely purchase them. Great product, came as described by seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show from the good ol' days","review":"I remember watching this show every week when I was a kid. Now I see that it's a modern version of all those really old shows (like the original Jonny Quest, Scooby-Doo, etc.). The art is kind of dated but still much newer than the old shows I noted, which I really like because it's kind of its own art style. The stories are very similar to the original Jonny Quest so if you're a fan of that it's a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"For reference: I'm 5'2\\", in between an A and B cup size and about 110lbThis set fit me perfectly, I was nervous about it fitting right because I tend to be on the smaller side.

I am 5'9 and 135 lbs, normally a size 4 to 6 with an average bust size. The top was completely unflattering as it smashed down what I do have to make me look flat. Maybe fake boobs would look better in it, as they are \\"unsmashable.\\" I had no trouble figuring out how to put it on, and the material seemed fine for the purpose. The bottoms fit a little better, and look sexy, but the straps do dig in a little if you have any tummy at all. A total waste of $17 for this in my opinion.

This book is a step up from the last novel, Violence of Action. No offense to the co-author, Mr. DaFalice, but I will always miss Mr. Weisman's touch to the novels. This one has captured what the previous novels had before VOA. Good to see the old stories are back. Please keep writing them CDR Marcinko. I'll keep buying them. One jab at the story though. The climax lacked that certain flair that used to be there. The bad guys just didn't get that extra kick in the pants that I was used to reading in previous novels. Still a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one in the series...comes right at ya!","review":"Having read Jim DeFelice's novel 'Havana Strike', I was prepared somewhat for this new writing combo. Overall I found it very entertaining and am glad the story is going back to the style of the earlier works Marcinko did with Weisman. The ending seemed kind of mellow, compared with how Marcinko wraps things up, and was glad to see the 'domestic terrorist' angle given in 'Violence of Action' come into play here.I am sure the next novel will be even better once this new duo get things together."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Rogue Warrior?","review":"I am a fan of most action genres and the early Marcinko stuff was great. This book, however, was so bad I couldn't even finish it. The characters were weak, the story poorly developed, and there was no evidence of any kind of research being done in this book. I live in Vegas and was dissapointed that Marcinko didn't even bother to verify glaring and rediculous errors that could have been verified on-line (even though a little on-site investigation would be better). It may be that this story line is just played out and should be put to rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macinko yet again delivers","review":"Marcinko is at it again with a fact/fiction return of life and conflict.

You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Dick.....","review":"My interest in the Marcinko books has tailed off since John Weisman quit writing the stories. Let's face it, Marcinko gives his \\"ghost writer\\" the basic outline of a story, then tells him to write the novel. \\"Violence of Action\\" was abysmal. \\"Vengeance\\" is slightly better, but the bloom is off the rose at this point in time with the Marcinko books. Just go back and read the first two or three novels in the series and see what I mean. I only hope Marcinko stops right now before everyone forgets how the first few books truly excited his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner","review":"It's time for Dick to just sit on the porch with his glass of Bombay Sapphire and stop publishing books. Vengeance was extremely tired and boring, no plot and extremely unbelievable. It takes more than glitzy locations and fancy guns to make a story. It also doesn't take a SEAL to make Homeland Security look bad. As Dick has admitted himself, an expert can cause minimum wage flunkies to fail every time. The book just never gets started.Which is a shame, since the original Rogue Warrior is on my list of all-time great books. Dick had a colorful and heroic past which most of us can only envy."},{"rating":"1","title":"??","review":"What in the he** was this about? Of course I knew what it was about. After reading through Dick's latest novel I found myself lost. All those detailed descriptions of battle, weapons, equipment and tactics are gone; and if you know the rogue his books always had excellant descrips. One minute your slogging through some boring narrative then someone ends up dead or some sort of chase commences.And the team? I miss the plank owners of the past series, excluding Violence of Action. To much time spent writing about superwomen Trace Dalgrehn(?). If you read his previous book: VOA, then you'll know of whom I speak. It's pathetic. I wish I would of waited for paperback- which I recommend.I really wanted to like this one. I really did. I'm a huge fan of the ol' Rogue. I hope that next time he writes on his own. Jim DeFelice need's to leave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Following the series our pleasantly plump former SEAL \\"collaborated\\" on with John Weisman, these latest forays into the fiction world are best left alone.

I was looking for something I could believe in, but found myself feeling like I was watching some action movie, without all the special effects.

Being a record collector of the early R & B and doo-wop records, I also noticed that the records that they show playing all have the wrong labels for the song represented.

This is mostly a matter of Freakwater's commanding vocals, intricate harmonies woven in almost hoarse, edgy voices of sleepless nights and smoke. It's a sound that works best for darkness, death, and dirges that make up the bulk of the songs here, but can also be surprisingly effective on upbeat numbers like Kentucky Home. When Freakwater sings, on Gone to Stay, \\"shovel, dirt and gravel/all his mother hears is the sound/of a little baby crying/somewhere in the ground,\\" the words stay with you for a good long while. Not a CD you'll want to play when you need cheering up, and the singing goes shrill (Hero/Heroine) at times.

Of course, Phil Lynott was masterful with his soulful baritone voice, and this recording is one of those where many of the live perfomances exceed the studio versions.

The interviews are the icing on the cake!!! A great insight on the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars only because...","review":"I like my live albums to be truly 'live', mistakes and all. Live and Dangerous is a great album for any hard-rock fan, but many parts are not live at all. The band did extensive dubbing in the studio, thus ruining the truly live feel of this album. Still, all of the major Lizzy hits are here;The band plays great, and the production is good enough so you actually do feel you are at a Lizzy concert at times. A must-have for fans of classic hard rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Sound","review":"My dad is a Huge Thin Lizzy fan, so I figured this would be a perfect gift. When we first started the dvd there was no sound we had to go into the extras and sound settings. once we figured out how to adjust the sound the quality was not that great, and we have a rockin sorround sound system? We figured it was because of the recording of the dvd? All and all it was fun to watch but it would have been so much better if there would have been a better recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb recordings of American classics.","review":"I thoroughly agree with all other reviewers (though I wish some would spell Copland's name right!) Morton Gould conducts with great verve and sensitivity. \\"Rodeo\\" is terrific and it also includes the seldom heard \\"Honky-Tonk Interlude\\" which is a delight in itself.The Grand Canyon Suite is a highlight with its marvellous orchestration and melodic richness. Although the score is influenced by a number of composers such as Dukas, Ravel, Respighi and even Richard Strauss, it nevertheless feels entirelyoriginal. \\"On the trail\\" is beautifully rhythmical,one can really feel the trottingof the donkeys, and the sound effects are pure joy. Note theee-ah-ing of the donkeys, so superbly part of the music. (somewhat reminescent of Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream overture.) The Cloudburst is a sonic triumph.This recording comes from 1957, but digitally remastered. Sound is demonstration quality. Still probably the best available, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"JF Texturizing spray","review":"Why is it that products that you find and love are ultimately discontinued? I was very glad to find John Frieda's Tousled Tresses on Amazon even though it was almost 3x what i used to pay for the product.

This, along with the threat of multiple attackers,are weaknesses of the Brazillian JJ system.None the less, Brazillian JJ should be studied because defending yourself on the ground is very important, and for this it is very good.There are many other styles out there though, and Mr. Tedeschi shows some great escapes, counters and take downs which Martial Artists with an open mind, and not restricted by a \\"my style is the best\\" philosophy should appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this book to learn \\"groundfighting\\"","review":"I must admit that this book is well produced.

If you want to learn real groundfighting buy a book written by someone who is a true expert like Royler Gracie or Rigan Machado. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the most effective and efficient art of groundfighting and is what people really want.Why do I know that this is what people really want? Because if it wasn't for the recent popularity in \\"groundfighting\\" started by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu experts such as the Gracies and the Machados this \\"Art of Groundfighting\\" book would never have been produced.

However, I was very disappointed when I got it because I expected it to discuss more about technical aspect of karate (like those of Morio Higaonna sensei). This book is more or less a family historical document. Despite having many pictures (again, usually not a technical one) this book gives you very little information about Goju ryu, Meibu kan, and even Dai Sensei himself (Mr. Meitoku Yagi).If you practice Goju ryu from this lineage, it could be a nice addition to your collection. Otherwise, not very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad Lady Macbeth!","review":"Lady Macbeth is a very bad character to begin with, but it doesn't help to be miscast in the role too.

Their duets in \\"Home\\" and \\"You Are Music\\" are particular favorites. \\"Dressing For the Night\\" and \\"Phantom Fugue\\" are paced faster than what is usually performed live on stage.

Instead, much of the half-hour program is devoted to Elizabethan architecture, London attractions of the time, and even clothing styles worn. This might be useful for someone interested solely in the historical context of Shakespeare's writing, but viewers will learn little about the playwright himself, or his world-changing plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Africa for the Africans","review":"Very well written & I read it from cover to cover - fuming. I've lived in East & South Africa for most of my life although I was exiled in England for 17 years. Never mind that Theroux has also lived in Africa, he is a miserable depressed man who has no empathy whatever of either the difficulties nor the pleasures of this continent. It's all very well for him to criticize the governance & the efficiency of this continent, I do so as well, but most African countries like Kenya, even more delightful Tanganyika, are dirt poor in resources & the plutocracy is tiny. All the Brits go on about the White farmers, the Happy Valley set & so on but the fact is that making a living here is a pretty hardscrabble life. The wonder is that almost all Africans are friendly & helpful, really some of the nicest people on Earth! Of course, it does help to approach them as human beings, be outgoing & speak a useful language like Swahili."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome!","review":"In some ways, this is the real conclusion the Marvel hoax that gave birth to the Sentry several years ago. Before reading this book, I'd recommend you reading not only New Avengers Vol. 1, but also the Marvel Knights TPB titled \\"The Sentry\\", written by Stan Lee. The story will make a lot more sense that way.Anyway, the art in this book is absolutely gorgeous - some of the best I've seen in a while - and Bendis is at his absolute best. I was rather skeptical approaching this book but it blew me away. In short, if you're looking for a great superhero team-up, you need look no further (though you should also check out Millar's Ultimates)."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Choppy storyline.

The author has very deep understanding of the vedic philosophy and the science of palmistry and yet it is presented with a very modern frame of mind. Illustrations are very clear and precise. Foreward by David Frawley - says a lot about the quality of the book. I love every page but my favorite is how each feature of the hand is explained in terms of the 3 levels of consciousness and sattva, rajas and tamas. It is only 104 pages, so no useless fluff either. Hard to put it down once you start reading it. Even if you are not interested in palmistry but are a spiritual seeker, you will not regret you bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"this book is a complete and total waste of time. this is one reason why palmistry can not seem to take hold the way astrolog has in our culture. it gives you no clue at all how to see what the patterns really mean. this is like bad fortune telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I Really enjoyed this book. It had everything; intrigue, love, ghosts. It is definitely one of my favorites. Also, I'm not really sure what book Natasha was reading. However, I'm sure it couldn't have been this one. Penelope (Pinkie) does not die, and the ghost is real. He appears repeatedly in the end and they even later explain who he was. So if you're looking for a good read this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but disappointed","review":"I bought this clock for my father who is a big John Deere buff.

Gave copies to my brother and nephew, both are musicians. Excellent book on the realities of making money in the music business. It's tough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I kept reading, hoping to be rewarded with something interesting at some point but was greatly disappointed. Since this book is told from the perspective of several different characters, every event is told over and over from several points of view, and in tedious detail. Sometimes a new chapter would start and I wouldn't even know who was speaking -- luckily by that point I didn't really care. I ended up skimming over many passages that were written in a bloated and graceless style that seemed like a pitiful attempt to sound Victorian. Rather than being a haunting and mysterious tale, I found this book only to be a bit obscure, and rarely did I stumble upon anything of interest lurking in all of the confusion. I don't understand how it could receive so many positive reviews. I suggest \\"The Turn of the Screw,\\" by Henry James instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that never ends. . .","review":"I'll sum it up in two words: inaccessible and redundant. Arthur Phillips had a good idea, but I think he could have done it justice within the page constraints of a short story. For the first 100 pages, each chapter is basically a repetition of the chapter before with only slight variances. The language is pretentious, so much so that Phillips loses his meaning. I found myself rereading sentences, but finding them so obscure that I wasn't able to make much sense out of them. Also, there is little to no character development, and the characters aren't terribly established at the beginning, so you're not really sure if their behavior is in character or not. If you are simply dying to read this, get it from the library and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh..","review":"I purchased Angelica because I wanted to read a good ghost story, and I heard that this was a good one from three different points of view. Okay...now I don't want to spoil anything for people who may like this book (from the reviews there are a few) so I am just going to say the following: the first part of the book was interesting, the rest, well...not so much. As soon as the first part was over the book became very boring and predictable.I just don't feel that the book is worth more than two stars. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"potential unrealized","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really wanted to like this book. I read it in only a couple days, not because I was utterly enthralled by the story but because I couldn't wait to be done with it.It's a ghost story. Or is it? I can't possibly say after having read the whole thing.One good thing about the book is that it's told in four parts, each focusing on the same story through the perspective of each of the four main characters. That in itself could have been pretty interesting if it weren't for the overly dramatic and confusing language which at times is so overly flowery that it's unreadable. At times I found myself skipping over entire passages (if you make it through to read some of Dr. Miles dialogue, you'll know what I'm saying).In the end I'm not sure if it's a ghost story, a story of madness, a story of unwarranted blame or WHAT. Very frustrating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"50-page-rule goner","review":"After forcing myself to give this book the benefit of the doubt for 50 pages, I finally decided to retire it. The writing style, while eloquent, was a little over the top in victorian vagueness, and I found myself getting extremely impatient with the characters. Perhaps I will try again after reading some other books I have on my shelf, but for now, this book just didn't have what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"our whole book club hated this one","review":"Our book club read this one and everyone hated it!

The author got her point across with inspirationals and wisdom. Kudos on that. Simone and Andy had a doozy of a relationship. Out of control dysfunction.

Tart's book is biased from the beginning: his goal is to convince the reader that child spiritual experiences are indeed similar to experiences of great mystics (Christ...). Though I have nothing personally about this hypothesis, Tart does not attempt to build his claim on well chosen details of child experiences. In contrast, child experiences are presented in a non-ordered way (or at least an order non explicit to the reader) so it is hard to make anything out of them. Also, Tart rarely quotes children. Instead he rephrases what he though they were saying.The topic and the material (raw child experiences) is good, the writing and the organization of the book is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A parents surprise.","review":"This book provided a multi-sensory experience that I was not expecting. Having both of my children now in their twenties, I thought this book would remind me of the precious times spent in awe of my childrens many moments of wonder. It did provide many memories but they were not all of the second-hand kind. Reading the first pages I was transported back to my own childhood. I was torn between devouring the entire book in one sitting or stopping to savor each delicous memory. I chose the latter and am so glad I did.

What should be a thorough review of conversational Spanish coupled with an intensive introduction to future, conditional and subjunctive tenses is nothing more than a cursory review of first semester Spanish. Granted, listening to all the conversations on these 24 CDs will undoubtedly help your pronunciation and ease with common conversational situations, however, why should you or anyone shell out nearly three C-notes when you can get the same and more from the Barron's Institute \\"Mastering Spanish Level 2\\" for less than a Franklin.

Nineteen bucks for sixteen waza is pretty steep, especially when the waza are not really covered in depth.Anyone interested in hanbo should not waste any time on this book, but instead get Hatsumi's Stick Fighting manual, which covers over 50 techniques and contains text a whole lot more informative, even translated from the original Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitens & Brightens Coat Wonderfully!","review":"We use this shampoo on our dalmatian.

Along with the Mersenne primes and prime producing formulae.An entire chapter discusses cryptography and related matters. Primes are at the heart of PKI and its RSA implementation.

As he was a professor at Cambridge I think there are plenty of people who would have \\"blown the whistle\\" if he as many dodgy things as ANW makes out. And - it's just occurred to me - who is ANW to criticise the CSL industry? he is part of it too now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Paper","review":"Simply the worst biography I've ever read. Another A.N. Wilson \\"work\\" .. namely \\"Dream Children\\" .. a modern \\"Lolita\\" fashioned in the likes of the works by Vladimir Nobokov are also indicative of the intents and character that Wilson so obviously portrays. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"C.S. Lewis - so way better than the write up","review":"When compared to the other CSL bios and even the film Shadowlands it appears that this is a biased book and Mr Wilson is only safe in writing it as CSL is dead. It is quite worrying as he tries to look fair by being nice about his academic literary critiscism such as the Allegory of Love but pays back-handed compliments or is generally off about his other works even the popular Narnia series. So I say read any of the others before you read this one to get a fair view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I didn't like this book. Wilson uses this book to express his real doubts on Christianity rather than just focusing on C.S. Lewis. His comments on page 164 & 165 are just plain silly. He seems to be an apologist for the Jesus Seminar rather than a serious biographer on Lewis. He challenges Lewis' comments, in Mere Christianity, that Jesus was either a \\"raving lunatic\\" or who he said he was. This is in question, as Wilson puts it, because all four Gospels don't contain the exact same information. He, like the Jesus Seminar, wouldn't question for a minute different accounts of the same historical event, written in history books, by several eyewitnesses from their own personal perspectives. However, in this book his bias shows through! My recommendation is not to waste your time with this book, because I'm not at all sure it is accurate about Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"An uneven, untrustworthy biography","review":"It was very strange reading Wilson's biography. At times, he seems very insightful and wise, with helpful and true comments about Lewis's character, his relationship to friends and household members, and his books. At other times, he seems like an educated fool, quoting things out of context, reading things INTO Lewis's life and works that aren't really there, misrepresenting facts, creating fictional sources, or making up comments to be presented as truth. Although Wilson sometimes presents many individual parts of Lewis well, the composite figure does not add up. As George Sayer - Lewis's friend of nearly 3 decades - noted, at times the portrait of Lewis is almost unrecognizable. There are better biographies of Lewis available. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho-speculative Biography","review":"Although very well written and interesting at points, Wilson's biography, in some ways, tells us more about Wilson than Lewis. I label the effort \\"psycho-speculative biography\\" because Wilson, writing as an outsider to Lewis' world (he did not know him personally), takes bits from that world and speculates, offering his own inferences on the data. Rather than adding a strong note of objectivity, Wilson's lack of contact with Lewis, obscures the man. By contrast, one should see the book \\"C. S. Lewis at the Breakfast Table,\\" a delightful collection of essays, reflections by those who knew Lewis over a span of decades. The Breakfast Table book is wonderfully honest about Lewis' flaws, but what emerges is a much more faithful look at those characteristics that made Lewis such a compelling figure: his wit, intellect, love of beauty, love of life, love of friends, and, yes, love of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tender Look at C S Lewis","review":"If you're looking for an enlightening look at the life of C S. Lewis and his cult following, look no further. This book takes a tender but blunt look at the life and writings of Lewis, as well as those that passed through his life. This book feels slow to read, but with good reason: it's a book to be cherished and savoured. Curl up with it during quiet times, or when you have insomnia, and you'll suddenly find yourself in the same room as the creator of Narnia himself. This is a touching read, and especially appropriate for junior high, high school, or college readers just discovering Lewis or wanting more information about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very believable and human portrait","review":"Wilson, who clearly finds his subject fascinating but refuses to worship him the way some now do, writes a very readable, well-researched and engaging biography that portrays Lewis as a good but complex and even tortured man. This work greatly helped me to understand the driving force behind Lewis's many contributions to literary scholarship, literature, and religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"This story of C. S. Lewis is told essentially as by a nurse (Wilson) to parents (we) about a problematical small child (Lewis). Wilson appears to be never in doubt that he understands his subject better than it ever understood itself. His cocksureness is the more inviting since he pretends to be rescuing Lewis from a perceived danger of becoming a \\"plaster saint\\"; it is the more embarrassing since he is incredibly careless in his use of the sources and has a proclivity for the very basest forms of gossip. If some Lewis devotees have lacked interest in the real man, Wilson has clearly surpassed them on this score. This biography is eminently readable; but its appeal is vitally rooted in the author's cocksureness, sloppiness and bad faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"C. S. Lewis in the dock","review":"The man of Shadowlands and Narnia, C. S. Lewis, gave the task of writing his more or less official biography to two people. The first of these was his friend for many years, the author Roger Lancelyn Green. The other was his personal assistant for several months near the end of life, Father Walter Hooper. Their book is a bit dry, but it does seem to be a fair account. They had many advantages beside personal knowledge of the man himself. Abundant access to C. S. Lewis's private papers, to Warren Lewis his brother and to many of Lewis's other friends and acquaintances. George Sayer knew Lewis well for years and wrote what you might call the 'friend's biography', with some surprises and some dull detail. Mr. Wilson puts Lewis in the dock, and goes against all of these others and has no real witnesses to prove his case. I don't think a judge would throw the case out, but I do think the jury might send him packing and award damages to Mr. C. S. Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tasteless Piece of Junk full of false accusations","review":"Wilson's many accusations of C.S. Lewis just show how incompetent he truly is. He confused Lewis with his brother, Warren, making the claim that the accomplished writer was a heavy drinker. He also accuses Lewis of marrying Joy Davidman for sexual interests, when it has been proven time and time again by those who actually knew the man that it was rather a marriage that would let her live in England as a citizen. He takes several quotes from Lewis, his friends, and his family and twists them out of context. It is a disgrace to see so much filth printed about a good man. Perhaps Wilson should pay more respect (and more journalistic competence) to the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploring dark corners in search of validity?","review":"One gets the impression that A.N. Wilson writes with ulterior motives in mind. Although interesting, and quite possibly true, the dark corners of Lewis' life exposed by Wilson seem to be a deliberate alternative to the accepted biography. This approach makes me skeptical of the validity of this text. In addition to these concerns, I found Wilson's style less than engaging, bordering on tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book for sales execs who like to think","review":"If you are looking to lead a sales driven organization, company or team and are more effective in selling when you have a deep understanding of what you are doing and why it makes sense, you will not find a better, more grounded or more solid book than Don McNamara's \\"Visionary Sales Leadership.\\"- Mark Goulston\\"Leading Edge\\"FAST COMPANY magazineand author,Get Out of Your Own Way at Work... and Help Others Do the Same : Conquering Self-Defeating Behavior on the Job"},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Dill Remastered","review":"This awesome title, from 1947 will keep you in your seat.

This time the case revolves around another madman capable of unspeakable acts of perversion. While not quite as gruesome as \\"Birdman\\", the mental imagery in \\"The Treatment\\" is equally disturbing. Jack is brought to the edge of his own sanity, as he cannot ignore the case's apparent connection to the disappearance of his own brother decades earlier. Another well written page turner by Ms Hayder, I look forward to the next installment. Once again a warning, like \\"Birdman\\" this novel is not for the squeamish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of Shock; very little suspense","review":"I really enjoyed 'Birdman'; particularly for the way the author gave us insight into both the 'good' and 'bad' guys. I was anxious to read the sequel, 'The Treatment', hoping that Hayder would find an equally interesting story for Jack Caffery. Unfortunately, I find 'the Treatment' to be an almost formulaic repeat of 'Birdman'; with many similar plot elements. I could guess many of the plot developments. Although the topic of pedophilia is as taboo as necrophilia was in 'Birdman', this just felt like Hayder wanted to be shocking, not suspenseful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking beyond words....","review":"I rarely find books to be as \\"horrific\\" or \\"mind blowing\\" as the reviews claim them to be. But \\"The Treatment\\" knocked my socks off. There are not enough words to describe how bone chilling the plot is, and the ending is the most shocking I've ever read. It makes you wonder if Mo Hayder is: a) extremely creative, b) exploiting events that happened to someone somewhere, or c) just a touch sick in the head.I didn't read \\"The Birdman\\" and I'm not sure I'm going to, at least for a while. There's a lot of unspeakable evil in the world that the average human can't even imagine. How much of it we want to bring into our lives via paperback books is something that we each have to decide for ourselves.Until I can shake the nightmarish images created by \\"The Treatment\\" out of my head, I think I'll loose myself in \\"chick books\\" for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than That?

And I just reread the American printing.To sum this book up quickly would use the words dark, twisted, and wonderful. Not for the easily freaked out, but if you don't mind dark books you will love it.Jack Caffery is back, and still haunted by his little brother's disapearance from years ago. A case he is working now stirs it up more than any other has. He doubts his objectivity, his relationship with his coworkers and his girl freind as a result.Mo Hayder sets a pace with her reading that won't let you go. I honestly read this in one sitting. If you read Birdman and liked it, you will love this. If it helps, I find it kind of a cross between Ian Rankin's Rebus, and John Connoly's Charlie Parker books.Jon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"This is an excellently written book by Mo Hayder. A trifle slow in taking off but wow! I suggest reading Birdman first though, also by Ms. Hayder as the two books are connected; however only in background nothing that would effect the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one should scare even the most hardened reader.","review":"The Treatment is a tense, terrifying novel that vastly improves upon its original. I never thought I'd read another book that would scare me out of my wits, but this one certainly did. I read it on the ninth floor of a hotel and was still checking out the window to make sure somebody wasn't dangling off the roof and looking in! (You'll have to read the book to know what I'm talking about).No, it is not a book for those with weak stomachs. It deals with some very heavy themes, which is what makes it so scary. Hayder is also able to strike a refreshing balance between exploring her characters' private lives and the crime at hand. No soap opera at the expense of plot here, a problem that befalls many crime novels of late. I hope Hayder returns to the crime genre and Det. Caffrey soon, because I've yet to find another novel that has scared me as much as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"The one word I would use to describle this book is harrowing. All of the characters are fully realized and flawed in some way, as in real life. The story is engrossing -- so much so that I know this one will stay with me for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"To shock the unshockable!","review":"I have been reading serial killer, thriller, suspense type novels for a very long time. The book is NOT for the faint of heart. My jaw dropped over and over again at the hideous subject matter and the grotesqueness of the killer. Not an easy read, it just doesn't flow, but the plot twists and turns. It makes you want to ask Mo Hayder, \\"who are you, really?\\". I couldn't put it down. I will never forget this one. You'd never think a woman wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think again","review":"The main problem with this book is the psychology of the characters. They all felt wrong considering what they went through which was quite a lot. A lot of tediousness in terms of detail that has little significance to the whole point of the book. I also don't understand the significance of some of the events once you reach the end. In the end everything is left hanging in the air and incomplete. The subject matter is really depressing too, so defnitely not for anyone looking for any sort of inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"lazy, long boring book about sadistic rituals","review":"Mo Hayder was probably out of good ideas, so he did like about 12 other authors I read this year: invent a sadistic pedophile, and write long and boring insights into the tortured psyche of the detective pursuing him. No originality, way too long, and most of the book is not about the case the hero is working on, but about his and his girlfriends tortured pasts and their difficult relationship. When I want to read about psychiatric cases, I'll buy a book written by an expert, not by a stumbling amateur who pretends to be one. The only bit of suspense is waiting for the hereo to stop being so clueless and do his job properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treatment","review":"Okay, I found this book in my school library clearance bin (I know, a clearance bin!) and it was given to me for free. Having never heard of the author before then, or knowing what it was about (I grabbed it for the cover) I began to read, and change. I had never read anything like it before, and in hindsight I was probably a little too young for this story at the time, but I swear I felt myself change inside. This book changed me. It is a pure adult thriller, with some heavy characteristics. Child abduction, abuse and murder, rape, drinking and drug-taking to name a few. This is the second book in the Jack Caffery series, with Birdman first, but it is readable on its own. This book set the bar for how I chose my books and thrillers in particular. And there will never be a sexier fictional character. Ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bit nasty but well written","review":"Plot has many similarities to the first in series with Jack still searching for answers in his brothers abduction as well as working on a challenging case and dealing with his girlfriend's problems. Tension runs throughout as the police investigation snakes along while the perpetrator repeats his crime. While this is an excellent police procedural I gave it only 4 stars as it is not quite up there with the best of class. The repitition in this and the first book in the series is a little annoying. While they are totally different crimes we have similar devices for spinning out the investigation. Shoddy police work and faked reports on grunt work, Jack taking the law in his own hands, failure to follow up critical witness reports and delays in getting crucial evidence. Strangely we have a new boss in the unit, now a straight talking, drinking large lesbian scotswoman - anyone read Stuart McBride?

No Beatles music. no relevant history of the band. Just, \\"this apartment was John Lennons for a few months\\". Its kind of funny, because in a few places, they are commenting on some landmark but only one of them has a microphone, so there is just a blank pause where the un-miced guy is commenting.

The base of the knife makes an excellent hammer as well. It's well balanced right at the hilt with an extremely good checkered pattern rubber-like grip even when wet.The sheath is my only complaint. Sheathing it at any more than a slight angle will result in catching in the sheath very tightly. The top part of the snap button also came off after a few months of use and the rubber securing strap it sits in wears down, revealing some sort of plastic fibers which annoyingly catch on clothing.

Typically this should be an easy return and credit, no excuse why this is still dragging on.

I stumbled across this CD and the band purely by chance. While walking through Reckless Records in Chicago I heard \\"Cantina\\" playing on the store sound system. I asked the girl the name of the band and have been happy I did so ever since. This was the first CD I ever heard from them and it is also the one I like the best.They hit heights here most musicians can only hallucinate about. I would fix \\"Parasol\\", \\"The World is Against You,\\" \\"Lamonts Lament,\\" \\"Soft and Sleep,\\" and \\"The Cantina\\" as being among their most endearing songs. The beauty of \\"Parasol\\" is something which caused me to reboot it up again and again in the time following my official purchase. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure bliss...","review":"Mixing a certain laid back energy, clever instrumentals, and some fine, keening songwriting, this is probably the very best of the Sea and Cake albums. Hard to say what makes it the best, though--probably a combination of the songs and the way they f-l-o-w. \\"Parasol\\" is the greatest song Prekop has yet written. Why it isn't on the radio, and a big hit, is a mystery to me. I mean, it's just criminal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sea & Cake: Ohhh, now that's good stuff.","review":"more mature than the first album, more organic than their recent stuff, this one's an absolute gem.

There are parts of this one that are a bit more lively than the debut and to me that is a good thing as that first one lost me at times. The guitar is more active and the drumming is fun and the general energy of the players is felt more than ever before. A good place to start with this band if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea & Cake Shines Throughout","review":"While it is difficult for almost any album to top the greatness of \\"The Biz\\", this is not the point. Nassau is clearly a snapshot of the indy boys from Chigago's finest work. With the exception of the first track, Nature Boy, the entire album is pure Sea & Cake wonder. John McIntire, as ususal, shines on the skins throughout (especially \\"The Man who Never....\\" and \\"Earth Star\\" and in this writer' opinion, could be the best drummer on the scene today (not to mention his production talent). Sam Prekop's soothing vocals are right on and Archer Prewitt continues with his mystic melodies.Parasol, Lamont's Lament, Soft & Sleep, and Earth Star are easily some of the Sea & Cake's best work and for those who can't get off Biz, shame on you, see the sea for the stars here.For any fan of the Sea & Cake, this album is a must have, and for those who havn't experienced this great band, it's a must have, along with The Biz and their eponymous first release."},{"rating":"2","title":"El aletargamiento del Pop","review":"The Sea and Cake es un grupo que esta empecinado en enaltecer al decaído Pop, y creo que lo logran, luego de un acercamiento a su música es probable que revitalicen tu lado más lúdico y despreocupado, pero siempre evocando paisajes melancólicos e intimistas. Nassau esta mas instalado en el lado del Rock/Pop que de otras corrientes, y dentro de la trayectoria de The Sea and Cake, este disco tiene límites mas definidos, de hecho funcionan aquí dentro de la lógica de un grupo de buenos músicos conformistas pero sumamente talentosos. Creo que la simpleza de las estructuras y la ausencias de arreglos demasiado pretensiosos hacen que las interpretaciones se radicalicen, por ejemplo Sam Prekop canta con mas determinación, la presencia de su voz se siente mas que the Fawn. Este es un gran trabajo que posee el valor de mostrarse honesto y claro en su búsqueda de otras maneras de hacer lo mismo, pero aletargadamente!."},{"rating":"2","title":"jack@earthlink.com","review":"This is Rachmaninov playing Rachmaninov - the master playing his own works.

But this is an idea which doesn't need to be 'sold', just explained; and a lay audience doesn't need to be beguiled, merely informed.Read the book: in 'The Real Eve: Modern Man's Journey Out of Africa' (published in the UK as 'Out of Eden'), Stephen Oppenheimer tells the same basic story with much greater clarity much more convincingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I have worn nothing but Riggs for 2 years now for work.

And even if you're not trying to determine what a specific text means, it's at least an interesting read to see where modern commentaries are taking modern Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pauline letters explained...","review":"Very oomprehensive--maybe tells you more than you wanted to know.

The performances are well thought out. Bream and Malcolm are individual virtuosos who work beautifully together.The Bach trio sonatas are complex intellectually, but can also be soothing to have on in a quiet house.Because they are played here on lute and harpsichord the dynamic range is narrow, so if it's on and you're relaxing you don't have to constantly change the volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Textbook You WANT to Read!!","review":"This book is so interesting, you might actually find yourself looking forward to homework! Part psychology and part business, it's just great material presented well. So far this is my favorite MBA book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Messages doesn't clarify","review":"Surprisingly, this compilation of essays is primarily centered around dismantling multiracialism because--as the authors vehemently argue--the multiracial movement is naively or insidiously distracting traditional progress (or lack thereof) for black racial justice. I read statements that compared multiracialism with \\"neoconservatism\\" which can be disconcerting for anyone who is accustomed to reading Marie P.P. Root's books, which take a more compassionate and emic approach to the studying of the multiracial experience.If you are looking for a book which addresses multiracialism from the standpoint of multiracials, which addresses interesting unique experiences that multiracials trek through, then this is NOT the book for you. But if you are interested in primarily criticizing multiracialism and are only interested in Black and Non-Black race relations, then I would suggest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for 'mopping'","review":"The earlier reviews say that this brush holds a lot of 'sauce'. However, it is advertised as a mopping brush. In that capacity, it is a major disappointment. Mopping sauces are very thin and are used to keep meats (ribs, brisket, pork shoulder etc.) from drying out in the cooking process. This brush doesn't absorb enough of the mopping sauce to be effective. I don't use the cotton mops because they 'drink' most of the sauce...this one is just the opposite. It doesn't absorb enough 'mop' to baste the food to avoid drying out. It is best used to apply thicker barbeque sauce at the end of a bbq cook. Silicone just doesn't work with a mopping sauce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"A mopping brush? You got to be kidding me. Maybe for a chicken leg or two. I am a serious grill enthusiast who cooks quite often outdoors and I had high hopes for this silicon brush mop. It is neither large enough or long enough to do the job unless you are cooking for maybe two people. Heat loss when raising the grill lid is an important factor when grilling or smoking meats and the tiny surface area of this mop will cause you to waste alot of time mopping on your sauce if you are cooking any substantial amount of food. Good idea that needs at least 4 times the surface area at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great !","review":"Took my ribs to a whole new level.Held enough sauce to easily coat the two rib racks I cooked.Clean-up was easy.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different and original, but not good !!","review":"This has some two or three songs worthwhile.

I love each and every one of them and often listen to the CD over and over again before switching to something else. If you like anything by Deep Purple, or any of the solo albums that the various members have released, you will absolutely love Accidentally on Purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds dated now.","review":"I just went through an Ian Gillan listening fest, and ended it with \\"Accidentally on Purpose.\\" I bought this when it came out, and didn't think too much of it then. Upon listening to it now, after several hours of Gillan's solo work and \\"Born Again,\\" his great album with Black Sabbath from 1983, I have to say that I was completely underwhelmed. \\"Accidentally on Purpose\\" has that \\"worst of the eighties\\" keyboard sound that has not aged well over the last nineteen years. If you want an excellent Ian Gillan vocal performance and have all the Deep Purple he was on, I suggest you purchaseGlory Roadan exceptional record or the afore mentionedBorn AgainIt received two stars because it is still Gillan doing the vocals, but song-wise, music-wise, it isn't worth one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's different from Deep Purple","review":"The reason why Ian Gillan and Roger Glover choose to record an album on their own was probably due to the character of the songs, i.e. they didn't fit Deep Purple. This album is a bit uneven but it's pleasantly diverse. The opening \\"Clouds and rain\\" is the highlight and a very strong song. \\"She took my breath away\\" is a quiet and laid back number where Gillan's voice is in focus, and also one of the finer moments on the album. But if you're looking for real hard rocking tracks you better look elsewhere, even if Gillan & Glover have thrown in some decent but rather average rockers. Some of the songs are a bit odd and very hard to categorize in a certain genre. Even if bits and pieces are very good and the mentioned \\"Clods and rain\\" is great, I can't give this effort any higher rating than 2 stars - but that doesn't mean it's worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeper of the millenium?","review":"I bought this album in 1988 when it was first released and thought it might be the \\"sleeper\\" hit of the year.

I feel this book says if you do these 9 things you will be successful. I do not belive someone's \\"do list\\" works. God gives us grace, not a list. Supose you try this list, doing your best, and are not successful? Would that not make you feel a little crazy? I feel this same book could have been written using a lot less words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success","review":"From the cover, it appears that the book is marketed at the success oriented crowd. Dr. Cloud is identified as a psychologist and co-author of the best selling 'Boundaries'. We have to go to the back flap to detect the biblical orientation via a citation of his previously published 'God Will Make A Way'.There are wonderful biblical quotes that illustrate points made along the way and the context freshens our perceptions of biblical wisdom.The brief, but very helpful concluding chapter might be read first. Here, we get a little from the author on how he came to make a success of 'Success'. He very frankly offers 12 steps toward applying the 9 things, and the first is 'Do Not Go It Alone'. It seems Dr. Cloud came up in a community of like minded folk who could support each other's ambitions.In the absence of such support, 'you are not going to go far'.With chapter 12 in mind, you might very profitably read the book from front to back and keep it handy for future encouragement."},{"rating":"2","title":"human heart","review":"In Lise Goett's musically eloquent book, Waiting for the Paraclete, the human heart, her heart, beats in celebration of the spirit in its nakedness.

A small party with two small boys asks to take sanctuary at the priory after being attacked on the road, but it becomes apparent they have not escaped danger when two more of their party are killed in the days that follow. It's obvious to Frevisse that dangerous politics is involved and she must find the murderer quickly. As always, Frazer is adept at characterization, and the impending death of their beloved prioress from old age adds poignancy to this story. Another excellent addition to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story has no plot twists and is carelessly written","review":"This murder mystery is set in midievil times.

It opens with a search for the Hametz, and then follows the standard seder. The text is in ENGLISH and the main blessings are in Hebrew script, English translation, and transliterated Hebrew. For the Four questions, it includes a page of music, and for Dayenu, it also includes a page of music. The seder includes a paragraph for Miriam's Cup.

Malcolm Dalglish and Grey Larsen are immensely talented -- I saw them play at McCabe's in LA in the early 1980's, and they were brilliant, especially Dalglish on hammered dulcimer. Most of the tracks are instrumental (hammered dulcimer, English concertina, guitar, flute, tin whistle, alto recorder, anglo); there are vocals on Christ Child's Lullaby. Most of the songs are traditional Irish, Northumbrian or North Hebridian tunes; a few tunes are original. My favorite track on this album is March Of The King Laois / Brian Boru's March. The melody starts off so simply, and then is increasingly embellished. This track, and Christ Child's Lullaby, are tracks that bring peace to my soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book can help you make positive changes in your life.","review":"Power Thinking is a beautifully constructed book -- the artwork alone is worth the price!

If 'Do While,' a repeating and slightly changing loops of tinkling bells and other sounds, is at all indicitive of the future of music, then I can sleep well from now on. It is, quite honestly, one of the most soothing pieces of music I own: 20 minutes of bliss.Though the album is worth it for that track alone, many of the shorter tracks on the latter half of the album are excellent examples of Oval's computer-manipulated music, particularly \\"Shop in Store,\\" which sounds as if constructed from an orchestral work, and \\"Commerce Server.\\" Though I've heard people complain that Oval sounds like someone holding down the fast-forward button on the CD player, regardless it still sounds quite unique and very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"diskont - oval - diskont - oval","review":"me + a bottle of hydro-codenine & the first song off this album played on repeat = a very happy boy :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too expensive","review":"This product will NOT \\"diminish appearance of fine lines\\".

It's a great shame that her recording association with RCA has ended. She doesn't play with a gigantic tone, but her phrasing and articulation are second to none. Her performance of the Bartok Concerto is highly appealing. She doesn't lay on the Hungarian goulash elements. Rather, her performance is subtle and full of nuances. She can be discursive and detail oriented without compromising the structure of the piece. She is greatly helped by Tilson Thomas, whose accompaniment is full of vigor and brilliant sonorities. The two Rhapsodies, somewhat more accessible music than the Concerto, go extremely well, too.

This book does a great job of cross-referencing songs, so if a song is officially credited to Puff Daddy featuring Mase, then it is listed in this book under both artists. This is incredibly helpful given the recent proliferation of guest artists on chart singles. Whenever I hear an unknown oldies hit on the radio, I can't help but look it up in this book and find out the artist. A must for every fan of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel Whitburn-America's Chart Guru","review":"Joel Whitburn has been America's chart chronicler since 1970 & he obviously shows no signs of slowing down-The seventh edition of his \\"Billboard Book Of Top 40 Hits\\" is by far,the best one he's come out with-Every artist of the rock era,be it superstar or one-hit wonder,is represented here-Love seeing the old 45 rpm record sleeves that are presented throughout the book-The appendix listing miscellaneous chart data is not to be missed either."},{"rating":"2","title":"List rich","review":"Good reference guide, even though it is behind about ten years.

Some of my friends and I always wanted to know where did some of the One Hit Wonders go, and how far up the chart did they go. This definately helps with that! The pictures of the artists are an added bonus! Not a lot of excess verbiage, just good hard facts.

Joel Whitburn is a stubborn stickler to accurate detail. Stevie's contribution is probably credited as a footnote, but in the pre-Puffy days, not everyone who walked by the studio got a credit on singles. Similarly, Elton John is not officially credited on \\"Bad Blood\\", or Odia Coates on \\"Having My Baby\\", or Thomas Dolby on \\"Urgent\\".There's a reason why this book is considered the Bible of chart information. It's as accurate as is humanly possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 40 Hits","review":"Wow...so many memories.

I couldn't put it down.The only downside was that the dates that the song PEAKED on the chart weren't mentioned, only the debut date, which I am not as interested in. I hope the updated version will include the peak dates of the songs. And I do hope that the next volume is on CD ROM, like that one reviewer said.

Great for beginners and advanced beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age kindergarten teacher style instruction.","review":"I'm searching for the perfect yoga video, and I'm beginning to realize there is no such bird, although some get closer than others. In this video the first set is an acceptably nice, relaxing do-able 32 min. set, but the second seems a bit kinky, ending with something that encourages free body movement. I'm personally not interested in watching these people gyrating around in a way which moves them but not me. The instructor speaks with the most irritating delivery, speaking as though we are kindergarteners. I may use this on creaky mornings, but only if I'm steady enough not to want to punch the instructor's lights out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cripple You Yoga","review":"I bought and tried this video and found it to be absolutely crippling!

The title is exactly what it says - gentle Yoga and its probably the easiest Yoga tape that I have.Personally, I use mine about 30 minutes before bedtime.The tape is divided into 2 sections that are each about 30 minutes in length. The first section is more structured and the second section is more free form. Even beginners should be able to do most of the exercises without too much of a problem.In this tape there are no wrap your ankles behind your ears or stand on your head type activities. The pace, the voicing and the exercises are all designed to simply relieve stress and loosen up those tight muscles and joints. If this is all you want, then you need look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really nice, but...","review":"I actually kind of hate to write this review, because I really like the Lexar JumpDrives.

So if you can find it, they're gone again in a few minutes. After dozens of times crawling around on my hands and knees to find the stupid thing, I eventually lost it for good at work.

WAY too many shots of a wiggling hand on a fretboard while being told that there are many more variations you COULD learn (that they don't show!)

However the version performed by the instructor includes several embellishments not taught in this video. These advanced techniques required a more detailed explanation to make it clear for the beginner guitarist.The additional materials section has an outstanding tutorial on broken 7th and 9th chords that alone is worth the price of this instructional DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"As usual...sizzle but no steak","review":"The problem with this (and most DVD and CD supported guitar instruction programs) is that the instruction is incomplete and misleading. The instructor shows a few chords and a basic lick. However, what is shown is so basic that it could be picked up for free on u-tube. Now, the DVD does provide nice versions of the songs, but the problem is the versions played are not the ones taught. The instructor adds lots of embellishment and flourishes, but gives no information on these additions. While no DVD can teach the subtleties of performance, at least the TAB for the performance could be included. Even without direct and explicit instruction, the addition of COMPLETE TABS would lead to an excellent product. As is, the product looks good, but has little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite A Story","review":"While it is no surprise that \\"the region\\" has it's shortcomings, the author clearly had an ax to grind. Much of this story revolves around high school drama that is not endemic to \\"the region.\\" The drug stories are good and clearly authentic. However, the story is a tale of youthful indiscretions. Rather than accepting responsibility for his actions, the author chooses to blame the environment for his hardships. The title is misleading. While the author would like the reader to believe that all these bad things happen to him because of \\"the region\\" and the people who live there, much of his misfortune is brought on by his own propensity for gossip and drug abuse. While I'm happy that he has finally found peace and happiness in Seattle, this reviewer feels that the author should move on. Furthermore, I have never read a book with so many typos. It was almost if it was never proofread. I'm not sure if this was symbolic, but I found it to be quite annoying. All in all, it has potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best- trust me","review":"What a fabulous way for people who aren't familiar with chopin to get acquainted with him.

If this disc doesn't sell Chopin to you, nothing well."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAC200","review":"This product works just as promised. It's easy to hook up and use. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it does not transfer the items to iMovie in clips like a camcorder would. It transfers as one giant clip even though there are pauses in the original. Therefore, I need to supervise and stop the upload to break the original into clips so that I may work with it to edit. This is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to convert old VHS tapes to DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product with only Minor Glitches","review":"I bought this to move my old Hi-8 (super-8) tapes to my computer for archival storage. I have a fully loaded Mac Pro and I imported everything into iMovie HD using the DAC-200 unit connected to my 15 year-old video camera. Overall the conversion went easily and reliably - I was very pleasantly surprised. The only glitches I noticed were (1) the unit would sometimes cause iMovie to create a new clip for no apparent reason right in the middle of a movie; (2) very occasionally the incoming signal would get scrambled without warning, leading to a kaleidoscopic mess until I stopped and restarted the recording session. The first issue was minor and easily overcome at editing time. The second issue occurred only twice during about 20 hours of video conversion, so it was no big deal. I would say the unit did exactly what I bought it for and it was much easier than I expected with excellent quality. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Time Based Correction - Otherwise Good Product","review":"The product is very well designed, has good features and is simple to operate.

Their schizophrenic mix of indie-sized stadium rock and atmospheric electronic excursions is finest here.

I am a fan of Celtic music, but I don't think you need to be, to enjoy this glorious sound. Do yourself a favor and relax and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poozies","review":"The CD is excellent. I was searching for a particular song, \\"Another Train\\", which I heard a while ago and didn't know who recorded it, so I went on line thinking it was the Posies, another group, I even wrote to their website trying to find the song, well long story...accidentally found out it was the Poozies and it was a welcome relief to finally get it together.

I'm sure Gary Glickman and Meg Wolitzer are feeling something along those lines in the aftermath of this thoroughly depressing novel. Had there been any art involved, of course, the issue of mined relationships would be moot, but autobiography is all this book has going for it, and there is little here to admire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"A good, easy read & well-written.

Night In The Lonesome October's Ed Logan is a character I believe any young college student can relate to in some way. I know I did.

He gets involved with a new love,and has run ins with night wanderers, cannibals, psychos and... well, it gets weirder (and kinkier) from there.Laymon has a nice flair for the creepy, but some of the elements just don't gel together, and the ending is rushed. We never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care, and the bad guy is just a meaningless plot device with weird kinks.For a better treatment of a similar theme, try the out of print \\"The Night People\\" by Jack Finney."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey into the dark side of the night","review":"This book was a amazingly fast read. This is interesting, since many books do not hold my attention for very long. The story is dark, and the atmosphere is intense. You simply cannot put this book down.

Rather than examine people and situations and provide the reader with an anlysis of events in the light of their outcome, the writer simply reports every word of dialogue, every event-and then goes on to the next one. The book is largely dialogue-oddly enough, for a history. One wonders why, when an announcement about a military breakthrough or a fiasco is given no more emphasis than another announcement about a change in the office's lunch rotation. This book may be worthwhile for someone looking for specific details about specific incidents, but a readable history of France's response to the Nazis must be found elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uncompromising and singularly recommended military memoir","review":"Fighting The Nazis: Memoirs Of The Only French Officer In On The Secrets Of D-Day! is the military autobiography of Colonel Paul Paillole, a French officer who was privy to what was perhaps the most important operation in the European Theatre -- the D-Day invasion of Normandy by the Allies. Paillole provides the reader with a truly gripping look at the catastrophic events building up to, during, and after World War II. Fighting The Nazis is a straightforward and compelling presentation of the harsh realities of battle, bloodshed, surrender, challenge, and victory. An uncompromising and singularly recommended military memoir, Fighting The Nazis would be a prize addition to any personal, academic, or community library World War II Military History collection or reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Funny - Too Strange - Two Copies Are Not Enough","review":"Buy it for yourself, buy it for a friend, just buy it. Rarely is musical theatre so silly and so delightful. I bought it because I couldn't imagine Moby Dick as a musical. I listened to it and I still can't. This is a play within a play. Songs range from silly, to fun, to serious, to depressing. It's so contagious, you will find yourself humming in the car on the way to work. Don't expect a somber Les Miz, but more of a light hearted romp in the pool during your high school reunion. Live on the wild side and get it! You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby Dick -a whale of a show","review":"This CD brings back great memories, i saw the show twice and was there on the night of the recording.One reviewer called the show \\"Carry on St Trinians the Musical\\" and that just about sums it up, a saucy, joyous, funny show with an infectious score and a young attractive and very talented cast. It is a shame you don't get to hear all of Sylvia's wickedly accurate impressions (Bette Davis,Katherine Hepburn,to name but two)but the sheer vibrancy of the evening can be gauged by the enthusiastic cast and response of the audience.This show outstrips, Les Miz, Cats , Phantom - the lot, 10 years on I still wish i could book a ticket and see the whole thing live, until then i shall keep playing the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Speakers","review":"Very good sound...I have a 32\\" Samsung LCD, and it definitely fills a room!

Sorry I can't comment on Ormandy's Wellington, it is the other CD that I have, which has only Leinsdorf's Eroica."},{"rating":"2","title":"An industrial flight of fancy.","review":"Too much industrial music these days is little more than synth-pop with a few distorted guitars on top. While I'm a fan of synth-pop, there are times when my ears need something a little more meaty. When it comes to music, Pigface serves up thick, juicy slabs. Pounding, growling drum & bass arrangements layered over machine noises and tape loops reminiscent of musique concrete. It certainly won't be everyone's cup of motor oil, but it would win points for sheer audacity even if it weren't so engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative, but not in a good way","review":"This record is one of the most creative efforts I have ever listened to. Unfortunately, it loses itself in being strange. Compiling several different singers and songwriters, this album has potential. However, the songs last much too long and never go anywhere - they just loop endlessly. Some songs are just drums (and synthesized ones at that!). This one is only for those who are fed up with mainstream and need something completely different. Even they will still be disappointed, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtly Love -- from then to now","review":"Courtly Love is a subject much discussed and much misunderstood. Jean Markale helps to clear the fog away from the subject, revealing the practice, and the culture within which it grew, in terms of a moral-poetic quest and an enhanting experience of heterosexual relationships. Perhaps the leading expert on all things Celtic, Markale traces the history of the concept from its life-giving roots in pre-Roman times through its various manifestations in southern France, to the deformations forced upon it by the Catholic Church, to its relation to Tantric Yoga. Courtly Love is not so much a unique study as an important reappraisal of the first appearence of the idea of elective love within post-Roman Europe. It is definitely worth the read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty light","review":"This was interesting, but poorly written (or, translated?) and light in terms of backing up the thesis with concrete examples.

I was disappointed, as day after day it lost several minutes before I even left home. Each time it required several minutes of button pushing before it would re-synch, and even then it had to \\"see the sky\\" to synch.

The watch body itself is equally large and awkward. Perhaps the watch needs to be that large to house all the electronics to receive the time radio signal.I will have to take the word of the previous reviewer that the watch does not set the time zone as other atomic clocks do by using the radio signal, because my watch has yet to successfully receive a radio signal. It is currently off by 6 minutes and losing a few seconds every day.I would return it, but I got it on woot (for $24.99).

This DVD changed that.Within a short time I was able to master Twist and Shout and suddenly people started taking notice. The songs on this DVD are not complex... in fact, they only have a handful of chords, repeated over and over.

After listening to a number of recordings out there, I'd say that it's still my favorite as far as intensity and passion--some of the tempi are a little far out, but I think that suits the spirit of the piece. McNair and Hagegard are phenomenal, and the tenor Aler acquits himself well with this insanely ranging tenor solo.I think it's an excellent first recording, but perhaps not *absolute* perfection. The cover is a bit silly, but perhaps the composer would approve--it is, after all, a ribald and orgiastic romp through some very sensual text and music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic and pasteurized...","review":"In the classical world there are great conductors: Toscanini, Solti, Karajan, Kondrashin, Boulez, Levine, Furtwangler, Klemperer, Rozhdestvensky, Previn, Ozawa, etc. There are also poor conductors, among which Fiedler and Slatkin spring instantly to mind.Leonard Slatkin is characteristically anemic in this outing. This fatuous release, cursed by facility, only serves to undermine composers as gifted as Orff. John Aler and the St Louis Orchestra are brilliant performers, and not served well by this outing. Even the cover [bites]. Avoid this dreck at all costs... CAVEAT EMPTOR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"Robin Gibb is and will continue to be a favorite artist of mine. I think this CD has some interesting material but it is not a great effort in terms of quantity. 3 of the tracks are remakes which cuts the \\"new\\" material down to 8 tracks. To reward the fan and consumer a CD with 14-16 tracks would be acceptable. I like the direction Robin is taking with this new unique sound. It is not Bee Gee-esque, however, a blend of new and familiar Robin/Bee Gee tunes would make this CD more appetizing. With so many years between solo CD's I feel the effort was not where it should have been, especially if Robin is trying to distance himself from the Bee Gees and create a name for himself. Ceratinly worth a listen at the right price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't click...","review":"I think it is my own fault, because I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was not pleased with this CD.

The Sea and Cake is a band with tremendous talent and a creative vision. Their sound is simple yet complicated, integrating rich, dreamy sounds with Sam Prekop's soothing voice. \\"Sporting Life\\" is a stunningly beautiful song that never wears out; it motivates you to hope high and love life. \\"There you are\\" is equally beautiful- it starts off bare and then integrates each sound until the perfect lullaby emerges. I feel that The Fawn is the type of album that the listener has to get used to in order to be fully appreciated. The initial listening will evoke curiosity, but every Fawn experience thereafter will be truly enlightening.

Its very addictive, well crafted pop. If you like Pulp, Blur, Stereolab, that sort of beat I'd add this one to your collection too. And Vice Versa, for your Sea & Cake fans. It also makes me want to buy lots of Bruuns Bazaar clothes and eat Scandinavian food. Maybe do some shopping. But that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick sophistication","review":"Living in Chicago I heard \\"The Argument\\" on Northwestern's college radio station. It's extended beginning is infectious. Sputtering drum fills, taps, and a watery soul bass line. Even though I had never heard the group, I began singing; making up my own lyrics in a faux breathy voice. Then when Sam Prekop's own breathy lyrics kicked in i almost messed myself. It was too perfect.The Fawn is a slick continuance of their past, morphing them ever closer to McEntire's personal Sterelab. Gone is the attitude that pushed the Biz into coolness. Also gone is McEntire's superb drumming sound which he now favors to tailor with electronics. The Sea and Cake have moved into sophisticated aloofness with this record. It is at times sublime and others boring. I really like this record but am trepidatious about what's to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just love it","review":"I've been working backwards from Oui, so that is my reference point.

This book presents the most compelling look into the individuals who perform heavy body modification, people that I have looked up to in my own personal journeys to attaining my ideal physical form. Modcon has been one of the highpoints of such journeys. This book has loads of excellent photography, and while it may shock you at first, you'll find that these are ordinary people that have taken the steps to achieve personal enlightenment through altering the bodies that were given to them.P.S, you'll even find a picture of me in there- I'm the one with the yoyo ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of the reviews on here are from friends of the author","review":"The book is OK, the photos, are OK, although they are mostly of \\"modified\\" penises, and the book is more like a bunch of essays/articles with photos stuck in between.

I suppose I purchased this book in hopes that I would find a condensed version of some of BMEZine's articles, which are well thought out and full of information. This book read like a series of poorly pulled together magazine articles and often times, the photos occupying the articles were either misleading, misplaced or lacking any further explanation. What also disappointed me, and someone has touched on this before, any person who identifies themselves as a member of the \\"body modification community\\" can easily point out many of subjects in this book. These people are already well publicized and very vocal. Although they are extremely interesting, they no longer command my attention.

Hats off to Phillip Barbosa for wonderful photography and to Shannon for his insightful commentary and interviews. This book explores the very nature and humanity of its subjects. I find the interviews and editorial insight to be the most important aspect of the book, and is what prevents this from just being a very shocking picture book.

I was struck by the imagery she portrays and by the mouth-dropping metaphors and almost seamless way of making you flow with the read.She has particularly two details that I appreciate very much from her writing.1.) She plays vividly with light and darkness, creating an assorted array of contrasts that lets you intake the imagery as if you were there, watching what she did when she was struck by the arrow of poetic thinking.2.) She has this most assuring way of dealing with death; death doesn't seem to bother her nor does it seem to be regarded as right and wrong, it simply is--like the keeper of life and the taker of it, too. She admires how death takes what it must but respects what life must keep in order to maintain balance.

I just bought the Canon XTi DSLR...an amazing camera!!!...All I can say is Perfect! Save your money, pay $300 more and get the Canon XTi. It's like the same size as the Lumix and you will be astonished what a DSLR like this can do!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLURRY PHOTOS INDOORS.","review":"I borrowed my friend's Panasonic FZ8 this past weekend to photograph my son's birthday party. I took about 150 photos total. I took all photos on Manual mode. Finding a photo that is sharp is a actually challenge! I ended up deleting 90% of the photos after uploading them to the computer. So, if you take lots of photos indoors where a flash is usually needed, keep on shopping. After taking dozens of photos indoors, I went outside to test the camera under bright sunlight. Horrible. photos were overexposed. I wouldn't want a free FZ8, let alone buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing results, returning back to Panasonic DMC-FZ7","review":"Grainy ISO 100 pictures at any light conditions. Usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem, but if you take pictures with Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and compare ... it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera.I had Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and the only cons. is really noisy high ISO sensitivity mode.In FZ8 camera Panasonic implemented the Venus III processor (FZ7 has Venus II processor). As a result picture quality really improved at high ISO sensitivity modes but DRAMATICALLY changed for the WORSE in ISO 100 mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had the 5K (5 MP) model of this camera which was stolen. However, I have added three or four other digital zoom cameras to my collection which were better suited to my use since then, so when I got this I was disappointed. First, there is no external hotshoe for flash, the camera is small compared to the others I own. I simply found that I had outgrown this size camera. It simply pales in comparison with my Canon 5SIS and my Fuji Finepix S9000, so I returned it immediately. A less advanced amateur might find it perfect for them, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for \\"soccer moms\\"","review":"As a novice camera user and mom to 3 mobile boys, I wanted a camera had the ease of digital but the ability to \\"get the shot\\" while my kids were playing sports. This camera meets and exceeds my needs and expectations for the price. It has a burst mode that I used during baseball games that could get the entire pitch sequence of a player. It catches the little nuances like the dust being kicked up yet can focus on the player. My friend who spent 900.00 on a camera and knows more than me, actually preferred my camera! A great value~"},{"rating":"2","title":"For $300 it doesn't get much better.","review":"Leica makes the lens for this fine camera and it shows, yes if your looking for something to pick on noiseis a small issue up in the lower ISO settings but this won't be a problem for most who buy this camera.You can always shoot in RAW, you couldn't do that with the FX7. Recycle time for the flash is good thanksto the powerful Lithium-Ion battery, get a spare if you don't want to gat caught with a dead battery thattakes 2-3 hrs. to charge. Battery life is excellent! The noise reduction setting is best set on low, default too much.All in all this is an excellent value, it's fast with a decent image stabilizer system, the 12X lens is top in it's class.It comes with a lens hood that other brands sell as an option. The feel and finish makes my canon look cheap.Take your time and read some reviews, most rate this model as excellent and after living with it I agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Product","review":"This is a great camera.

Menu, controls are very easy to operate. The camera size is right between a DSLR and point and shoot. The grip and LCD are excellent.

I like a camera that feels more substantial and this one does. Great zoom and very versital adjustments. Good stabilization too. I have used it often already and have no complaints. Battery life seems to be great. One thing though, you will have to get an SD card or a gig or more as 7.1 megs is alot of resolution. The built in memory only nets you 4 to six pictures at full 7.1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic DMC-FZ8K - Great Camera","review":"I purchased this camera back in July 2007 and have had it for about 2 months now. The previous camera I used was a Sony DSC-W5. I was looking for a camera with a zoom greater than 3x and an image stablizer. I reviewed and tested several cameras and finally decided on the DMC-FZ8K.I am very happy with the camera. It takes great pictures, especially outdoors, and the 12x zoom is fantastic. I've had a few problems with indoor pictures being a little blurry but no more so than the Sony I had. The problem seems to be worse when the room is dark and the flash isn't used.A few weeks ago my son & I went caving. I took the camera and took about 50+ pictures. In spite of the pitch-black darkness the pictures turn out quiet good.The videos are great--much better than those I took with the Sony W5. The bad thing is that they are .MOV and can't be read directly into Movie Maker without converting. A 2gig memory chip will hold about 20-25 minutes of video."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a SLR is too much and point & shoot digital not enough","review":"Love the camera. I don't need a all the functionality of a digital SLR (or the expense and multiple lenses). But the pocket point & shoot digitals don't have the zoom an flexibility I need. Being farsighted, I hate that most simple digitals no longer have adjustible view finders. The 12x is zoom I need and I like the manual focus option. Earlier versions of this camera had manual focus/zoom as a twist of the lens barrel which is perferible to the mouse type control on this camera, but at half the price of the older camera I can live with this compromise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was very disappointed","review":"I did so much research before buying this camera. I wanted something small, lightweight, but as good as I hear Sony and Canon are but can be bulkier. It is a very fast camera. The burst mode is all I expected. The 18x was fantastic - I was truly amazed at how close it could get. The disappointed came in when I uploaded the pics to my computer. They were grainy, just awful. Not sharp, crisp. I have used my Canon A95 for several years & have never had to play around with my pics to get the color right or sharp. I could just shoot, upload & enjoy. I spent more time trying to get these to look decent. I just returned this camera. I will be trying the Sony next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Como volver a mi antigua Reflex con ventajas...","review":"Después de haber abandonado por varios años mi vieja reflex Konica, esta cámara me ha devuelto el gusto por la fotografía artística. Estuve evaluando la Lumix DMC-FZ8K y la TZ3, y me decidí por la FZ8K con este resultado:PRO:- Excelente zoom y apertura del lente Carl-Zeiss- Ventajas del joystick en la operación manuel de la cámara.- Buena opción para compra combinada con memoria sd de 4 Gb y batería extra.- Gran calidad en video 720x480 30fps.CONTRA:- Es necesario concoer de fotografía para operarla adecuadamente.- No tiene zoom optico o digital mientras se captura video- Es un poco grande para caber en un koala, ya que las lentes no se colapsa totalmente.- El accesorio para convertirla en wideangle 28 mm es muy costosoHa resultado como mejor opción (técnica y económicamente hablando) frente a cámaras profsionales de más de 600 US$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a camera","review":"Researched and researced for the specific inclusions I require in a camera. The Lumix, Panasonic DMC-FZ8, was the only one----now to learn how to use all the dozens of functions. It is a little more cumbersome than my other camera but the zoom and battery type were so important. Far zoom, I can confirm, requires a tripod---I did not get a real good picture of the eclipse without it. So far the picture quality seems excellent. There is a good size instruction manual to work with and it is pretty well written. I am having some difficulty locating a place to get the auxillary parts, i.g. filters. When I am proficient w/this camera I believe it will be a 5 star item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for Money","review":"I purchased this camera basically because I wasn't quite willing to spend what an SLR costs but I wanted SLR functionalities. This camera isn't quite there. Its main defect is that the pictures it takes have a LOT of noise which was pretty disappointing. HOWEVER, for less than 250 USD, I am pretty sure there is nothing better out there. Physically it is really nice, I mean it's very well made, small, light etc. Using it is extremely easy and the zoom/image stabilization is very impressive. Also, once you take a couple days fiddling with it, you can improve picture quality significantly (vs. depending on the automatic features). Now, after using it for a month, all-in-all I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"This has been a great camera for me so far.

Maybe it's the \\"K\\" designation following the FZ8. Still, if one's going to buy this camera, it's loaded with great features. The stablization feature works very well and the camera's zoom is breathtaking.The CONS of this camera include a very inaccurate white setting that makes using it on \\"auto\\" risky. Also, despite its zoom capability, I find that wide angle capability is far more useful than telescopic! Most digital cameras have distortion in both wide angle and telephoto, but the Panasonic comes with software that can help correct it.For $225, this camera would be just about right. For over five hundred, take a hike and find something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic bargain","review":"My wife and I purchased the FZ8S ahead of our honeymoon. The camera was extremely easy to learn, and provides excellent image quality and zoom capability. It's more featured than a basic pocket camera, but doesn't go to town like a DSLR. For people (like me) who are above novice but still well below professional when it comes to picture taking, the FZ8 is simply a fantastic buy.Yes, at high ISO/low-light levels and deep zoom levels it tends to produce fairly noisy images. To this I say, \\"Well, it's still only 250 bucks\\". So there are some sacrifices one must give for the price.Still and all, it's a great buy for the budget shooter."},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera, very pleased","review":"I'm very pleased with this camera :)prosit's very light and small, but well builtthe lecia lens is awsome and the 12x zoom is perfectvideo quailty is goodmacro setting is greatauto focus is greatall the settings and options work welleasy to understand and use menuquick start upimage quality is generally superbflash works greatnearly perfect veiwfinderLCD is crisp and clearaffordableconsnot so great photos at ISO 200+the flash is set to forced off (all you have to do is pop it up and change it to forced on, no biggie)action shots? still figuring out how to take them well with this cameraI've had it for about a week and so far Im loving it more and moreI havent had any problems and it's a great upgrade from my standard 4mp kodakI'm still learning how otu se all the settings and all the tricks, the manual is very helpfulI highly reccomend this if you're not quite ready for an SLR, but want more options than a standard point and shoot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great digital camera for the price!","review":"I've recently got into digital photography and am learning all of the features of digital cameras (other than point and click).

I like the format and the pleasant way Bozenka instructs the different shimmies, some which are completely new for me. It also helps to review the more common shimmies. This has something for all levels and I find it a welcome addition to my DVD collection. I am pleased with this DVD. Even the length makes it easy to do from start to finish leaving one with a feeling of accomplishment after each practice. Excellent buy for the discount price of $8.99 from Amazon.I will be buying the 21 shimmies at some point as well since it does cover much more. It is also much more expensive, about $34.00, so that will have to wait a little longer. That is why I started with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want more from Bozenka!","review":"It's difficult for me to review this DVD because it seemed like very little effort went into the making. Bozenka's an amazing dancer and a gifted instructor so why this did not translate into her video doesn't make sense. The DVD would fit the advance beginner level; unfortunately, if you've had more than a year of dance instruction, you might feel cheated by the slim amount of instructional material. I would only recommend this video if you're the kind of dancer who sometimes feels lazy and you'd like to follow along without putting a lot of mental effort. As long as you're very familiar with your shimmies, you could use it for this method. I know some dancers do this at home. Still, I'd go hunting for another video before popping this one into my DVD player. BDSS should be producing better videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing !","review":"I was not too happy with this DVD. Everything about was too rapid and hurried, even the warm-up.

You should have studied Neon or Joyce to see what a great bellydance DVD contains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissipointing.....","review":"I'm not sure what Bozenka was thinking with this DVD. There are such excellent shimmy dvd's on the market already, to put together something so lacking.....I attended one of her workshops a few years ago and it was the same way. She taught a choreo that she was making up as she was going along. Which might work with Yousry or Suhalia, but not Bozenka. And then her performance was 2 minutes of wings! It was obvious she put no time or effort into preparing for the event. Very dissipointing!

I've had problems with most everything, the spring loaded pins that hold each section extended, and the clear plastic collars that sit atop each section. The spring loaded pins that freeze from retracting, or will not extend; these have contributed to numerous uncommanded collapses of one or two sections causing damage to the pin mechanism and elongating the holes that the pins extend through. The clear plastic collars have set pins that you tighten with an Allen wrench. The plastic is so fragile that it is next to impossible to avoid breaking them. I've gotten my flagpole back up, but I had to improvise. I bought 3 hose clamps from the hardware store and installed them just above the plastic collars. Think seriously, with the constant failures and maintenance, I would never buy one of these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Overview of the Acadians","review":"For the general reader who needs a good overview of the Acadian people, this is the book.

Acadia was a prize contested by France and Britain in many wars, declared and undeclared, in the 17th and 18th Centuries.The book is especially good at describing the British, Massachusetts and French internal political battles which ultimately led to the Acadian expulsion.

Of course, Rumpelstilskin never actually takes the baby because the Queen learns his name. However, the premise of the story is unsettling to small kids. Nevertheless, I would not go overboard with political correctness as the story is a classic and so long as you explain the story, your children should enjoy it.

Also, they seem inefficient: why all that space just to carry so little? This work didn't really touch upon my questions. This work details why the blimp was useful to Germans, Brits, and Americans in times of war. This felt like any other History Channel documentary. There's much focus on the 1910s and 1940s. It does mention Alberto Santos-Dumas, a figure about whom I want to learn more and about whom I encourage others to do the same. To me, this work was dull, but I'm sure it will have an audience who would just love, love, love it. The successes and failures of the blimp mirror the successes and failures of space travel.

Although the video is long, the actual exercises probably only take 30 mins. After each exercise there is a long period of doing nothing - okay maybe it's meditation, but this is not what I call dynamic!

Problems in the book are similar to the examples so that students can easily figure out what they are doing. The CD included with the text is a good resource for users of the text and even provides chapter notes and more sample problems along with the solutions to those problems. The only thing that I did not like is the text focuses mainly on using Excel where most students are taught to use SAS or SPSS.

The book tends to give a perspective on one specific means of deriving a problem as an example, instead of issue multiple different avenues of problems involving the same equation. The upside to the issue is that the book does contain answers to many of the chapter questions (answers located in the back). (NOTE: Unfortunately, his book is of very little, if any, help if you are taking his class, so consider ordering an additional guide to help you through it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to keep for reference","review":"I used the book for an introductory course at U. of Maryland and I found myself to come back to this book over again to review the materials and concept. As I go on to learn more about statistics used in data mining of genomic data or reading science papers regarding gene mapping stochastic methods, I find myself go back to this book for reference and review the concepts; sometimes going back reading the concept, I learn something new that I did not understand before. I also find the flow charts that specifies the conditions and assumptions in the book extremely helpful. Also, many comments that the author gives in data analysis are valuable.Thus far this is the statistics book that I use for reference.

Unfortunately, if you are a researcher just trying to obtain a basic understanding of the field of statistics, this is not the book for you. There is very little that is understandable to a beginner or even to someone with some basic knowledge in the field. This book is purely meant for the statistican. Norman and Streiner's text on biostatistics and Andy Field's text on Statistics and SPSS are written in plain language. They are easy to understand and get the concepts across with only the bare minimum of formulas thrown around. This book's primary usefulness is its comprehensiveness, but that only goes so far when the text is just unintelligible to most of us mere mortals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my money","review":"I too had to purchase this as the official text for my course.

However for teaching the examples are poorly written, often convoluted and largely useless for learning. Often the text is along the lines of assume X = xxxx, Y = xxxx, thus the answer is . With little to no explanation short of the generic formula/law/axiom. As well as one, at best two, said examples.Another flaw is the horrible lack of solutions to problems contained in the book. Only about a third of the end of chapter problems have a solution in the book/cd, and it is just the solution with zero info on how it is obtained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Pumpkin","review":"Great book!

She's just turned three and we're using it as our pre-Halloween reading again. What I like best about the book is that the characters, a witch, ghost, vampire, mummy and bat, aren't at all scary. They all have the same sole interest, eating pumpkin pie. There's no witchcraft, no haunting, no nasty mischief. They're basically silly characters, offering parents a good way to introduce young children to them in a way that might later neutralize potentially scarier meetings.

The book is written partly like an autobiography, partly like a discerning review of the subject. It is a nice mix, with enough personal insight and interest to make it compelling, and enough factual detail to make it a worthy reference book on its own. As is common for this author, he has a keen insight into not just the technical and factual aspects of a subject, but the human perspectives as well, and it is this which makes the book not just another list of facts (as many about computers are), but an intriguing narrative of human history and how the present came to be--as well as what the future may hold.

The real people who took part in the events of that night are degraded into incidental characters, and it really wouldn't have made a difference whether the ship was the Titanic or not. The disaster takes back stage to the drama between Stanwyck and Webb. The college kids singing and dancing left me cold, and I can't even begin to describe how hokey it was to see all of the doomed ones left on the Titanic taking part in a singalong just minutes before they are all going to drown in the cold waters of the North Atlantic.

I don't know if this is a file problem, a server problem or what, but if I could I would totally ask for my money back as it is basically impossible to listen without being distracted.On the plus side, amazon's support center was ridiculously fast and helpful with getting me around my work's content filter..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Edition rights some serious wrongs.","review":"This 1999 redeems the original release, which only had 9 songs and not in the order in which they were actually performed in the monumental live performance filmed by Jonathan Demme.To hear the whole set list played in the intended order - and believe me, the order matters as anyone who's seen the film knows - is to relive the film, and that's a very, very good thing.And if you never saw the film, Netflix it.If you're already a Heads fan, this '99 issue is a great way to introduce a needy friend to one of the bands from the late 70's and 80's that really *mattered.*Download immediately, w"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"this work it an essential for anyone and everyone. tight, moving, thought-provoking lyrics with a form-meeting-function instrumental style like never before. the classics are one this one: 'once in a lifetime' and burning down the house' with some of the other, more loved, favorites as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't get much better than 9 for 9","review":"David Byrne (lead singer/writer for Talking Heads) will never win any awards for brilliant lyrics, deep emotional songs or, for that matter, lyrics that can be interpreted at all.

For those of you who have heard \\"Burning Down the House\\" (which should be just about everyone except my dad), the rest of the songs are just as energetic. For a CD just about as good, I highly recommend \\"Little Creatures.\\"To differentiate the truly great CDs, I have only given 15 CDs a 5-star rating. This is one of them.

When you listen to a cd you can tell how much time was put into it and if the artist really tried. The day I bought this was the worst day of my life.....I believe Mase didnt even try on this one. He always had the slow slur in his voice but he had a sense of urgency. On this album he threw that out the window. ( as you should do with this album) Puffy didnt give him any good beats to work with making it even worse.It has one good song in Get Ready which sounds like it was left off of Harlem World. The only good song.The album feels uninspired on the production, flow, and the lyrics. I know Mase can do better, but this is an abomination. The WORST album i own hands down.

How you gonna let Arsenio dog you?","review":"When I first listened to this CD I was watching old tapes of the Arsenio Hall show (with the volume turned down of course) and Arsenio kept laughing and barking and stuff while Mase was singing. I think he was probably making fun of Mase's new album because I don't think he was laughing at me or his guest because it was Magic Johnson and I'm pretty sure those two get along pretty good. Mase should try and get a hold of him or something and figure out why Arsenio's got beef with his new record. I hate seeing them fight like this.

I don't hate him for turning to god because that is good thing str8 up, but with sounds as weak as this you need to be behind the album. I know this will still sell because of who he is and his fans and image but one listen and you'll see it can't compare to the first. Lyrics wise it's whole lot better and he flows a lot more stronger and faster on this cd. But the production on some of these songs is just wack and weak. I was really feeling his first one, but this, well, theres at least 4 I like. the rest i'll leave up to you the listeners to decide but trust me, Double up definetly isn't double the beats or lyrics cause it's just weak. I'm not hating on mase juts saying what I think. I think puffs cd will be way better. I heard the first cut P.D. 2000 and that will start the bad boy hits all over again.Buy at your own risk.

He also had quite a few tracks featuring other artists. It is now apparent, after his release of Double Up, that Mase can simply not rap alone. Maybe it is a blessing in disguise he is retiring. The \\"hit\\" of this album, \\"Get Ready\\" featuring Blackstreet, is nothing like his first single off his old album \\"Feel So Good\\". He attempts to relive old success with a song with Total and one with Puffy, but for lyrical and production reasons, these songs fail. All in all, the M A Dollar sign E is smart to have gotten out of the rap game with just a little dignity.

I am a Mase fan but this CD is very flat. Not even his supposedly best song \\"Get Ready\\" feat. Blackstreet is any good. Mase keeps saying the words \\"Way Back\\" and that's where he is going to be! Way Back in the hip-hop crowd if he comes out with another poor CD as this one. I was very disappointed with this CD.

Young David steps into the breach and saves both worlds with his creativity, intelligence, and attention to the world around us.David takes control of the cause of nightmares, and he banishes them.

Spizer's well researched text clarifies the sometimes confusing circumstances that allowed Beatles singles to be released on several different labels before Capitol took over with its marketing muscle. The real treat comes in page after page of color photos of rare picture sleeves, promotional materials, even record club marketing of the Beatles.

Or maybe a better analogy would be a bad 70's fusion / acid jazz band that can't seem to find any soul or direction. This CD just goes nowhere. Every time I think it's going to get better it doesn't. It just rambles off on another tangent only to get lost in the mish mosh of what sounds like musicians hoping to find some sense of unity. They don't.

Well maybe it isn't that good I thought, but then I realized how long it was- wow! You have to listen to this at least 1000 times before you really understand how amazing it is.

I'm a big fan of Metheny's guitar...But this album really shows who he is musically. He's a master guitar player, with beautiful phrases, tone, experiments, etc... But here is a question to Pat: Where is the music? The music that touches people's hearts? Why changing keys with no point to it? Or why using harmonies filled with holes and emptiness? Is it just fun with the math? If so, this is not about music, this is about research and science. But to add to it, it's not even interesting... It's a boring math, nothing that sparks an excitement. Music is the truth, you either reach it or you don't. It exists regardless how and what methods we're trying to research it with. So, unfortunately this album did not any touch with the real. It's probably the most artificial of his career, in the full meaning of \\"art\\" as not natural...I'm giving 2 stars because it's Metheny, but that's it...I know he can do much better, connect through your heart, Pat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and boring technical wizardry","review":"Yikes! I've listened to and loved Pat Metheny Group music for years, but I can barely listen to this album. The music is tedious and uninivting. Despite the absence of a lead singer, PMG still often has a melody or lyric. Most of this latest music is devoid of such themes. For me, TWU is mostly an album of musical stuntmanship. I regret even more going to the concert, but that is a different story. While many people think this album is great, I am unloading mine on the second hand market. It's an album for musical archivists. Ugh!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"This is by far the most thought out album I've heard by Pat. It is not his usual style, but it still comes out great. This album definately desreves that grammy. The music moves smoothly up and into the clouds. Like I said, it's not the usual sound you'll hear out of Pat, but it is still an awsome suite."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than last album","review":"Well, I own every single album Pat Metheny has ever put out. How does this one compare? It's definitely better than his last effort, \\"Speaking of Now\\" (2002), although not as ground-breaking as \\"Imaginary Day\\" (1997) (the other before that) or \\"We Live Here\\" (1995). However, it is a fresh sound and while no PMG album sounds exactly like any other, this is a worthy addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd man out","review":"I just don't get this album. It sounds tired. I've loved Pat's music ever since his late teens. Heck, his grandpa worked where I did--I used to get my Dodge serviced at his dad's dealership--I even lived in several locations he used for titles. I love his atonal stuff and his romantic stuff, his ersatz Dead, his work with Ornette and Gary Burton. But over the last few years, his composing has lost its freshness, its heart.. It is technically proficient--and his soloing has evolved in some ways. But the chord changes and musical phrases are overly familiar here. The form of the work is new, but the content is...well, it sounds like watered down Pat Metheny."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"TWO THUMBS\\"....ALL THE WAY UP!!!!","review":"I JUST GOT BACK FROM SEEING THE \\"PAT METHENY GROUP\\" TEAR THEHOUSE DOWN AND BUILD IT BACK UP AGAIN AT THE TOWER THEATRE INPHILADELPHIA!

Yes, I've been a PMG fan right from the self-titled debut album in the late 70's, right through Offramp, Travels, First Circle, Talking, We Live Here, and Imaginary Day. Five stars to all these titles. But with Speaking of Now and The Way Up, I question what is really being said in the music. Where are the beautiful melodies? Where is the barely contained tension of Are You Going With Me? The Way Up is a confused sequence of time and key changes that do not contribute to a cohesive message. Listening to this album is like listening to a teenage kid who talks all of the time and doesn't speak in complete sentences. What are you trying to say?Anyway, Pat if you're reading this, please know that your music has been a cornerstone of my musical experience since the 70's. I wish you well, and I hope you will once again connect with the music in your heart.Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"PM what is this?","review":"Well, I have been a fan for many years and have most of hisrecorded works. I must say this is very disappointing.

Having listened to at least 20 times i can say it just gets better and better. May i dare say it vies for the best jazz masterpiece ever produced by anyone !! Bravo, Pat and PMG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great PMG Work","review":"I was at first biased against this CD by the Gavin Wilson comment \\"sheer confectionary\\" yet purchased the CD because I love the PMG. Yet after a few listenings I understood why there was no \\"musical statement\\" like other CDs from PMG make: How do you hold the attention of listeners for 68 minutes? Instead this piece flows like a flag in the wind, changing all the time. It is a different way to make music and I think you have to give it a chance to appreciate it. Overall, I think it does show that Pat and Lyle have matured musically and in their compositional thinking. I wish the newness of the Introduction would've been demonstrated more throughout the work because the rest of the CD is obviously PMG music, but it is a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat","review":"You either get Pat or you don't. The man takes you on musical journeys as he explores himself. You go along for the journey. Sometimes it works. Sometimes you get lost.

All the male characters are gay or bi-sexual and all the female characters seem to have multiple lovers which seldom include their husbands. I was bored for most of the book, but stuck it out to the end hoping the big fight scene that is building throughout the book would save it. Talk about anticlimatic. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was the villain. She did an excellent job creating a nasty, female villain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible ending to a mediocre series, don't bother","review":"The first book in the series was very promising, even with all the sexual lifestyle situations I don't normally care to think about between men. I could look past it, as I had great hope for this book. Book two was a total bomb and wasn't even needed, a worthless book about a quest that didn't need to be included. Book 3 again started great, but fell completely flat and the characters that were fleshed out in book two were basically useless even after a big buildup. The great battle that was to happen, the fight between good and evil that was promised for 2 books ended *(SPOILER)* with one stroke of a sword. The four people, warrior, magus, bard, and whatever the other one was had no task in the book or the final battle. Do not read this book or series or you will feel like you wasted time after the horrible ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"I thought this was whole grain kasha. it was the coarse granules and not what i thought i was ordering.it should be more clearly labeled as to the exact product.i wanted the whole kasha grain.very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 pumps did not last one trip as bait pump","review":"I have been running rule pumps as bait pumps for nearly 10 years. They typically last 2-3 years. I run a main and backup and decided to replace both since one failed and the other had several years on it. Both new pumps failed on my first overnight fishing trip. Dead bait=bad fishing trip. I replaced them both, this time with an 1100 and a 500 gph. The 3rd 1100 quit on the first trip. Not sure if it is a problem with the batch of pumps? I dont suspect the installation because previous pumps in the same spot have lasted years.

I very, very rarely stop reading a book in the middle of a story, but after a hundred pages of complete cheese... (they are still addressing each other as Miss Templar and Lord...) I couldn't stand it anymore. Nothing interesting was happening in this book and the dialogue between the two main characters is generally corny. I thought it was too convenient that they immediately had all these things in common like their childhood, etc. This book annoyed me more than anything else. Unless you like slow starts, boring characters, and blah dialogue don't read this book. (Not to offend those who loved it, but that is my opinion. Thanks for reading it.) :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I had such high hopes for this book, since I loved MW's Pieces of Sky, but I just didn't enjoy it.

Even the love scenes were lukewarm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Pictures, Bad English Translated (badly written)","review":"The photos and illustrations are great; however, the writing (i.e. translation from French) is very, very poor.

Also, the outlay of the Army Order of Battle's design is difficult to decyfer; I have other books from this series and they are equally written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, think about what you're doing.","review":"In my opinion, this is not a good purchase. It's an example of the money making machine in action. No, I'm not one of those Doors \\"purists\\" who think that without Morrison everything is useless, I feel that the music performed on this DVD is of poor quality. If you like STP and Creed and shtuff, than you might like this. If you like the Doors, the real Doors, then buy a CD and listen to them the way they really are. If you like all star karaoke, go to a Hollywood bar. It'd be cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Star Karaoke!","review":"This DVD is nothing but a bunch of \\"musicians\\" (and I use the word cautiously) who got dressed up and decided to karaoke in front of an audience. The \\"musicians\\" included on this \\"Tribute\\" are a strange choice, and the remaining \\"Doors\\" seem like an act. They don't belong together anymore. And don't even get me started on Ray Manzarek. What a character! He's the one who started the whole \\"Morrison Mystique\\" junk and now he's basically saying that all Jim was was a frontman. (Read \\"Light My Fire\\" by Ray)All I'm saying is that whoever made the decision to do this, and with the people who did it, are not people interested in the music. The \\"guest musicians\\" are currently unpopular \\"stars\\" longing to make themselves cool again, or they're youngsters (like \\"Creed\\", shudder) who need some good PR and want to align themselves with something greater. Too late kiddies.

An intellectual twist on the \\"secluded retreat\\" idea - a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives. And of course, they're overrun by zombies.I especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore-fest. It works on so many different levels - while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral, your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes, the interesting characters, and the joyful way it plays with film conventions.This is a rare and unusual film to come out of the Czech Republic.

The whole bit about the editor's visit to Washington, the despressing discriptions of the government's treatment of the bonus marchers (some of them children) may appeal to history buffs, but had little to do with the crimes in upstate NY. Also the editor's involvement with one of the marchers,a young mother with two children had nothing at all to do with the murders. She was there in a wagon with a mule. I vaguely wondered about the historical accuracy of that. Would there be a mule pulled wagon on the highways between DC and NY in the 30's? But no matter - it was filler.

I strted trouble-shooting and found out that my injectors are not spraying properly, so I have sent them out to be cleaned, hopefully that will fix the hesitation/surging unburned fuel issue that I'm having.Usually I cannot read this sort of book for more than a few minutes without getting bored, but this book is written in a way that makes it easy to understand. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to learn how fuel injection systems work, and how to work on them.It is a little hard so far to fully grasp the pressure system, but I'm sure that's just me, I will keep reading it and I'm sure it will sink in.

The book focuses on general description rather than on personal experience, giving a flavor more of the city than of the life of a particular child. The historical information about general living conditions in 1940s Amman is quite fascinating, covering such topics as the various schools, medical clinics, markets, and children's past times, as well as the looming presence of war.

This is one of those stories where you root for the person who is changing and the roadblocks that are overcome, eagerly encouraging them on.

The description of Cleopatra maturing from an adolescent that had just become the sovern of Egypt to a becoming a confident ruler was interesting. However, the remaining 400 pages of the novel just had her going back and forth like a ping-pong ball, between trusting Caesar to being betrayed by Caesar, to trusting Caesar to being betrayed by Caesar. (Actually, for the last 200 pages it was Mark Antony that she was trusting and being betrayed by, but he seems to be interchangable with Caesar for the purposes of this novel.) It became exasperating that Cleo couldn't seem to remember anything from more than 5 pages back. In the end, I feel the time spent reading this book was mostly wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.....","review":"I had high hopes for this book, as I am a lover of historical fiction, particularly Roman. The first few pages seemed to support my hope, but then . . . My advice is to save your money. The book is a juvenile piece of literature, full of inconsistent behavoir by the main characters and a decided anti-Roman perspective. On the whole the author's portrayal of Romans is , at best, one dimensional and harshly judgemental. There is no depth to the story, no richness to the prose, no enthralling historical detail, just a bunch of words on a page. I made myself finish it as I forked over $25 for it, but suffice to say there are numerous better written historical fiction books out there. Thankfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this guy find a publisher???","review":"This book reads like an abridged version of Margaret George's \\"The Memoirs of Cleopatra\\" which was published in 1998. The two books are so similar that I figure there must be a real wealth of detailed historical information on Cleopatra's reign; no publisher could have taken a chance with something that appears to be plagarized. Don't bother with it - get George's book and enjoy the rich history and character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Entertainment","review":"What a glorious journey to ancient Egypt! This is a beautiful, racy, heartbreaking look into the past that is still completely accessible to modern readers. I loved Colin Falconer's Cleopatra--she was smart, real and had a great sense of humor, as well as being gorgeous. Everything a man could want or a woman should be! This was a terrific piece of historical fiction that entertains but doesn't insult a reader's intelligence. Highly recommended by this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, sexy and incredibly entertaining!","review":"I've read several fictional works about Cleopatra so I wasn't sure I really wanted to read another. But the beautiful jacket pulled me in and the writing didn't disappoint either! Colin Falconer writes with a modern flair that doesn't detract from the rich historical setting (his detail, by the way, is well-researched and beautifully rendered). I actually found the characters to be marvellously believable and touching, which is not easy for a male writer writing about a female character.I read a lot of historical fiction and this is one of the best new retellings of the ancient Egypt and Rome saga to come along in many years. I will recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I loved some previous novels set in ancient egypt and was hoping this would be the same - not so. It was not well written and didn't build any excitement as you get towards the end. I barely finished this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"... especially when compared with \\"The Memoirs of Cleopatra,\\" as so many people are doing. This book has some characterizations I did like -- namely, Caesarion as a spoiled palace brat and Antyllus as an insecure, awkward teen -- but the rest of it seems pretty lacking. Half the book seems to be sex scenes that might as well have come from some trashy teen romance novel, and Antony and Cleopatra are just too one-dimensional to be enjoyable. Check this one out from the library first, or borrow it from somebody, before you spend money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless characters - interesting background detail","review":"Although I found that reading this book was useful in terms of obtaining interesting information about historical Egypt, the background of the Egyptian royal line and some information about battles of the time, the characters themselves were hardly captivating. None of the characters seemed real or alive and although the storyline itself was interesting, I did not feel drawn into their experiences in any way. The sexual descriptions were fairly graphic in a somewhat disturbing, rather than sensual, way and did little to add to the story except in terms of sensationalizing the \\"outrageous\\" behavior of the characters. The author is clearly not adept at writing from a female perspective, which seems necessary to carry off a work of this type.Overall I would not recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too biased against men","review":"Although I found the descriptive prose to be very entertaining and informative for the settings and places, the same was not true for the characters and action. All men in this book are portrayed as egomaniacal tyrants, drunken fools, silly sycophants or chronic complainers. The women, on the other hand, are portrayed as clear-thinking, purposeful and virtuous victims of the men's excessively flawed personalities. I found it hard to believe that an army would follow any of these men despite documented history to the contrary. Additionally, I found descriptions of battles and major military engagements to be virtually non-existent. Perhaps the author considered actual events to be unimportant when compared to the need for further analysis of poor little Cleopatra's thoughts on her trials and tribulations."},{"rating":"1","title":"a blatant margaret george [copy]","review":"How to describe this...?The words stilted, one-dimensional, ... come to mind. Oh, make no mistake -his prose is pretty interesting, but it ultimately falls out in character development. His characters come off as caricatures (Cleopatra as a sexette, Caesar as a barbaric sugardaddy, Mark Anthony as a buffoon, etc) speaking in soap-opera dialogue, and the better descriptions are heavily borrowed from Margaret George's \\"Memoirs of Cleopatra\\". The latter is a MUCH better book -longer, but more interesting. If you're in a limbo over which to read, pick the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"When We Were Gods","review":"This book was one of the best I have read about Cleopatra and Julius Ceasar. It really brings out the true personalities of these chartacters and you really get to see what life mut have been like for Cleopatra. You remember that the great figures of the past are not so flawless as the marble statues carved of them. That makes this book so real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden characters, lacked interest","review":"I read this novel and read the Margaret George novel on Cleopatra right after. There is no comparison. Whereas George's characters have depth, Falconer's are one-dimensional. Would it really be possible for Antony to have been the total drunk portrayed here and have accomplished what he did? Would Cleopatra really have been attracted to such a lout? She seems too smart for that - but not in this book. The characters in this book are so lacking in depth and likable qualities I felt like I was just waiting for them to all die.The novel also lacked the richness of detail that attracts me to (good) historical novels and allows me to feel as though I am there - a witness to history. There are several good novels about Cleopatra.

If the villians were an advanced race of super-alliens, why were they defeated in 4 minutes?

Sadly, it is about as interesting as a Saturday morning cartoon. What really annoyed me was the lack of interest Marvel shows in this product.

Quality control people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"The Ultimates comic was skillfully written, socially relevant and brilliantly illustrated. The movie is a watered down, Saturday morning cartoon adaptation, probably aimed at people under 12.

Otherwise, just stick with the Justice League, it's much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to anyone","review":"No one knows anything about this movie. It hasn't been released yet. Either wait for it to come out THEN read the reviews, or just buy it.There was an article in Wizard Magazine about this. They (producers) said they wanted to keep the movie as close to the comic as possible. Some things were changed (like Giant Man being naked) to avoid problems with parents or the FCC or something like that. But in general, it's supposed to be much like the comic. Screen shots were also featured in the article, they were almost mirror images of the comic book panels. So maybe it will be a lot like it. Even if it's not exactly like it, I'm getting it anyway because I'm a fan of Marvel, The Avengers, and The Ultimates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been.","review":"I wish Amazon.com would allow for half-star ratings. The Ultimate Avengers Collection doesn't quite fall into what I consider 2-Star territory but it's certainly below a middle-of-the-road 3 Star average.These two films had a lot of potential but they just never delivered. It felt like I was watching a seriously edited version of a longer story that felt rushed and inconsistent. If you're not already familiar with the characters this isn't going to do much for you. The only real back story that's provided is on Captain America and The Black Panther. The other characters get little (if any) exposition on their origins powers. The animation seems oddly inconsistent as well; in some places the quality is very good and in others it's sloppy, poorly shaded, and just plain boring.I'm disappointed that Marvel seems unable to produce animated features of the same quality as DC has been able to do in recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice combination of Marvel classics","review":"Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and Hulk star amongst other larger than life superheros in this animated comic book story of a long brewing battle between Capain America and Nazi sympathizers, who also happen to be aliens. Animated and running around 70 minutes, this tight little story does not leave much to some of the character development, but does have plenty of action, and a strong enough plot to keep it movie along. There are just a few sub-plots to spice things up. I thought the animation was adequate, kept with a comic book feel, and managed to get dark enough when needed. I hope the second edition is as good as the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Save your money!","review":"The animation was on par with the Spiderman animation from saturday mornings decades ago.

Oh man, was that brutal! :D I advise all of you Avengers to Assemble to watch this movie! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda Ultimate, but Still Good","review":"I first watched these animations when they were new and I really enjoyed them. I had a issue with the slight grainy look of the picture quality. Sadly even with the Blu-Ray conversion it's still noticeable. The films themselves are still pretty good. Voice acting was great and had good action. The story was ok. It was great, but it held my attention. The story in the second movie was slightly better as the cast introduces Black Panther who I always thought was an interesting character. Overall, it's a pretty good. I just wish the picture quality was sharper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only recommend this to your worst enemies!","review":"I have never had my intelligence so thoroughly insulted in my entire life.

Or so I thought probably because I've seen the amazing Batman movies but this just pathetic. Boring, doesn't follow the comic at all or barely. Two stars because they focus on Cap who is my favorite marvel character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for kids","review":"As an adult reader of comics who loves The Ultimates, I have to say that this movie was quite a disappointment. The animation was surprisingly cheesy, reminding me more of the old Spiderman and His Amazing Friends than X-Men: Evolution. The story was confusing and lacked the wit and style of the comics. If the goal was to attract children to comics, then maybe the choices to dumb down the material and save on the animation costs make sense. If Marvel wants to find another way into the wallets of adult comic-lovers, though, I think it made a big mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"New but not improved","review":"This animated crossbreed of the original Avengers and Mark Millar's remarkable reincarnation The Ultimates fails both titles equally. It lacks the both earnest charm of the original comic as well as the Matrix-esque glitz and gusto that makes The Ultimates one of the most readable and cleverly modern comics published today. Additionally, the special features fall short with a long winded (and inexplicably Millar-less) documentary on the Avengers past, present and future that would bore even the least discriminating fan boy to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad storyline but good ending!","review":"I watched this animated movie many times and would really give it 3 and a half starts. The storyline was not so good which involved mainly stopping the Red Skull and an alien invasion of Earth. The ending of this movie was the best action part. It involved the Hulk badly beating up Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and this other guy who can grow into a giant. Like someone said earlier, if you're a Incredible Hulk fan, you'll love the ending of this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this so....","review":"Disappointing?

Considering they had brilliant source material and a model for successful comic adaptation to animation (DCs properties) the only excuse for this pedestrian knockoff is a cash grab. The animation is mediocre 1980s Saturday morning, the direction is artless and the story is just a timid outline of what it could have been. Dull. I don't know what's more insulting; teasing the audience with Hitch's illustrations in the end credits or the Special Features material where Avi and company gush about how hard they worked bringing the book to life. I suspect the only envelope they pushed was with schedule and budget. It's a rushed, empty affair that with fit in well with the rest of Marvel's cinematic offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent first entry","review":"I held off writing a review until I had actually watched the movie. It's mostly traditional style animation, but there are a few jarring bits of over-processed CGI generated animation that never looks good when integrated with 2D artwork.To the purists, no, it's not \\"really the Ultimates\\", but lets be real... You aren't going to see Hank Pym beating his wife Janet in an American animated feature. It just won't happen.I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of the character development from the comic. There's a nice bit with Cap and Bucky, there's a scene between Black Widow and Tony Stark. The relationship between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross shows a decent level of complication for an animated feature.The weakest point is the voice-acting which is really lacking. It's like what a committee might think Thor or Nick Fury sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste","review":"I love animation. I am a big comic book fan. When I heard that this was coming out I was pretty excited. The Ultimates is one of the best books Marvel is producing today. After seeing a few clips of this I was totally disappointed. The animation is sub par, the voice overs are on par with an average Saturday morning cartoon. There is nothing in here that even resembles the Ultimates from the book. I have the feeling that Marvel did it this way so they could market this to a preteen audience and sell the heck out of toys. Maybe even put in syndication on the Kids WB. I guess I can not fault Marvel for wanting to make a dollar or two but they will not be getting any of my dollars. It would have been nice to see a version come out that was true to the Ultimates, marketed to an older audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Thor fans","review":"It dragged a bit, not a whole lot of action. More Nick Fury than anything else. Cap was OK, Iron Man was mediocre, but that was about it. Thor was majorly disappointing. Thor came off as some beer drinking wierdo with very little presense in the film. And what's up with Hulk picking up Mjollnir and using it against Thor?? WRONG!!!! NO ONE ELSE CAN PICK UP HIS HAMMER!!!!!!! Thor should have been kicking major butt, but not here. Thor is the GOD OF THUNDER, show him that way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and mindless superhero entertainment","review":"While apparently not for the comic book geek crowd, those of us who are just superhero fans and enjoy a little comic action will enjoy this as did I, my husband and my 6 year old son. To those who said too violent for kids, I respectfully disagree. I watched it before showing it to my son and saw little problem. So, my bottom line:1. If nipples on the batsuit bothered you to the point of suicidal ideation, you won't like this movie.2. If you know every Avenger comic hero and their alias, you won't like this movie.3. If you are just a regular joe (or josephine), who likes a little comic action entertainment, get this movie and you will probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great -- if you like wearing your coffee instead of drinking it..","review":"I received this mug yesterday as a replacement for an old one that I loved but had begun leaking.

I tried dumping the coffee (or what was left) out and filling the cup with water to test it out, and replaced the lid, being sure to tighten it up to remove user error.

But as the previous reviewer notes (with 5 stars nonetheless), the Beethoven has to be the most emotionally detached ever recorded. Is this following \\"the composer's intentions\\"? Given the other works Beethoven wrote during the same period, it seems extremely unlikely.This is a \\"radical, off-the-wall\\" rendering, rather than a traditionalist one. No amount of technique can cover up for that fact. And the reality is it is not even very musical. Listen to the divinity of the Menuhin/Furtwangler recording, or that of Kreisler, or even, much more recently, Hilary Hahn's, and one easily sees that Heifetz is way off base. Yes, I admire his technique, greatly, but it is technique used for no discernible or serviceable purpose.

It is an academic writing that gives deep exploration of the existing literature on the subject under study and provides fascinating insight into the complexities of migrations and migrants. It is also a literary work that is written in poetic style and fraught with endless philosophical thoughts.Iain Chambers in this book successfully challenges the belief that we are living in a unitary world with linear history and homogenous culture. Reading this book is a journey that leads us through the diversities surrounding and defining us. Along the journey, we will be given many interesting perspectives to look at the fact that we have increasingly realized - we are living between worlds and cultures that are shaped by as well as shaping different migrants, languages, and histories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bust-Up and put in the trash","review":"First off, it's tiny.

I became an instructor and have continued practicing over the subsequent years. If you have no prior experience with tai chi this is a good place to start. You will learn the correct external form of the Yang large style. This is just the 27 short form but you will have enough grounding so you can begin to learn the 108 long form in the future if desired.There is a great deal more to be learned than can be given in this short video,I still have original VHS, but I find myself coming back to it every now and then to refresh my memory of the patient and good friend that Marshall became. You will not learn the internal mechanics or energy circulation from this DVD but that is something to look forward to...tai chi chuan is a life long and very beneficial practice.For those who wish more advanced material I recommend Bruce FrantzisBagua and Tai Chi: Exploring the Potential of Chi, Martial Arts, Meditation and the I Ching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic and useful","review":"For those who are housebound or find themselves working in a limited capacity in public due to health issues; Marshall Hoo's dvd provides a good regimen of the 27 tai chi forms. The temple exercises that precced the lessons in tai chi are of good value as well. I plan on coming back to this one time and again along with tai chi for arthritis which I plan to purchase later."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"I get so many compliments on my ring, and i just giggle, thinking if you only knew how much we paid for it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like it came out of a quarter machine","review":"I bought this ring because I wanted something I could wear all the time and not worry about losing it or damaging it. The design is a good idea and had potential but the center stone is too big and it is set in a way that makes it look like it came from a quarter machine. It has a \\"childs ring\\" look to it. It's sparkles beautifully I just don't like the way it sits. It just looks fake! They also don't fit \\"together\\" as closely as I think they should.

The prose is terse and scathing at times, but nonetheless enjoyable. After this intro, the work launches into an indefatigable cornacopia of isomporphic confabulations and tricksters that will confound the most seasoned arithmetatic pundit. Occasionally bordering on the obscure, the work is still satisfying in that it aims a powerful spotlight at undiscovered country in the aboninable world of pattern logic and isomorphic decay theoroms.

However, you must have a cable box in order to record on VHS tapes (it only plays DVDs).I called Comcast, our cable company, and they confirmed that while those receiving cable without boxes WILL get digital TV in February, they WILL NOT be able to record off devices that don't have tuners -- and the Sony SLV-281P does not have one. Comcast suggested waiting until February, when such units will have digital tuners that will accept its COAX without a cable box. By the way, the seller charged me the 8.54% Los Angeles sales tax, but when I returned the unit I was refunded only the 7.50% sales tax that is in effect where I live.

The Usher, Ludacris and Lil Jon collaborative effort may be the highlight of the CD, but every cut, even the Rick Rubin produced, Don't F*** Wit Me rings out.

Jadakiss, NaS, Ice Cube, Bun B & T.I. are so bad, that it makes you think: \\"who can f#& up a track featuring NaS?\\" the answer is = Lil' John!And then The Source Magazine crowns Lil' John as the best producer of 2005! that really lowered their standart.All in all: This is a violation of hip hop, a rape of a proud culture.track 1-19: 0/10track 20: 2/10it shouldn't be necessary to say anything more about this album.instead, check out \\"Late Registratiion\\", Immortal Technique, Non Phixion, Outkast, Common, Gang Starr, R.A.

Starting off with \\"Get Low\\" and it's remix, Culo, Saltshaker, Neva Eva, No Problem, , Freek-A-Leek, My Goodies, Yeah!, What You Gon' Do and finally Lovers & Friends. It's great music for the club and to listen to once in a while on the radio..., but a whole cd is simply too much to handle (sorry!?). One can tell that this CD is a little more mainstream than \\"Kings Of Crunk\\", since Lil' Jon included some radio friendly tracks, such as \\"Lovers and Friends\\", \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"Stick That Thang Out\\", but I just can listen to this CD the whole way thru. All you hear is *%&$!?. With the exception of Lil' Scrappy's, Ludacris's and Ice Cube's verse the rappin' on this CD is very, very poor, but people buy this CD for \\"Lovers and Friends\\" (Which in my opinion would rather fit on Usher's \\"Confessions\\" CD) and the crazy beats.

Now all this craze over crunk music has come and Lil John makes millions of dollars off of being crunk, which to me is another word for screaming and acting ignorant.

Lovers and Friends might have been a great song for the ladies until Lil Jon decided it was a good idea to rap and ruined the old Michael Sterling classic. More Disposables: Da Blow(chopped and screwed up garbage), One Night Stand, Stick That Thing Out(the second worst track on here), Stop F*****g Wit Me(the worst track one here and Lil Jon gets to annoy metalheads with his bad rapping on this rock/rap infusion. Big Plus!), Awww Skeet(What the.....?) and the rest of this album. Bottom Line: Lil Jon is the worst thing to come out of ATL since..........Jermaine Dupri!

It's quite obivous that Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz(Big Sam & Lil' Bo) can't write good lyrics or any at all, which is why that have artists like Ice Cube, Ludacris, Nas, Bun B and other various rap artists to do the majority of the rapping. Also, the skits in this album are rather pointless, it serves no purpose to the album. The only good songs are \\"Grand Finale\\" and \\"Real Nigga Roll Call\\". Everything else is just pure trash.

Yeah, it's a few dollars more, but believe me, it's well worth it as the remixes are amazing. Here's what you do: Burn a copy of it for yourself, but replace tracks 11-20 with the 10 remix tracks on the bonus CD. The only downside is that \\"Grand Finale\\" from the album won't fit, that's a great track, (I guess you could leave out a remix and put it on it if you want or whatever) but other than that, if you do this, you won't have to skip a track!

Dre, Green Lantern, Whoo Kidd, Just Blaze, Kanye West; These are decent producers. Lil' Jon doesn't even make proper music. He just uses electronica zips and whirrs to form a repetitive and dull beat. God, even a Crazy Frog rap would be better than this. Where has Hip-Hop gone wrong? Well, Lil' Jon sure had a lot to do with it. This only got 1 star because there were no negative ratings. You should be payed to get this album, and counselled/shot if you actually play it. Even if you're trip out it sounds like [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lil Jon: Crunk Juice","review":"I just don't see why so many people like this music. Oh, my bad, I should even call this music so I'll just call it Lil Jon music. Lil Jon's music a just a bunch of crap but some of his songs are good for clubs and such. He has banging beats but they all sound the same, he recycles to much to be honest. The only song I really like off this album is \\"Grand Finale.\\" Nas and Ice Cube tear it up on that track no question. All Lil Jon says is \\"YEAH\\" and \\"OK\\" which gets really annoying really fast. All Lil Jon does is yell out cuss words and constantly degrades women. I could do this music and sell records if I wanted to. It just goes to show how easy it is to make it big and make money these days. I'm not even going to go any further with this review because it's a waste of my time.

With freestyles from professional artists like T.I., Ludacris, Bun B, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Eminem, Mase, and Fat Joe. And singers as Usher, R. Kelly and Nate Dogg. On album cd with hits like 'What U Gon' Do', 'Roll Call', and 'Lovers and Friends'. Remx cd features 'Lean Back (Remix)', 'Let's Go (Remix)', and 'Roll Call Crunk Rock Remix'. And finally with an hour long DVD which shows tv performances, making of the album, and the 'What U Gon' Do' video. Personally, my favorite song is the 'Grand Finale'.

Don't let anyone deceive you. Lil John is one of a bajillion of other Lil retards floating around that should be shot for a horrendifying lack of originality and importance.

I got quickly tired of this album b/c I got tired of hearing Lil' Jon saying one thing and The East Side boys repeating it as if they had no brain to contribute their own words to the tracks. Yeah yeah I know, they were just doing what they were told to do, but gosh...How much can a brotha take of those poor boys yelling!? What it all comes down to is what the listener is looking for; if he merely looking for phat beats and a hook, then this cd is what you need.

People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex.

He has always been big since the early '90s, but slowly he worked his way up to the top of the game. Not known for his albums, but mostly his productions, he has churned out the biggest productions of the new millennium. The producer of \\"Yeah!\\" and \\"Get Low\\" is now back with his crew, The Eastside Boyz, and while Crunk Juice is just an extention of his previous work, it is the bust crunk album ever made. It is certainly a lot to digest. The record is obviously very in your face, and that may be its only fault. Most of the record is perfect, and the production sizzles. Crunk lovers will treat this album like a bible, and with too many highlights to mention, this album is pure hotness!

Another positive is the song \\"Grand Finale,\\" you can always expect quality from Nas and Jadakiss. I didn't know Lil Jon was so strapped for cash that he had to recycle beats. But check out \\"In Da Club,\\" by R. Kelly and Ludacris. It is a recycled \\"Red Light,\\" by Usher that Lil Jon also produced.

It may take a good dictionary to clarify the meanings of some expressions; it does not have to be the Technical Dictionary of Scientology, the Shorter Oxford will be quite sufficient.

I simply had to quit reading after the second use of \\"wondering\\" instead of wandering on the same page.

Yet it is a dissapointment. There seems little coordination between the violinist and the orchestra. All pieces are played too fast, by my opinion, especially the 1st movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. It is even somewhat disastrous. It sounds as if everyone is in a rush to catch a train. Perlman's version is much better. The Mendelssohn pieces are better. However, they are still to my dislike."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars? weird ...","review":"Both pieces are played way too fast for a romantic concerto. The technical expertise of Heifetz is breathtaking, but this is not what these concertos are about.

It was old had a different cover but I had been looking for a Heifetz recording of the Tchaikovsky. At that time he was the only violinist I knew alot about at that time. So I bought and it's a very good CD. I realize that he does play to fast now that I have heard countless other recordings of both concertos, but I think this is still a good buy. I really enjoy his Canzonetta. His usual focused vibrato and cold sound make this movement sound very good. The Mendelssohn I have to say is way to fast with very little or no vibrato. Look at the title of the first movement. It's supposed to be played with passion. Even though I have some criticism I think this is an overall good CD. For a better Tchaikovsky get Milstein. He does it amazingly well. For Mendelssohn get Szeryng. His is played at just the right speed with lots of vibrato"},{"rating":"2","title":"A collector's item","review":"I have both the vinyl(mono) & CD. I have heard this recording countless times and I am still not tired of it. Heifetz played this piece to perfection. I don't have say anymore about his impeccable technique. He takes a fast tempo and captures the mood, especially in the 3rd movement. He doesn't take the usual 1st repeat in the 1st movement, but not much is lost. Fritz Reiner & CSO accompanied him well.

If you're a metal fan or love the industrial-metal hybrid, this might be up your alley.

Pleaseeveryone says how great Charlie is. And I do agree that there was a spark that will not be able the be match with all of them together. However, there isn't one on the whole show that didn't add to that spark and is not equally talented and funny. Give them all credit people. Charlie certainly did not pull the whole show by himself.

Good selection of bearing sizes. The only thing that is difficult is that you need to look at the chart closely to assemble the correct bearing,bolt and washer for desired depth. Takes a couple minutes to do but I don't think there is another way of doing it. So don't lose the directions or other small parts. I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Separation of Facts & Fiction","review":"A refreshing take on The Spanish Inquisition. Henry Kamen separates the facts from the myths. As a Spanish Literature major at UCLA, I found this book very useful and impartial. Kamen gives data that is very interesting to say the least. Dates and people are mentioned, something that lacks in many books. He presents dates from very reliable sources. The footnotes are almost extreme but it is a job well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Read","review":"This book spent so much time trying to minimize the impacts of the Inquisition that, grasping for facts, left the prose stiff and dry. Perhaps like the arguments the author made, also stiff, dry and strained.The issue is not how many died and that the prison conditions were not bad compared to regular felons. Kamen misses the point. The Inquisition did not target felons but, to use an old phrase, those who marched to a different drum.That is the real tragedy of the Inquisition. It stifled thought... and perhaps silenced many who would have contributed much to Spanish political thought and culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to justifiy torture and murder!","review":"This book reminds me of books that try to convince you that the holacost did not happen. This book is nothing but a cheap attempt to downplay and justify the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of men, women and even children by the catholic church. By the way, the pope has never admitted that the inquisition was wrong. But then this is the same institution that threated to burn anyone alive that did not beleive that the earth was the center of the universe, and they did not admitt this mistake untill 1989!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure OK, it wasn't SO bad,,,, as long as you weren't a Jew","review":"I really felt this work was seeking to validate the author's personal opinions. We must remember that this is one man's viewpoint. And again, he was not there. The book seemed to me to try too hard to minimize the facts, and put them into some kind of \\"author's personal perspective\\". It reminded me of books I've read trying to downplay the Holocaust, diminishing the number of innocents killed. Does any of it really diminish the power of the Inquisition? Even if it was fear and power, people still were tortured and died. I just felt there was too much self-promotion of the author's lifelong views in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of my favorites, go for the older works.","review":"If you're interested in how Adler can help interpret the gospel stories of Jesus, see The Psychology of Jesus.

Essentially, it will help you stay afloat if you have the periodic question or need a refresher, but it wont save you if you are completely lost in terms of grammer rules.

The rest of the band made this album in the early 90s with some other dude singing. It has a bit of an industrial sound to it, complete with lots of \\"industrial\\" sound effects in the background, like clanging metal pipes etc. The song \\"Murder Inc.\\" prominently features the sounds of a dot matrix printer, a real blast from the past. Geordie gets in some decent KJ style guitar riffs but the singer just isn't Jaz Coleman. He sounds a bit like a second rate David Bowie and personally I just don't think his voice is well suited to the music. A lot of the songs seem to end very abruptly, like they were a bit hurried putting this album out. The last song, \\"Mrs. Whiskey Name\\", is an ill-conceived traditional drinking song with drumming.

And you payed for that privilage. A facinating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This book was boring!! The ending was dumb and frankly I thought the story was pointless. Basically it's about a man who falls into a coma and he thinks that he is awake then leaves the hospital. When he gets home and falls asleep, he wakes up to find all these wierd things happening to him. These illusions or daydreams that he has makes him realize that he never woke up from the coma, so he tries different things to wake himself up like strolling down memory lane. This story builds you up with suspense but at the end you will be VERY disappointed. I would not waste my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"It was really interesting in the beginning, but got lame in the end.

The entire time I was breezing through this \\"novella\\" I was remembering my second grade teacher scolding me for always finishing my stories with \\"And then I woke up.\\" While the writing may be intentionally sparse, the narrative construction borders on adolescent. By the time you finish, you'll have wished you saved a couple dollars and gone to the movies... or better yet, rented Jacob's Ladder and ordered a pizza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Read","review":"This book, was at the most, strange. At the least, boring. I didn't understand the point. If I wanted to read about consciousness and dreamlike states I would read a non-fiction book. This just didn't do it for me. It takes you through an attack(which was weakly described) to a man in a coma, who appears to wake, then realizes all his experiences since the accident are a dream in his comatose state. I found it to be pointless, and wondered throughout the book, is there a point to all this? The ending was anticlimactic, and really wasn't an ending at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"This is the kind of thing one writes in their first Creative Writing class -- and properly never shows anyone ever again. Unimaginative, unoriginal, sloppily constructed, and it ends poorly.Anyone who has read Phillip K. Dick (and if you haven't, buy something by him instead) will be amazed at the shallow work here. I give it an extra star for the woodcuts, which are attractive and clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you awake or asleep?","review":"Coma by Alex Garland is a quirky journey into a dreamlike reality. It is a mystery that never quite unravels itself. The story unwinds with a gripping feeling of reality all its own and at the end you find yourself wondering if it just a dream, or something else. Garland does an exception job of capturing the jerky, suddenly awake, feeling throughout the story. It all seems to take place in those few seconds when the mind is between asleep and awake and grasping for that place where the dream breaks off and reality takes over. The work is unusual in that it manages to capture the wandering, disjointed feelings of almost being awake and it leaves you wondering if the character is really waking up or has been awake all along. It is short, artful, interesting and intriguing like all Garland's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsequential Nonsense","review":"Having read both of his earlier works, I eagerly anticipated reading \\"The Coma\\". Sadly, it disappoints on all levels. It is short, turgid and unimaginative. Surprising, given both his skills and the subject matter, but there it is. For a far better read on the subjects of conciousness and coma, readers should try \\"The Bridge\\" by Iain Banks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so short","review":"I can't argue that the story was not gripping, but I read it in an hour............Ater such a long wait since The Tesseract I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous","review":"I was a big fan of Mr. Garland's debut novel \\"The Beach,\\" less so of \\"The Tesseract,\\" and while I was entertained by his latest effort, I can't say it compares favorably to the narrative drive and thrill of his first book. \\"The Coma\\" is essentially a short story interspersed with some interesting wood cut illustrations by his father that really serve little purpose beyond bulking up the page count. You keep turning the pages in hopes that some sort of narrative thread will be picked up, only to discover by book's end that you're more-or-less right back where you started with little illumination, and you'll be hard-pressed an hour later to even remember the characters' names.Still, Garland is a talented writer and I will keep buying his books in hopes that the next one will achieve the same literary heights as his debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong start...lame ending","review":"This novella starts off competently with an attack on the tube and the narrators' subsequent descent into what he first thinks are hallucinations and then brain damage only to discover he's actually in a coma. From this chilling and intriguing concept it deteriorates into a dream world where questions are never quite answered only born. Garland's examination of consciousness is written too lightly and sparcely for my liking. Lame ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"So lame... (spoiler alert)","review":"Okay, so The Coma had some nice turns of phrase, and Garland succeeded in weaving a swoony, disturbing tale that certainly piqued my interest, BUT... the ending was so much crap I can't even believe his editors let him get away with it. \\"I woke up and it was all a dream?\\" Boooooo! How stupid. He had the frame for a beautiful dark story, and completely wasted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No resolution","review":"I recently purchased this novel because I loved The Beach and was thoroughly entranced by the writing style involved in The Tesseract. Though Alex Garland's writing style is always (in my experience) amusing and unusual, I was definitely not a fan of this novel. Granted, as the covers stated, it was a book that was difficult to put down. However, it was sort of like watching a movie on pay-per-view and having your cable cut out before the last 30 minutes. It was very disappointing for that one aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring re-interpretation of opera classics","review":"Opera lovers beware: These may be opera songs, but this is not opera music.

Other than that it was good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"When I picked up this book I thought it would be enjoyable since I love other British authors, such as Louise Rennsion. But this book, made me ill. In the series by Louise Rennison, she manages to take teen life and make it highly enjoyable and almost ridicoulously funny. I found this book nothing like it. The main character Janet, doesn't stop whining for about 200 pages about how crazy her family is, and I don't understand why she is complaining so much.I wasn't planning on finishing the book but I did anyway, and it did not get any better. As a whole the plot line could of been great but it was overshadowed by Janet's ability to blow everything out of proportion and complain about the littlest things."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST books I've ever read","review":"First off, I just want to say that if I could give this book no stars, I would.

Skip this book.","review":"I don't recall the author's other books being quite as bad as this one. I almost didn't make it to the end, but I did--and save yourself the trouble--it wasn't worth it. The hero and heroine were amoral, \\"do as I say and not as I do\\" characters who saw nothing wrong with orgies, pornography, or forgery.And what was with the heroine's other family members? An aunt/servant(?) who looked the other way no matter what her nieces did, including sexual misconduct and forgery. One sister who lived in la-la land except when she chose to come out of it and make perfect sense. One sister who was a cross-dresser. And the youngest sister who was constantly being pulled out of trouble if the others cared enough to check on her. I could go on with the problems in the book, but I think you get the gist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable Hunter - Much better than typical Regency","review":"Althought the title makes one cringe, the content is classic Hunter with characters who have depth, and a much more interesting view of the Regency period than the endless (boring) rounds of parties, frothy dress details, who was \\"bad\\" and who is \\"good\\" and the usual angst about the \\"ton\\" that is the usual historic romance. Other reviews will give plot details. You will enjoy the fact that there is in fact a plot. This is a sensuous book, probably a bit more than the other titles in her regency series, but the love making is carefully done to fit the characters and not for effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome glimpse into the underworld of GenX music!","review":"Couldn't put it down! Everyone I know who has read this absolutely loves it! It is a many-faceted reading experience, full of side-splitting humor, pathos and drama. The characters are incredibly well drawn and believable. Even though this is \\"based on\\" the DJ's experiences, I am sure it is about as real as it can get without giving away identities. It is even educational and informative, regarding the radio and DJ industry. Best of all, it has a spiritual dimension, which is hard to define in a brief review.

This book was full of narrative, had little dialog (stilted in some places, awkward in others)and the author basically told us a story rather than let us experience Amara and Keino's love for ourselves through wonderful dialog and skillful scene plotting.

Here he performs two works by Max Bruch and Henri Vieuxtemps' 5th Concerto. These recordings were made in the early 1960s long before Mr. Dolby's noise reduction inventions so you'll hear some tape hiss. However, this CD isn't about sound quality, it's about how well Mr. Heifetz plays the fiddle. His performance of Bruch's Concerto No. 1 in G-minor demonstrates why it should remain in the repertoire. It compares well with Brahms' violin concerto. No matter how difficult the passage, Heifetz tosses it off effortlessly while conveying all the passion and romanticism of the music. Bruch's Scottish Fantasy is a delight and the lesser known Vieuxtemps work is full of virtuosities that Heifetz surmounts with aplomb. Listen to these works by other violinists and Heifetz invites you to compare his performances with theirs. Heifetz always comes out on top. No contest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heifetz give the best performance of Bruch & Vieuxtemps","review":"I really liked the CD. Two composers who are less known during the romantic era but are just as good as Beethoven and Chopin. The Bruch concerto starts with a very quick energetic but romantic first movement. The second movement is the beautiful second movement which doesn't sound very adaigio. The third movement is my favorite. It is very energetic fast and yet has a very beautifuyl sound. The vieuxtemps is a great piece of music. The first movement starts off with a slow allegro and yet the second movement seems faster because it has more energy even though it's an adaigio. Then it goes into a very brief but energetic last movement. I highly recomend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I have three recordings of the Bruch VC, Perlman, Midori, Kyung Wha Chung,and all of them are pretty good, with Perlman standing out in the group of three, but when I heard Heifetz's rendition I was blown away. The 1st movement, which is played quite often, had a new flair to it that made me feel like i HADNT heard the piece 1000 times. The second movement was very heartfelt and the best I have heard, along with the technically perfect 3rd mvt. As for the Scottish Fantasy, it's the best around, and I havent really listened to teh Vieuxtemps yet, but so far an AWESOME CD, especially the VC, a must have!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for the Hits","review":"This album serves up the hits only. The rest of the songs have great guitar dynamics but that is the extent of it. \\"Cabo Wabo\\" is good, but not until you get to almost the end of the song, and that isn't cool. \\"Mine All Mine\\" is interesting, at the beginning of the song you don't know what you're in for, but the tone is a bit darker and it has kind of a catchy chorus. I use catchy losely, what I really mean it has a certain melody to it that appeals to me. It's not a bad album opener. Everything else is making me yawn. You may want to stick to the hits here, the fav has to be \\"When It's Love\\" and also \\"Feels So Good\\" those two songs make it worth the purchase, \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" is a good song as well. This album is too varied as far as good songs spread over ok songs thrown in with some terrible songs. It's too sketchy for me and is recommended for die-hards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Halen","review":"Needless to say, \\"Red Rocker\\" Hagar pulls out all the stops on this one - this is Halen at their hardest, at their absolute finest. Save for Cherone who steps in later on, there's just nothing better than hearing the piercing wails of Hagar as he tells us like it is, boy!!OU812 features Halen's biggest hits, and MTV rocketed these boys to #1 with a bullet.

When It's Love takes another poke at the Beatles with it's Hey Jude ending, then it's straight into the tank with A.F.U (Naturally Wired).

Is this Van Halen???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"While I thought \\"Feels So Good' was okay, the rest of thealbum was below-par. \\"When It's Love\\" was too sappy, and\\"Finished What Ya Started\\" had ridiculous lyrics.

Don't believe me? Hum the well known \\"Ode to Joy\\" tune during the chorus of \\"When It's Love\\" and hold the last three notes of the melody twice as long as Beethoven gave them. See what I mean?

Van Halen started out as a great band but have gradually lost it. And bringing on Sammy Hagar sure didn't make things better. \\"OU812\\" is just mediocre at best.

None of the songs are very engaging and to be honest I actually had to look at the track listing to remember what was on it. My lack of memory wasn't due to not being informed it was in fact due to remembering that there really wasn't anything note worthy on it (and I had to check the list to make sure I wasn't mistaken). I have most all of VH's cds and this one is played the least in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM","review":"LISTENED TO AN OLD COPY AS I WAS GOING THROUGH MY CASSETTES THE OTHER DAY AND FORGOT HOW GOOD THIS WAS JUST PICKED UP THE CD VERSION OF IT AND WILL ALSO GET VINYL VERSION OF IT WORTH HAVING I THINK NEXT TO THE VH FIRST ALBUM THIS IS ONE OF THEIR BEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pop album","review":"This is not my favorite Van Halen album but it's my favorite with Sammy Hagar. Doesn't have the rock edge or hipness of the early Van Halen stuff, but the songwriting, at least as far as pop music goes, is a lot better. Musicianship is polished and production is slick.Every song on here is pretty good. It's the last Van Halen album that I felt this way about, which may be part of why I kind of lost interest after this one. Or maybe I'm getting old?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Halen - Good, But Not Great","review":"The second of the Van Hagar era albums is fairly similar to the first one. The title is a jab at David Lee Roth's first solo album \\"Eat Em And Smile\\". The keyboards are toned down a bit on this one, compared to the last two and the guitar more up front for the most part. Hagar's lyrics are a mix of attempted profundity and juvenile sexist schlock like the first single \\"Black And Blue\\". The album produced several huge hits most notably \\"Finish What Ya Started\\", and \\"When It's Love\\" both slightly atypical of Van Halen's usual fare. Hager includes what has become one of his theme songs in the infectious \\"Cabo Wabo\\" where he now famously owns the famous Cabo Wabo Cantina nightclub in Cabo San Lucas Mexico. For the most part if you like \\"5150\\" you will probably like this one as well. I rate them about the same with Hagar in fine voice and Van Halen screaming on guitar. Good stuff for the most part, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice WATCH!","review":"I'm normally a gold person, but it was time for change. This is a great watch for the price.

Ms. Matthew's recording still holds the \\"gold standard\\" for me. Her playing is heartfelt, well-informed, tender, genuine, and tonally luscious. The live acoustic (recorded in a small church in rural Iowa) and light hand in editing make this recording feel like a live performance, with all of the spontaneity and musical abandon you don't usually hear in a commercial recording.

I sent a message to the seller and they immediately refunded my money although they didnt send me a new battery. So they sent me the wrong battery but refunded my money and told me to dispose of it properly. I would have rather received the correct battery for my phone since it still has a bad battery but the company did me well by refunding my money.

I bought this for one of the 5 handsets because I don't want to break up the set. I almost decided to throw the whole set away and get one of the newer dect phones. I might just do that in the near future, though I insist on my motto of making my stuff last long before sending them to the dump."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for all Uniden phones using BT-446 model battery","review":"This is more of a NOTE to would-be buyers.I bought this due to all the good reviews and the description that it's for Uniden cordless phones using model BT-446 battery. When battery arrived, it turns out this battery had a specific list of Uniden phones listed on its packaging. My Uniden cordless phone using BT-446 was NOT on the list ! Why that list is NOT part of the product description is anybody's guess.Allowing MY stupidity to take over, I still tried to see if maybe it would still work on my phone.Bad move. It burned my phone in just a few minutes. Now I have one less phone. Again, that part is MY mistake. If Amazon still does not show a list of phones that this battery works with, just remember tocheck the packaging when you receive the battery and don't do as I did. Return it if your phone is not on the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"This is a great book, with brilliant choices.

With satanic and socially critical lyrics and imagery, this may appear to be a run of the mill underground rock album, but EVIL MOTHERS manage to deliver their own twist and tricks to the sound that has at least this Goth shouting \\"I HATE EVERYTHING\\" in the darkest hours of the night and the most absurd times of day. Recommended to buy for fans of Industrial Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVIL!","review":"One word to describe this album is \\"evil\\".I stress this band is one of the most talented and underground bands when it comes to blasphamy.

This traces a detailed, highly effective study of the role of gender in colonial power. Exploring four specific issues, Sinha traces ways that the representation of colonial women was crucial for the politics of self-justifying the exercise of white power over colonial men.

I was expecting great things from the son of blues man Tabby Thomas. King switched labels with this albums and appears to be experimenting with sounds and styles with this cd.Chris Thomas King starts with a haunting minor key blues song called Why Blues. In this song he uses some scratching techniques. He includes a couple of soul inspired songs - Stay Just as You are and You are My Heaven. These are not to my taste. He also has a rap styled song called Cain. His straight up blues are excellent. Like Father, like Son, Gambling woman, Bourban Street Blues and Stones in My Passway are excellent.I applaud King for experimenting with sounds and hope he finds a groove that is comfortable for both himself and blues fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Relationship","review":"I was loooking forward to this book after reading one other by this auther.

Check your box first, you may have to move some around to free up space on your box for these doubles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Love Interest - Bedazzled","review":"Bedazzled is a very catchy song and I enjoyed it a lot. Seems to me though that the remixes, for the most part, are very much unnecessary, they are either too similar or too obscure, not really anything solid. All you really need is one of these mixes and then you can move on with your life. I like the Blue Velvet Mix, but it is very short. I would have to say this is a nice effort, but why form a new project just to release one song? Perhaps Chris Connelly was trying to follow in Al Jourgensen's footsteps, but folks, this is no Acid Horse. A nice try, but he could have done better with this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender, funny, enriching","review":"Once upon a time, I ordered whole slew of literary magazines to get an idea of the landscape. I read hundreds of stories, and what I saw impressed me. There are an awful lot of talented writers out there.But one story in particular stood out from all the rest. It was called \\"Larsen's Novel,\\" and it achieved something that seemed almost magical to me. It was smart, tender, touching, laugh-out-loud hilarious and, I swear, edifying. I became an instant Steve Almond junkie.This collection includes \\"Larsen's Novel\\" other equally bewitching stories, most notably \\"Wired for Life\\" and the title story, \\"The Evil B.B. Chow.\\" But those are my personal preferences. If you love a writer who bravely digs into the deepest corners of the human psyche, you'll buy this book and choose your own favorites--stories that will find a place inside you and never leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almond is Here","review":"Almond is a master of the American short story. While stuffy academics keep reminding us that the short story as a form is dead or dying, Almond is penning tales that aim for both the head and heart, that are invigorating, sexy, and serious. His depiction of people is nothing less than what it should be: accurate and compassionate. He cares for his people the way only a seasoned writer will. We know Almond's characters; they live next door to us, they live right under our own roofs. THE EVIL BB CHOW is cause for celebration. Here is a story collection that isn't afraid to confront the absurdity of our world, or to relish the beauty when it is found. If Almond's first story collection, MY LIFE IN HEAVY METAL, was the promise, then THE EVIL BB CHOW is the consummation."},{"rating":"2","title":"dis book good but","review":"not as carefully composed, mon, as de \\"heffy metal\\" book which haved de best steve almon' story, \\"My Life in Heavy Metal.\\" he write de good about de sex--yes. at times he stories break--or better, blossom--into de mos' mellifluous passages, mon. de almost like poetry--startling sentences wiff combination de words you never dreamed of, mon. mostly, mon, dis guy write about DESIRE--and dat a very universal thing. he one horny dude, as well. when he write about Mandy Shaw, character in one de stories, a co-ed wiff a cheesecloth haltertop, mon--i want de sex her up too! dis like literary pornography sometime, mon. i teach steve almond at de university (secret: i not Jamaican, mon, i just bored!)--major university i cannot say which (OK it be NYU some years, UCLA others! hahahaha).

I love it. This is exciting music to me. Not the music out there right now. It challenges you to think about what makes a good song, a good hook. That in my opinion is what bands like Pigface are meant to do.Plus I love Ogre and Paul Raven(RIP).Way to go Atkins, you are one hell of a drummer. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fook this","review":"For those primarily involved in the noise-drenched, atonal reverb familiar to primitive industrial acts such as early Ministry or Skinny Puppy in minimal mode, Fook will feel right at home in the collection. For all others judging content based simply on what is there, unfortunately there is not a whole lot besides the lousy anarchic posturing amidst bleak, underdeveloped electronica and monster-like vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Jane","review":"What a poor little girl!!! It is really sad how the parents used their daughters for personal advancement. Lady Jane was a victim of the tudor times. She had parents whom did not love her as parents should love thier children and used her for thier own personal advancements. I do not want to spoil the story for anyone, but it was a good read. In the end, I imagine Jane must have welcomed death, as she would finally be free from her abusive family and free from being an instrument of treason. Her life could have been very different had she had different parents. I hope she found peace in heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Let me begin by saying that I love Alison Weir. I've read most of her non-fiction historial works and found them to be well-written, engrossing, and instructive. However, I think that in order to tell Lady Jane Grey's story, she should have stuck to her forte--dealing in facts.It was a good idea to indicate which character was speaking at the beginning of their respective narratives, because there were no defining characteristics between each of the players. Each one had the same voice, the same level of self-awareness, and the same manner of speaking. Perhaps the novel would have been stronger if narrated by a third person.Ms. Weir is a great historian, but the historical novels are best left to Philippa Gregory or Sharon Kay Penman."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent Traitor","review":"A wonderful book!!!!! I read it in 24 hours----it was so interesting I did not want to put it down. It is written with so much feeling and so accurate for this period of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady Jane","review":"I did not dislike this book, in fact it was a fairly good read and I enjoyed it. However throughout the entire novel I couldn't help but feel that Weir had not quite stepped away from her \\"historian's voice\\". Whole sections of it could very well have been in one of her legendary biographies, except the facts are set to dialogue.Descriptions of place, especially when the setting was in London, were dry and not really needed as I don't feel they did much to strengthen the story. And when Weir did step out of the box by placing Lady Jane at the burning of Anne Askew or having Queen Mary give Lady Jane a ruby necklace that looked like blood around her neck the tone of the novel changed for the better.I appreciate her accuracy and it's definitely better than being annoyed by inaccuries when reading historical fiction, but I couldn't help but wish Weir had had more fun with the fact she was writing a novel while still staying within the lines of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"Bravo Alison Weir!!! Innocent traitor was a pleasure to read! Intelligent, exciting and well-written. I look forward to your next fiction books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlucky to be named Jane","review":"I really unjoyed this book.Poor Jane,, a total inncocent.All she wanted were her books and her faith it seemed.For me, it's been a bit tough to find anything on this Jane or Jane Rochford. I already read Vengence Is Mine, but I won't go there here.This womanchild was so dominated by her parents, to the point of child abuse.You really feel for Jane, her life is nothing like she had hoped it would be.She was used til the very end. The crown was put upon her head for nine days...nine days!It's truly a wonder how some slept at night back then. They would have had no concious whatsoever.I reccomend this book, it's a good but sad read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad","review":"So glad Alison Weir made the move into fiction. What can anyone say that hasn't been said before? Great writing, great research! Takes you out of yourself into another world, another time. Some people call it escapism. I call it brain-exercise. We expand our perceptions, get into the heads of other people, other mind-sets and ideas. How very different they were to us, and yet how wonderful to have someone guide us back to those times and those thoughts, those experiences and deeds! Historical fiction - lets celebrate it. And this is the genre at its best.This is a story of one of the most tragic events of English history. Brave Jane! Perhaps just a little unfortunate that we call her the 'innocent traitor' with this title. She was certainly the former, though in no sense the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, strange narrative choice","review":"While I enjoyed the story this book was telling immensely, I did find that having multiple first-person points of view was a little bit jarring. Perhaps this is simply a matter of what I'm used to - third-person past tense, or first-person past tense - but this is why I've given the book a four star versus five.As other reviewers have pointed out, this is the story of Lady Jane Grey's short, tragic, and unhappy life, and I really enjoyed the fact the Weir has such a great eye for detail, something she uses well in her historical biographies.Overall, I would give this book 4.5 stars. Well worth a read, it just may take some time getting used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, amazing, heart wrenching!","review":"I could not put this book down. I truly enjoyed that the author \\"showed\\" us the different points of view of the characters by using diary entries for each person throughout the book. By the end of the book I found myself so attached to Jane that I was begging for the ending to be different than what the history books have told us. Despite knowing the history and thus knowing exactly how the book would end, I found myself shocked, horrified, and in tears as I read Weir's telling of Jane's fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innocent Traitor: A novel of Lady Jane Grey","review":"Very slow moving, does not keep me interested. I like books that make me keep reading when I should stop and do other things.This book is rather boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Novel From An Excellent Author","review":"I've been a huge fan of Alison Weir's nonfiction work for many years, and was thrilled to find she has ventured into historical fiction. Not only was this a well written and gripping novel, but knowing it was authored by such a thorough and devoted historian gave it such authenticity. I loved it and look forward to her other works of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastatingly True Tale","review":"A beautifully penned tale of tragedy.

All in all, an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous read!","review":"An engrossing tale about a young girl who encounters only brief moments of happiness in her short life. Fans of Phillippa Gregory will be immensely pleased by this novel. Loved it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fiction","review":"Alison Weir does a fantastic job of fictionalizing the life of the Lady Jane Grey. If you enjoy reading historical novels that are based on good, sound research, this is a book you don't want to miss. Lacking most of the sensationalist dribble that plagues many other author's styles, Ms. Weir embellishes the everyday life of Jane Grey with sufficient detail to bring you along with each of the \\"contributors\\" of the novel. Written as a compendium of journals of the most significant people in the drama that was her life, Lady Jane Grey is revealed with a multiple perspective that allows the reader to observe the tragedy that was only one of the parade that marks the Tudor era."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Work of Fiction!!!!

And Alison Weir's writing style is so enjoyable and fluid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tissue, please.","review":"This is the story of Lady Jane Grey, told from her point of view and told very well.

And do have the tissue handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocent Traitor","review":"What a great story! An incredible insight to the terrible and very short life of Lady Jane Grey, who had the worst parents in the world!How she was treated was appaling, she was so sweet and had a thirst for knowledge. Pity she wasn't born a man, she would have been a force to be reckoned with!The Lady Elizabeth: A Novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"The historical elements to the novel give it all its interest. The story moves along all right, but the main character doesn't seem to have much character in a way. She is a bland sort of girl, who is somewhat priggish, and not in control of events. The author tries hard, but the novel is bland. The innocent does in fact at one point agree to the treason (so it is not entirely against her will, she feels she must try for Queen for the sake of her faith) and while death seems an apalling result for her living her convictions and doing the best she can you feel she is more a victim of her parents and husband than of her cousin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put down my kindle","review":"I loved Alison Weir's \\"Henry VIII and his six wives\\" and \\"Lady in the tower\\" so I decided to read \\"Innocent Traitor: A Novel of Lady Jane Grey\\" next.

Outside of our Christian Bubble,folks seem to have a better idea of what is and what is not appropriate for kids. While I went through my master's degree program in education, we never were taught to \\"include stories about not having sex outside of marriage in your 1st grade circle time.\\"This has made me so sad that your Bible has exposed her to this. The secular world seems to have a better grasp of what's appropriate for young minds then the Christian world does at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great Bible","review":"I bought this Bible from a recommendation and I was very disappointed. There is a reason why the Lord had the Word written the way it is and this is not in correct order at all.

You can have your Bach and eat the gypsy violins too. I love the entire album, but for some of you who really aren't classical buffs, get it for the Zegwienerweisen alone and it will take you to the heavens and back to earth. THEN sample the rest a little at a time and you may find out that classical music really does have something to offer you. It will have the added advantage of making you smarter. Really!

In all this is an insult to the years Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammestein spent on working on the King and I."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie doesn't even deserve one star!!!","review":"Animation has really deteriorated. The King and I is just another example of how the 'magic' of animation has been lost, no help to anyone in the Disney Company. Animation movies such as Lady and the Tramp are better than movies today!! According to the animation rules of detail, color, and overall dialogue. All I can say is, The King and I wasn't even worth making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The ads made this seem like a wonderful movie, but when my child and I saw it we both felt let down. The story line was mediocre, the characters lacked depth, the animation was so-so. We will never have any desire to see it again. This is the first time I've been tempted to return a movie I bought simply because I didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whistle an Unhappy Tune....","review":"What started out as a promising idea, (An animated version of a classic broadway show) Turned out to be a woefully misguided flop. In trying to compete with disney, Warner Bros simply tried to imitate the disney style without the substance. Oh sure, the voices are good enough, but not memorable and the changes in the plot were unecessary and at times ridiculous. Had they simply animated one of the existing soundtracks to this classic musical (the broadway revivial with lou diamond phillips would have been great to use) the film as a whole would have turned out much better. Over all the film is rentable, but only barely. If you want to have your kids see \\"the King and I\\" stick with the Bryner/Kerr film version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Film. Don't waste your money.","review":"This was a dreadful film and I wouldn't consider buying it. Why does it have an average rating of five stars when two of the three previous reviews agreed it was awful?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a way to give a movie negative stars?????","review":"Before I begin dishing this out for Disney, I will give my one (and ONLY) praise about this movie. The music in it is beautifully written. It's only too bad the rest of the movie couldn't have been this good.If anyone out there is thinking of renting/buying this movie and showing it to their kids, expecting it to be an animated version of the original, FORGET IT. Wait until they're old enough to see the really thing. This movie would be good as a stand-a-lone, if they had been the first to make the whole thing up. But it is a true disgrace to compare this to the original film. Even the story line strays from what we would all expect to see...."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"My daughter was three when she first watched this and she enjoyed it so much that I plan to buy it very soon. You say the story was rushed? How long do you think a child's attention span is? It was great and I truly hope that Warner Brothers continues to make these type of movies. Especially great for any children who love to sing and dance like mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why remake a classic into slop","review":"This animated version is a pathetic attempt, and a waste of time. Rent the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie I have Ever seen!","review":"I was watching this with my sister while babysitting her.It is a watse of time and money. The animation was horrendious. Who does the voices? Totally fake! Oh and that cheesy Siamiese accent, what's up with that?!! I didn't even like the original so this was SUPER annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the 1970's Yul Brynner TV Series???????","review":"Yes, of course, it is a nice idea to make a cartoon in order to make kids watch a well-known musical. The cartoon certainly had some nice attempts, but if you have to change so much of the original Musical story (not to speak of the actual books by Anna Leonowens!!) why not simply wait until your kids are old enough to watch \\"the real thing\\". The first impression of something you watch is very important, and I certainly would not want my kids to have this cartoon as their lasting impression of a very lovely musical. If you want to bring the subject closer to kids, why not show them the wonderful 1970's TV series starring Yul Brynner and Samantha Eggar (regretfully not available on video!!)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was very bad, a waste of $2.50 to rent.","review":"I have seen Anna and the King of Siam, and the King and I. I have to be honest, and say that this is the worst version I have seen. I like Anna and the King of Siam the best. It would have best not the make this video. I lived in Thailand for 2 1/2 years so this special for me. I do not thank that you will sell very many copies in Thailand, and I do not think that you will sell many copies in the United States. Someone should have read the book, and watched both movies before making this pile of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"My children love it.","review":"The music is great and fun. Action is eye catching for younger children and adult too. Great family movie get we need to think what other are feeling also in are working with people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what was listed, or pictured","review":"I was very disappointed with this listing. It was not at all what was listed or pictured. The picture is false on what the item is. The picutre is of the cartoon and the product ended up being some older adult version of this movie \\"The King and I.\\" Not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lousy movie overall, but Master Little alone gives it 4 stars!","review":"This movie is only a shadow of the wonderful musical. The palace might be nicely animated, but it is spoiled by the plot itself. For example, the characters are all one-dimensional with only one intention the whole movie. I thought the songs were un-catchy and lame. However...MASTER LITTLE!!!!He, the sidekick to the villain, is positively the best character in all movies ever made; he is soooo funny! I get laughs from him even after watching him twenty times. His wimpy voice and funny appearance (short stature, gigantic belly, smile that takes up half his face) add to the tasteless hilariousness. He also loses teeth through the course of the movie in the funniest ways. This movie gets its four star rating from Master Little alone. I even recommend this lousy movie because of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if looking for a short favorable biography","review":"I suggest anyone serious about reading on Nimitz skip this and go to Potter's work. It appears to be primarily drawn from Potter... not sure what the author intended to accomplsih here. We could sure use a new Nimitz biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful monitor","review":"After much research, I purchased this monitor. I made the mistake of not thoroughly researching the differences between types of LCD displays. The most color accurate displays are S-IPS followed by S-PVA. The worse are type TN, which will only ever give you just 6-bit color--262,144 colors. Various blending tricks are done to create the illusion that there are more colors, but fidelity is necessarily compromised.The HP w2007 is a TN monitor and it shows. The colors were washed out and varied widely across the screen. As could be expected from a TN monitor, all the adjustments I made never got the color fidelity to be more than bad. If that wasn't bad enough, you cannot balance both the darks and the lights. For pure game playing, this monitor might be acceptable (though even there, I didn't particularly like it) but is dreadful otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never even got to plug it in!","review":"After all the positive reviews, I decided I couldn't go wrong with this monitor. Unfortunately I never got past trying to move the neck on the monitor so that I could slide it into the stand. It wouldn't move! The instructions were very clear but it was stuck solid. I tried forcing it until I felt it could break off. I looked for a button, or a switch - something to allow the neck to swing up. Nada! I even emailed HP customer service and they admitted that I should return it. I don't know if I want to try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little to fault","review":"HP\\"s 20\\" flat screen delivers outstanding performance. The images are clear and the colors true. However, the aspect ratio (the screen is wider than it is high) takes some getting use to. On balance, I'm very pleased with the product and Amazon's service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"I bought two of these 20\\" HP Monitors for my video editing suite. They are used in the \\"span\\" mode to double my desktop space. These are really nice monitors and have a lot of \\"punch\\" (i.e. high contrast), but seem to avoid the \\"eye fatigue\\" factor that can result from boosting contrast. If I were to buy again, I'd be tempted to upgrade a notch to the 2207 because that monitor has more positioning flexibility and usb outputs.Overall I'm giving it 4 stars, which for me means as good as it gets without causing me to drool. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong monitor","review":"Not recommended at all. The monitor provides wonderfully vivid color and crisp text when the screen resolution is set to 1680 x 1050. Any other resolution settings would blur the text and smear the color. The monitor automatically adjusts its settings and warns me that \\"1680 x 1050 is the recommended setting\\" everytime I change the screen resolution. I would say 1680 x 1050 setting for 20 inch monitor gives me a bit too small icons and texts that tire my eyes fast. My video card is generic nVidia but I don't think that matters.I never had these problems with Dell monitors for examples. I am very disatified and thinking of returning it for refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"What?","review":"DVI cable is included. I just got mine last week and inside was a DVI cable. Now I got to return the cable I bought at best buy. Don't listen to these HP fanboys (unfortunately I did before buying) who have nothing to do and write a review on a product they didn't buy. Color is good, not the best, but good. I also bought a Bose speakers for my computer, and funny thing is some reviewers complain Bose has no midrange. (FYI, among audiophiles, Bose lacks highs and lows, not midrange) Probably the same type of people who dont own the product but write a bogus review becuz they are a fanboy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of HP's software package","review":"The monitor itself is great. Installation is more of a pain. When the HP software/driver package installed it messed up the video driver for the systems integrated graphics. HP was called and had no clue as to what the problem was. Reinstalled the video drivers and everything is OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"wide screen crystal clear","review":"My early Christmas gift was an HP 20\\" monitor.

Perhaps I have to listen more of Heifetz to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Virtuosity","review":"I don't think that anyone would argue against the amazing virtuosity of Heifetz, but many, including myself, have found his weakest link to be his cold approach to many of the pieces he performed. I find his performances of the Bach partitas and sonatas for solo violin to be emotionless and rushed. Performances by Milstein, Perlman, and Sitkovetsky are more enjoyable, better recorded, and plumb the considerable depths of these pieces to a greater degree than does Heifetz, matchless virtuosity notwithstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bach an Heifitz are opposites...","review":"I have listened to many Bach recordings and many Heifitz recordings, but very few with the two combined. I'm not really a Heifitz fan, and this recording really puts it into perspective. Heifitz, like always, is techinicaly brilliant, but interprets Bach like he does Saint-Saen. To some degree, he sounds like a robot. The same, fast oscillating vibrato and mechanical bowing arm. If you want a Bach recording with much more sentivity towards the music, and robust playing, try a Menuhin recording or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work.","review":"Heifetz is the supreme violinist of the 20th century. He was without a peer in his class when it comes to Romantic pieces. These sonatas and partitas are not quite right for him. His approach was not of the usual high standard that he set in his other recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book that is very informative its in depth but simple to understand would highly recommend.This will help you pass Ase test easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente reloj pulsera","review":"Elegante reloj casio, con maquina y correa de metal, facil de ajustar a la muñeca sacando eslabones de la correa, broche abre facil muy seguro. jaglvzla"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gospel Music at Its Best","review":"I first became aware of Faifield Four when the were on david Letterman with Elvis Costello..singing That Day Is Done..From then on i was hooked.

After getting the wrong pair I tried to re add them to my cart to see what would happen and once they were added to the cart the picture changed from the ones that I wanted to the ones that I got.

The web page for this shoe lists these are two (2) separate color options (although very similar in name) and with different photos show for each, BUT after receiving the wrong color twice, I contacted the Vendor & Amazon who confirmed that they are the same color and the \\"darker\\" tan photos are just wrong.

I have the linen/oat version with the longer toe box, and right out of the box they were comfortable and did not cause any blisters, etc like I usually get from new shoes. I have bony feet and the shorter toe box version hit me in the wrong spots, but the pair with the longer toe area was perfect. I can't say enough good things about these shoes. If you are contemplating buying a pair, I highly suggest you do! For me, they were about half a size too big. I generally wear a size 8 but they were slipping off my heel, whereas a 7.5 fits perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoes","review":"Shoes are nice but I think they run a tad small.

She is obsessed with her ex so refuses to get emotionally involved with anyone else. However, she has no reservations about getting physically involved. Her current interest is reporter Joyce Ecco. Joyce is 19 years younger than Zena Beth. In fact, Joyce has always had a crush on the popular older woman. Zena Beth lures Joyce into an almost unbelievable situation where Joyce leaves her long-time girlfriend and sets out on an adventure. Joyce holds out hope that Zena Beth will eventually fall in love with her, but that may never be the case. You'll have to read it to find out what happens.I like Diane Salvatore's writing. She rarely goes with formula and frequently interjects a lot of imagination in her stories. That is certainly the case here.Bottom line - Sure, it's an older book, but it's a really good one. Highly recommended by this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing","review":"This CD was very entertaining, I enjoyed all the songs and artists. It puts you in a nice relaxed state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice assortment","review":"This is a nice assortment of standards performed by singers you don't normally associate with this type of music. It gives you an appreciation of the range of their talents. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there are two songs on the CD that didn't seem to fit in. While the songs were good, \\"The Man I Love\\" by Diana Ross and \\"The Look Of Love\\" by Dusty Springfield didn't sound like typical romantic standards. Overall, the CD is quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product","review":"I've always been a little leery about scope rings (having never used them before), so I shopped around for a while. These seemed a good compromise between cost and value.I'm happy to report that these rings have held up very well.I have them currently mounted on my AK 47 in a forward (scout) position. Considering the semi heavy caliber (7.62x39mm), how quickly I fire at times, the 200-250 rounds I've fired, and the fact that it is forward mounted (effect of recoil is more pronounced toward muzzle of rifle), the rings have performed admirably.Also, zero has held every time I remove scope, and the quick release aspect is very handy at the range.Just don't over-torque the screws like an idiot. I see a lot of reviews complaining about that, but it's merely user error, not a fault of the product. I had no such problem.I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mounts","review":"Warne did a great job designing these mounts. I have them on a 3.5 rifled slug gun and they don't move at all. I can detach my scope and use open sights if I'm hunting in brush and reinstall and scope and still on target 3\\" groups at 100 yards all day long, if my shoulder can take it. They are a bit complicated to install for the first time. You have to install the scope in the mounts before you can set the mounts on your gun. It takes a few times to get it where you want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fiction-believable","review":"I bought this book, knowing it was fiction, and the story would be someone's opinion. Well, I was elated when I finished the book. I read it in under 2 hours and could not put it down. Although the story is fiction, it is easy to imagine Jabez's life as the author describes. It's a wonderful story and gives you hope that good can come from bad. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fiction set in biblical times. It's well worth the time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of missing plot and character development","review":"Though little is known of Jabez, and much of the book is speculation and fiction, there is little to convince me that Jabez became a true follower of Yahweh.

Very weak book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource for any writer.","review":"I picked this book up by chance, as I have been a long time fan of Mr. Card's work. This book has been exceptionally helpful in my own work. It covers concepts writers from all genres can appreciate, and was entertaining to boot. I strongly recommend this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"SF, YES... F, NO","review":"If you are trying to write about science fiction, this is an average book. I am an aspiring fantasy writer and was duped by the title. The meager fantasy entries do not constitute adding the word \\"Fantasy\\" to the cover. I also got a bit annoyed with the flow of ideas; every line is based on how the author came up with ideas and each suggestion stemmed directly from something he had wrote. The book read more like a promotional book than a How-To. I was left more stifled than inspired. To this date, the best book on writing I have ever read is \\"If You Can Talk, You Can Write\\" (Joel Saltzman) and I recommend it for all genres of aspiring writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book by someone who knows how to write","review":"If you've ever read any of Orson Scott Card's fiction, you'll understand why he's the perfect author to teach others how to write. Card is a writer's writer, a master at what he does, a person you know without a doubt is giving you good advice. Toss out anything else you've got on your bookshelf about writing and replace it with this one. It's all you'll need, besides maybe his \\"Characters and Viewpoint\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Useful","review":"I'm trying to turn myself into a writer.

Card's other 'How to' book on characters and viewpoint is also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing Career","review":"There are people whose absolute goal in life is to produce a great story that is unlike anything ever seen before. They devote their lives to the pursuit of writing knowledge and memorize anything that could help them improve the quality of their work. For those of you who have recently set this goal, Orson Scott Card answers some of the questions that you will have. I can only say that this book was, at least for me, completely worth the 137 pages and I urge aspiring writers to read this along with his other useful book, Character and Viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for more than one thing","review":"Even if you are not planning on writing science fiction or fantasy today, this book is worth your time if you are 1) interested in Orson Scott Card and how he gets and develops his ideas, and what he likes to read, or 2) you are interested in writing of any kind, even non-fiction. If you have even a fleeting interest in any of these subjects, Card will tell you more in a little book than almost anyone else in a very big book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Card has some good advice here. I especially appreciate the section on structuring the story, and finishing the story you begin. I've been able to look at a lot of book that left me with a \\"meh\\" feeling now, and I understand completely where the feeling came from. The author finished something other than the story I was promised in the beginning. I need time to reflect on the \\"MICE\\" breakdown, but it seems right offhand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for any SF & Fantasy writer","review":"Orson Scott Card's fiction is incredible, and Ender's Game is one of the classic scifi novels. Card manages to do a very good job of teaching the craft, with a very specific emphasis on speculative fiction. I wasn't expecting it to be this good, and I'm sure it will be a daily go-to reference.Want to write scifi or fantasy? Buy this book, study it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read","review":"This book is no different than most of the other \\"How to\\" books dealing with SF&F.

Most of it consists of anecdotes about his personal experiences and his personal life... interesting for fans, but not really helpful for the aspiring writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivializes a high art form","review":"Books like this are almost self-parodying. 'How to Paint a Mona Lisa', 'How to Play Like Yo-Yo Ma', etc. All this book did is show that sci-fi writers are going thru such lean times that they can make more money selling how-to books than doing their 'thing'. Seriously, would a real pro in a crowded market sell his secrets for success for a few bucks, hoping to create his own competition? Not likely. Writing great lit. takes a dedication to art that makes this slim how-to volume seem like an insult, sorry. If he had titled it 'How I Write Sci-Fi/Fantasy\\", it might have been more honest; but not really, precisely because he's hiding his 'best secrets' to keep you from topping him. Think for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better music out there","review":"I had to add another opinion to all these glowing reviews. There is a chance you won't like Laurie Berkner's music. My mother purchased 2 Laurie Berkner CD's for my kids based on all the 5 star reviews on Amazon. We listened to this CD once as a family. My husband and I just looked at each other and said \\"There is no way we can listen to this stuff\\". Her lyrics are pithy and unimaginative.

We INSTANTLY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT!!! I called everyone I knew with kids and told them they HAVE to get Laurie Berkner! Then a friend sent me Whaddya Think of That? and we're hooked--we now own all of her recordings. My baby used to go crazy and shake his rattle egg to \\"I Know a Chicken,\\" and now at 2 1/2, can sing most of the songs on the CD. He loves the dinosaur song and stomps around the room singing the song. I love that Laurie is not over-commercialized--her songs are fun and energetic. Most importantly, it's fun for grown-ups as well as kids--I don't mind when my kid asks for it over and over--I sing along too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd for kid's!","review":"My kids love to sing, dance, and role play to almost all the songs on this cd.

Laurie Berkner has a good voice for kids;it isn't \\"plasticky\\" and her songs are actually fun to listen to.There's also plenty of variety in the songs and enough songs (22 tracks) to last a trip to the grocery store and back.I haven't heard any of her other cds, so I can't comment on this one relative to the others, but it certainly seems more enjoyable than some of the other kids music I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the best!","review":"You cannot go wrong with CD.

My four year old twins love this cd and request it constantly. I hear them singing songs from this album around the house - it's so cute.

She's wonderful and so is this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will find yourself singing the songs out load...","review":"By yourself, in the shower, and in front of your friends. That can be good or bad depending on your company at the time. This is a MUST HAVE for the car, period.

It looks really nice, was easy to put together and gives really good coverage. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bed rail","review":"It wasn't too hard to put together, but a little bit in getting it to fit accurately. My grand daughter knocked it over. Guess she didn't like sleeping on a bigger bed and wanted to make a statement without saying anything.

I read the instructions and it only took about 10 minutes to put it together and install it. However, I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to get the rail to lower. I know I'm supposed to pull up on each side at the same time, bit it doesn't do anything except lift the mattress with the bed rail. It's very sturdy, and my 3-year old son likes it. I'm sure once I figure out how to get the rail to fold down, I would rate it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I ordered this product thinking it would keep my 1 year old from falling out of bed while we were on vacation. He & I had to share a bed and I was worried about the open end by him. I put the bed rail together exactly as the instructions said and hooked it up to the bed, between the mattress and box spring, per instructions. We both went to sleep and I was awoken in the middle of the night to my baby falling out of the bed. The bed rail simply swung out of the way, doing nothing to stop him from landingon the floor. I do NOT recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not clearly listed or described.....","review":"Very dissapointed that advertising and listing for this product did not state NOT FOR USE ON TODDLER BED, after I received item, this was clearly stated on outside of box. It is very time consuming to re-box a product and ship it back. What a hassle..could have been avoided had it been advertised properly. Thus, I did not assemble the product as it is not appropriate for my daughter's toddler bed.

I did this by myself, but probably could have been faster with two people. Our daughter sleeps in a full size bed and has woken up many times against it.The bed is slightly raised which worked out well as that allowed the rail to fold down flat and not jut out from the bed.So far we've had it for ~3 months and it's shown no signs of wear. My daughter has leaned on it while standing in bed and it did not give a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great, wide and secure. Folds easily for putting away.

It is made well and my husband can't hurt himself on it because it is made up of fabric and mesh. For his size , it gives him the protection he needs to prevent him from moving/sliding off the bed and I can sleep better because I am more relaxed knowing my husband is safer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Family Bed","review":"We practice the \\"family bed\\" and started to use these when our son out-grew his co-sleeper.

The only con, the bed would need to be higher in order for the rail to fold flat when not in use. I don't want my 2 year olds bed higher than what a standard bed frame makes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"These worked pretty well for my son. I just set them up on one side of his bed, as the other side was against the wall. He never did fall out of bed while they were up. We never folded them down, so I can't comment on that function.My only complaint, and the reason for docking one star, is that I thought it was kind of hard to set up. I had a really hard time getting the strap tightened on the opposite side of the mattress. I would tighten it as much as I could, but it would still have too much slack, such that the rail would slip around. I finally realized that I needed to lift up the mattress, over-tighten the strap by a few inches, replace the mattress, and then pull the thing into place. That made it fit snuggly. Even then, after a few months it had loosened, and I had to re-adjust the strap.He finally graduated from bed-rails, so this came off just the other day, after about a year of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it...","review":"I bought this for when we transitioned my daughter from her crib to a twin mattress. I returned it after trying to make it work for a few weeks. No matter what we tried, we could not get the rail to fit snug enough to the bed... there was always a gap. The metal bar that goes across through the middle pushes against the mattress and creates a gap. We always had to stuff the gap with blankets and even then I felt that it was hazardous if my daughter were to get stuck between the mattress and this bed rail. It got to the point that my husband and I both thought that it would be safer for her to fall out of the bed than to get stuck at night inbetween the mattress and bed rail. We returned it and haven't missed it, she did fine with just putting a row of pillows along the edge of the bed... thankful for the free return, but wish I saved myself the trouble and just used pillows in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bed rail","review":"This was a cinch to put together and install. It is very sturdy and keeps my toddler from rolling out of bed. I am using it on a twin mattress without the box spring on the floor. This isn't a recommended way to use it on the box (says to use WITH box spring) however it is still very secure and the bed is nice and low for my son to get in and out of. Very happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very satisfied","review":"Don't buy this if you have a pillow top mattress! It only ends up coming about an inch or so higher than the bed. It certainly doesn't look like it would keep your child from rolling off. And maybe its just our mattress but it doesn't even seem to be tight enough to the bed to be safe. For example, it may prevent your child from hitting the floor but they would probably end up between the rail and mattress. If you even gently push on the rail a large space opens up between it and the bed. I now have to return this product and wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Bought this for my 2 year old daughter.

The two problems come up right at the begining with Farber's description of new year's eve in 1959 and what the three famous people (Ike, head of catholic church in USA, and MLK) were doing that evening. This book falls into the trap of looking at the sixties independent of its context as well as taking a top down perspective that ignores the local political movements that really move history. He redeems himself slightly with a nod to the fifties and the local activists in the 60's that really led the way to social change but it is too little too late. I have not seen a synthetic view of the 60's that is able to adequately show this overall context as well as give due credit to the underlying social movements.

So now the slide cannot inflate enough to even let the kids slide on it. There is air seaping out of it everywhere! Way to much air to even patch it. The white hose part shoots off of the orange piece it goes on. So I had to rig that to stay on. That broke a couple of months after we had it. The second tunnel you go under does not stay up at all!

Sound like torture? In many others hands it would have been, but Cale, Young & crew aren't spitting out random sounds but tickling places in your mind that you lay previously unaware of. I'm not saying your going to gain E.S.P.; but you just might find you're unable to resist listening to the entire album. Even if, intellectually, you find yourself put off by the music (or lack of). Something in that shrill wall of sound just wont let you press stop. If you enjoy Eno, Cage, Cale or other similar shapers of sound, this is a must for your collection. If you've never seen any of these names before, pass it by."},{"rating":"2","title":"deeply moving","review":"This music is deeply moving on an emotional level.

The entire recording is like traveling through all of the emotional states one can be in, and afterwards all you want to do it listen to it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leather carrying case doesn't fit t619 correctly","review":"The carrying case is inappropriate for t619. Just a warning. The sides that hold it together cover the bottom of the volume button. Also, the hole at the bottom to speak into doesn't actually match where the hole is on the phone. Finally, it appears there is no way you could use the camera with this thing, although I have to admit I didn't even get that far.However, this might still be worth the price for an extra ear piece (which already comes with the phone) and the car charger, which is not much cheaper on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moldy Bread and Manna","review":"Merkur's \\"The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible\\" poses the thesis that the majority of the major mystical experiences over the last 2000 years are the by-product of the consumption of psychedelic substances administered as part of the secret initiations kept alive outside of the mainstream of Western religious practices. The holy Eucharist, shewbread, Masonic symbolism, and the Grail Quest are the means by which this tradition has been transmitted despite persecution from secular and ecclesiastical authorities. While the topic is definitely hot and very debatable, Merkur has well researched it and presents his material in a highly readable manner. A nice introduction to this controversial subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks after one use then I was charged restocking fee for return.

Sun and abuse will weaken the fabric of the hose over time and create the pinleaks noted by other reviews. BUT it's great for occasional use, easy to handle and transport, very easy and space-saving to store. Perfect for campers/RV if you aren't a full-timer. I used it last year to weekly refill our garden pond during the winter - quick to drain & roll up before my hands or the hose froze, and could store in a small spot indoors by the back door. Hubby left it out to freeze a couple times, so by spring it was starting to leak.

In reality it was not such a nice place. It was a filthy, deadly (Do a search on The Affair of the Poisons) place.This book is the autobiography of a dwarf named Hughes. He winds up at the court of Louis XIV, particularly as part of the household of his mistress Madame de Maintenon and eventually that of the kings mistress, Montespan. The story is filled with intrigue, sex, violence and mystery. As with most historical fiction, there is a mixture of fictional characters combined with the historical.This is an easy way to learn history. A good novel gives you the truth about the historical parts and combines it with a story that doesn't leave you trying to memorize a never ending list of dates. The important part is that a good novel, as this one is, gives you a feeling and understanding for life as it must have been during these times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Soul Funk Compilation","review":"Real good audio document of rare soul and funk from the state of Michigan.

Also includes artists from Grand Rapids and the metro Detroit area. Great variety of sounds: some jazzy, some gospel like, a little light disco flavor.

I gave it several tries with a variety of recipes, but only ended up with barely edible dishes at best. The flavors were not deep, rich and complex as one expects with proper Indian food, but rather harsh and uninspiring. Perhaps this is because the dishes are Vedic (no garlic, onions, mushrooms etc...)I don't know, but I've since purchased a book by Jaffrey and am so much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend who knew that I was a vegetarian and loved Indian Cuisine.

Someone who finds the taste of oily, non-descript, and \\"curry\\" flavored foods you find in many Indian restaurants as excellent examples of Indian cooking might be confused by Yamuna Devi's presentation of subtly spiced and well balanced dishes. I grew up in India and traveled throughout much of the country. I can attest that the author has beautifully captured the wonderfully deep culinary tradition that India has to offer. On a side note, I quite enjoy the personal way Yamuna Devi relates her culinary voyage to her readers. She writes thoughtfully of sources and inspirations for recipes. It seems that her spiritual awakening is tied to her cooking and therefore it seems natural that she would relate these personal reflections to her readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook!","review":"While I can't judge the \\"authenticity\\" of Yamuna Devi's recipes, I can comment on their deliciousness. I've had her books since 1991 and they've been indispensable in my culinary education. As the years have passed I've found myself adapting favorite recipes -- adding onions and garlic, for example -- to my family's tastes. I did find some of her techniques intimidating back in 1991 when I was a newbie vegetarian cook. But honestly over the years I've discovered that they're incredibly useful not just for preparing these recipes, but in making other dishes as well. I've also discovered a lot of wonderful ingredients thanks to Devi's books -- asafoetida/hing is an incredible spice, for exanple! I highly recommend her work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book for Pre-readers!","review":"This little book is on my entering kindergartener's Summer Reading List and I can certainly understand why.

In both iTunes and Windows Media the buttons do things that aren't what they say-in iTunes volume down turns the volume up, mute turns the volume down, and there is nothing that actually mutes.

Inappropriate (I mean words that should have been typos, except they happen to accidentally be whole words) word choices and grammatically nonsensical sentences abound. I finally DID complete the book, but only after deciding to ignore spelling, punctuation and a rather scattershot approach. Maybe I just wasn't drunk enough.

The conflict starts to feel tacked on instead of exciting. And I swear that half of this book is about the main characters learning proper meditation techniques. Now I don't need all my fantasy to have epic battle against evil overlords, but I need some conflict.

Interesting concept sure, but the plotline itself was weak and lacking. There's so much more she could have done with the story, but it was confusing at times, especially the way she tried to describe magical scenes. In my humble opinion the story was poorly devised.

These books were recommended to me also, and since I enjoyed the Alanna series very much, I decided to read these. They aren't as good as the books on Tortall. What's more, although Pierce writes about magic in all of her books, these ones in particular I have found to be quite occult in nature.The occult elements include magic circles, craft magic, and gods/goddesses. The human mages are part of a Temple and practice meditation. Their blessing is tracing a \\"gods circle\\" on their chests with their fingertips.Just as a warning to parents who like to monitor what their children read, these books could almost be a primer to Pagan/Wiccan rites.

This just wasn't as good as it could have been because all the introductions have to be made, all the learning that they have magic, and the getting from enemies to friends. I enjoyed it, but it was an introduction book, not really an action book. And it wasn't even mostly about Sandry, really. But to get started, a man called Niko rescues four different children and brings them to the same place: Sandry, Roach(Briar), Daja, and Tris. They all are sent to the Discipline cabin for different reasons, where they start off as enemies.

I particularly like the Tamara had some of the character's backrounds in the beginning, and the way she joined up Briar, Tris, Sandry and Daja.

It seems solid and may work for some trailers, but not for all.Instead, try the Master Lock Universal Trailer Coupler Lock #377DAT; it worked for me and seems as if it will work for all couplers.

Could easily be my mistake, as a complete novice, but I have followed the directions VERY carefully...From the reviews, I think it could be the machine. It just shouldn't be this hard to thread it and get a few stitches sewn!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy a better one!","review":"I bought this for my daughter based on the many good reviews. But when I received it I was disappointed in how cheap the plastic was. Some parts were just waiting to break! I didn't have to even try it before I shipped it back. Not even the free patterns and free shipping (which I lost for returning it anyways) could convince me. I spent a little more money and bought a Janome.

The upgrade to Panther costs $129 after Jan 30 2004. I just barley made the free \\"$19.95 for shipping\\" offer through APPLE. I would have much rather bought a computer with Panther on it instead of having to go through the whole process of upgrading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you like Excel...","review":"I got this book to write some VBA in Word97. 32 out of the 900+ pages are devoted to exactly that... almost. The problem is that this book doesn't give you the definitions of the objects and their parameters, so it's like trying to learn to speak (or write) a languange without a dictionary. Lots more examples for Excel and Access. Interesting that the object SELECTION is referenced under the section devoted to RANGE, when Woody Leonhard of the Annoyances series of books says SELECTION is superior (in Word, at least.) Also very few examples of using the code. I might be able to figure out the definitions by watching what the code does, but without examples.... Excel people will have better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on VBA","review":"I would definitely recommend this book if you use Office 97 on a regular/daily basis and want to learn how to program individual applications to get your work done faster. I've picked up a couple of 1000 page books on Office that barely touch on the subject, but this book goes into it in much more detail. This is actually the first bok that explained the topic of OLE Automation in a way that I could understand and use it. Probably not for the advanced VBA programmer, but well writen and definitely recommended for beginning to intermediate users."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Right Hand Doesn't Know...","review":"Having listened to A Widow for One Year, and seen The World According to Garp and the Cider House Rules, when I popped in the first cassette of the Fourth Hand Audio Book I was prepared to be entertained by one of the finest of contemporary authors.I was sorely disappointed from the very beginning and will not finish this trite commentary on the world of television reporting and the mental and physical sexual encounters thrust upon the handless reporter.The redeeming quality is probably that the novel is less a tome than his previous works.Please, John, give us more of your old self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Patrick Wallingford loses his left hand to a lion's bite while working as a reporter on a news story in India. Dr. Sajac, a world famous neurosurgeon receives an offer from Doris Clausen to replace Patrick's lost hand with that of her husband Otto. The repercussions of this arrangement are somewhat surprising.What begins as a very interesting story with a typical John rving odd assortment of characters slowly deteriorates into the more mundane story of Patrick's sexual proclivities versus his desire to win Doris Clausen. It simply loses the threads of the lives of the other characters which make more lively reading. Although the novel induces the reader to want to reach the conclusion, the latter part of the story is far less engaging than the first half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst novel I've ever read.","review":"This is the first Irving book I've read. Apparently, I made a horrible choice. The characters were flat and obnoxious and difficult to relate to. Their interactions were boring and unbelievable. The only character that had any appeal whatsoever was the hand surgeon, but his role in the novel was so insignifcant I almost wondered why Irving even bothered creating him. On top of everything, the plot didn't even make any sense. I kept hoping that everything would tie together in the end- that something was going to be revealed that would make the book worth my time- but that something never came. I can't believe this novel was even published, let alone by Irving. I can't get over the fact that some people honestly rated this novel a 5. So bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Irving Reading","review":"As a longtime John Irving fan, I loved this book. It was a nice change from \\"Widow for a Year\\" which was excellent but depressing in places. Don't shortchange this fun, quick read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Sister to earlier books","review":"A sad disappointment -- the characters did not engage me. I didn't believe the attraction that Wallingford had for the Wisconsin chick. His attraction to Angie was at least motivated by Angie's acrobatics. The biggest question was why was this novel written? What does it bring to the reader? It reaffirms marriage and family, especially the desire for sons, but only after trashing the people getting ready to commit. I agree with an earlier comment that Zajac was more interesting, but his story too fizzled into contentment. I can't recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of John Irving","review":"I generally adore John Irving's novels, but this one was a bitter disappointment.

Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting magical.","review":"Being a huge fan of anyone who has the talent and the courage to write and publish what they write I feel horrible giving a poor review. In the past I have read John Irving's work with delight and pleasure. What happened? This story had potential but failed repeatedly. I never cared for any of the characters, didn't find any of them entertaining or the least bit interesting, not to mention that I never understood them. I believe that is because there was nothing to understand. Nothing under the surface. Please, don't bother but rather read Owen Meany again and enter the magical place John Irving took us to before.."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major flop","review":"I picked this book up because the title caught my eye and I had seen some of Irving's work. I was truly dissapointed. The idea seemed to be a good one but the story development was awful. I found all the characters to be annoying and shallow. I finished reading it in hopes that it would redeem itself at the end and again was dissapointed. The size of the book could have been cut in half if the author had not kept repeating himself over and over and over. This is by far the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fourth Hand","review":"I read a lot, I mean a lot, a lot....and this is the first book I have ever wanted to give a review to....I mean I feel I have to give a review, I feel compelled......I'm disappointed and I expect that many fans of Irving are also disappointed. This book really misses the mark. Sure we know that not every book can be an Owen or a Garp.....but jeez, Irving should know better and so should his editor. When something falls this short it just shouldn't be released. Maybe it makes good business sense to releaes it but from an artistic perspective it goes against the grain.In trying to meet a deadline or a contractual agreement we are left with The Fourth Hand. In trying to be too clever we have only The Fourth Hand. A story that struggles to take meaningful shape but never does. A story that tries to shape interesting characters but never does.Oh, I'll keep reading Irving though because I know what truly great writing he is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and disappointing","review":"I did not like this book. I probably wouldn't have finished it, but it was a gift from someone who knows that I love \\"A Prayer for Owen Meaney\\" and \\"The World According to Garp\\", which are magnificent books. Alas, this is not.It rambles, it has poor characterisation, and what's worse, I didn't care about any of the characters. It is actually quite a dull book. John Irving is a very talented author, but this is a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I bought this book before any reviews were in, having faith in John Irving and was axiously awaiting his next book (\\"A Prayer For Owen Meany\\" being on my ALL TIME FAVORITE list)Along the way I had a hard time feeling anything for it and kept seeing unfavorable reviews. But I kept thinking and hoping that soon it would grab me. Not so! What an incredible waste of time! The main character was a real sleaseball that I could never feel any sympathy for and the ending was like a sappy romance novel. A very untypical John Irving novel - disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"I have read everything he's ever written, and I think a NYTimes reviewer got it right when he said (and I paraphrase) that this is more like a book by a student of John Irving than by the man himself. No good character development, nothing all that intriguing - the best thing about his books is that all the things that happen to the characters are usually believable. Not so in this case, and you don't care about them to boot. He's written much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but as an Irving fan not his best","review":"Speaking as a fan of Irving's previous work it's hard for me to say that any of his work not be vary good, but uncomfortably I get that feeling for The Fourth Hand. A beautiful story full of emotion that is captured with Irving's distinct style, but lacking in the detail \\"length\\" of characterization found in his previous work. While the story has great potential as a great Irving novel, the book leaves me with the feeling that it was underdeveloped. I highly recommend that you do read it though because it is still a great book. My expectations were higher though ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"This book competes with \\"Hotel New Hampshire\\" for worst Irving book. He repeats, blatently, words and word themes through the book seemingly just to add girth to the tome and get it off to the publisher. Seems as if he had a great idea for a book, but really wasn't in the mood to write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much written but retold","review":"Having been an avid Irving fan for over twenty years, I had high expectations for The Fourth Hand. Irving disappoints me on just about every level. The characters are essentially one dimensional and static. One could see every plot twist long before it arrived. One reason I continued to read was that I was waiting for Irving to surprise me. He never did.The Fourth Hand borrows from just about every other book he's written with nothing new to offer. I got the sense that Irving was filling the quota of a book contract and we'll see his next effort with a new publisher. It's either that or Irving has chosen to rest on his laurels.I thought A Widow For One Year a stunning comeback from the abysmal Son Of The Circus. However, with this effort I have to begin to wonder if Irving has lost his will to write. Shallow characters, predictable plots and unresolved subplots just left me unfulfilled as a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect something unique from Irving!","review":"I don't quite understand the less than favorable reviews for The Fourth Hand! John Irving is a gifted author who continues to evolve. This book is in a category all its own and should not be compared with any of his previous works. It entertains with an improbable story and unforgettable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Satirical Yet Very Accurate Observation Of Media Life!","review":"My good mate John down at Matilda's book store in Mount Waverley recommended this book to me and I am glad that he did. This is the first John Irving novel I have read but it won't be the last. Journalist Patrick Wallingford loses his hand to a lion at a circus and becomes a News Item himself as opposed to just reporting it.However help is 'at hand ' (no pun intended) from a skilled surgeon. Along the way Patrick beds a lot of women due mainly to his boyish charm.This book cuts very close to the bones of the our 21 st Century god \\"The Media\\" and is both entertaining , funny and very well written. Thanks a lot John !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and sad and goofy?","review":"Can a book be goofy, ironic, sweet, romanic and sad? This one can. I've never read anything quite like it and am now interested in reading more Irving books to see what other surprises he may have in store. Unlike other reviewers, I did care about the characters and while they were broadly drawn at first, Mr. Irving brought them to life. It is true that we often spend a lot of time looking at the surfaces people show us, totally unaware of how deep they really are--that's one of the very profound things this very funny book has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I'm an avid John Irving fan... I eagerly awaited to get my hands on this book and read it...the thing is, I was completely disappointed. I'm not sure why exactly - I was just incredibly bored. I didn't even finish the last part of the novel - I couldn't. It just seemed like a ridiculous story to me and it felt like torture reading it. I'll stick with Owen Meany."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun parody","review":"To all the people who have written poor reviews about this book: I hear you. Judging it against Irving's previous works like \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" and even \\"A Widow For One Year,\\" it doesn't quite measure up.But if you measure it against the typical novel fodder, it jumps up a notch.It's a parody, folks. And anyone who watches FoxNews knows the Disaster Channel is not that far removed from the reality of TV news.Perhaps as a journalist, I could just relate a little more to the book.It was a fun, funny, breezy read.Patrick Wallingford had that mix of likability and shallowness, a la some (though far from all) TV newscasters I know. In the end, I loved him for saying enough is enough on the JFK Jr. (or any other celebrity tragedy) coverage.Amen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing for More","review":"As a huge John Irving fan, I was eagerly awaiting this read. It opens well, in somewhat classic Irving fashion, but then dissipates into mere possibilities. Interesting concept, but too much foreshadowing and forced twists. Found the characters to superficial and forced. I enjoyed Irving's commentary on the media and crisis, but can't recommend this one. If you must read it wait for the paperback, library edition, or better yet, for his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Style, Dull Book","review":"John Irving has become a brand name. While the \\"Show-Don't Tell Rule\\" is hardly a \\"rule\\" that must be followed rigidly by every author, it was never more evident than in this book why this advice is so often repeated in writing lectures. Most of THE FOURTH HAND is summarized, like someone explaining what happened in the book, rather than dramatized with dialogue and action. If a new writer presented this, it would be discarded as lazy writing. John Irving, like Thomas Harris (HANNIBAL) or even Woody Allen, presents this based on the strength of his name, and people will praise it for that reason alone. I have to struggle to keep reading it, and I love many of Irving's earlier books. Then again, maybe this is \\"Art\\" and I'm just a moron."},{"rating":"1","title":"The forth hand","review":"Irving must have felt pressure to get out a new book. This book was not of his usual quality or quantity. It did not contain his usual superb sentance structure. The Protaganist was unbelievable, underdeveloped and unlikeable. The sexual content was gratuitous. The only interesting story line was that of the surgeon and his son. I had to force myself to finish this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Author John Irving is a literary icon, having won many awards. And because he has a great reputation he can get junk like this published. It is supposed to be amusing and/or droll, but it reads like a complete waste of time. It may be possible that there is some great message or point to be made here and I am just too stupid to see it. But, failing that, someone would have to point out to me what value there is in this rambling tale of sexual misadventures and attempts to transplant a hand. There is nothing more sad than an attempted joke that falls flat and that's all there is here."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRVING LITE","review":"I consider John Irving my favorite author of fiction. I always look forward to each new novel. Having read all of his previous works, I have to say that this is definitely not up to his HIGH standards. The characters were not fully developed, nor did his writing entrance my imagination. I was not moved by, nor did I have any strong feelings for, any of the characters. To me the writing was like an outline for a movie (I understand that there is already a movie in the works). This might be one of those rare casees where the movie is better that the novel. If you are looking for a great novel, read \\"Empire Falls\\" or any of John Irving's previous books, but not \\"The Fourth Hand.\\" Hopefully this new novel is one small bump in the road for Mr. Irving and he will return to his high standards with his next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite some minor irritations, still a good read","review":"Although the negative portrayals of women in this book really made me want to dislike it, I couldn't help but be sucked in by this poignant, funny story. The central character is largely unlikeable, but by the end of the book, I found myself rooting for Patrick Wallingford to get his woman. This is by no means Irving at his best (for that, read Cider House Rules or The 158-Pound Marriage), but it was an enjoyalbe, engrossing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel or porn skript?","review":"I find myself sorely disappointed by this, John Irving's, last effort. The book reads like a skript of something Larry Flynt may have been interested in and meanders in such a way as to remind one of an adolecent boy's daydreams. Basically, the plot disappears behind a not so interesting character hopping in and out of bed with different women. My advise is to get the Playboy channel instead. I want my money and my time back please! Note that \\"The Hotel New Hampshire\\" is one of my all time favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly disappointed","review":"As an avid reader of John Irving, I'd hoped to be a naysayer to the common concensus that this book is a disappointment. Unfortunately, I have to agree. Probably my biggest complaint is that from an author that usually creates such complex, three-dimensional characters, I felt next to nothing for any of the characters in The Fourth Hand. In fact, Otto may have been the most well-developed character - and he was around for the shortest period of time. I think the story had potential but it fell well below its mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite work, even for Irving fan","review":"John Irving's characters are often quirky to say the least. Normally they draw one in. Irving's typical forays into the minds of the odd but believable individuals who populate his stories are usually irresistably intriguing. I have often had a difficult time putting an Irving novel down.This novel for some reason does not work. The characters did not interest me, and I neither liked nor disliked most of them. The plot drags on. I often considered putting the book down for good, and not finishing it, which is NOT like me, once I get in very far.Sorry for the short discussion, but I disliked this book so much I would rather not think about it too long now!For those who have not tried Irving, don't judge him by this one! I especially recommend A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY, one of my all time favorites, and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"Visitation rights for a hand? I soldiered on through this book hoping that it would get better, but to no avail.Irving is a good storyteller, and there are several entertaining passages in Fourth Hand. Unfortunately, this time around Irving doesn&#65533;t manage to bring the quirky elements and offbeat characters together into a coherent novel as he had succeeded in doing in previous efforts (Garp and Owen Meany jump to mind). I read almost the whole novel on one long round-trip flight; had I not been a captive audience strapped into my seat at 30,000 feet I would have aborted the effort and selected something else form the bookcase. I&#65533;ll give the book two stars for a couple of funny scenes, but overall not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I had heard such good things about John Irving that I bought this book in spite of the odd description on the back. Bad move.\\"The Fourth Hand\\" combines an unlikely storyline with characters you couldn't care less about to deliver a truly forgettable book.While at times it had interesting things to say about broadcast journalism, the main characters were bizarre, self-centered, and one-dimensional. At the end of the book, I still didn't care what happened to any of them. A couple of supporting characters (Vlad and Angie) showed promise, but were tossed aside once they served their purpose with regard to the protagonist.With nothing to relate to and no characters to care about, I found this book truly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad read","review":"This book had nothing in it for me. The characters were all wacky with no redeeming qualities. It made for a five minute discussion at our book club meeting. Luckily, the hostess had made a salmon mousse in the shape of a hand - now that was something to talk about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a major disappointment","review":"There is very little of a positive nature to say about this book. It is difficult to care about any of the characters, except perhaps the hand surgeon. The plot is poorly supported--when we see a character change his feelings and behavior, there should be some reason for the change. The constant sex scenes were boring, offensive, and pointless. This book is not worthy of sitting on the same shelf with Owen Meany and Cider House Rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Sure Not \\"Garp\\"","review":"I'm a big John Irving fan, and I've read almost all his books and enjoyed every one; some more than others, but each one was a worthwhile read. Not this one. I have to confess right up front that I was so disappointed in this that I never finished it. It was a big waste of time. I guess I might be getting alittle tired of all the contrived \\"coincidences.\\" Don't bother buying it; Pick up a paperback copy at a neighborhood yard sale (the literary equivalent of going straight to video!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"Boring, slow paced, juvenile. Irving thinks he can rescue horrible writing by including all of the explicit sex he can fit into each paragraph. The man can't even tell a story! I kept waiting for the \\"Catch-22\\" type of comic, cosmic ending. I was certain that was where he was going. Imagine my surprise when I read to the end and found out he wasn't kidding...he was really attempting to write a story with an actual plot and characterization. What a load of crap. Don't waste your money or your time. If this is where Irving is headed, look for him in the dumpster soon with a 50-cent bottle of wine in his hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Hands- No Feet","review":"This was the most disappointing work(?) by John Irving. The charachters were as uneventful as the supposedly symbolic fourth hand. By the end I cared not whether Mr. wallingford or Mrs. Clausen sunk or swam in their cold water retreat. Her final answer could have been neoned in Lambeau Field's scoreboard but I doubt anyone would have noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"watered down Irving deep disappointment","review":"I love John Irving's writing, and picked this book up without even reading the jacket copy. Initially, the story seemed engaging--a television news anchor loses his hand to a lion, becomes known as \\"the lion guy\\" and goes to work reporting for a tacky news show--and typical of Irving's wacky outlook. Yet, there was a desultory feeling all the way through the book that all would turn out as expected, and it did. The love story within the novel wasn't at all interesting, maybe because it focused on Patrick's life rather than Doris's. She was the interesting character, in my humble opinion. I had heard that Irving was incredibly persnickety about his books, often changing type after it had been set. What happened to this book? I'll read his next, though. This one just isn't up to the magic he's capable of creating."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing it's suspicious","review":"The Fourth Hand is by far John Irving's worst book... if it is by John Irving! I agree with almost all the other reviewers. No character development, trying too hard to be funny, almost amateurish. In short, totally unlike Irving. How he could publish this book after the brilliant A Widow for One Year is beyond me. We're talking about the author of The World According to Garp, here!! Did he write it at 16? Did he write the book over a weekend to honor some kind of contractual obligation? Did his wife write it (after all, Irving himself said his wife had the initial idea - was that a hint?)? Really bizarre and suspicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and forgettable","review":"I've enjoyed John Irving before (Owen Meany, Water-Method Man), but this is the book that finally alters my classification of him from important author to hack popular novelist. This is a dull, meandering story with no believable characters or interesting ideas. The prose style is equally unmemorable. I just don't know why he wrote this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greased Palm","review":"I can only assume that this book fulfills a contractual agreement (and was loosely- or NOT-edited because of an Oscar?). What an utter waste of paper, time, and money. I've been an avid fan of John Irving's work for years; that just changed. My only consolation: I put the book on the street with a note marked \\"free,\\" and at least someone else was spared paying for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"This is undoubtedly the worst book Irving has published. If you are new to Irving, read Owen Meany, Cider House, Garp, and Widow for One Year. Don't judge Irving by this poor production. Avoid this one, and Son of the Circus too. If you are a devoted Irving fan as I am, borrow Fourth Hand if you feel you must read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised; what an imagination","review":"Everytime, John Irving writes a novel, I start to read and it takes me a long time to get into the book. This novel was different; I got into the story of Patrick Wallingford losing his hand to a lion right away and really liked it. I am amazed at the imagination of John Irving. I really found myself laughing at the oddities of these characters. It was a quick read. As long as you don't take it too seriously, you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fourth hand can't hold attention","review":"I have loved John Irving's novels. I've always thought he was America's Dicken's. With his new novel \\"Fourth Hand\\" he's just \\"Dicken\\" us. Very disappointing; we expect better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop After You Read \\"A Widow for One Year\\"","review":"If only John Irving had hung up his pen after he wrote \\"A Widow for One Year.\\" Irving claims this book attempts to answer a question about dreams - how do you know when you've had a dream of the future? My question for him is: \\"Why do people - writers, (Irving, Heller) sports figures, Michael Jordan, etc., find it so difficult to quit while they're on top?\\" A Widow for One Year was everything this book is not: interesting, full of well developed characters, witty, different. This book never explores the motivations of anyone, except in the most shallow, obvious manner.My advice to anyone who's read Hotel New Hampshire, The World According to Garp and AWFOY is to stop there, and don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Disappointment","review":"For over 20 years I've been a loyal supporter of John Irving's ideas, and the quirky characters he creates to support them. I read The Fourth Hand to the very last page, and with each page i read, I was not only sadly disappointed, but angry. I wanted to call John on the phone and ask him, \\"What the hell's the matter with you?\\" I've read my last Irving novel. The love affair I had with the man and his books is over. Characters flat, story banal, nothing else to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting to be put out of my misery!","review":"I picked up this book at my local ... bookstore ... because the title caught my eye, the backcover blurb drew me in, and because Irving's 'Prayer for Owen Meaney' was one of my favorite books. This one, however, was a major disappointment. The characters were shallow and undeveloped and parts of the storyline were just so ridiculous. I mean...the widow wants to connect with her dead husband one more time so she seduces (and becomes impregnated by) the man who is going to receive his hand? Somebody explain this to me!Sorry...he could've done better. Like other reviews I've read, the books was short, but painfully long. As a bedtime reader, it took me at least a few weeks to get through the book because I kept falling asleep while reading. So far, John Irving has been hit or miss with me. This was one was definitely a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just discovered the meaning of the word","review":"I have read every John Irving novel, starting with Garp when I was still in High School. I went back and read his earier works, and I have loved everything he has written (except Son of the Circus, which left me saying, why why why for a month afterward). Honestly, some of his books, notably The Cider House Rules, have in some ways changed the way I view my life. I was so thrilled to get his new novel this July; but when I finished it I realized that it is ... I was so disappointed; although I will read his next novel, I will certainly be more cautious in my optimism."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could he be thinking?","review":"It is incomprehensible why Irving would have released this book. Fourth Hand lacks the colour and insight and joy we have come to expect from such an accomplished writer. The book is trite and dismissive and is more an invective against the media than anything else.It almost appears less a novel and more a script. Perhaps Irving has fallen to the lure of the moneyed agents and film industry. And who can blame him. What is art compared to healthy bank account?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish .....................","review":"This is quite clearly the worse book I have ever read. Was this some sort of joke or was Irving also high on the drug that was administered to the main character when he lost his hand. I still don't get it - the whole book was a load of utter rubbish with every second page being taken up with 'hard-ons' and 'erections' For goodness sake,Irving grow up - who the heck wants to read trash like this.This book is NOT recommended by me - in fact don't even accept it as a gift, you'll be VERY sorry if you do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was terrible. Very much a machismo story about a crippled man that has sex with every woman he meets. Not much else to it. Doesn't go anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"So NOT a John Irving book","review":"As a major fan of John Irving I was disappointed in this book. It's boring. He keeps saying it's comedic but it's not funny. I tried to like the characters but I didn't really care about them. No Owen Meany in sight. And yet it generates 263 reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I've read everything John Irving has published. This novel has none of the well-developed characters or beautiful turns of phrase of his earlier work. It's a disappointment. For much better work read The World According to Garp, A Prayer for Owen Meany or Trying to Save Piggy Sneed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fourth Hand","review":"Very pleased. I couldn't put the book down. Another Irving book that makes you wonder where the hell he got some of these ideas. Doesn't matter. Go read it. I don't care what detailed reviews say (sure there are ways to disect the book). I don't care. It's just another very good book by Irving. So go read it. Worthy enough to splurge on the hardback to add to your library shelf. Maybe even with some spot lighting on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"John Irving has given us so many wonderful novels that awarding him a mere one star is painful - but only as painful as this empty, unappealing book. Was it the challenge of writing a novel about a vapid and shallow man that even he could not admire or like that produced such a work? With each new Irving title you hope for an experience as rich as \\"Garp\\" or \\"Owen\\" or \\"Cider House.\\" This work is at the very bottom of the Irving canon. Better luck to all of us next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable, but not Irving's best.","review":"Like many other reviewers have already pointed out, this book--while good--is not up to par with most of his other novels. That being said, it is still a very readable, very interesting story. The protaganist--Patrick Wallingford--is a TV news reporter who loses his left hand in a freak accident involving lions. He then receives a new hand from a deceased man, and gets romantically involved with his widow. One of the problems I had with this book is that the characters aren't quite as \\"quirky\\" as in some of Irving's other books. But it's still a light, entertaining and worthwhile read! I recommend it for any Irving fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"FANS PASS ON","review":"John Irving has long been one of my favorite authors, but this novel is unworthy of him. The two words that come to mind are1) 2) pointless. The characters are extremely one dimensional, and there is so much sex one wonders if Mr. Irving's mate has taken vows. He seems so obsessed. There are some cute comic moments, but all in all my advice is:Skip this one and reread Son of the Circus instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love John Irving","review":"I'm biased, b/c I love John Irving. He has the wierdest scenarios, yet his characters exude such warmth and humanity. Not his greatest novel (for me that's Garp), but very enjoyable Irving."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Absurd to Dullness","review":"Well, I was quite enthousiastic about Irving, after reading the New Hamphire Hotel and the water drinker novel (I know its spanish translation only, sorry), and there was a strong campaign for Irving in the formal press, with long and very positive articles dedicated to the newest novel by the Cider House Rules man.And it begins fast, funny and very very interesting, both on what Irving tells and the way he tells it. But... after the main character looses again the hand, the novel descends into the realms of nothingness, and an different novel begins; a very very ordinary love story. Besides, I am European, so I don't know anything about American Football...Remarkable, though; the whole episode of how Patrick lost his hand, the life of Surgeon Zajac and Patrick's sexual adventures with Monika with K and the chewing gum girl, and also the Indian Pills plot. The rest? just pages and pages of dull litterature."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I did not enjoy reading about a selfish man who did not interest me at all. The book was strange.

As a long time Irving fan, I looked forward to reading this latest novel.How disappointing! This book can't be compared with his other works. I loved all his previous novels with 'a prayer for Owen Meany' being the absolute best.I can only agree with the other reviews, read his other works first."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time...","review":"I agree with the first reader review.

I was excited to see a shorter work than usual from this author and knew I could finish it before I reached my destination. My God, was I ever BORED!! At no time during the flight did I feel one ounce of anything for a single character in this book. The writing was just as dull as the plot and I think Mr. Irving was having another midlife crisis while writing this one. The Readers Guide in the back of the book is more interesting. It attempts to explain why Mr. Irving is patting himself on the back for penning this disaster. He boasts of his incredible use of wit and humor, but it fails to come across the pages. Stick to bears, wrestlers, and whatever; but give up on the humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD & BAD","review":"Where is my favorite author? The man that penned, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP, OWEN MEANY and CIDER HOUSE RULES? Books that beg to be reread and given to people that you truly love. Fourth Hand had no redeeming value, characters that didn't interest me, and a plot that just didn't happen. If you haven't read, A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY or CIDER HOUSE RULES,you should! John Irving is an artist and wonderful author, and this book must have been written under some sort of duress. Mr. Irving, I look forward to your next work of art, obviously artists have bad days too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something missing","review":"If there's one flaw Irving's books *usually* suffer from, it's over-writing... Sometimes the character development gets a bit overdone and the plot progress grinds to a halt. However, this go-around Irving seems to suffer from the exact opposite: his characters are under-written... I found no compelling reason to like the Mrs. Clausen character, no understanding of why Wallingford cared for her so much, no sympathy for any character other than Dr. Zajac (who wasn't in the book much, unfortunately), and no interest in the developing love story. The whole 'mysticism' (the best way I can put it) surrounding Mrs. Clausen's motivation for donating her husband's hand, Otto and Patrick's reoccurring (and intertwining)dreams (especially that of the blue pill) just seemed like sloppy writing: Irving started to develop an idea, and then it just died midway through.Definitely disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately lightweight","review":"A John Irving book is always something to look forward to - Piggy Sneed, Cider House Rules, Garp, Water-Method Man, all great, entertaining books - compellingly written, engrossing and the best type of best-seller.The Fourth Hand however is almost laughably bad, mainly perhaps because it comes from John Irving. I find it hard to believe he really wrote this, as the sophomoric writing, plot and structure are just staggeringly weak. Perhaps, as Salon says, the book \\"is just a quick shot at another bestseller before the glow of the Oscar wears off\\". If so he'd better get the polish out ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I've found John Irving's past books to be wierd, so I began reading with full expectations that this one would be too.

Ennui, impatience, boredom predominate. None of the characters had any effect on this reader, seems like none of them effected the author too. The idea of the novel was probably bizarre enough for John Irving, but his heart and mind were not thrilled by it - hence the detached uninspired cliche filled piece of tired writing.Interesting to notice, that Irving fame would have probably reached Salinger's level, if he would choose to stop writing after \\"Garp\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his previous works","review":"John Irving has succumbed to producing \\"pulp fiction!\\" I previously considered him worthy to recommend to friends.

I always try to look for the positive in a book but, unfortunately, the only aspect that appealed to me was Irving's, once again, tongue-in-cheek humour. Overall, the plot was rather immature and almost childish, the characters were weak and came across as air-heads, the writing style was stinted and the story, in general, went around in circles without meaning or purpose. If the book remains on the best seller's list it is likely due to the previous acclaim of the author and past literary successes; however, this one in no way lives up to the renowned gifted talents of Mr. Irving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irving is past his prme","review":"John Irving has not written a good novel since Owen Meaney. This book is not about dreams because it is a nightmare. Pat Wallingford is one of the most uninteresting characters I've ever encountered. The doctor and the housekeeper are the real interesting characters. This is a novel about eating and we could only have wished the lion took a bigger bite out of Patrick to spare us the agony. Too many of the minor characters read like acquainances of Irving's thinly veiled in fiction. Must be a fun inside joke for his friends to read, but otherwise don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Outing","review":"As the author of Strike Hard, I was completely disappointed by John Irving's outing on this one. While his stories always seem to have a wave of what I term \\"Wacky Humor\\" to them, The Fourth Hand didn't even seem worth the effort. The premise of it being a \\"story of love\\" was completely lost on me, and seemed to center more on a morbidness.Hopefully his next one will be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I, too, am a big Irving fan who bought it first day out and read it in one sitting. Irving fans can't resist consuming it, but we can be disappointed once finishing it.I miss the weightiness of previous books.

Every four pages or so, I'm stuck wondering just how this book got out of the sex shops and into the Borders around the country.\\"Is this Irving character some sort of sex storywriter gone professional or something?\\" one might think.The Fourth Hand was incredibly well done, don't get me wrong. Dr. Zajac enchanted me, and I really hoped to read more on him. Its seems like halway through the story, Irving wrote him off, gave him a happy ending, and focused on Wallingford.Wallingford's obsession with Mrs. Clauson is extremely vivid. The entire story was very vivid. Especially the sex scenes.Sensational story. But it makes you wonder just what kind of sex life the author really has."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Worst Book I Ever Read\\"","review":"This book has to be the worst book I ever read.

I didn't care about Patrick Wallingford. Someone in another review stated that he became \\"emotionally involved with the characters.\\" I couldn't disagree more."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasant surprise. A collosal disappointment","review":"I am a John Irving fan. I have read most of his previous books. I usually find his characters engaging, quirky, and complex. I am usually fascinated by the emotional twists and turns of his truly human characters and their believable, though sometimes fantastic circumstances. I was disappointed that \\"The Fourth Hand\\" did not live up to my expectations. In only a few pages after the introduction of each, I had learned everything I wanted to know about each character. I found none of them endearing, in the least. Mr. Irving's preoccupation with the sexual exploits of Patrick Wallingford seemed to overshadow any effort at character development. I hope that this disappointment is not a harbinger of the decline of a fine novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Owen Meany, but definitely Irving","review":"I grew up in Green Bay, and really liked all the G.B. and Packer references. Don't know if Irving visited Green Bay, but he got it right. I couldn't figure out where the plot was going, but then I never do when reading Irving. Like rboffp, Owen Meany is my second favorite book of all time, and The Fourth Hand doesn't really measure up. Patrick Wallingford is not as interesting as Irving's characters usually are, but this book is definitely worth reading and finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fourth Hand is a bizarre, but intriguing tale....","review":"John Irving writes about quirky people with flawed personalities and lives filled with challenges and sometimes even tragedy. I find his characters totally believable and compelling.

So when I saw this novel (in the discount bin), I snatched it up.A huge disappointment. My main (and only) complaint is how unlikeable every character turned out to be. I was expecting quirkiness, but what I got was self-centered idiots. By pg. 75 they seemed so callous and mean-spirited that I didn't care what happened to them. So why should I keep reading? I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irving Fans Will Be Disappointed","review":"As an avid Irving fan, I found The Fourth Hand to be one of his weakest works. True fans will read it because they love this author - and it's not a bad read. It's very funny in places, but those who expect something from Irving along the lines of Garp, Owen Meany, Cider House, or Widow will be sorely disappointed. The familiar theme of love as redemption rings a little hollow when the reader has a hard time caring much about the main character.The entire second chapter is dedicated to the maniacal Dr. Zajac, leading the reader to believe his story will be a true alternate plotline. However, Dr. Zajac receives little more than token treatment thereafter - like the third subplot of a sitcom. Ultimately, Dr. Zajac had the potential to be a much more compelling and sympathetic character than Patrick Wallingford.This may end up being a better movie than a book (I've read that Irving is already working up the screenplay - jeez, give a guy an Oscar!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Owen Meany.","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I am a big John Irving fan. And like the others, I found THE FOURTH HAND to be disappointing. It's John Irving gone over the top. Yes, he is the master of exaggeration and satire but this time his plot just turned ridiculous. Yes, there are some poignant moments... using STUART LITTLE to woo Rudy and Doris was lovely, and the wedding rings on the dock was breathtaking, but these moments are few and far between. I don't really care about football statistics or details of some guy's erection in my novels. Make me laugh or make me cry, John Irving.

I agree with other reviewers here that this one was probably written with an eye towards a movie (an amalgam of Network /Any Given Sunday/ On Golden Pond ?) on which he would not need to take as broadly swathing a scalpel as was done with Garp and Cider House Rules.

The Fourth Hand doesn't even get to verbal foreplay.The characters are weak, uninteresting individuals who never develop and about whom I never am able to care. The book further suffers from a conspicuous absence of plot. Which, normally, is not a problem since Mr. Irving's books are usually so strongly character-driven.I felt that I was reading either a first draft or a cheap romance novel.

However, both here and in Monsoon, a lot of the violence has no purpose. Two full pages with a deadly wounded man's battle with a vulture is very unnecessary. The plot is also flat, too few characters, most of them not make-belief. In the first of his Courtney-novels, the heroes had some flaws, and the villains had some relieving feature.

Gradually it started having problems feeding wood (as several others have mentioned). I have cleaned and adjusted to no avail. I would stay away from this planer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeding problems galore","review":"Bought the planer mid-summer 2004. Before the end of the year the planer began requiring \\"help\\" to keep the boards moving. Periodically it would just hang, burning the board. A quick nudge was needed to continue feeding.Normal maintenance includes cleaning the rollers. The manual says to use a scotch pad and soapy water. I also adjusted the outfeed roller per the manual. This would fix the problem for a while, but it would slowly go back to its old ways. Eventually it gets so bad it requires a constant pushing or pulling to get the boards to feed continuously. Dangerous, frustrating, and leads to poor results. The finish when it works is amazing, but I have found the machine to be a poor substitute for a heavier duty unit. I am only a hobbyist, building boxes and some small furniture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Planer - Follow Directions Though","review":"This is a great planer. I have really enjoyed working with it. One caution though: follow the directions. It says to only change the speed of cut while the planer is on. I didn't read that until I had already changed it. Which made the infeed and outfeed rollers stop working. All I had to do was change the speed again while it was on and it fixed it. Anyway, again, great planer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon shipped me Used / Refurbished Planer !!!","review":"I bought this planer from Amazon and was surprised to see the way it arrived in damaged Box.Well, When I opened the box, I could not find the manual / instructional video / wrenches in the box and machine clearly looked like 'Used Before'. I checked the stores in my area for this planer and they told me that I must get all these items in the box if product is brand new else it is refurbished one being sold as 'New'. Also I found that front plate clearly out of 90 degrees.I am very disappointed with this and never expected amazon/delta will ship used/refurbished products as 'Brand new'.I have called amazon and waiting see if they offer a replacement. I really wish they will give me replacement ( Brand new planer ) and not the money back as based on reviews , I really would like to have this planer.I will update my review once I hear from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"DELTA is less than forthright","review":"I've just received this planer and all is okay except, to my very great surprise, it is not possible to resharpen and then use the blades {which cost about$40.00 a pair}. While DELTA is normally excellent in describing its products, this apparent \\"marketing decision\\" {DELTA's term per a telephone conversation 6.26.02} not to make clear that blade sharpening is not an option, is in my view .... at best less than forthright. In the hope that this might cause the marketing folks at DELTA to rethink their approach here, I am giving this the very lowest rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I bought this planer and five weeks later it was 100.00 cheaper. Can you say sorry about your luck. Now after just a couple of uses the drive belt fell apart. I have had it about 13 months. Can you say sorry about your luck. I sent a email to delta. Guess what can you say sorry about your luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Infeed & Outfeed Roller Operation","review":"After setting planer up and while running a test piece board I noticed the infeed roller did not feed the board as it should. After careful inspection I found out the drive chain that drive the infeed roller and outfeed roller thru a gearbox was not hooked up to the gear assembly (even though the cutters were turning). Delta service told me the drive shaft from the gearbox was not keyed to roller drive gears. I couldn't imagine how such a glaring error and important operation could've escaped inspection at the factory. I was then told by the Delta authorized service center that it would take about4 to 5 weeks to get the part to fix the problem. I will think twice before I buy another Delta product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professional high end furniture maker","review":"I bought this planer over a year ago after a lot of research and decided it must be worth the extra cost. I'm not sure why all of the trade magazines gave it such a high review. My complaints about this machine are many. Poor dust collection. I have it hooked up to a jet 1,100 cfm collector and still get a fair amount of debri. The dust chute (which you have to pay extra for) gets in the way and one has to flip it around everytime you need the collector on the other side. The two speeds are a gimick. There appears to me to be no difference in the quality of cut. The knives do not last very long and are prone to little chips. Lastly the \\"blade zero\\" switch is not accurate. So after a year of frustration I bought a Dewalt DW735. This planer is a sure winner. I love it. Now this machine is worth the money. It is really too bad that delta has really gone down hill in the last few years. Hope they can step it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Planner","review":"I've been using this machine for close to two years with not a bad thing to say about it. I agree that this machine really should come with a dust hood tho. A shop vac isn't sufficient to handle the output of this machine - needs to be in-line with a larger vacuum system.Per the two speeds - I agree that there isn't much difference in most wood - however in working with highly figured woods (maples, myrtle, etc) it does make a noticeable improvement to the finish. Sanding or scraping is always required if you want a great finish.I've been through a number of blade changes - all as easy as they say. No snipe issues, and having in/out feed tables is an feature that I took for granted until using a friends Delta 3 blade planner (no tables?!) Very glad I got this machine. Would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Equipment but don't try to call the company!","review":"Just received my Delta 22-580 yesterday. WOW! it works very well, spent some time last night just playing with it. I'm quite impressed!Now for the bad news: when I received it the tape in the scale was broken. So tried to call the customer suport to get a new one (it's easy to replace), no one to answer, \\"busy helping others\\" and voice mail full, tried to call for parts same and voice mail full. Tried to call again today numerous times, same thing and voice mail full. What's the point of having a call in number if they never answer and you can't leave a message.The product is great, I rate it a 5+, however as far as their support/help/contacting the company? I rate that a -2. It appears FAX is the only way to contact them... and hope they respond. Not a great way to suport customers after the sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your delta planer not feeding? Here is how to fix","review":"I wrote a previous review about my 22-580 not feeding wood properly. The wood feeds part way through, then stops. I took my planer into the Delta shop who told me that nothing was wrong. They did, however, give me a clue that will help you.The tech asked how warm my shop was. Apparently Delta used very hard rubber on the feed rollers. They don't like it cold!So, I took the planer home and tried it. My shop is in the garage and on cool days it didn't feed well (below 60 degrees F)How to fix: Take a small electric heater and have it blow onto your feed rollers. Every time I set my planer up, I just run a heater and get it nice and warm.No more feed problems!Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feed Problems Continue","review":"My 22-580 planer is a $400 doorstop. From the beginning, it had problems feeding the wood. Now, 9 months later, it barely feeds at all. I don't know if the rollers are too slick or the unadjustable front roller is mounted too low. The manual offers no solutions that work. And if you look through the reviews that follow mine, you'll find several cutomers have the same problem. I wish I looked at them more closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Smooth","review":"This is a very good planer. I get \\"finish quality\\" smoothness using only the \\"dimensioning\\" speed on oak, walnut, pecan and hard maple. Blade life expectancy is apparently high. I have used the supplied blades since purchasing the planer and still get very smooth cuts, and I haven't yet reversed them. Depth setting gage seems accurate and easy to read and set, and the blade height set feature works very nicely. Only suggestion for improvement is to supply a stand with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I could take thickness off myself this easy!","review":"I've run miles of pine and hardwood through this planer, it works well with minimal snipe once you get the tables properly adjusted.If I was doing it over again today, I'd look to the DeWalt model 735 . . . if you can get that one anywhere near $100 more than this one, step up to it!!My only fault with it is the disposable knives, they are a bit pricey. Also, the pricing seems to fluctuate often, be sure and compare it around."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Eh... Not so much","review":"I picked them up for an Xbox 360 since the 360 is notorious for scratching discs, even while the system is stationary. The skins did take the brunt of the console abuse, scratching the skins and not the games. The problem is that there is play in the size of the skin compared to the disc (understandable since you have to squeeze it over the disc.) The problem with the play is it creates an effect like a warped disc, that the laser cannot read through. If you leave the covered disc in the 360 long enough, it heats up enough to smooth the back out a bit. It's just a hassle making it just right so that the game will play. It may work with less data intensive media like CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"While I'm sure my problems are unique, the promise of the d-skin fails to live up to it potential.

Matthew speaks with such candor and uses witty humor and personal experiences to discuss some rather touchy subjects that concern most Christians today. After reading this book I really feel encouraged to really love and show care for everyone that I meet. I'm personally tired of living a boring Christian walk and I feel a deep compassion and need within me to reach out to those around me. This book was a great tool in helping me to evaluate areas in my walk with God. So many Christians (myself included) have relied upon the church itself for spiritual growth and sustenance in our personal faith journey when all we ever really needed to do was rely on Jesus himself. I am so glad to have had my church life support plug pulled because now I can breath on my own and experience the true freedom that Christ offers to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going for God","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who has struggled with what it means to be a \\"correct Christian.\\" Matthew Paul Turner shares his personal story of how he left the abusive faith of his childhood to seek out what it means to live a life as an authentic Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative Faith Challenging, Honest","review":"Provocative Faith challenged me to really make my faith authentic and honest.

However, these ideas are repeated quite frequently. Often, I would feel as though I had already read a particular section of a chapter, when actually it was something \\"new\\". Also, something very apparent from the start is the Author's pessimistic personality. While I am not saying that the book should have been written \\"happy-go-lucky\\", I would have felt more comfortable reading the book if the Author had more \\"love for life\\". Not sensing an apparent joy in the writing I feel as though the writer may be struggling in his own faith. This of which would make writing a book on faith not necessarily the best idea. Throughout the book there also is a sense of disconnection between the writer and reader. It seems as though the writer is trying to connect with a non-Christian, rather than a Christian working towards a greater faith. The book isn't a difficult read and would perhaps make for a good afternoon devotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the place!","review":"This book is the best resource to get a throughly overlook over the different directions within the latter day (mormon) movement outside of it's most known mayor \\"denomination\\" (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT).

She also read Harry Potter and Scorcerer's Stone to us, and this ranks right up there, as far as, interest and facination is concerned.

When I got to the second novel, which came as a surprise - that there was a second one, I expected a repeat of the first one so I read on. I could not believe how boring, predictable and implausibly of this book. There were no descriptions of any of the characters other than observations such as, 'he wiggled his eyebrows to show his interest'...lame, just lame wording like that. The slang came from the 1800's and I just could not believe this author was actually making a living writing books such as these. That's it. I feel better now.

It creates a unique mood of playing a game that cannot be won."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Look Away","review":"An atmospheric film with great performances. This is not a film to listen to while you're cleaning up the kitchen or paying bills. If you look away from this film for even a second you might miss an important moment. The slow pace is broken by several surprises. People are not who they seem to be. The main character, played by Jack Nicholson, runs away from one complicated life to another that is even more complicated and dangerous. I watched the final scene several times. There is almost no dialogue for the last five minutes, and at the very end, things happen quickly.A thoughtful film that will inspire interesting conversations, but one that may leave the viewer feeling depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear","review":"I bought the DVD as a Xmas present for my son - hence the delay between purchase and discovery.

You have to view the last scene with Jack Nicholson's commentary as he explains how it was done. It broadened my appreciation for talented directors. Just for that scene alone it was worth the purchase price.Yes, I like this film and will continue to view it. It has a story. It is what it is, and may not appeal to everyone, though. It's an examination of someone's life and representative of what some people will do to escape from that life no matter what that entails. In the end, though, this film makes you realize that far away hills are not always as green as you think. Or maybe they are.

Many of these are interviews with authors like John Updike, Salman Rushdie, and other such literary luminaries. While these are likely of interest to the well-read, I found the more entertaining essays to be the non-interviews. In this vein are those railing on Republican politics, the darts scene, judging a short story competition, the Frankfurt Book Fair, an English soccer team's tour of China, and playing pool with a good friend. The essays are all fairly short, so it's a good book to pick up and put down constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing new but still great","review":"There's probably no better commentary on Ephesians but I must say that this commentary doesn't really add much to the study of Ephesians.

The orange color grabs your attention. I also like the handy storage case which is easy to carry and stores the tools well. However, I was frustrated by how slow the charger is - 6 hours to charge up a battary. I also don't like the fact that the charger will actually damage the battary if you leave it charging too long. This needs to be a trickle charge like a Makita. The worst thing is that the flashlight burned out in 20 minutes! I was also underwhelmed with the Sawzall. The Sawzall stalled out when I was cutting through balsa wood? This unit needs more power.Black & Decker should spend less money on the fancy packaging and more money on power, performance and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Charger Problem","review":"I read the other review about the problem with the Black & Decker battery charger. I also had my charger quit on me. I had 2 batteries that came with the drill. I bought another 14.4 volt B&D product so I could continue to use the drill. I quickly found out it wasn't the battery charger that was causing the problem. When I tried to recharge one of the old batteries in my new charger, it quit like the old one. After calling B&D, I was told the problem is with the battery. Once the battery goes, so will the charger. The problem is you never know when your battery is about to go until it is too late and your charger is killed as well. I think I'll cut my losses and try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shabby love in Wartime Paris","review":"The superb historical novelist Paul West's greatest accomplishment is this short, unsentimental yet oddly moving love story between a Parisian vagabond and the young woman who (against all bourgeois judgement) cleans him up and falls strangely in love with him in occupied Paris. Loosely inspired by stories of sightings of a real life character who wandered the city of lights with a trained rat during the war, West's gritty, twisted love story is among the best three novels I have read from the 1980s, along with White Hotel and Libra. A strange, rewarding read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride Runs Deep","review":"Just a all around great novel of the gritty world of WWII submarine combat.

It's true that it doesn't stick faithfully to Mary Norton's books, but it's still close enough to make the movie interesting and delightful to watch. The actors are all fabulous especially Rebecca Callard as Arrietty and Daniel Newman as Spiller (wonder what they are doing now and what else they've done?). Highly recommended for both adults and kids; you will not be bored. The only problem is the quality of the tape really really sucks - which is really too bad.

Often while reading it, I did have to consult the web a number of times, and still got a bunch of dead ends-This book was not ALL bad, but the other reviews mention a embedded database usage that is out of date. No kiddin there!

I want to know about J2ME, not about satallites orbiting the earth.There were several small errors throughout, source code missing things here and there. But as I got deeper into the book I didn't know enough about the language to correct the errors. That's what I purchased the book for.Instead I went to Osborne's website where they have the source code for the book (with errors intact) but otherwise don't acknowledge that the book exists. It would have been nice to have an \\"updates\\" section where a couple of the errors were corrected. At least run the source code before you put it in the book.

She read it as part of her philosophy course syllabus. At first I thought it too slim of a volume to have substantial philosophical merit. How can the meaning of existence be even broached in one hundred pages? But Thomas Nagel has done just that. Be it read as introductory or review, one can satisfactorily cover the basics of philosophy in about an hour. That in itself is quite an accomplishment.This book examines and acquaints the reader with the major questions of philosophy. As many other reviewers have pointed out, Nagel is remiss where it comes to giving answers, but I don't believe that was ever his intention with this short work. This is not a tract on \\"how to live,\\" rather a primer for \\"what to think about?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The way this book has been written about and the reviews surrounding it are quite ambiguous and misleading to the point of fury.

It compares favourably to Bertie Russell's 'Problems of Philosophy' in the sense that it is simpler, clearer, and thus much easier for the complete novice to read and understand. On the other hand, this is precisely why it will be unsatisfactory for other readers. It mostly utilises the traditional philosophical device of doubt, and encourages the reader to ponder possible solutions to the fundamental conundrums that arise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought the paperback version of this book for an introductory philosophy course. The book's prose is clear and well-written, so I will give the author that much - otherwise, I would have given the book a 1-star. The text is so brief that it is unsatisfying. The author seems to circle around and around questions without offering much except the questions themselves, so he left me with a hollow feeling. He comes across as depressed, particularly his statements that we only matter to ourselves. The book closes with disturbing statements that \\"Even if life as a whole is meaningless, perhaps that's nothing to worry about\\" and \\"Life may be not only meaningless but absurd.\\" If he feels life is meaningless, why is he teaching philosophy? In the end, he came across as ill and living without hope or meaning. I can't buy into a viewpoint like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't mean much, apparently","review":"This book was assigned reading in an introductory philosophy course and I am very, very glad I read it at the end of the year rather than at the beginning (although it is too simple for a college level course in any case), because Nagel's conclusion suggests it's all an exercise in futility!. Although it is a good introduction to some of the major questions of philosophical enquiry for complete beginners, I feel that Nagel should have included some recommended reading at the end of each chapter for those who need more depth, especially for readers who are not using this book as part of a course in philosophy. Those same readers might well be put off by the dour ending of the book which strongly hints that (1) any God is merely a God of philosophical gaps (2) ultimately life has no meaning and (3) those who look for meaning are probably taking themselves too seriously. Why do philosophy then? And why write a book about it!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Free style\\" Frezzato's masterpiece","review":"The best from the series, I'd say it's the artist's \\"free style\\" (master)piece, with bold & fresh colors, stunning contrasts and totally hallucinogenic compositions!!

You overpay for a game with crappy graphics (I mean, have you seen the character models) and then you have to pay $5 dollars to play with these rude clowns who will personally attack you if you don't swear by it.It just makes the whole thing that much more useless. Everyone knows that the Xbox360 will be abandoned like Xbox in a year or so and personally, I'm mad too that I drank the Kool-Aid but then again, I also bought a first generation iPod and a new one this year.

That is if you want to play the same boring style single player missions that the previous Halo releases offered as well. Other than better graphics this game is a pitiful excuse of a shooter. The only good in Halo titles is the fact that every kids mommy buys it for him for christmas/birthday, which means more online players. Other than that, Unreal 3 (or any unreal for that matter) is worlds better than these titles. They offer more characters, better weapons, more manuverability, comparable graphics, and tons more unlockables. So if you are a die hard Halo fan, by all means waste your money on this game, however if you are in for some balls to the wall, blood filled FPS action, please do me a favor and support Epic games.

Can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo 2 + 1","review":"It's good, but it's a small incremental improvement over Halo 2. The graphics look almost the same as Halo 2. I expected better graphics and a feeling similar to the first time I played Halo 1 where I couldn't stop saying WOW! So overall, I'm a little disappointed. Regardless, it's a good game, and I think most people will enjoy it after the slow start."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's well....ok","review":"I'm sorry I do enjoy shooters and I have bought all of the Halo games....but I need something more. New Shooters now are way beyond Halo 3. The graphics are better, the story is better, the AI is better, the games mechanics are better, and the online multi-player is BETTER!!! Come on...no new maps only refurbished old ones...it's like halo 2 but just better graphics. If I want to play Halo 2 I'd just play it. The only thing this has is the ability to take a guest online with you but those other...BETTER games are catching up to that one. I really expected more from the great Halo name. But when is comes down to it who really freaking cares.If you want this game wait a year it'll reach Platinum status and you can buy it for $20...hype sells all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome","review":"Halo is one of my favorite video games. Halo 3 is the final chapter in the Halo saga. Despite it being a first person shooter it will live on as a cultural icon of the 2000's because of it's compelling storyline and great game play. It is very much worth what you pay, supposing you already have an xbox. It is recommended you play the first two first though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo 3","review":"This is a game that you should add to your library, It's still fun even today I still play it online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I expected more from this game. Yes, or course, the graphics are improved. Other than that, it's a bit of a let-down. Played it this morning for over an hour at a friend's house and have no real urge to go back to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to see microsoft cutting loose the people who bought the first console","review":"I bought the first Halo and the second Halo. Now if I want the third Halo, I have to throw away the entire console and buy the 360 for $400+tax, then new controllers, etc. Thanks Microsoft for making the game exclusive for the 360 and cutting loose all the people who bought your products in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is terrible","review":"I didn't like anything about this game. Looks exactly like halo on old xbox. Nothing compared to the new games on 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"A friend of mine gave me this game for free.That was still too much to pay for this boring shooter. Feels like playing tribes, only not as fun. How on earth did the halo franchise get so popular?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"Graphics are great. Ive only played a few hours, appears Gameplay similar too, if not exact to halo 2. Same weapons, same enemies over and over again.....Gripe.....HOw lame not being able to hide and duck behind cover like you can in Gears of War or ghost reocon. Last I checked this was 2007 not 1999."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"The campaign to start is confusing. Even when you get the hang of it it sucks. Online is stupid. You don't know when a grenade is near and it is overpowered. For gunfight, it is dull and simple. If u shoot first you one the fight. If you have a rocket launcher you won the game, same with sword. Save your money and buy a better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Boring, Lame, Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Haven't we done this before? The maps look the same, the weapons are boring, and the characters are, once again silly. This game reminds me of the disappointment I felt while watching the new Star Wars movies. Characters or childish, and the plot is entirely un-inventive. Save $60 and play Halo 2 again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single player... What single player?","review":"I will just go on the record reinforcing the notion that Halo 3 suffers for its shallow and repetetive single player campaign. The multiplayer alone is fantastic and the coop mode makes the story mission much more bearable. The features in the multiplayer game including the interface (matchmaking system), the Forge, film and photo features are so well executed that going back to alot of the other multiplayer games' multiplayer interface seems like a huge step back. I have fewer problems with connections in Halo 3. The community can be a bit annoying but that is a problem I've had across the board.After all is said and done, Halo 3 is a great game if just for the multiplayer, but those without Live are getting shafted with about 1/1000 of the true value of this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleans up Halo 2's mistakes","review":"I loved Halo 2's co-op features,but I thought that the missions were terrible!The missions where you were elites were just agony!But Halo 3 is such a large step up in TONS of way,such as,the co-op maps are a lot more fun,complex,and just plain better than Halo 2,the missions are so much better I can't name all of the improvements,but I will anyway.My favorite thing about co-op missions is to ride in a vehicle,my brother drives,while I operate the turret and wipe out all enemies in our path.I beat the game on all levels of difficulty and still haven't gotten tired of the game,I play it every time I go down to my neighbors house(which is quite often)and we enjoy every minute of it,whether it be shotguns,energy swords,or rocket launcher(all of which are my favorites)it's always a blast.Halo 3 is my favorite Xbox 360 game and I can't wait till Halo Wars comes out(I love RPG's)(role playing games)."},{"rating":"2","title":"really fun game","review":"this game is really fun and i really recommend this game.the graphics:9/10really good. barely could be better.campaign:10/10it could be hard but fun.sound:8/10some funny sayings.game play: 10/10really fun game to pick, like how it'sin the future.story: 10/10a really good story.Halo 3 Legendary Edition"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the big deal","review":"Ok frist of all I would like my money back. This was just to fast of a game. Ok it looks great and plays great but man it took me long to bet the other Halo games. Look this game is not all that. I think they blew it with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, its a pretty good game. worth buying","review":"Halo 3 is a good game mostly for the multiplayer. The campaign was a major dispointment because it was too fast, sure you can go back to get the skulls, some acheivements, but the campaign is really only to do to get it over with. As for the Multiplayer, its really good. you can play a lot of games including team slayer, team doubles, oddball, infection, etc. You can talk to ohther people through the headset and it is one hell of an experience. The same goes for Custom Games, you can play with your friends online on maps that dont have to be on matchmaking and you can invite whoever you want. Forge was a cool addition because you can edit your maps into anything you want and place the weapons and objects wherever you want! And on Theater, you can watch back you fights, take pictures of amazing kills or something amusing, and record clips of anything! Overall, i can play Halo 3 for a long time and its something worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh (shrugs shoulders)","review":"Less then the first and the second and the second was just alright. I only played this game to see the end of the story which to put it bluntly sucked bungie really blew their load on the first halo."},{"rating":"2","title":"wHEN THE tough get rough, you must pull out the stuff","review":"Halo 3 is a great single player experience. The Story is captivating. The enemy ai is entertaining. The scenery is beautiful.The multi-player is fun. Just about everyone that plays halo 3 online is pretty darn good right now. So its very competitive, be ready for a challenge if you are playing this game for the first time. A lot of map to pick from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but better than good","review":"Pros: Excellent gameplay, graphics, AI, large amounts of enemies on screen at once, Cool campaign (4 player co-op option!) Intense multi-player, cool new weapons, new feature called equipment, and the saved film option is awesome.Cons: Came up short with the campaign, I was hoping for an actual 'fight' when the slogan was \\"Finish the fight\\". I bought the game mostly for the campaign, and I was disappointed with the time it took to beat it.Worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo Does it again!","review":"WOW! A few months was worth the wait!Even though im kind of getting bored of it because it is my only game for my 360. Ive played Halo and Halo 2. Pros and Cons:Cons:-Forge Money Buget, i dont like that, beacuse we should have unlimited things and infinate money(Without Glitching).-Multiplayer Energy sword, since they put a limited charge, it will change online gameplay with it.Pros:Good storyline, great graphics, more optioins when creating your own Custom Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fun in 2012","review":"I had just played through Halo 1 & 2, and feeling like a completionist I was compelled to finish the trilogy. Humanity could only hope to be invaded by such a flamboyant society as The Covenant. Their brightly lit blue and purple armor is hard to miss. Still with overwhelming numbers and enough AI to hide they make challenging moving targets."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorite Games!!","review":"I bought this game over 5 years ago and have never reviewed it until now.Halo 3 has always been one of my favorite games on XBOX. I recently got Halo 4, and I have to say I liked Halo 3 better. I bought the game when it was $60 and it was worth it then.If anyone is still looking to buy this game, I would definitely recommend it. The campaign is lots of fun, and multiplayer is even better. I've logged days and days of playing time and still love it.Overall a great game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its all right","review":"In my opionon the game is not all that good . Its is a big let down for those who waited at the doors for it to come out. I mean people who have played Halo2 didnt really miss anything cause everything is the same. Except the stages suck and online is full of five year olds cussing thier mothes off.And achievments are so easy thats the only reason i played it for a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"run of the mill","review":"halo is by no means a bad game, its simply just run of the mill. basically its a ww2 game with an aliens theme. If your a sci-fi lover than this is for you but i like realism a lot and the idea of a whole clip to kill an alien doesn't float my boat. on the bright side this is the best executed multiplayer on the 360, but when you dont like the game execution means nothing. this is a good game but if you like realism rent it before you buy it if your a sci fi addict than why arent you playing this already?"},{"rating":"1","title":"halo 3","review":"Many people liked this game. i myself didnt see the attraction. i thought the graphics were average at best. probably should have been put out on ps3 for better graphics. that said, if you are a big 1st person shooter fan, which im not, then you should be satisfied with this game because it did have a fair amount of action"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to finish the series!!!","review":"People say this game sucks.They're probably not gamers.They're NOOBS!!! This is a perfectly fine game with a great Campaign and awesome Multiplayer.Fantastic new gadgets and weopons.Fun new vehicles too!I think this is way better than COD 4.I don't hate COD 4 but I thought it kinda sucked.This is a fine 1st person shooter.A great way to finish the HALO series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant graphics, smooth gameplay, awesome on-line","review":"Though the game isn't perfect, it is a brilliant addition to a very popular title. Graphics are gorgeous and fluid, controls are smooth, the difficulty settings get challenging on \\"Hard\\" and \\"Legendary\\". The new vehicles and weapons are also very enjoyable. The new \\"device\\" use is also a nice addition.My only complaints are minimal and minor annoyances: in game, you hear voices which slows things to a crawl as your mind hears them...I didn't understand why they chose that effect. The other is that you can't save multiple \\"solo\\" games...do developers realize that more than one person can play an X-box 360 in a single household?"},{"rating":"2","title":"SLIGHTLY over rated","review":"Halo 3 is a very good game. It has awsome maps and fun online play! The campaign for it has a horrible story line and is not much fun. Halo 3 is definitly overated a slight bit, but nothing horrible. The biggest thing you could do to make it better is more people on a map!Over all Halo is an awsome game! But if you want something that has both a fun campaign mode and exciting multiplayer, get Call of Duty 4!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The same, but still fun","review":"I find that the game its almost the same than Halo 2 in sigle player of course not in graphics, about the multiplayer, well i didnt play halo 2 in multiplayer, but i know that halo3 has an addition of 4 Coop campaing wich is a good thing and fun!!!!. and the others game types in multiplayer i havent use them much, but almost everything in multiplayer is good.

I give you 5 stars. I love the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all around","review":"The game was solid. Single player was decently lengthed, if my memory serves me, at around 15 hours of gameplay. The story was entertaining and filled with a variety of circumstances that really kept the player on the edge of suspense. Multiplayer was a blast, if unbalanced, certain weapons being vastly overpowered. And co-op. The single player was long enough, epic enough, and fun enough to make the co-op experience probably one of the most satisfying gaming experiences of my life, and I've done a lot of gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo Three","review":"Great graphics, awesome replay value! Highly recommended that you get Xbox Live to play online games - the online play absolutely makes Halo such an amazing game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most over rated game I have ever bought!","review":"I played this game before..... its called Unreal Tournament 2004.... and the graphics were better back then !This game is all hype ! it brings NOTHING NEW to the xbox 360 ! I mean nothing. Graphics a weak - not even hd... they are upscaled. the multiplayer sucks big time... its so hard to find a match that you want to play.. horrible over all game... if this game was not called Halo it would get no love at all. Bungie sat on their hands and brought nothing to the table... Gears of war raised the bar so high that they cannot even compete ...At least Unreal 3 is coming which will be what Halo should have been.....Buy it in the used bin because a lot of people will be trading this ' dog ' in because it has fleas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest rip off ever","review":"If you liked halo 1 and halo 2 you might like this game because all it is is repeat of those games. Better graphics, but the same game. I would congratulate Microsoft in convincing all the teen fanboys to buy this garbage. So how bad is the game? Well let's put it this way, all the people who were so hot on buying the game a couple of months ago, no longer play it. Yes, those same fanatics who pre-ordered the game don't play it anymore. I played the game on the easist setting just to get through it but even then it was too boring. And online play? Horrible. Menu system? Worse ever.I would suggest that colleges teach about Halo 3 in their marketing classes. To sell this dog turd at 60 bucks a pop is truly a great marketing accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"HALO","review":"'''''''''''we never received the product-SELLER TOOK OUR MONEY AND HAS NEVER SENT THE PRODUCT.WE HAVE THRE TIMES TO GET IN TOUCH WITH SELLER AND GET NO RESPONSE.

This game is basically very stupid, because all you do is jump around all day, and you can't zoom in on a lot of guns, shooting at midget things. Basically OK graphics, OK online, and the hammer is just plain gay. Overall, don't get this game, there are MUCH better games out there, don't waste your time and buy into the fan base hype.

Untill you roll through the single player game in about 6 hours. I understand that Halo is online multiplayer at it finest but some of us would prefer a little more story. Basicly I would like to thank MS for not putting a HD-DVD drive in the 360 Elite so our games keep their wonderfully short gameplay. Unfortunately 8Gb of storage just dosent cut it for HD games nowadays. (Here come the fanboys, let me have it) But seriously I just purchased an Elite and though it may contain the 65nM chipset the lack of a HD-DVD drive and HD-DVD game support makes my nice pretty console a Halo rig and nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own a 360 don't pass this one up","review":"One of the best games the xbox 360 has to offer.

Bought this off Amazon marketplace and its acting glitchy or something. Checkpoints do not load after dying and instead I'm sent back to the very beginning of the mission. Also when I finally get to the end of the mission it reverts back to the beginning again. The only way to make progress I found out is to save the game after reaching a checkpoint and then loading from a fresh restart of the game in order to resume where I left off.

Best I've here on a consoleStory 3.5/5 pretty short story mode, however its a very good story with plenty of ooo and ahhh momentsMultiplayer 6/5 multiplayer is where this game stands out, it has a very organized party system which makes it easy to get with friends, 4 player co-op over live is a blast, and sharing screenshots and videos is alot easier and cooler than other games.All in all 4.5/5...Try or Buy? Definatly buy, you can't go wrong with Halo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for a great price","review":"I bought this game as a gift for my boyfriend, he's been on it ever since, It was a great value paid for it being in almost brand new condition, the multiplayer online is great, hopefully it doesn't turn out to be like reach and you don't get credits when you are playing offline. The seller was great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I am sad to see so much useless halo bashing on this page. A lot of these reviews do not specifically target anything and seem to only bring the rating down. My review however will be short and sweet as well and will cover only one thing. And that is how much fun I had playing the game. It was a blast, Bungie gave me the ability to finish the story of halo with three other friends, as well as switch over to multiplayer for an almost neverending online experience. The main thing was that I had fun and am glad I purchased a 360. So five stars it gets. I also recommend Bioshock for people who enjoy FPS as I recently got it and was shocked by its quality of gameplay. If you like Halo get this game, if you did not then dont worry about it.P.S. Will someone please silence the PC fans who bash every console and console game, it is very annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been better","review":"Yes, Halo is fun and an easy way for everyone on your friends list to pick up and play endless hours, but after playing the first 2 Halo games this one just gets boring. I play it occassionally with friends online. Honestly, I haven't even finished the campaign mode on my profile. I beat the game a long time ago in co-op with a friend, but Halo 3 doesn't provide much of anything new. The graphics are good, but not much different than the other Halo games. The gameplay is fun, but you play the same style in part 1 and 2.And these new Halo games coming out...please, Bungie needs to stop making all these off shoots of Halo (Halo Wars...Halo ODST). Some games have good sequels, and Bungie did the right thing in making a third installment, but it needs to be fresh not the same ol' game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I guess I don't see the big deal about Halo.

The weapons are awful and the graphics are ok. The worst part of the game is you can't run, and the sights on the guns lack any control!

It may be the same as the others but i expected it to be alittle bit longer that the first two. The story was not as epic and heartpounding as i expected from ending the Halo story. Everyones favorite A.I. lady Cortana isnt in it much so that was a letdown for me anyway. All in all Halo 3 is still one the best FPS of all time. Always remeber the hero's of the Great War"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as fun as the original halo but darn good effort","review":"I feel like the Halo series is a lot like the Godfather movie series. Each one was very well done, but everyone has their favorite. My favorite was halo 1. Just because there was nothing like it when it was realeased. The thrill and exhileration from that can't be matched.

I've been waiting for this title for years, and all I got was a SHORT rehash of Halo 1 & 2. Not much new here.

Most of the reviews are right saying that this game is geared for online play. I was blown away by Halo 1 and I still play it. All the halo's are good I guess for playing with your friends and talking smack ofterwards I guess but they have changed the game so much from HALO 1 gameplay that they should have gave it a different name.

We pondered long and hard whether or not it was appropriate for a boy his age, and decided that, for him, the war action and violence was not harmful, rather it was a means of cleansing his general sense of fearfulness or powerlessness. This is a kid who cries when a pet dies in a movie. This is a kid who is not shy, or introverted, or \\"dark\\", or mean. He plays sword-versus-monster games with his friends, then runs inside to catch Billy cartoons or to read Calvin and Hobbes books.The game is all about different weapons and explosions and alien enemies. We believe that experiencing the roles in mythic themes is not a bad thing for him. While we might prefer his curiosity and focus lay in math or basketball, we realize we ultimately will not eliminate whatever fascinations he holds for his world, and that withholding sometimes merely increases the attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated to the max!","review":"This is most overrated p.o.s.

It is lightweight and water resistant and easy to use and find the stopwatch. A couple of things I have noticed are that the paint chips a little bit, and while using the stopwatch function if you run in twilight, using the light function also stops your stopwatch! Otherwise, if you are looking for an inexpensive digital watch, you could do worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"The watch outlasts the band!","review":"The watch face lasts longer than the strap! I've had to replace it twice before I gave up on it entirely. I couldn't even find a replacement that would fit the silly watch.

It is all downhill forthe remaing two thirds.The author jumps around and is never ableto do more than make bizarre scenaros that are used to discreditlong held beliefs.The appendix contains charts that are so useless that the reader is reminded of the college freshman trickof filling the term paper with double spaced pages and anything that would thicken a weak report.The author makes many timeline errors and I had the feeling thatshe had not researched and verified much of the data."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and well-researched","review":"Interestingly written, fascinating research... analyzes various understandings of miraculous from the parapsychological to the psychoneuroimmunological to the theological.

In a prior review the customer stated that the machine runs but the needle stays put. The reason for this is a tiny little screw inside the plastic of the handwheel.

Around 1/3 of the book shows basics concepts ( Resonance , Heterodyning , Demodulation , Full-Wave Rectifiers , Zener Diode Regulators , etc. ). Chapters 3 , 4 and 5 ( around 90 pages ) describe the old Big-Dish Systems , used to receive C-band signals .Chapter 8 , dedicated to DBS systems , is very superficial ( just 25 pages ). The same occurs with chapter 10 , that presents Encryption/Decryption Technologies : 29 pages with no updated information. Finally , the Index found in the end of the book is very confused ; for example ,DBS Satellite Transponder refers the reader to page 214 , where will be found the schematic diagram for an IRD channel display circuit ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising delightful . . .","review":"The book encompasses some 120 stories out of 4000 submissions to a National Story Project.

It begins in Sunnydale but moves around a lot, giving us the characters we're used to as well as some new ones. The plot was good; it held my interest throughout.

Snyder, Harmony and others from school are in the story, I always like to see some of the semi regulars get a mention in the books as well.Very reluctantly Buffy and Willow have to work with Yulia, to stop Koschei and finish him off.It is a fun story and interesting to have a Russian theme something a bit different.It was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, poor construction","review":"The idea is excellent.

Although I do have a couple or so complaints about it. I can't believe the that Conner's drinking has increased and only Tia has noticed it. When is Liz going to notice and when she does, how far into denial will she go? This book didn't have a lot to say about Andy and how he's dealing with the fact that he thinks he's gay. I would like to here more about Andy and the relationship between Ken and Maria. As for the Jessica-Jeremy-Jade triangle, look out for another addition to the whole messy situation. This book was interesting and I can't wait for the next one.

I have watched several football documentaries and this one was middle of the road. It wasn't as solid as it could have been. I enjoyed it, but there wasn't that one thing that made this team special or stick out from the rest. The coverage of the games, interviews with players + coaches, and the whole Texas high school football environment was nice, but the video kind of drug on and left me wanting to skip to the end to simply see if this particular team would end up winning it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another guest artist CD that falls flat","review":"Other than John Lee Hooker's efforts that combine superstar guest artists; there are very few CDs that successfully make this combination work. And Buddy Guy's effort isn't one of them. The duets or combination songs just simply fall flat and are strangely uninspiring. Give this one a miss and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"More melodic, less pyrotechnics","review":"I have to admit that I have a fondness for the explosive side of Buddy Guy. When he's locked and loaded, he is a true weapon of mass destruction. That's why it took me awhile to adjust to the soulful, melodic side of Buddy that this album exhibits so beautifully. He's just reminding us that he can play with style and taste in addition to horsepower. If I have a beef with the album, it's the \\"and friends\\" concept that's being beaten to death in the music industry. People like John Mayer, Tracy Chapman and Carlos Santana certainly don't bring shame to an album, I just question why they're needed. I guess maybe as a sales booster but people like Carlos and Buddy should be above that by now. They're certainly earned their stripes in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT GREAT","review":"I know it's Buddy that is not enough to make it great. I bought this after reading the reviews and was kind of disappointed. It's not bad, just a lot of weak songs, very toned down and very few good guitar solos, just very slow and not the old smoking Buddy. Like always this is just my thoughts, and I am sure this one is not for everybody. Some will pick this review apart, but I am a huge Buddy Guy fan. I have over 30 cd's by him. I just find this one to be weak after listening to his others. Do yourself a favor listen before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guy is Great","review":"Another great Buddy Guy album. Good solos, his guitar tone is all there. some different styles. a must have for Buddy guy fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way Industrial Used To Be","review":"Ask somebody who'd never heard of the term what they thought 'industrial' music sounds like, and the chances are you'd get a pretty accurate description of Leechwoman. Bare-chested metal bashers with some ear-bashing guitar riffs and plenty of Nitzer-Ebb-esque vocals (i.e. lots of repetitive shouting). It's a very male, testosterone-fuelled form of industrial, far removed from the electro-goth crossover material that fills the worlds darkest dancefloors these days. However, if you fancy a change from the VNV Nation's and Apoptygma Berzerks of the world, 33 degrees might well prove to be the perfect tonic for your rivet-headed (oh, how some people HATE that term) indulgences. It's industrial music that really does sound industrial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"The anticipation of Task Force Dagger was quite high after playing Land Warrior mulitple times. Unfortunatley within minutes of my first mission I felt as though something was either wrong with me or the game. Why were the hostiles \\"Sitting Ducks\\" Where was the combat? Why did every barrack and building apprear to be the same as the last? Where was the dramatic music? Where was the need of urgency in the voices of my team? Where was my team? It wasn't me. It was the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are WAY better games","review":"If you are looking for good first person shooters, here is a list of some you should try: Half-Life, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Medal of Honor: Allied Assualt, Aliens vs. Predator 2, and Red Faction. The best thing about this game is the very large outdoor enviroment. Try any of these and you will decide that the Delta Force series [isn't as good]."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS AWSOME","review":"I BOUGHT THIS NOT EXPECTING MUCH BUT IT IS AWSOME!!! YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF MANY WEAPONS AND THAT IS AWSOME. BUT IT'S NOT SO UNREALISTIC WHERE YOU JUST [DESTROY] EVERYONE.

EXCELLENT GAME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt let down...","review":"I can't believe that anybody would say that this game has improved graphics over DFLW. They use the same engine, only this one seems to run slower. And the enemy AI is pathetic. You can almost walk up to some of them before they bother to notice you are there to take their lives. I have been down with the last 3 Delta Force games, but the only thing i can figure is that this last effort(or lack of effort) by Novalogic must be a way to make money before the greatest game, DF Black Hawk Down, gets here. The reason I gave this game 2 stars is because Novalogic had a good idea with letting you choose from 10 different special forces soldiers, and because i love the supressed M4. If you really feel compelled to get this game, then go ahead. But if you can hold out until Black Hawk Down gets here, then wait for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out!","review":"Watch out if your on a high end machine. I built a high end machine with 3.06ghz 2gigs of Ram on a ATI 9700 Pro using windows XP PRO, and I got a virtual memory error but only with this game. All my other games work awesome, Wolfenstien, medal of honor, battlefield 1942, unreal 2, UT2003,and soldier of fortune2 to name a few. So its definatly not the machine, it runs all of them at the highest settings like a dream except this one. This is just a word of warning, oh yea this game ran good on my old system p3 550 with XP home on it. So just keep that in mind. I hope Black Hawk down runs good. It better with this much power............................."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Having played many of the Delta Force games, I'd say this is the WORST release of them all. This series has always suffered from weak enemy AI and Task Force Dagger is no exception. The design work was hurried as there are many glitches. You can find crates floating 6 inches off the ground, large gaps from poor alignment in the tunnels, and events that don't trigger just to name a few. All-in-all, a shoddy piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naysaysers have it wrong!","review":"This game has improved graphics over Delta Force Land Warrior. Anybody who says otherwise has NOT tried this game yet. When you are looking through your scope your sights will wobble a bit when standing, but the more secure your stance the less this happens (an improvement over solid stances in DFLW). As an avid gun enthusiast I can say this game has the most realistic aiming and ballistics I have seen yet in a video game. The AI has been improved but not by much.In another review I read on this site somebody claimed Novalogic never updates their games. I think he should check the Novalogic site as a few weeks ago they released a patch for Delta Force Land Warrior which at least temporarily hampered the cheaters that use trainers which can do such things as unlimited ammo or extreme zooms. I love this game and it is definitely worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game, Too Many BUGS....","review":"If your a fan of the Delta Force Series, this is still a must. I love it BUT they really rushed to put it out to market. There is a lot of bugs. For one example, The mission: Capture the General that is protected by 3 guards in the tallest building. I never got to the building, I never saw the gaurds, but when I killed the last bad guy outside the building, it said Mission Complete\\". There a few missions like this. Other missions say kill everyone, and after killing 10 of 15 bad guys, it said the mission was finished. But still it was worth playing because of the current events taking place in the middle east. Time flew while I played it, and finished the game in 2 days. I was disappointed that the campaigns where the same as quick missions, unlike DF past games. Being a sniper in the helicopter was the BEST mission! I can't wait for Blackhawk Down, BUT PLEASE TEST IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm..","review":"First of all my keycode was already in use by 5 other Nova accounts. So I contacted support.

The graphics are not very impressive; most of the details end up just being billboards. The AI is pathetic. It requires no skill to walk through each mission. The different characters have little impact on game play. For example: The SEAL, having a specialty in the medicinal field, is quite capable of picking off the enemy, standing, with an OICW at about 500m. The only silver lining is that I have not seen it crash and Novalogic provides an update utility. Basically, this is trash.If you want something similar, but better:Return to Castle WolfensteinGhost Recon, and mission packsOperation: FlashpointSoldier of Fortune II (some reservations).Medal of Honor (some reservations).If you are just looking for a game:Dungeon Siege (This was deceptively fun)Warcraft IIIJedi Knight IIOr some on the Horizon that look good:The ThingHitman 2Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness"},{"rating":"1","title":"horribible","review":"STEAR CLEAR DELTA FORCE AHEAD TASK FORCE DAGGER AHEAD!!

If you've never seen Wilco live, you need to run out and buy this CD, because as good as YHF, A Ghost is Born etc., are, the studio recordings only hint at what an amazing band Wilco really is. Part of the joy of seeing them live is feeling the connection that Wilco has with their fans, and as much as it is possible to feel through a CD player, you feel. Jeff Tweedy sounds confessional, and the band moves between intimate moments and explosive sound. Wilco becomes increasing more and more experimental each time I see them, and this live album reflects that experimentation. If you love WIlco, you need to own this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"note: i write this as an avid wilco/jeff tweedy fan. as said fan, i feel an obligation to share critical feedback. i was really excited to throw the disc in when i bought it. however, i almost immediately felt something missing. i figured i just needed to give it a few listens. but still, i wasn't \\"feelin' it\\". then by chance my wife was playing an earlier recording of a show in denmark. same tour. and i realized how much more energy, rawness and life existed in that show than in the chicago show captured on this official release. the chicago show just sounds way too safe, way too \\"perfect\\"? what happened? were these shows at the vic just too contrived? too prepared? too self consciously performed? very underwhelming experience for me. find a bootleg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs - shame about the audience.","review":"Moronic audience whooping noises distract from the music. Avoid this and check out the studio releases - unless you are American and are used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this band","review":"This is a great live cd which showcases the amazing talent of the band.The best song is \\"Ashes to the Amercian Flag\\" because it is dramatically different from the cd Yankee Foxtrot Hotel. The end of the song has stunning guitar solo from Nels Kline. \\"Misunderstood\\" is done in a very dramatic fashion and \\"Spiders/killsmoke\\" rocks the house down.Most of the songs are off of their last 2 albums. THis seems to be a collection of different performances. My only knock on this cd is that I wish (since it was a double cd) that they would have included earlier works as well.I cannot say enough good things about this band. They are excellent musicians, Tweedy is a masterful songwriter, there are aching vocals and the group pushes itself and takes chances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2005: There's no place like home...","review":"Life is better when you're home. This is the case of this live album, where Wilco gives the best of each band member while they deliver the performance of a lifetime in their hometown of Chicago throughout each of the 23 songs.Having heard the band play live during their visit to Orlando in early 2005, listening to this performance sent me back to the day I saw them play at House of Blues, a day that left an indelible memory in my mind. With Jeff Tweedy also fronting the band, though with a shorter set than the one \\"Kicking Television: Live in Chicago\\" offers, they impressed me as one of the best and most true-to-form live acts I've ever seen.This album takes my impression of the band a step further, with impeccable renditions of the best from their last two albums along with a handful of classic Wilco tunes. It easily qualifies as one of the best live albums to come along in a long time, and one of 2005's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neo classic band at its peak","review":"Over the last few years, Tweedy and the band have seamlessly absorbed Neil Young, the Stones (who they opened for last fall), the Beach Boys, the Beatles, not to mention some 70s prog rock a la Genesis into their own signature sound. In the process, they've found their own identity. They're instantly recognizable, and, while still not known to most classic rock aficionados, are steadily veering toward the mainstream.Having seen them live 2 or 3 times in the last couple of years, this is, as Rolling Stone put it, \\"a love letter to their fans\\".The recording quality is excellent, and the setlist consists mostly of material from the two most recent albums with a few older gems (\\"one by one\\" is outstanding) thrown in for good measure.I'd go so far as to say this is a great starting point even if you don't have any Wilco albums, and definitely a must have for long time fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"ladies and gentlemen the wilco experience","review":"I can't really give this album a full review. I am only writing this as a fan who has seen the band live and have to say that the act is excellent. Wilco is a special act because it is an intimate one. They suck you into their little world of beauty and cross-musical brilliance. They require an attentive audience, but one that enjoys the music as well. The only drawback is for someone who has not seen the band and only has a CD to fall back on. Otherwise, something like this is a great reminder of how fun rock and roll can be. The real thing is more like five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a 48th opinion?","review":"I need there to be at least 48 reviews of this album so that I can sleep at night. That is all. Oh, and Wilco stirs an emotion within me similar to that of unicorn giggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"I really can't remember why I picked up this CD. Maybe I read all the great reviews here. Maybe I'm just always searching out GOOD music that I haven't heard before. I do know that in my quest for great CD's (some of which are obscure, some of which are well known), occasionally I pick one up one in which I think to myself, \\"huh, what was I thinking?\\". Don't get me wrong, I tried to like this CD. I've listened to it several times, and while its OK in places it just doesn't do anything for me. The sound of the vocals tend to be annoying to me. Hmmm, well, to each his own. I guess those that find this CD \\"amazing\\", and it seems there are many, are listening to something different than I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Band, but Not their Greatest Tunes","review":"Wilco is great band who has produced some excellent albums over the past years. Their best works, \\"Being There\\" and \\"Summerteeth\\" saw a cutting edge band moving away from lead man Jeff Tweedy's Uncle Tupelo twang past, and findnig his own sound with the assistance of a great supporting cast of equals. \\"Kicking Television\\" covers \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" and \\"A Ghost is Born\\" almost exclusively. While \\"Foxtrot\\" won a grammy, \\"A Ghost is Born\\" was a major disappointment.If you like earlier Wilco, pick up a bootleg from the Summerteeth tour and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as being there","review":"This album clearly defines why Wilco is the best band touring today or any day. The connection that Tweedy makes with the audience is crystal clear, as is the harmonious instrumentation that this current line-up display. Each musician in the band is a virtuoso in his own right, and Nels Cline sharp guitar is a welcome addition indeed. I usually don't like live albums, as the audience noise is a distraction, but it is clear on this recording that the audiecne was too much in awe to get in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Live record","review":"First off, Spiders (kidsmoke) is indeed great in this performance, but I still don't get the dislike some people have for the album version.Also, regarding complaints of the song selection, do you really want Wilco to play shows like the Rolling Stones? Cycle the hits and call it a day? They are playing the songs and creating a sound that they want, and they picked the tracks that fit best. Why do you think that they write new songs?That said, hearing the band play these tunes so well - particularly Poor Places, Spiders, Company in my Back, Via Chicago, Shot in the Arm...there really isn't a bad track on the album - just makes me want to hear what new material the band will release next.It was nice to hear Tweedy's easy interaction with the audience. I'm glad that he's found a group of players that he feels fully comfortable with...at least for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alt. Country meets noise jazz","review":"Wow. Like peanut butter and jelly, mixing alternative country rockers Wilco (as if Tweedy and company can be that easily pigeon-holed) with noise-jazz improvisational guitarist Nels Cline has created an unforseen musical marriage made in Heaven. Haunting melodies, biting lyrics ... and now, meaningfully edgy instrumental accompaniament and solos to drive the whole message home with a flourish. Bravo! I, for one, hope that this meeting of spirits can continue.The only slight downside is the lack of material from earlier studio albums A.M. and Being There. But considering the quality of the music on the discs, you will soon forget all about that omission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show-Stopper","review":"This is an amazing recording! I was just introduced to the band live in Asheville, NC a month or so ago. I didn't know any of the songs but loved every one for different reasons. This recording brought back the entire show to the forefront of my brain. The writing is so subtle yet the technique so good. This is one of the freshest things I have heard in years. If you are a Wilco fan, you will not be disappointed in this CD. If you're not one yet, it may make you consider seeing and hearing more of this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Warning","review":"This item is for the 1st gen shuffle, the long one, not the 2nd gen shuffle that looks like a clip.

I pawned it off on my hubby who has smaller legs and knees thinking he would like it. He couldn't use it either. Just too hard. I would recommend looking for one that is made of poly fill or memory foam, as this high density foam version has \\"sharp\\" edges and is painful.As a side note, I moved it down to just above my ankle and was able to use it there without pain.

My only gripe with this watch is that when using the time display, the day and date display at the top of the window is kinda small and difficult to read.The face and overall size of the watch are a bit larger than normal, but that's what I wanted. It does look a little off-balance because there are three metal side buttons that protrude, but the 4th one (at the 10 o'clock position) does not.Update on 1/2010 - the battery died already. I think I've only owned this watch for 1 and 1/2 years. On all of the previous Casio watches I've owned the watch died before the battery. Maybe the watch broke? I'll have to try a new battery and see if that fixes it. I have not abused this watch or submerged it so this failure is unexpected. For this reason, I'v downgraded my rating from 4 to 2 stars.Update on 5/6/2010 replaced the battery, but no joy. Watch is broken.

When I called SanDisk, the guy told me that the drive had to be reformatted and that there was no way to save the files. He also said that the reason was probably that I had removed the drive before I had stopped it (and everyone will do that at least once -- sometimes the computer won't let the drive stop).

Being an IT specialist, I carry it on my keyring and keep drivers and setup files on it. It's never let me down, and never cracked, even in the tightest squeezes on roofs or under desks. The blue light is kind of fun too. In short, for the memory size (256 is ALOT more than you think!), the price and the ruggedness, you will NOT get a better drive.

The speed is good enough for me, especially at the price. Two caps come with it, a small std type and one that fits right over it so you can use it as a keyring and keep the scratches off. HOWEVER, the caps don't stay on as a previous reviewer mentioned but it is a small thing compared to the rest of the features and something am sure I can sort with a little rubber strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Service from Sandisk","review":"I bought this product last year and I really like it.

I don't know why they can not do that by email but I won't bother to email them anymore, just call them because you have to do that anyway. Besies, I requested the RMA on March 6th, I shipped it on March 8th (after 2 days Authorization) and they havn't ship the replacement out till today (March 20). Maybe they are in the Spring vacation?

However, it soon became evident how \\"late forties\\" the writing style is, with so much lingo and attitude of that era filtering into the story. Then, there is the increasingly preposterous turn of events in Candy's adventures. While the author makes a game attempt at providing a dog's-eye view of the world, it becomes increasingly apparent that the behavior your are reading about is simply not how a dog would really behave, especially under these circumstances of being lost. It finally became so full of loony plot devices and goofy twists that I found myself cringing at the ridiculousness of each new turn of events. I am a sentimental person by nature, and I love dogs, but this book is not realistic enough for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Good Book","review":"This was an extremely good book.

I was pleased that Amazon.com had it at a small cost but was a little disappointed at the appearance of the book as it had been owned by a Junior high school and had some grafitti in it. But the book was intact and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and was pleaed that Junior high students liked it well enough to get it a little used-looking as I enjoyed it as an adult.

There is no need for this subject to be dreary not to mention the inanity of the charts that are incorporated within the text. I stuck through the first 115 pages and then put it aside; far aside.Yes, University Presses are understandably higher priced than mainstream publishing, but the U. of Chicago Press should have staple bound this and distributed it to those libraries that might have a readership interest.

America has long been afraid of Islam and Muslims for they are not people to be easily conquered. This is the nature of Islam, it teaches all it's faithful to stand against oppression and injustice. That is why the U.S. fears Islam. 99.9% of Muslims do not hold violent beliefs, but yet they are judged by what the less than 1% of Muslims do.

It does say familiar Woody phrases when you push the star on the front (there is no pull string). Within a few minutes of playing with it, one of the arms came unattached at the elbow and then later at the shoulder. It is something I would expect to get in a happy meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"De belles mélodies, sans prétention","review":"Antoine Reicha (1770-1836), tchèque de naissance mais établi à Paris, a composé plus de 25 quintettes pour instruments à vent (flte, hautbois, clarinette, basson, cor).Ces oeuvres ont plutt pour fonction de plaire à l'oreille que d'exprimer des sentiments profonds. Elles renferment de belles mélodies empreintes de vitalité et de virtuosité.Les deux quintettes (opus 88, no 5 et opus 91, no 1) sur ce disque ne font pas bande à part. Tous les mouvements (en particulier les 1er et 4e) se démarquent par la richesse de leur composition. Reicha n'était manifestement pas à court d'inspiration.Le jeu des instrumentistes est excellent. Le son est bon, mais pas complètement limpide. À défaut de décerner 4,5 étoiles à cet enregistrement, j'en alloue 5, ne serait-ce qu'en raison de son prix très abordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reiner and CSO at the top of their game","review":"Fritz Reiner's tenure with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was the greatest collaboration in the history of symphonic music in the United States. This recording showcases them at the height of their considerable powers. The exemplary playing of the brass section is worthy of special accolades: Kudos to Adolph Herseth (the greatest orchestral trumpeter the world has yet known), Frank Crisafulli, Arnold Jacobs, and the rest. Fritz Reiner has such complete command of the orchestra that he can afford to let it play loudly yet not lose cohesiveness. The performances are richly emotional and evocative, doing full justice to Wagner's orchestral colors. The sound is remarkably lively and clear for a recording that dates from the 1950's. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"woman on trial by lawrencia bembenek","review":"Great book!!!! Read it in 2 days. What happened to her could happen to any of us .

He was, along with Herbie Hancock, Bill Summers, and Mike Clark, an originator of seventies jazz-funk fusion. Here, he touches on his old style and updates it, making a unique blend of old-school funk with newer sounds and reminds us of what can come from letting tradition inform present trends. Though he can play amazing stuff, he never loses sight of his central role in driving the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album by the SWANS","review":"This is my second SWANS album, and I was just as impressed with this album as my other album, \\"White Light from the Mouth of Infinity\\". If you like something different, this is your band. The only thing that I wasn't thrilled with were the childrens' voices. I have always thought that was kind of silly. It's not done poorly here; it's just a matter of taste. I'd say don't hesitate: buy this album and \\"White Light...\\". I plan to buy more SWANS until I have all of their albums. Oh - the other thing - it's a great deal for 17 songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one terrific album","review":"In this later chapter in the Swans career you see Gira and Jarboe getting a pace that had not had for some years. In the Great Annihilator Swans rock quite a bit faster then a previous years.. less sensual and elegant yet never lacking in expression. \\"Mothers Milk\\" however reminds us and lets us know the ethereal gorgeousness of former albums has not gone anywhere. Many style of music peak thier heads into the Swans entire career but never stand alone. The music of this album however is tinged more then past efforts with great accesability.The safest bet for new comers to Swans would deffinately be this album, \\"Various Failures\\" and \\"Children of God, World of Skin\\" Thier greatest albums still need to be reprinted desperately... Look them up if you want a great big fat tease!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where did this album come from?","review":"This is unlike anything in SWANS entire catalog and by far the most accessible and infectious. One listen and you will be addicted to this strange new sound. There isn't really anything to say about Anihilator that hasn't already been said in these reviews. I'll just add this: a largely unknown alternative rock treasure from a pioneering band whose influence can be felt across many genres of contemporary music. See my SWANS listmania for more details.

It takes place in the future when the world is run by Masters of special machines. On their 14th birthday, children are taken from their dorms, and turned into one of these machines. This book is about a group of free humans, who live in a submarine, owned by Shade, a computer personality. This may sound a bit weird, but it is truly a great book. I also recommend Sabriel which is by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspensingly fufilling","review":"THis book is one of the best i've read.

It often travelled the path I least suspected, but no matter how much I regretted reading some incidents, I said the hell with it, because this was an increadible book. Gold-Eye, finding Ninde as a lover, was a good choice by Garth nix, and the heros (Ella and Drum) where also satifying characters. My feelings for Shade changed through out the book, when sometimes i wanted him dead, and others, I Enjoyed his choices and presence.

It gripped me from the first page, and I was immediately engulfed into this strange and terrifying world. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the ending seems to occur too quickly. It would be really interesting if a prequel was written - so that we can find out how this imaginative world was created."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK WAS THE EXCELLENT","review":"Who ever says this book was bad, DEEZ!

It truely was the best book I've ever picked up. From the first page to the last, I honestly could not put it down. Garth is such a good writer I bought all of his other books the next day. Every little thing was in such good detail I could make a little movie in my head the whole time. I'll probably read this book over and over again. I think I'll start reading Sabriel today. I definitly recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast-paced thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat","review":"Garth Nix's \\"Shades Children\\" is truly a masterpiece. 400 pages of pure intensity!

I am not what you would call an avid reader, but I sat down and read this book over the span of one week, not doing much else.

Beware of Language!","review":"shades Children is one of the best science fiction books i have ever read. From the very first page you are locked into the world that Nix has created. The only reason this book is missing a star is because there were F-Words in it, which I thought took highly away from the pleasure of the book. I am in eight grade, and if swearing bugs you as much as it bugs me, i would reccomend reading this book with caution,however, the plot was fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure it's disturbing. That's all the fun.","review":"Yes, this book is disturbing. All adults gone, kids harvested for parts, death everywhere. But that chill is the beauty of the work. While I read this book at when I thought i would be too old for the writing, I was still too young for the content. I have to admit practically crying at the end. This book moved me in such a way that I was freaked, yet inspired. Hey, that's good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is the most fun I've ever gotten out of reading a book, and I'm a Jock! I cant believe this book hasn't won more awards!

It is actually one of my favorites. Garth Nix put so much detail and emotion into it, that it was practically realistic.A fiction book about children living without their parents. Raised by Shade, a hologram. They are living in a dreadful nightmare. Children are being captured and sent to the Meat Factory to be turned into vicious creatures. This is a very scary book, but it's also very fascinating and creative.Not everyone will be able to handle the tragedy though, so if you are looking for comedy, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT!!!","review":"I wasn't sure I would like this book at first... but boy was I wrong! I didn't read this book by choice, I had to read it for a teen book discussion group at the lbrary. From the first chapter on, I couldn't put it down! I started the book on September 7 and I had read the whole thing TWICE by September 9. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story with lots of plot twists and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"When I read this book I found it only mildly entertaining. Generally, it's about some super-hero children trying to save the world, and off course they doand everything is happily ever after. All around, this book is unrealistic, dull, and contains gross content that is totally irrelevant to the plot and could be removed without taking away from the story. This is not one of Garth Nix's better books. If you want to read something decent by this author, try Sabriel, Lirael, or Abhorsen. But Shade's Children is just a waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography","review":"I think that this book is ill suited for even adults with Garth Nix's sick mind.

For example, the opening scene is looking at the Golden Gate Bridge from a walking birds eye view on the beach - for three minutes. The waves are only about 3 inches high. And I really don't need a flock of seaguls walking up and looking into the camera.The biggist problem is that the DVD is divided into seven separate \\"days,\\" with the same redundant view of palm trees followed by very annoying computer graphics rolling into view at the beginning of each new section. It is guaranteed to wake you up and annoy you if you were starting to relax. And almost all of it was shot from the same very low point of view, withought ever giving you a real perspective on the scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have used loctite glue and it wasn't bad but this adhesive just doesn't stick.

This echt-Russian sextet (forget the title, there's nothing Italian about it) is given a fantastic performance. The second movement is mostly a duet of Violin I and Cello I with the other players supporting. Piatigorsky and Heifetz transcend their ensemble skills and their huge technical equipment to make something rather magical. Heifetz was deservedly famous for the ability to play the hardest stuff superbly, but his gifts shone just as much when there was a beautiful melody that had to be delivered just so to make its effect. He delivers and Piatigorsky matches him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This version - on Esperanto/ESP8052 - it also says M.I.L (Multimedia) on the back of the cd, is a BOOTLEG and very poorly recorded.

This CD has an ethereal beauty which is difficult to describe; the vocals and music merge seamlessly to create some magic! Do yourself a favor and buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Allure of Blonde Redhead","review":"I've been a fan of Blonde Redhead since their first release and Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons is yet another beautiful album. But why am I and many other people in love with them? Most of their songs are very melodic, which makes a pleasant balance with their occasional use of heavy, percussive guitar and siren-like vocals. The lyrics are often vague or enigmatic, leaving interpretation up to the listener. But I think the most unique characteristic of their music is that it tickles -- Blonde Redhead has a rare sense of timing and chord changes that plays with the expectations of the ear. With repeated listenings, their songs move deeper and stimulate our primordial enjoyment of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, ominous, delicious.","review":"I listened to the album for the first time through on headphones this morning and it sounded to me like the last songs of a Hallowe'en dance at a high school in the 1980's -- leaves swirling in the dusk and a half-smoked, hastily-discarded cigarette smouldering in the garbage bin in the girl's washroom. Uneasy -- the potential for something bad to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, Easy Reading","review":"I recommend this book for anyone who is tired of reading through numerous theology books about the creation of earth and only coming up with more questions. Not only does this wonderfully written book explain every aspect of Genesis in clear, precise detail, but it leaves out the ridiculous theories and suppositions that so many \\"Christian\\" authors are prone to include in their work. Chapter highlights and quizzes only further enhance your grasp on the wonderfully intriguing book of Genesis.

'One Trick Pony' is not the first album that comes to mind in his extensive cannon. (\\"How terribly strange to be 70\\") Who would have thought that he would still be making quality, relevant music 50 years on? I ignored this album when it first came out, but that was my loss. The first song, \\"Late in the Evening\\" appears on later compilations, but it seemed pretentious to me when I first heard it. What part it plays in the movie, I don't know, but the song, and the album, has withstood the test of time. Stand out tracks include \\"How the heart approaches what it Yearns\\", \\"Jonah\\" and the bonus track \\"Stranded in a Limousine\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend Kindergarten Jitters!!","review":"This is a fantastic book! It is written in easy-to-understand language...perfect for preschoolers. The pictures are adorable and show the typical first-day experiences of kindergarten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I have read all of the Pern books more than once, and it is wonderful to get the music she writes so much about in your ears while you're reading. It's similar to watching the movie before reading the book...you see the images of the characters already. For those of us who cannot write our own music, it allows us to listen to what the harpers of Pern really wrote. With an Irish feel, using primitive sounding instruments, the music gets under your skin. You'll be singing the Question Song for a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to listen to","review":"This is one of my most favorite CDs to listen to, especially after a hard and stressful day. I love the alternating lyrical songs with just instrumental. The music matches the lyrics and of course, the lyrics are memorable.Once you hear the music, you must listen while reading, especially reading Moreta, Nerilka, or The Masterharper of Pern. If you listen while you read any of the books that have the harpers harping, it just adds to the feeling that you are there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She DID hear the music!","review":"As a long-time lover of Anne McCaffrey's \\"Dragon Riders of Pern\\" series, I just knew that the author could hear the music that goes with the lyrics liberally spread through her books. Finally, two composers have turned what she heard into music that the rest of us could listen to and enjoy. And they got it right! This is a lovely CD with grand music that just fits the books. Wish that they had done this sooner! This CD is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Masterharper of Pern","review":"I admit that I cried when I read this book. More than once. I love the way Anne McCaffrey writes: she makes you feel like you are there- on Pern, watching as the story unfolds, only knowing as much as the characters. Little Rob is so cute, and he only gets cuter and wiser as he grows up into MasterHarper Robinton. He settles a land dispute by pointing out that a wall has two sides, falls in love, becomes a father, speaks to dragons, turns into a spy, and becomes a major political leader for Pern.What a harper hears is for the Harper's ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"cd masterharper of pern","review":"Am loving the first half of the cd but the last four songs would not load or play.

A definite feeler-oriented book, as opposed to thinker-oriented book. If you get galvanized by an activist who likes to play victim, then this book is for you.I recommend the Bradley Method very highly. I simply wanted a better book about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dated","review":"I'm only about half way though, but not currently impressed. As mentioned, there are some good relaxation techniques, however, the diet portion is basically eat lots of protein to sustain energy and maintain blood sugar levels, the exercises are nill to none for anyone whose not completely sedentary, and much of the hospital info is very dated. In short, it didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but racy pictures","review":"The book is great for anyone who wants to learn different natural birthing techniques. We didn't have the money to take the actual Bradley Method classes, so I figured I'd read as much as I could to prepare for my son's birth. The book had a lot of position suggestions for relieving labor pain, but I don't think we used many of them during my labor. Things happen so fast that you forget a lot of what you read. The one thing I do remember was being shocked when I opened the book and saw the pictures. They are very explicit. I found \\"Hypnobirthing\\" to be the most helpful natural childbirth book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"This book is very biased towards home births. also read The Bradley Method, and felt that this book although it incorporated some of the same ideas, didn't seem to line up with the Bradley Method. I also found many of the pictures unnecessary. I must admit that I didn't read this all the way-but rather skimmed the topics and eventually returned the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much pressure for me!","review":"This is an informative, eye-opening book about labor and delivery. I am glad that I read this book as I feel it prepared me for what my body would be going through during labor and delivery. However, I felt that the book placed too much emphasis on having a natural, drug free delivery no matter what. This book gives you one point of view - no drugs, no intervention. After reading this book, I felt inspired to go natural, however, that wasn't possible for me. Medical intervention was necessary for my health and the health of my baby. So, when things didn't progress \\"naturally\\" as this book told me they would, I felt somewhat like a failure. Keep in mind that this book deals with the best case scenario and every delivery is unique. Read this book to inform yourself, but keep an open mind about your birth and trust your OWN instincts instead of this author's ideas and expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted a sermon I'd go to church...","review":"I found this book one-sided and preachy. They dismiss all other methods of childbirth as inferior, and imply that if you don't follow their method you're inferior too.I hope to have a natural childbirth, but it certainly won't be due to the Bradley Method! A far better choice is The Birth Book by Drs. William and Martha Sears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't follow the ideas in this book","review":"After 26 hours of labor the doctor finally convinced me that we had to sucction my baby out. I had studied the bradley book and method and really believed in it. I was so sure that there was no such thing as a dry birth...but there certainly is. I also remembered not to give up because the baby may be born just minutes after the doctor has intervened, so I really \\"hung in there\\" sure that I could do it. My point is... find adoctor that you trust and listen to him or her. I hope that I can help others to avoid the nightmare birth experience that I had with my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a really great book. It is very informative and gives \\"how to\\" information for how to have a natural birth. This book and my natural birth to my baby changed my life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really informative and helpful!","review":"We took The Bradley Method with all three of our children. This book was wonderful at assisting with choosing your childbirth educator, your doctor, affect of drugs in labor, nutrition, the stages of birth, relaxation techniques and many other things related to the birth process and choices you may have to make during your labor. Susan is very easy to understand and provides a clear picture and expectation of what you can expect. Thank you so much for writing this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly Like Taking the Class","review":"I took Bradley classes for my first baby. This book is terrific, both my husband and I read it from cover to cover. It gives complete information on Bradley and what happens to a woman's body, and how a woman can prepare for what will happen. Though I had to have a c-section, I spent the first 18 hours of my labor unmedicated and by helping me learn what I would feel like (emotionally and physically) this book helped those 18 hours be as positive as they could be. I highly recommend this book and Bradley - forget Lamaze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written. Good Information.","review":"This book is often cited as a definitive resource. I'd say its age is showing. That is, attitudes around natural childbirth have changed a lot since this was first written. I believe for the better. This book has an underlying preachy and condescending tone, as if it is trying to cajole readers into aligning with the authors view. I'm converted. Most readers are at least receptive to the idea of natural childbirth being a reasonable and viable choice for expectant mothers. The attitude is not called for and is distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really out of date, even if this was still 1996","review":"Details about hospital practices and medications are out of date even by 1996 standards. A whole chapter on the dangers of Bendectin for nausea? That drug was taken off the market in 1983 by the manufacturer. What exactly was updated? The cover art?Why can't there be a book that teaches natural childbirth techniques without the tinfoil hat, anti-medical (and not even remotely accurate anymore) hysteria?"},{"rating":"2","title":"truly natural childbirth preparation","review":"My husband and I have to travel a lot and so we knew we wouldn't be in one place long enough to take a childbirth preparation class. We asked my midwife for suggestions on how to prepare for the home birth of our first baby, and this is what she recommended. We're so glad.It's actually written more towards a hospital-birth audience, but the principles are the same. My favorite part is the exercises and activities (like the husband talking the wife through relaxing through a contraction) to practice while pregnant in preparation for childbirth.The only part I don't particularly like is that all the illustrations are black-and-white photographs of naked women. I don't find them particularly clear, and would have preferred simple line drawings like those used in my pregnancy book (The Joy of Pregnancy: The Complete, Candid, and Reassuring Companion for Parents-to-Be)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected much better. Very dated.","review":"I bought this book after a friend recommended it and had used the information (not the method) to have a natural homebirth. I was expecting a lot more. The information was general and very dated. There were a few things to learn, but I found the narrative to be narrow-minded and theoretical (vs. medical). The layout was a little confusing, ie. there are three phases of X ... and then no list of the phases.I found \\"Preparation for Birth\\" far superior. While it is Lamaze based (not Bradley based), the information is relevant for any birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book may make you a little more afraid to give birth","review":"I thought this book was oddly fear based in how it was written. It talks a lot of the \\"scary\\" things that happen in hospitals and during labor. As many people have mentioned, it is DEFINITELY outdated. As a pregnant woman with my first, I don't feel any less anxious or relaxed after reading this. There are other books out there (Ina May's Guide and Birthing from Within) which will make you feel a LOT better about giving birth compared to this book. Overall, the advice I would consider helpful in this book are described in detail in many other books, so I would skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Resource for Natural Birth","review":"This book was easy to read and understand. If you are looking for a book to help you with a natural birth this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw this evil book away!!!","review":"I usually donate or share books when I am done using them, however this one was so outdated, sexist and evil that I recycled it to avoid passing it on to others. I was trying to prepare for natural childbirth using the Bradley method, but I found this information to be extremely biased and negative towards any opinions other than those presented by the writer. References towards traditional hospital procedures tying a mother to the bed for the delivery were incredibly inaccurate and obviously geared to scare an uneducated mother. I delivered a 9lb 2.4 oz baby naturally and it was hard, but this book was of no assistance what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"I liked Husband-Coached Childbirth much better. This one spent so much time telling me why everything else was bad, rather than selling me on why this one was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I wrote a review on Husband Coached Childbirth (other Bradley Birth book) but I have to say, this book has a lot more value for those who are interested in the method of Bradley Childbirth. I Really love the method, but the classes can be long as well as somewhat expensive for families are on a tight budget. I would say if taking the classes are not an option for you for any reason but you are still very interested in the method, then definitely get this book. I pretty much covers what the classes cover. I do have to say though, that if you can, you should take the classes. The teachers are very knowledgeable about birth and can be a great support system for the parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way to go!","review":"I am not a big reader, but this book was easy to read. It kept things really simple. I also liked that it separated my job versus my husband's job. I ended up having a c-section so we were unable to put all the knowledge that this book provided to use. As they say, \\"knowledge is power,\\" and this book provided the peace of mind i needed during my pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was great. It was exactly what I was looking for. With my first child, I tried Lamaze for about two seconds before deciding I could do better just using my own common sense. The Bradley method was recommended to me for my second birth. Although we haven't gotten to use the method yet, I am very excited to try it and enjoy practicing. This book is great at explaining the method thoroughly and advising you what to do when. My only complaint would be that some of the information regarding hospital/doctor policies tends to be a little over-exaggerated and would probably scare a lot of women right out of a hospital birth. Overall, I think this book is very helpful and I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for preparing on a natural childbirth","review":"I loved this book the BEST book to prepare for a natural childbirth. Some things you might want to read quick and not to seriously, just use your own common sense and take the best things out of this book. and ... I had a natural childbirth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned a lot of great information from this book.","review":"Anyone interested in childbirth the natural way, meaning no medications of any kind, should read this book. It provided me with a wonderful brithing experience and even though I had a 26 hour labor, 3 hours of pushing, I had no medications at all. I highly recommend this book to any pregnant woman so that you can make an informed choice about your birth experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview of the most popular natural childbirth method, but...","review":"A lucid explanation of childbirth and the Bradley Method, an approach to childbirth whose primary tenet is that a normal birth is an unmedicated one with minimal interference. Like many Bradley texts, its photographs and an underlying suspicion of contemporary obstetrical practice show it to be slightly dated and biased, but the text could not have been more gratifyingly clear. I highly recommend it to anyone considering natural childbirth. Once we have the baby, I'll write an updated opinion. ;)UPDATE (1/19/08): Everything we gained from having read this book served as well in childbirth. I recommend the book even more highly now that we've had the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Method","review":"My mother used the Bradley method with my youngest brother....She made having a baby look easy. I bought this book to learn more about The Bradley method....which it did a wonderful job with. I'm currently using the exercises and I love how it includes my husband in the process. However, I am also training to be a neonatologist (pediatrician with extra training in sick newborn infants, term and pre-term). I have been called to countless normal delivery where things went really wrong. Most of the medical information in this book is severely outdated (nearly all of my books from medical school are outdated as well) and that is my biggest critique. Looking through the bibliography most of the information was taken from the early 80's....... MUCH has changed since then. Your OB needs to be your allie and if you choose wisely she won't steer in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had read it....","review":"As a Bradley Method teacher, I would highly recommend that every pregnant mother and her partner read this book and keep it close by to refer to in labor. In fact, I wish I had read it before the birth of my first child. The part I think most beneficial to first time pregnant women, who have never experienced labor before is parts two and three, the first and second stages of birth. Every woman wonders most about what labor will be like and I think Susan McCutcheon does and excellent job at thoroughly explaining what will happen and what a woman will go through during the stages of birth. The illustrations and pictures in this book are so helpful too! Definitely a must-have and must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative!","review":"This book is very good at showing you how to do the exercises, what positions are best in labor, and giving wording for relaxation. It has a lot of pictures and is easy to follow! I am not able to make the classes, so this book is what I am using to train myself in the Bradley Method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very educational!!","review":"Very educational book, I highly recommend it for women looking to learn about the birthing process. Careful leaving this book laying around, though! There are many graphic pictures of the birthing process that are not suitable for little eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bradley way or the natural way?","review":"This book is fantastic for those who want guidance on how to give birth naturally. Guidance? I hear you say....these days, giving birth is so medicalised that its difficult to remember how we gave birth before doctors! If your pregnancy falls into the 'normal' category and you want 'natural' then fantastic! This book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"If you can invision the process of childbirth, you've conquered at least half the battle to a healthy and drugfree delivery. You will understand the process quite perfectly after you have read this book. From a husband's point of view, this book delivers a very clear picture of the childbirth process. Very clear, concise and informative. One rather irrelevant negative - I don't quite understand the title - ... The Bradley Way? Huh? ... It's the \\"natural way\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, Defensive","review":"I was uncomfortable that the first two chapters talk about why this method is so superior to everything else on the planet. I wouldn't have bought the book if I didn't hope so myself, but it seemed odd to be that defensive. It was a little childish. I skipped those chapters for the most part.It's also a little hard to take this book seriously when all of the images are clearly from 1970. I know that not much has changed as far as the method goes over the years, but it would have been nice to know that it was modern. For the most part it was very un-helpful, and I walked away feeling pretty un-informed on what the \\"Method\\" really is? Oh well, I'll try another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bradley(R) book","review":"It's a wonderful book for those who are considering the Bradley(R) method of husband coached childbirth. It's practical and is a must for a companion book for Husband Coached Childbirth by Dr. Bradley. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"So outdated","review":"I am so disappointed to see how out of date this book is! Looking at the chapter about Lamaze, she quotes things that were changed more than 15 - 20 years ago. It makes you wonder if the rest of the items are so poorly researched and updated.I hope if there is a future edition that the publisher requires some fact checking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"Extremely well written, can't say much for the 1970's pictures *ha* but very detailed about the step-by-step of labor preparations. I remembered it all in labor, which was amazing. I use the techniques even now, not pregnant, but just to relax at night before I sleep.To make the Bradley Method work, I advise you to get your partner or birthing coach to read it, also!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It felt preachy","review":"I started looking into natural child birth methods realizing that natural medicine and conventional medicine often butt heads, but I was surprised at how bitter the author is towards conventional medicine. I had a general idea of what I was trying to avoid in a doctor and the hospital I am going to give birth in, but she honestly scared me. I also have to say that a few of the things she said have no scientific basis or are outright wrong. I was looking for a book that just explained what the Bradley method was and advantages to the method. This was not the book. There are sections that explain the method, but they are relatively few and far between and she tends to be very condescending of any other method out there. I like the general idea behind the method, but this book was a real turn-off for me. I would suggest Ina May's book, it actually has useful information in the second half and isn't nearly so scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful book but very old school","review":"I ordered this book after buying Husband Coached childbirth and its good to have both books. There is a lot of great information in this book, I dont really understand the need for all the nude pictures. Its not as up to date as I would like but still very useful. I'm glad I bought this book and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - needs updated/revised","review":"This is a great source of information, whether or not you have taken the Bradley classes. It helped me to get a better feel for the classes and what they contain.My only complaint is that this has not been revised since 1996."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great book, but ya wanna beware there are pictures in there (I think the woman needs to be wearing clothes...no reason for her to be naked, really). The book contains good techniques for going through labor, though I'm gonna probably tailor them a little bit to cater to my plan. I haven't given birth yet, so I'm not sure as to the effectiveness of the techniques, but having received my MS in Clinical Psychology, I think it'll be a good way to psychologize one's self through labor and delivery, especially if you have that sort of mindset of really wanting to do it naturally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"We took a Bradley class, and were asked to buy the book. Turns out, we didn't use the book at all, and the book seems to only have two points (which they belabor ad naseum): 1) Do not trust the medical community, 2) They are better than Lamaze. We learned a lot in class, and felt so empowered and prepared for our delivery, but that certainly had nothing to do with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - made my first childbirth experience a great success","review":"Let me start off by saying that yes, the pictures are annoying. Not because they portray birth, but because the women apparently felt that they wanted to be naked during their labors! (I took a marker and colored over some of the pictures!) Aside from that, I thought the book was fabulous. I knew that I wanted a natural childbirth and I found the book to be informative, practical and enlightening. I read the book when I was 6 months pregnant and diligently did everything it said to do. That's the key - diligence and determination. My husband read the book and practiced with me so when the time came, we knew what to expect and what to do. We did it and the birth of our daughter was a wonderful experience with no drug intervention. My doctor and the nurse were extremely impressed. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be in control of their birthing experience and understand how they can have a wonderful natural delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"I've had 4 natural births, all but the last were home births. I recommend this book to ALL pregnant women. Whether you will be in a hospital or at home this is a MUST READ!!!! Very helpful. Very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information","review":"I am a huge advocate for natural birth. I had my first one natural, and I am a few weeks away from #2. I found this book very helpful and informative for my husband and I. There were only 2 issues I had with the book. The first was that I felt she kept repeating herself over and over again. Which can be a good thing for memorization- but I felt sometimes she carried on a bit. The second was all the naked pics. I'm not a prude or anything- but it was akward to me that all the women in the book practicing the excercises were naked...? Its one thing to have a shot of them giving birth- but I didnt understand why ALL the pics and illustrations needed to be completely naked. Other than that- great information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had heard a lot about the Bradley method as I progressed through my pregnancy, but I was unable to find a class in my area. This book was a disappointing alternative. The first half is essentially why every other method is wrong. The author has a tendency to harp on about Lamaze and traditional midwife methods in favor of the only right way. I'm glad I read the book, but borrow it from the library. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"life saver for first time parents","review":"Living in a very remote part of the country we decided to have a non-medicated home birth but i was not sure that was the right choice for my baby's health.After reading this book i feel confident we made the right choice.We will consider going to a hospital only in an emergency. this is the tool you need to become an active part of your birth experience rather than a victim of hospital practices and their estatistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bradley Method works wonderfully","review":"I had my first child in a hospital, it was a horrible and scary experience, mostly because it was my first. My second and third babies were born at home with a midwife using the Bradley Method. I can honestly say I had a painless childbirth with both - it wasn't easy or comfortable :) but I really understood how to focus and help my body in the labor process. I highly recommend that anyone who is having a baby at least read thru the book, then decide what is best for you and your baby. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Want You","review":"I only heard the First Last Kiss and bought the Want you CD based on that NPR interview.

His eloquence is rivaled only by that of Cyrano himself, and indeed this play depends on the sublimity of Rostand's verbal artistry, which shines through any translation. You can't resist reading parts of it aloud, with or without an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good information","review":"This video is full of excellent samples of the instrument being played - alone, in concert, with other theremins, modern as well as classical musical styles.It is a bit long for classroom use (1 hr. 23 minutes).

If you are watching this around children, be careful with this section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I found the history of the Theremin and a look at the lives of the people involved with the Theremin to be very interesting.This video sparked my curiosity enough to see all the movies with Theremin music that I can find, and buy some CDs of Theremin music.I was fascinated with Clara Rockmore. She was able to pry excellent, creative music from a very hard to play, musical instrument.The life of Leon Theremin is also very interesting.This video also caused me to explore the music of Bernard Herrmann, and I have listened to everything composed by him that I can get my hands on. His use of the Theremin duet in \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" shows his superb creativity and understanding of music that creates mood and feelings.I found this video to be very entertaining and informative, and anyone that loves history, biographies, and Theremin music, should love it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful travelling in time ...","review":"... and in history.

This is a documentary about the early years of electronic music and the invention and developoment of the theremin. We meet Leon Theremin and his protege Clara Rockford and witness there re-unification after Theremin was allowed to leave the Soviet Union. It was interesting to watch them perform on the Theremin, but the latter half of the movie is disappointing as Leon & Clara are both so old that I am wondering what I am watching. Leon falls asleep in a taxi on camera at one point.

Is it essential to your corporate survival to be completely demented at the outset of your career, or do you only become more and more demented the higher you rise in your organization? Clearly Stanley Bing, tongue in cheek, is praying to the gods for some rescuse from our current corporate structures(s. Do NOT do what he recommends in this book.

He may have read him thoroughly but he doesn't really seem to get what his aim was. Enemies in the days of the Medici were real and the lust for power was not guided by lawful means. You even had to watch your drink. Machiavelli was writing in those days where ruthlessness ensured survival for Il Principe.Its nonetheless an amusing book. I have a boss who happens to be a nice guy so its better to share him the book than throw it at him. I do recognize though that narcissistic individuals are bloodthirsty and ruthless. I meet these people but luckily they are not in positions of power.It has its moments. A good single pass would do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, refreshing and relevant!","review":"Stanley Bing has done it again -- this clever and imaginative book is essential for making it in today's frenzied business world.

A great gift for colleagues (but only if you want to reveal the secrets!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Self Referential Satire of Moderate Insight","review":"Fans of Bing's missives in Fortune will be very comfortable with his characteristic syle of sneering humor. Readers not as familiar will probably scratch their heads a bit as to the deeper meanings, or the basis in facts, or larger significance, etc., or lack thereof. It is ultimately perhaps best read as a pack of witticism with strong notes of acid; the occasional bits of \\"truths\\" best enjoyed as only incidental to the fairly funny ways that a corporate warrior who has seen one too many atrocity or folly to care about the literal precision.

I figured the book wasn't going to be philosophical or even very serious, but I did think it would insightful and interesting. It was neither. The \\"chapters\\" are very poorly written and have virtually no point to them. There are no developed examples and no shred of reference to anything in The Prince, other than being mean.My copy has been relegated to the bathroom, right next to the Far Sides (which are not only more interesting, but more insightful...)I could not not recommend this book more.

Did I mention it's funny too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY DANGEROUS BOOK!","review":"This book is no less dangerous than a satirical book on bomb making would be, in the hands of Tim McVay. This would not be a very nice thing to give a young graduate if you wanted them to grow up and ever know what it's like to have friends. But if anyone wants the skinny on what makes a CEO tick, or Sadam Hussein for that matter, get your saftey glasses ready. There's more blood and gore in this than a Stephen King novel. Chainsaw - Al Dunlop plays the role of the satanic clown living in the sewer and there's a special cameo by Ken Starr as Cujo. An inspiring book on how to get a head in the business world - and having it mounted to hang in your den."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrary to mainstream business thought","review":"Read this book to balance the plethora of \\"feel good\\" business books out there. This one gets to the bottom line of exactly why succesful people become successful, and it's not the way you may think! It is an easy read, riddled with anecdotes that hit right at the heart of the matter. I found it cynical, but also delightful and refreshing in places. It's hard to object to some of these tactics when you find them producing results over and over. You will definitely not find pablum here, but we don't always need a soft approach with people."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure Machiavelli would do better","review":"The problem with this book is not its meanness, it's its brainlesness. This very low end and unimaginative approach to business success is a loser. Perhaps Mr. Bing's busniess experience dates him.

It would have been very interesting to see those concepts actually applied to the business world (and not veiled in humor as Mr. \\"Bing\\" (Chandler?) spits it.) The Prince is misunderstood and that ignorance is used to perpetuate more ignorance on behalf of the public who don't understand and authors like Mr. \\"Bing\\" who feed more misunderstanding into the mainstream.

About a month ago my boss mentioned that he just read this book and how it re-affirmed every notion he had about how to manage. Ever since then he has been on an absolute rampage. He seems to be at war with his own department and the rest of the company. I think it has set him off the deep end. I guess my only defense is to become a little Machiavelli too. What happens when everyone reads this book?UPDATE:I bought the book but after about 50 pages it seemed too inane to finish. However, my boss has just been informed he is being demoted and transferred out of my department. Too bad.I think this was the result of taking this book at face value and putting its suggestions into practice. Either you are born a Machiavelli or you are not.

In fact, the writing is quite poor in this book and would be an insult to anyone with a high school reading level. On top of that, Mr. Bing quotes mass murders like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to \\"prove\\" his point even more.Mr. Bing feels any kind of morals or ethics need to be thrown away for the sake of making money and being successful. Yes, that has happened in the past, but look what happened to those people. They either ended up in jail or died.

Cosequin was recommended and after using it for over a month I saw a vast difference in one of them. She now runs and leaps over small obstacles with the greatest of ease. I believe the Cosequin was responsible for that. My other little one doesn't seem to tolerate it very well.

Will not even record 15 min. without static problems. At first I thought it might be my record. I cleaned and then spent 5 hours attempting to record one side. Tracks that didn't have problems at first had them when recording the second or third time. It seemed so simple at first. I wish I could give this one ZERO stars. I returned it and am now looking for something better.I can't believe that my experience was so bad and others can rave about this piece of poop! I really want to warn everyone about this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnacceptable","review":"As excited as I was to get a USB turntable, to digitize my 500 some odd pieces of vinyl, when the ION was unavailable, I turned to Numark. Within the first few recordings, I was able to discern a noticable and completely unacceptable wobbling of the pitch of the recorded items. In the ONLY response I got from Numark, the representative tried to blame it on my improperly assembling the belt mechanism, which could, in no way, affect the frequency of the audible wobble, occurring at the frequency of the platter rotation. It was quite apparent that the platter was improperly molded. Upon reviewing the pictures of the ION turntable, it also became apparent that the Numark is a cheap off-shore knock-off of the ION, with little or no quality control.Be prepared to throw it in the trash, as it won't even move for a dollar at a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Numark USB Turntable","review":"The good:It works!It is well made!The software it comes with works!The quality of audio is very good!The bad:No cover, a dust magnet in silver and black.....No tone arm pickup, not good on the record, or your ears....The turntable pad is not quite as high quality as the rest of the unit.Overall I am happy, price is a tad high, but Amazon free shipping, and no sales tax evens it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"Please do not waste your money.

It would be nice if the turntable included a dark, plastic cover so that I could place it over the turntable while the LP is playing, keeping the dust out.

It took multiple attempts to get this watch off my wrist, and I broke a fingernail trying to pry up the clasp one evening. If I had purchased it for only occasional use I might have been willing to live with the problem, but I needed it for everyday use and don't want to go through the frustrating experience every evening before I go to bed. I'm returning it. It is a very pretty watch, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. Too bad the clasp is such a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narrow band, narrow face, gold and silver: Almost perfect!","review":"I've been wearing this watch for about two years. I love it. The only fault I find with it is that the crystal is already very badly scratched. In my mind, I think the crystal should have resisted scratches better. The metal links comprising the band are still in very good shape, MUCH better than the crystal.What I love about this watch:I wear it everywhere and it goes with all types of jewelry.This watch is very comfortable to wear: It is not heavy, and the face and band feel like \\"one\\". The band has a very pliable feel to it.I can move my wrist in all directions and the size and shape of the face do not interfere with my movement. I don't feel the watch on my wrist, now that I'm thinking about it. I'm real picky about that....Even though the crystal scratches, I could easily buy this watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Olive Skin, Not Brown","review":"I bought this based on a rec from a youtube user ad after consulting the Joe Blasco website in an effort to cover dark circles.

I purchased this for a 13 year old birthday party hoping it would be a good source of entertainment and was severely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I have to admit, I am impressed. We purchased this volleyball set last summer and have used it constantly since. The product is easy to setup/takedown and tons of fun.I have a 18' wide inground and the net easily covers this distance. The net itself is probably ~16' wide, so it spans almost the entire distance across our pool and the strings are easily another 4-6' longer on each side, so it should fit a 24' wide pool as advertised.I think it took me about ten minutes to setup the supports and net. We fill the bases with water and they are remarkably stable - I don't think the net bases/supports have been pulled into the water yet.The ball provided is actually very durable and hasn't needed to be inflated.One other note...at the time of this review, Amazon provides two photos of the set. You might notice that the two photos show different bases. Our set matches the bases shown in the photo of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated giving this even one star.","review":"This is a terrible product. Way to flimsy and light-weight to even begin to to use for even the smallest kids, much less adults. Years ago we had a much more expensive one that worked just fine.

After two tries to replace the product, company on the way and Amazons promise to satisfy, I give this poorly made, have to live with it volleyball set I did not order and was never corrected a poor product review. Do not order if youbwant a quality volleyball set. Again I am stuck with a poor Amazon deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Version of Pool Volleyball!","review":"I've tried a few different pool volley ball games. This one is pretty fantastic. The floating ones tend to cause issues because they don't keep the net taught and the net is too close to the pool so you hit it too often. This one has the advantage that it stays in place better and adds a little height to the net making it harder for spikes to result in someone pulling the net down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"A great read, seen it as a reoccuring theme in the movie Ghost dog which inspired me to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"It is one of the worst books, I can't see how anyone can read this and walk away thinking that it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Books Are The Best!","review":"I'll take books over emedia anytime!

Me and my wife watch it for 15 minutes, and then turned to each other saying: This is just boring! Not bad, not silly, no nothing. Just not interesting at all.I think that the problem with this film is that it is not written very well. The script is very thin and feels as if it is just in its cradle.Sometimes I have patience with boring films. But when a pedant girl with a boyfriend meets a free spirited queer girl, it seems too obvious what is going to happen.

I would have liked this film a lot better if I felt it was realistic. New York is nearly 70% ethnic, of very diverse backgrounds. This film is not diverse at all. Even the extras are not ethnic. It's too bad that filmmakers don't pay attention to their demographics, or choose to deny the reality. Part of the experience from film is to feel it's realistic and this one failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one draw back of this game","review":"the games on this are typical domino's and play well.The major draw back is the tile shuffling ability I have found there are only 2 different shuffle arrangements and I am beginning to memorize them I am regularly getting lower scores because of this In a short while the game will lose its appeal.minor issues are i wish it could keep scores and names ,to get a sharp contrast on the screen it has to be held just right. It has a narrow field of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for serious dominoe players","review":"i hate to give less than a good review; but, this dominoe game is not what i expected. even though the screen is small it scrolls in every direction so you can see parts of the board you need to. after the initial double is played cross ways all others are laid like normal dominoes, i didnt like this at all. i also noticed that when i turn the game off come back and play another game, i draw the same exact dominoes again! i was actually looking for a dominoe game that would let me play all fives. this game is for beginners not serious players or those who want to improve their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"amusing look behind the scenes","review":"Janet Maslin's review in the New York Times called this book enjoyably wry and amusing and compared it to a young Tom Wolfe, and she's got a point. The book is light and entertaining, a compelling fast read filled with colorful characters. There's the man who spends $500,000 on a single bottle of wine, and the vintner with a barnful of vintage Porsches, Ferraris, and Bentleys on his Napa \\"farm,\\" and the community activists who fight so that dozens of chickens can wander freely through the town square in Sonoma. The book gives an eye-opening insider's look at the wine country and shows what visitors rarely see when they come for a day of wine tasting or a weekend getaway at an inn or resort. The tone is humorous and bemused but the book also raises real issues about growth and development and direct democracy and how can we try to preserve the natural beauty and character of a place as more people flock to live there and threaten to ruin it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the magazine articles, Alan.","review":"I suggest a new subtitle: \\"Wine, Wealth, and Enough Filler to Stretch a Feature Article into a Book Deal\\"This book could be summer reading for a 5th grader, but if you've read Napa or East of Eden, you probably have higher expectations for the proffered subject matter.

This one is neither well written or entertaining. For a non-fiction book, the author's depth of inquiry, presentation, and the conclusions he draws, are inexecusably shallow. Given the rich bounty of events, people, and relationships with which he had to work, there was clearly a far more fertile and substantive harvest left on the vines than what was ultimately brought to market.

Although the exercises are okay, but they were not fun. Instead it became a turn off for my daughter.

This worked very well for this book and it keeps you reading!I don't really want to discuss what happens in the book because it would be extremely hard to do without containing a ton of spoilers. I started reading this book last night and just flew through it.You really start to connect with the main characters: Claire, Eve, Shane, and Michael--and you can really start to see them connect with each other. For a YA series, this is one of the better ones that I've read- granted I wasn't extremely crazy about the first book.Would I recommend this book? Absolutely.

Caine does a great job with characterization. The story did not have as much feel to as the first one, but it is easy to see that Caine has much planned in the future. The story picks up exactly where the last one left off, with Michael dead on the floor and Shane's dad and biker gang holding the girls and Shane hostage. The story has the title \\"The Dead Girls' Dance,\\" but this is misleading in that the dance holds only a small part of the story and is not even the climax of the story.

The only time that she saves any one at all is when she saves the evil vampires and their human sheep. She does this because of some haft baked moral reason.

The book is full of author's own (and mostly incorrect) conclusions about issues which are deep and puzzle even the experts. Most of the book's focus is on the local food and entertainment rather than investment climate. A look at the author's conclusions seems that Mr. Rogers left for this trip with a pre-set bias in his mind.If you like to read personal travel diaries, this book will be an average one (not good).

I am tempted to return this one or give it to someone I do not like."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing trip","review":"Foe those of you who have yet to buy this book-don't waste your money. Rogers writes his typical negative, the US sucks and I'm the smartest guy in the world book. Anyone who's followed his advice over the years has earned a sub par return.

However, I found this book disappointing for several reasons. It is very choppy writing and I would have preferred if he provided more in depth insight about something. I enjoyed his summations regarding various countries but it's not as engaging as national geographic from a travel perspective and not as helpful or informative as an investment or economics book from a financial perspective. Consequently, it's not particularly effective on either front and I found it to be a long dry read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and Informative; not a Guide to International Investment","review":"I bought this book in a used bookstore in Northern Thailand, interested primarily in the insight that Rogers' can offer through his travels around the world. I haven't read its predecessor, Investment Biker, but this book offered me new insights on both travel and investment and was moreover an enjoyable read. Note that this book isn't a comprehensive guide to international finance - there are plenty of those available and this isn't one of them. Because Rogers has the ability to offer brief fiscal insights on international economies and markets with his investment experience doesn't mean to me that this book fails as a guide to investment - I don't feel that's what it is or was meant to be. I'd recommend this book first to travel enthusiasts, but maybe not at all to those with only an interest in finance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely Compelling...","review":"Someone once said that poetry is not so much about the words as it is the sound of the human voice.This CD is proof positive of that.I have absolutely no idea what is being said (and although I am curious, it really doesn't matter), but the soundscapes created by the sound clips and electronica backgrounds renders this disc strangely compelling.From the opening \\"kamaraden\\" repeated eerily to great effect, through dozens of radio, newsreel and film sound bites stitched together, the cumulative effect is a strangely beautiful and subliminally disturbing as any Trent Reznor production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkling music - Sparkling remaster","review":"First of all, can anyone confirm that Arthur Fielder and the Boston Pops recorded another stereo version of GAITE PARISIENNE around 1959? The performance heard here is lively and energetic, but it is not the same performance I had years ago on an Lp (filled out with four selections from GAYNE by Khachaturian.) I know about a much earlier mono recording, but it would seem strange that Fiedler would record GAITE a second time only a few years later.At any rate this CD has been remastered with the care and attention to detail that BMG brought to all of the Living Stereo re-releases. The addition of LA BOUTIQUE FANTASQUE makes a welcome companion piece and listeners will recognize many segments in this suite, but the joyous Offenbach music is the real star here. Over the years, GAITE has been recorded many times, often abridged to fit one side of an Lp. Of the complete recordings, no one has ever matched Fiedler in terms of bright, crisp musical direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought one for my 11yr old son and we were both disappointed.

The holistic approach, the attempt to present material in a novel way were all good. However, the textbook is poorly (if not hastily) written (in time for a publisher's deadline?) in that the information is not presented clearly and does not flow easily (at least, for a textbook). The authors seem to refer to the works of the same 5 or 6 authors, which to me is a sign of a biased approach despite their attempts at objectivity. The case examples are presented outside of a historic or cultural context and thus have limited value (at least for a counselor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broadway diva still soars","review":"Many who only know Patti LuPone as \\"Evita\\" should take a listen to this spectacular two-disc record of her one-woman show. While Cole Porter and Kurt Weill are fairly represented, the much anticipated 'theatre section' of the concert is what truly thrills. LuPone's soaring vibrato fills each song with almost more feeling than the lyrics can handle, most impressively on \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\", \\"Sleepy Man\\", and, of course, her signatures \\"Meadowlark\\" and \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\". The patter is also informative and cozy, revealing with self-deprecating humor many musical theatre experiences for us diehard fans. All in all, this is a must for any fan of musical theatre, the excitement of live recordings, and mostly of one of the great voices of the century. There is simply no substitute for Patti LuPone live...or recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Fans of Patti LuPone who do not have this album in their collection need to get a copy.

But so must Nabokov. The publisher actually has the nerve to compare Moody's pseudo-art with Nabokov's SPEAK, MEMORY!

I'll tell you what you're hearing: a grown man whining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, moving memoir with literary genius","review":"Whether Ricky Moody is related to Nathaniel Hawthorne or not, he is an equivalent talent. this is masterful, candid prose and entirely unique. Brave enough to admit depression in our haha society...Brilliant and honest. Make a space for Moody, on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody's Best Book","review":"This is Moody's best, most engaging book. Though it is also his most difficult and slippery. I think Moody at his finest--in The Ice Storm, the short stories \\"The Grid,\\" \\"Demonology,\\" \\"Phrase Book,\\" and \\"Ring of Brightest Angels Around Heaven\\"--is probably the best, most genuinley serious American writer going. A lot of his work, however, lets form take over (some of the stories from Demonology are tired experiments). This book, however, formally beautiful, is deeply sad and authentic from start to finish. I think it compares well to Speak, Memory, the Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge and Memories of a Catholic Girlhood. And I'll tell where the bad reviews are coming from (both in periodicals and by customers): this book is smarter than most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Deeply Dishonest Book","review":"Moody has always been the most narcissistic and cynically careerist of the younger American writers, and this book -- the memoir of a man to whom nothing of special consequence has happened -- makes explicit what was implicit in the fiction. The Black Veil might be subtitled In Search of Credibility, as Moody documents, apparently without realizing how silly it is, his endlessly self-aggrandizing attempts to add weight to an essentially weightless life and body of work -- first by turning a minor drug and alcohol problem into an extended bout of slumming and melodramatic recovery-mongering, then by trying to link his work to that of one of the great Yankee masters. Neither effort yields much. Moody is the John Favreau of American fiction: not the real thing, but close enough to pass. The book is shallow, opportunistic, creepy-cold, and, finally, nauseating. For those of you wondering why his career has taken him so far, I offer two words: Ang Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"strictly for the adolescent crowd","review":"Moody's not an untalented writer, but his great talent seems to be self-promotion. I read about a third of the way into his latest, just to see if he'd found some new topic besides his unpleasant self-- but this \\"memoir\\" may be the book that finally reveals the emperor's nakedness. Every sentence reeks of self-promotion, grandiosity, and an assertion of the author's literary \\"importance.\\" It's unbelievable and in a way quite sad, because the author clearly can write well and clearly cares about books and literature. But this one made me want to take a bath. I wonder who his friend in Baltimore is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digressive Nonsene","review":"This is the type of self-pitying tome that Hawthorne, Melville, or any other true New England artist would and could never have been accused of producing. To turn one's ancestry into some sort of self-involved paradigm is to feed the need of the modern middle class fest of narcicism. Give us all a break, please. You are, in the first place, uninteresting intellectually. You are also bouncing a ball repetitively against a backboard that is concave, thus sending the projectile back to you and you alone. The rest of us have laid our rackets down out of sheer disinterst. Trust the naysayers on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writers, bad choices","review":"It's sad to see such a brilliant writer like Moody turn out such a pompous and poorly executed book.

Trouble is you have to sit there and watch him labor, and you have to bear it. This one is thick and deadly dull, overwrought, less than the sum of its parts. ...Skip this one and try someone you've never heard of."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting departure for Moody","review":"The \\"digressions\\" part of the subtitle primarily refers to the fact that this is not only a memoir but also a sort of family genealogy, or an attempt at one. Moody finds that he may be the descendant of a Reverend Moody who was fictionalized as the title character of Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Minister's Black Veil.\\" Digging through obscure histories and travelling about New England in an attempt to find out more about the man behind Hawthorne's self-loathing minister, Moody creates a sense of very powerful parallels to his own struggles with severe depression and drugs. These sections alternate without Moody making explicit connections between the two stories, but the format keeps the pages turning and the reader intrigued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for improving your craft","review":"This is a new book containing old information about the correct way to make embroidrey stitches. I think it is a great book. It is a little difficult to read, but only because embroidery is such a visual and hands-on activity. I love how it goes into specific details as to how to make variations of different stitches. The pictures are black and white. The reading and examples of stitches are fairly easy to follow if you study the information and have some experience with embroidery.

However, the music, especially the drumming, is fantastic.\\"Hit the Floor\\" is in the same vein of Medeski Martin & Wood, Stanton Moore/Galactic, Charlie Hunter, and Grant Green's funkier stuff.

That was an understatement, my wife and I were so surprised this thing was a hit with all our family members and guests who proceeded to try and beat each others scores. It was so entertaining to watch everyone use this thing.In any case, if you are looking for the classic rubik's, look elsewhere. This is a different animal altogether. No moving parts, there are about 8 different games to play either alone or in a group and it involves pressing the middle button on the color side indicated. The more you get, the higher your score.

My 7 year old asked for it and I bought it. I guess I wanted to relive part of my youth from when the original Rubik's cube hit the stores. Unfortunately, this toy is nothing more than a light game. It does not rotate like the original. There is really nothing educational about it. It not really challenging. You just push the light that is blinking and hand it to the next person. And it is LOUD! I thought it was going to be a really cool, new version of the classic. Serves me right for not reading about it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok game, but it has nothing in common with a Rubik's cube","review":"As a game, it's ok. It plays a lot likeMerlin Electronic Puzzle Gamewhere each of the different games is basically some variation on pressing the buttons in a particular order. One thing annoying about the design is that the button on each side (the middle square on each side is a button) is recessed about about an inch into the body making it difficult to press. That may be the intent of the designers, but I just found it frustrating.However it is pretty shameless marketing to present this game as some sort of Rubik's type of puzzle since it has nothing in common with a Rubik's cube or that style of puzzle. If you buy this expecting something similar to a Rubik's cube type of puzzle you will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, not Rubik's cube related at all.","review":"This is a poor press-the-light-quickly game which has been wrapped up to look like a Rubik's cube. It has NOTHING to do with a Rubik's cube, it has no puzzle to it, the pieces do not move.DO NOT BUY this thinking it is Rubik's cube related, it is not. It might as well be shaped like Elmo's head or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Rubik's Puzzle - Definitely Not Rubik's Quality","review":"I recieved this product for Christmas. My youngest son and I played with it for about an hour. No hard playing and already four stickers have come off. It is very much like another electronic toy called Brain Warp which I found much more user friendly, durable, and fun. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone. I bought Brain Warp for $2 at a second hand store and that was a great deal!If you're a Rubik's fan don't disappoint yourself with this cheaply made product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy that caused lots of laughs","review":"I bought this for my younger sister because she recently bought the standard old school one. I bought it for her birthday kind of as a joke and for fun. When she first turned it on, the robotic female voice started to talk which made us all laugh. She tried several of the different games, some harder than others. Then I tried for a few minutes. She played it a few more times after. After this the orange button does not work most of the time which doesn't help especially for a game that relies on how fast you press the buttons. So now we don't play it at all. I don't know if the seller would replace it since it's been so long since I ordered it, plus it could just be a deffective one. But for how cheap this item is, I don't think it's worth going through the whole return process especially if I have to pay any of the shipping.If the product wasn't deffective, I'm sure it would still be tons of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this for my fiance as a gift for Christmas since he loves Rubik cubes. I thought it was just a different type of Rubik cube but it doesn't turn and it plays more like a Simon game then anything. He tried it out briefly and has never used it again. He did say that it was difficult to push the buttons for the games at times and just not very much fun in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"hand and eye cordination","review":"I bought two of these one for my husband and son in law.

I must admit, I was plesantly surprised at the rave reviews my kids aged 9, 8 and 4 years respectively gave this toy. What is even more instructive is the fact that before the Holidays were over, I, along with several of my adult friends had literally ambushed the kids and almost monopolized the use of their toy.

I am more of a Conner and Elizabeth fan, so that is why i gave it four stars, but for Will and Melissa fans, it should be a big treat. It really doesn't get super interesting until the end when something super tragic happens. Also, all through the book you get some vibes that Melissa doesn't really want to go to Michigan and she is only going for Will. It was also interesting in the Jeremy/Jessica/Jade dillema.

I can some of the plots being romance, but all of them? And boy! Do Jessica & Jade have a lot of growing up to do! Jessica broke up with Jeremy, yet she falls into a jealous huff because Jade's going out with him. I thought it was so spiteful of her to bring Jeremy over to where Jade was with another guy, then tries to get Jade fired from her job. And Jade...I liked the Jade in the old series better; it's really too bad that Francine changed Jade too much like that. Jade used to be thoughtful in the old series & into ballet; now in this new series, Jade's only interests seem to be cheerleading & getting boyfriends to show off. I really wish this series would get deeper plots. That would make this series a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good","review":"this was a really good book i thought.i never thought Will would last long in the relationship and i really liked hearing about them more in this book.by far this was one of the best books"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this book seemed to cover everyone in one book. there is so much happening between everyone. and even though its a lot of will and melissa its still a very great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't kill me!","review":"I liked this book!I know soom of you hated this book!but I liked it!Conner is a drunk a the time!Hope he and Liz breaks op!=) Will is getting what he desrvevs!he can't play football any more!=)Jess and Jeremy seems to be friends again!

The items dont makes much sense for players to figure out unless it is trial and error. ie: they find silly putty which about 4 maps later must use it on a sign to store its lettering so that they dont forget due to the \\"forget\\" spell on the sign.

Some cinemas that dared to offer it were, ironically, set on fire. The subject of lesbianism is taboo among Hindus, who as one of the characters reveals, have no equivalent word in their vocabulary.In spite of the controversy, Mehta's treatment in large part, is subtle, tender and evocative. Though the males, particularly Jatin, are somewhat predictable and typical, the female leads, Radha and Sita, are believable and sympathetic. Mehta makes effective use of Hindu mythology as metaphor, and the film resonates simply through its handling of colour."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE DAMN GORGEOUS MOVIE!!!!","review":"FIRE...

Should we pass a collection basket so as to purchase the clue gift certificate Mr. Maltin so desperately needs?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Viewing","review":"This isn't Biji's Bollywood. This is Deepa Mehta's New Delhi, India, during a time of transition. Fire is about burning desire-- for passion, for life, for the vision that is behind the eyes. This is not a love story, per se, but a liberation story.The story line is quite basic: in a middle class family, one husband devotes himself to his swami and vows celibacy while his younger brother, forced into a traditional wedding, continues to see his lover. Both wives tend to the restaurant and their husbands' mother, following traditional roles of subservience. Until they discover, or uncover, their passion for one another.So if the plot is not the draw, why watch this film? It gives a glimpse of the upcoming middle class (late 1990s) life--the juxtaposition of uberurban cosmopolitan life and traditional mores. It is India trying to grow into itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Low Key Movie about Lesbian Love in India","review":"Two women in undesirable arranged marriages in India begin to desire each other. While male sexually in all its forms are overlooked if not approved of, the women endure more disapproval and social stigma. Interesting take on lesbianism in a culture in which there is no such word for it or concept in the culture. Part of a trilogy with Earth and Water. Earth I haven't seen. Water won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and is about a child bride who is cast off as a widow by age 8. I highly recommend Deepa Mehta's films.

The movie is both innovative and sexy. Shabana and Nandita (the actresses) are sensational. Shabana Azmi is a feminist, a great actress and a member of the Indian parliament. The struggle depicted in the movie is not just something Indian or south asian women face, women all around the world face opression - only the details are different. While this is an excellent movie you should be aware that India is a diverse culture and you cannot represent the people in that culture with some of the generic statements that other reviewers have made here. There are several flavors of middle class India. Many Indian middle class women have excellent careers both in and outside the home and find partners (men and women) who believe in the equality of sexes. There are excellent women scientists, homemakers, engineers, doctors, teachers, members of parliament, etc. who have a great sense of self respect - self respect is not unique to western women :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire is the perfect word for this movie!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I had to force myself to move at one point as I became aware that I had been watching so intently; afraid I would miss the important nuances mixed with the sometimes painfully obvious. This movie, like fire, was full of warmth and passion. The spark that desire creates among the same-sex relationship in this movie is like an all consuming flame and finally purifying and alive- like the love they could finally express and survive. I loved the fact that all the characters in the movie were having to deal with patriarchy on different levels...Some embracing the culture and faith fully and denying any desire and others doing quite the opposite. Everyone in this movie was finding their own way. Isn't that what life should be? Wonderful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie...hated this DVD!","review":"\\"Fire\\" is one of my favorite films. Beautiful and powerful performances, scenery, and plot.

They touch us through our past experiences, challenge us to rethink the hereto 'acceptable behaviors' that have been placed around the feminine, while lifting our spirits to that magical place that can only be found within joy and the ability to laugh at ourselves and our experiences.In short, it was a surprise...a very pleasant one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT","review":"I received this book today and found it to be utterly worthless.

It's a creative mix of new age, jazz/rock fusion, world music (complete with dueling Indian percussionists), and folk guitar tunes. Unlike his earlier works, DeGrassi's compositions here aren't built so much around the guitar. Several of the pieces feature other instruments and actually seem to use the guitar more for accompaniment.My favorite cut is McCormick, a solo alternate tuning piece with a heavy chorus effect that employs a contrapuntal approach to composition. The final piece - \\"MTY\\" - is reminiscent of Shadowfax and even uses their original violinist Jami Szmadzinski. Produced in 1987, this album was an obvious attempt by DeGrassi to explore the possibilities of acoustic guitar composition and arrangement. If you ask me, the exploration yielded very positive results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't cover well","review":"This product didn't work at all for me.

Ms. Gregory always uses particularly ruthless villains, and great numbers of people die before Matt and his wonderful friend Broither Michael can solve the mystery.
