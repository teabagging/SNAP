For those of us who are long time Mickey Spillane fans, it is a major disappointmnet. That hard, crudely eloquent writing is missing. The tough guy main character is not an angry, slow moving guided missile, seeking his target and smacking down anyone who gets in his way.The tough guy in this book spends all his time drinking beer and dropping hints that he used to be a vengeful guided missile. The story is flat. The pacing is slow. The characters are just not very interesting. Spillane has a new Mike Hammer novel coming out in the summer of '04. Let's hope he is back to his old form for that one.

The sounds on the first CD are raw, and not electronic at all, still, the groove is amazing. CD2 is excellent, picking up on the tribal groove of the first CD, and becoming seriously hipnotic and deep by its end. This is truly a first class album. Cant wait to see Danny play live someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would't go there if I were you...","review":"Maybe Danny didn't have the copyrights to spin real records on this album, I don't know, but it's just background music. The first half starts out alright, sounding vaguely tropical and new-yorican, lifting a style from NY Club Body and Soul. And there are some clever samples...but they never go anywhere. If you want vocals, there are NONE except a bad remix of Keep in Touch Body-to-Body. I happen to like vocal-less techno house, but this doesn't cut it. The second CD is much worse. This is soulless Danny being heavily marketed to new-school clubbies tweaking under headphones with no history to ground them."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm.well I don't know about these reviews","review":"usually GU offers the best in DJs and house music...this one man I got to pass..too slow...sounds like a slower version of Oakenfold or Digweed.

I was amazed by the clarity the Nikon NC Filter was. You can test it out by simply putting the filters on top of a piece of white paper to check the clarity.

The 1st disc is very comprehensive, detailing the history of the Redskins and atmosphere of the Washington, DC area in the 50's and 60's and some good insight on the racism of the times, (the owner refused to have Black men on his team, in fact, the Redskins were the last team to have Black men on their roster). The 2nd disc has interviews with prominent Redskin players, Theismann and particularly one of my all time favorite backs Mr. John Riggins!This is a great dvd set of the Washington Redskins!

It's a little bit summer chill and a little bit vocal soundtrack from a 1970s romantic comedy set in the Mediterranean sun. The song styles vary, but remain upbeat and remind me of young love. The song list goes:Into the Sun (Come to Saint Tropez)Photogirl (C'est ma vie)First LookParfum d'étéHouse of Love (Club Saint-Germain)Footprints in the SandDis-moi ChloéElle l'aime (le sarcarstique)B.B.

Second, air would be blowing through the ventilation ducts in Mall and most of the gas would have not entered the system, the scene at CTU was a little more convincing at least there was a fan moving a little air.

In short; it is ridiculous and contrived lowbrow fodder. '24' should be called '8' as only one third of the plot and dialogue is interesting or entertaining. Each episode is full of 'fillers' in the form or additional characters or contrived conflict, all within absurd twists of plot. The barely competent Sutherland Jnr. resorts to a hoarse whisper to show anger, tension, frustration, exhaustion, stress and occasionally, stealth.

In all of those, the presidents were wise, honorable, saintly, and totally virtuous. The white presidents in the other 1 1/2 seasons were evil incarnate who make the real Nixon look like George Washington.And of course no one dare suggest that 5 years after 9-11, terrorists who want to attack us with nerve gas might be Muslims is completely taboo.

It's hard to blame the creators as they do fine with what they have, but the very nature of a one-day serial is fatally flawed. Jack Bauer, and the disaster(s) he alone can stop, must NEVER be resolved until the final (24th.) hour. Every trick in the book is used to prolong the story, and to keep Jack alive. This leads to LUDICROUS plot devices, which make watching it often painful. If this doesn't matter to you, then I'm sure you will enjoy it, but if a plot or story needs to make sense to be pleasurable, this season will drive you mad. Obviously, a LOT of care, talent, and clever ideas went into making this, but at the end of the day, I knew that I had thrown away a entire day, watching smoke and mirrors signifying nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Addictive","review":"24 is the most intense and entertaining TV show that I have seen. Season Five is the best one yet.Assassination, Murder, Mayhem, Setups, Hijacking, Treason, and Treachery are all in this season of 24. Most of them make an appearance in the first two hours and it just gets better from there.This show has more twists and turns in one episode than most programs do in a whole season. The acting and casting is also excellent.For those who have never seen 24, it is a tough call. The show is very addictive. One might be better off to not ever start with it. On the other hand, it is highly entertaining. If you have not seen it before, I would recommend starting off at the beginning of season one and going from there. It would really help with the background for this season. If one does not want to consume that much time on it, I think that this season would probably do pretty well as a stand alone also."},{"rating":"2","title":"24- It just keeps getting better","review":"I now own all 5 seasons and am looking forward to the excitement of season 6.

I'm dissappointed, however, with the new packaging (hence the reason for 4 stars). Seasons 1-4 have the 'book / accordion' packaging (similar to the Sopranos but easier to use) and the new set has the individual, dare I say cheap, cases. I would've paid a little extra for the 'old' packaging. I hope the someone in the production might read these reviews. Otherwise, a superb series. I'm looking forward to the release of the current season next Xmas and hope the old packaging returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Season Five shoppers","review":"Currently seasons 1-5 of this outstanding action adventure series are being sold as one package on this site. This is not a collector's edition, just a five season bundle. I thought I'd mention this for people who may not have the other seasons yet. Season five seemed to have the best overall plot, but the other four seasons had great action with some unexpected twists and turns too. Also note that \\"24 - Season 6 Premiere (First 4 Episodes)\\" is available on DVD too. At first that sounds like a waste of money, but it comes with a ten dollar coupon good for any of the complete seasons of 24, including season six. Plus, the coupon does not expire until February 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Season Yet!","review":"If you haven't seen this season of 24, I highly suggest you buy it!! The first 10 minutes will shock you to the core!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last great 24 series","review":"Forget the excesses of season six. This is 24 at its peak!Jaw dropping surprises and non stop action with Jack in absolute top form. There is no other way to watch this series than on DVD.The only issue? How do you stop before it's done?A++ escapism. Should be everyone's number one guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"24 - Season Five","review":"This item is worth it if you haven't seen the five season of 24.

Better on DVD without the commercials and the ability to skip over boring subplots."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better!!","review":"It seems to be a pattern that the first four episodes set the tone for a season in 24. The first four episodes of this season are amazing. I want to say that they are better then the first four in Season 6. All in all an excellent Season and a fantastic ending. It did get a little lost in the final third for a couple of episodes but the final third turned it back around. A must own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on TV - Watch in order if you can","review":"This is easily the best show on TV today. The twists and turns every step of the way keep it exciting over the course of 24 episodes, which is something other serial dramas have failed to do. This is the gold standard.It's three months until the season 6 premier and I can't wait. If you haven't seen the show before, I would highly recommend that you start with season 1. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service and Price","review":"Very prompt receipt of my order.

While s3 and s4 kinda slowed down and seemed to lack the inspiration and story of s1 and s2, s5 is really back to what 24 is all about - interesting characters, surprising turns, thrilling story. But beware: the end is a cliff hanger! Cannot wait for s6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Having finally caught up on all of the seasons of 24, I can say that season 5 is the best. This is saying a lot as every episode of every season is great. I kick myself for not starting to watch 24 when it started, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching the seasons back-to-back. I'll get a taste of having to wait week to week when season 6 starts.The killing off of a few major and beloved characters was a huge blow. But, any fan of 24 knows that no one is safe. And the deaths of these individuals, along with the threats against others, really sets up Jack Bauer's devotion to getting the bad guys.Jack is more ruthless that ever, less willing to take orders than ever, and better than ever.I couldn't begin to outline what happens...not that I would anyway. Those reading this review may not have watched it yet. Even if you've never seen an episode of 24, you have to see this season. But, I would start with season 1. Seasons 1 through 4 set up the events in season 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously stupid plot line ruined it for me <spoiler alert>","review":"I am not one to nitpick about things not being 'realistic' in TV and am willing to suspend disbelief in most cases. But I just could not get over the whole plot line involving the incriminating recording of President Logan. The idea that the 'recording' was some valuable piece of evidence that Jack kept having to recover was just plain ridiculous. Jack had the recording for an hour before Secretary Heller took it. WHy didn't he make a copy? Why didn't he make ten copies? Then when he recovered it again, on the plane, why did he not play it for CTU when he was on the phone with them so they could make a copy then and there? Then Chloe only makes one copy and it gets destroyed.What makes this even more ridiculous is that, in the final episode, they immediately played the new incriminating recording for the Attorney General. It made me realize what a load of filler the whole subplot about the recording was."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original","review":"When \\"24\\" first premiered 5 days (read \\"seasons\\") ago, there wasn't anything quite like it on television. And that is what caught my attention about this show. I was drawn in! Crisp writing, mostly unpredictable and (don't forget that clicking clock!) made this show a must watch for me. And I must say, over 5 seasons later, I still consider this show a must watch. Now, there have been many shows that have come about that I would call \\"flatterers by imitation\\", some of which are also some of my favorite shows...\\"Lost\\", \\"Prison Break\\" and \\"Heroes\\" to name a few.I'm glad that Kiefer Sutherland was finally recognized for his contribution to this show and I'm looking forward to the upcoming movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't miss season","review":"Season 5 brought an action packed 24 hours of fun, excitement, and suspense to an otherwise dull TV lineup. The twists and turns introduced throughout the season kept me coming back week after week, regardless of how disappointed I was by some of the writers' choices earlier on. Most shows have their low points during their runs, however, this season was definitely not 24's. It keeps you guessing all the way up until the conclusion, and I recommend that if you did not get to see it, that you try to before the new season starts on January 14th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumptuous!","review":"Continuing in the tradition of the fist 10 Spectrums, Spectrum 11 is a feast for the eyes.

For all practical purposes, there is no information about anything in this book! The typical treatment of a subject is a simple paragraph that essentially says \\"You might want to do this with your web page - well you can!\\" Then screen shots of the process involved in its simplest form.

Discounting the fact that the shows' video had not been cleaned up in the slightest, with a few episodes being of extremely poor quality, I would've still been content in watching the artistry of a master comedian. But the collection has other problems. I've had two sets now, in which the DVDs lock up at different places. Amazon has been great about replacing them. But the problem remains. In frustration, I'm simply keeping what I now have, but would recommend any other potential buyers to consider this before making a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really the best of Jack Benny","review":"This 4 Disc Set is wonderful in more ways than one.

They simply used their own character to make fun and laughter for their audiences. Jack and Rochester were great together! To some people today this show may seem silly; but I say it is good, clean humor. Something that makes you laugh without insulting anyone. The guest stars on Jacks show along with the old sponsors adds takes me back to when TV was really entertainment. Not shocking, immoral, and desensitizing.

All the great stars of the day appear as guests in skits, routines and song and dance sketches. The full length episodes include the Lucky Strike commercials that are entertaining as well. The comedy writers today could take a lesson from the quality of the past material.This collection is more than a scratchy violin rendition or Jack Benny calling \\"Oh Rochester\\". It is quality comedic entertainment that I can only compare to the Tonight Show (Johnny Carson) and Saturday Night Live (Early Years) in a Time Capsule.The transfer to DVD is good, with some occasional blips from the day, but is not bothersome.While the pricing is very good, I picked this up on a discount site for one third of the price, with a discount during a semi annual promotion.Update: 4/5/08 - This is at Walmart in the bin for five bucks. This is a great price for the value and fantastic content.Enjoy, j."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Expected","review":"Some other reviewers complained about the quality of the videos but I haven't seen any problems. They are grainy and dark at times but still very watchable. You have to consider these shows were recorded over 50 years ago and the quality was much lower then. Someone else has already listed all the episodes and they are all there. If you're a huge Jack Benny fan like I am, even though these shows were made before I was born, you will enjoy this set. Dennis Day, Don Wilson, Eddie Anderson, and Mary Livingstone are all there and I've truly enjoyed the episodes I've watched. Eddie Anderson, aka Rochester, has always been my favorite character and he is in most of the episodes.

As a result, it did not fit into half of my eSATA ports. Crimping the metal resolved this, but the fact that I needed to do anything to it at all simply reeks of poor quality.

Also the unit keep losing its signal from the remote sensors. The remotes are less than 20 ft from the main unit. This is my second Honeywell. I have first purchased TE821 and it did not hold its signal either. I should have bought a Davis weather station. All my friends have Davis and have no problems with them at all.

I was assured that there would be no issue.I have had the system operational for about 2 weeks now and generally like the format BUT, the anemometer readings appear to be low in winds over 15 mph and more importantly, the unit has lost the anemometer signal several times already requiring a reset. The anemometer is located above our elevator roof entrance and less than 30 feet from the location of the main unit.I called the Honeywell/Meade tech support line and was told my issue is probably environmental -- steel frame building -- and that I should contact the company I purchased it from and see if they will accept its return.WHAT PITIFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE HONEYWELL IS OFFERING!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy","review":"The Honeywell TE923WHoneywell TE923W Deluxe Weather Station with Rain Gauge, Barometer, Thermometer, Wind Datais a clumsy collection of weather sensors.

There are mistypes, MUCH missing information and MANY assumptions that you will have to guess or figure out on your own. Once we got the unit set up, some things worked well, others didn't. The temp & humidity are OK. The TEMP w/WIND CHILL is off. No matter what the wind chill is, say 22, the TEMP w/WIND CHILL is always the SAME as the regular TEMP(WITHOUT wind chill factor). I'm going to try to reset the unit and revisit this in the spring. ALSO, it is now DST and the CLOCK on the unit has NOT reset, nor has the sunset & sunrise. It reads time automically from the Atomic Clock, so I don't know what the problem is.

Make Your Own Bones is an excellent opener, with Holt's viscious screaming and Maxwell's creative playing. Bleeder, a little quieter, follows up nicely. Same Solution has some catchy hooks inside of it, but by then it's clear that the cd is going to be the sound over and over again. In Nothingface's case, however, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Make Your Own Bones, For All The Sin, Can't Wait For Violence, and Blue Skin all standout in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"a short story and my evaluation","review":"not long ago, at the beginning, a young girl, unknowingly, went to a ska concert featuring L4suicide, formula one (!!) anf dow jones and the industrials. as i was skanking my way accross the floor a young man comes up to me and says, would you like a free sample cd? of course, i took it, who wouldn't?!?! i mean, what if these people got famous, i'd have a sample cd. well, little did i know it was someone from nothingface, giving me his cd. after a couple listens to this two-track cd with bleeder and make your own bones, i decided to buy the entire cd, and found it quite good. i enjoy the contrast between songs, and the sincerity in which everything is sung. i much suggest this cd as a wonderful change from the norm."},{"rating":"2","title":"get it","review":"anybody who has any sense in heavy music today will go pick up this album. songs are so well crafted melodic but hard. i ve gotten so many comments saying theyre a poser band, the only reason people say that is b/c people have never heard of them before. well im telling you to get this album and get to know them"},{"rating":"2","title":"crazy ass music","review":"This cd is one of the few cds you'll find that has a demented brutality that rivals and black or death metal band.

If u like bands like Slipknot, and Deftones, and and even old machine head, then you'll probably like this. The singer doesnt have the best singing voice, it has too much \\"echo\\" in the CD, you'll know what i mean after listening to a few tracks, but his Screaming voice is brutal. He screams a lot too. Almost all of the songs are good, but the best songs are Make Your Own Bones, Bleeder, For all Sin, Cant wait for violence, Dead Like Me, Blue Skin, Filthy (best song), american love, and piss and vinegar. Piss and vinegar is a really heavy song. Showing that these guys can sing, as well as scream. The drums are great, they have 2 drummers or something like that, and the bass goes right along with the heavy distorted guitar. Some of the riffs sound the same sometimes, but who cares. If u like Hard Heavy metal without the rap influence, then get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for any fan of hardcore music...","review":"ive been waiting a long time to hear something like this. something that hits me hard, that makes me want to listen to it over and over again. Something that is intense and powerful. i definately found what i was looking for. this album is awesome, in that it can blow ur speakers in its heaviness, or just let you sit there and listen to its greatness. the variety in the album is pretty good, in that t has some heavier songs in which Matt just shows off his screaming abilities(\\"Make Your Own Bones\\",\\"Cant Wait For Violence\\") and then there are some which really show off his vocal talent(\\"Dead Like Me\\",\\"Filthy\\"). theres not much i can say about tom and his guitar work, except that it is unbelievable..the drums are the same..tommy sickles is just sick. and bill gaal lays down the bass and sound fx. this album is just overall one of the best i have ever heard.."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as described","review":"I was very disappointed in this Lily.The color was pink as described, but that's where it ends.It was not a double and had no defining petals.It looked like a regular lily with six petals,and had no dots.Maybe they gave me the wrong lily,don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific guide to the Civil War Battlefields","review":"I found this book to be the best in this area. Many of the others I looked into were too compact, too poorly detailed, or far too many advertisements, difficult to read or just too hard to figure out. Mr Eicher does the job right. Each battlefield is detailed out with great maps, numbered markers and a condensed history. The maps are perfect for a colored marker pen to assist when driving along or for walking the trails. My first copy, after my vacation two years ago, disapeared, so I bought another copy for my trip next year.

I am a first grade teacher and still have an old copy of How Spider Saved Halloween. Year after year it is my class's favorite book. The simple story and illustrations are very appealing to children. The story has several good lessons such as, nice guys finish first, and you can solve your own problems. The story revolves around a sweet ladybug, a grumpy fly and a kind but Charlie Brownish spider. When some Halloween bullies try to take the fun out of Halloween, Spider cleaverly devises a plan to save Halloween for his friends. An excellent book!

This tape wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.We also have the Bilingual Baby - Spanish tape. While it bores me, she will watch all 45 minutes through if I let her.

These are a little salty and if you don't stir it properly and add the warm water the dried saucesticks to the bottom or stays dry inside the pasta leaving it a bit crunch in some spots and a little weird tasting from gettingtoo much of the dry stuff in another. It would be fantastic with a little grilled chicken thrown in but that is hard to come by unless I buy the chicken in a packet which would make this even saltier. 3 1/2 for flavor and 4 1/2 for being handy. Recommending having at least 1 1/2 bottle of water to have to drink while eating. The price isn't too bad either"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"While I am sure this is bad for you, it is one of my favorite comfort foods, mostly because it is easy to make and has a great flavor.I do not care for the other flavors of Bowl Appetit because I do not find them half as flavorful as this one. This is really high in salt (50 pct of your daily intake) so better go light on salty items on days you eat it.All you need to make it is water, a utensil for stirring, and a microwave.

It can be tough to get started depending on one's orientation to the pipe. Once the first click on the ratchet is made the tool locks itself onto the pipe and won't disengage until the clamp is perfectly cinched. So it's easy once you get the initial click, then you can re-position for better leverage. Although my connections happened to all be in awkward tight spaces so maybe it's not an issue for most use cases... I love the tool though. When it's finished ratcheting you know the joint is properly secured."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"I am a master plumber with over ten years in the trade .

Though Camrons first album \\"Confessions of Fire\\" was too radio friendly and commercial......he had clever word play and his own style that was later stolen by Drag-On. Anyway the beats on this album are off the hook but waisted on lame lyrics. Camron, Jim Jones, & Santana are a bunch of half [...] MC's talkin a bunch of nothin. They also could have left out the dumb interludes and skits. This should have been one disk. The stand out tracks are only stand outs because of the beats.[...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats is Really Good","review":"Diplomatic Immunity is a solid debut cd by Camron and the Diplomats. The production on this cd is extrodinary in my opinion, I love how just about every song has an old sample in tune with the beat. To some many of the songs might be to fruity. They combine street lyrics with old school classic beats. For example, the songs sound like the hit Jay Z song \\"Hard Knock Life\\" The cd is 2 cds I feel that the second cd is a lot stronger then the first,the only major flaw is the use of too many skits but by no means does that take away from the cd. Your still receiving 20 plus tracks.

But, the lyrics are the worst lyrics i have ever heard in my entire life. I really can't believe this dude used to do joints with Big L. It is like a first grader wrote the lyrics for them.

Cam'ron, Juelz and Jim Jones have great chemistry. Freeky Zekey is pretty annoying, but he's only on a few skits. Jim Jones really peaked on this album with sincere emotional lyrics. Juelz is the real hero of this album. Everything he's on is on target. This isn't Cam'ron's strongest appearence because I'm sure he was more focused on letting his crew shine, but he doesn't slouch either.

While the situations and themes created for them are serious (child abuse, bigotry towards gays, commitment in relations), the solutions are sensational, melodramatic, and ultimately unrealistic.Of the 4 books referred to, I will concede that this is probably the best of the lot -- and it would be of some interest to gay high school boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sweet","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading all the positive reviews posted here. I was disappointed with the outcome. I think I would have enjoyed this book when I was younger or in high school. While very optimistic, it also came off as being too unrealistic. The two boys are very sappy and that started to irritate me towards the end. If you're looking for an easy and sappy read get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best love story I have read in years!!","review":"I cannot say enough about this book!! I loved it!!I could not put the book down. It has to be the best book I have read this year. I read this in one sitting from cover to cover. The characters are written like real people that I could imagine being from my small town. It was extremely well written and it flowed with an electricity that captivated me. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me want to go out and fine my one true love!! In this age of cynicism it was heartwarming to read a good love story between two people I could relate to. In fact I think that anyone could relate to these characters regardless of the reader's sexuality. All I know is that if you buy this book you will NOT be sorry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Sons 101 by Kevin J. Porter","review":"Five Stars out of FiveCommon Sons 101 by Kevin J. PorterRonald L Donaghe claims that his Common Sons is a simple story, and I agree. But within this simplicity, he takes you back to the mid 60s and delves deeply into the human condition, taking you into the lives of two teenage boys and their romantic love story. From the beginning you will want Joel and Tom to live happily ever after, but you quickly find out that the path on which Donaghe sets this story is filled with hate-filled, narrow-minded, violent characters. Even one set of parents is scarier than Hell itself.Many sections of the book will have you holding your breath as you turn the page, convinced that a murder will bloody the scene. Common Sons is a damn fine read. I highly recommend it. A family discussion of Common Sons will make the world a much happier, safer place for us humans to live and love.www.kevinjporter.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is so awesome, if definitely warrants bonus stars!","review":"I love this book, in fact I just finished reading it like 5 seconds ago and knew I had to share how great it is right away. It's a wonderful love story, with excellent writing, interesting sideline plots and a wonderful cast of characters. You will love Tom and Joel by the end of this book and feel very close to them aswell. Lots has already been said about the books plot so I won't add much more, but yes, I have to say, it does end happily. It's just such a great book, I have to gush about it. You will NOT regret buying this book if you are in fact able to do so. And theres the rub. It's quite hard to find, especially in Canada. But if you can, buy it, cause it's a book you'll want to read over and over and treasure.Read this book! Some how, you will not be sorry you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent story","review":"Overall this book was good. However there were parts where I wondered who edited it, only because sentance flow was not that good. Odds are I would have skipped over the sentance problems if I had really been pulled into the story. Although I had trouble putting the book down after I started, the characters weren't real enough for the story to just suck me into it.Like I said before, overall this is a good book, and it is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...for small kids","review":"I don't know how an older kid would like this, but our four year old loves it. The surface is basically just a kind of flimsy wood that is a bit bowed and cannot be leaned on at all. But overall it works really great and we've had fun with it with our young son. I agree with other reviewers that the \\"net\\" is awful - the scorekeeping thingy snapped when we were putting it on, and we're considering removing the nets altogether and just letting the puck shoot out onto the floor. But, for the price, it's not a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of cr@p","review":"The item was broken,and even if it wasn't it's so bad quality that I would have returned it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This DVD deals more with how to understand Hispanics' accent or ESL students' accent when speaking English rather than saying \\"adios\\" to their accent. Some example are just plain ridiculous (for example I have never heard someone say \\"ome\\" instead of \\"home\\"!).Totally not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Portrait","review":"The life of Nancy Reagan through the eyes of someone so well acquainted with her life through the last 25 plus years is a touching tribute to one of America's foremost First Ladys.From her life at the side of Ronald Reagan to her contribution in public to things she was passionate about, like the Just Say No Foundation, Deaver discusses what drove Nancy Reagan and the effect she had on our President and our society overall.Touching were the stories of the love the Reagans have for each other and the infective nature that their love and joy together had on Deaver and those around them. To think that the President missed his wife so when she travelled.This is an important book at important time for the Reagan family. As one of the great Presidents of our time is close to end of his life, this is a fitting tribute to his loving wife whose life is an example to us all of what we can do for our family, for our nation and for our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be autobiography of Michael Deaver","review":"If I wanted to read a biography about Michael Deaver I would have bought his autobiography. Extremely full of himself and his feelings, accomplishments, etc.... I felt it seriously lacked the biography part for Nancy. Although occassionally he would throw something in about her. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"66 Chapters & Not a Single Page of Sensuality","review":"I was highly disappointed by 66 Chapters on 33 Women. The characters were dense and rather saddening. None had a sexual past that I would ever want to aspire to or even fantasize about.When a woman reads erotica she would prefer not to read about men discussing their sexual histories using derogatory terms for the women they've bedded. All these pages could do is make sex with a man the last thing on our minds. Also, many chapters had scenes that did more to nauseate than to titillate.I found myself forced to read this just so I could provide a proper review. Thankfully it was short read. I would recommend looking elsewhere for TRUE erotica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced","review":"You can read it in one sitting, which is the best for most erotica. a lot of flash fictions string together by re-occurring characters. There's some odd repetition, but I see that the author uses this like jazz music, certain notes that come back to haunt you with a theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slideshow of erotic tableaux","review":"This book reads like a series of flashes in a dark room.The sex is so fast paced that the eroticism gets lost, and the novel seems more like a slideshow of erotic tableaux, and some of them not so erotic anyway.Warning some scat scenes might be too much for those of some delicacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Rather than an actual history of the period, this is a huge grab bag of facts and opinions, some fascinating, others a little boring. But when the author says, on page 67-68, \\"It was not some Napoleonic tyrant who authorized the bombing of Hiroshima, but a small-town lawyer, President Harry S. Truman,...\\" one catches a glimpse of how Wilson's opinions influence and perhaps even alter the facts he chooses to write about. Of course one of the most amazing things about Truman's career was that he never even got a college degree, yet he was one of the wisest presidents of the twentieth century, despite what A.N. Wilson obviously thinks.So one has to ask, if Wilson can get this fact wrong, how about all the others?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book on an era usually glossed over","review":"I'm currently finishing up this book. It's a real page-turner, well-written, easy-to-follow, yet providing interesting insights and comments, which make this period in history, which is usually considered as the bit between the two world wars, so granular you can nearly reach out and touch it. I would highly recommend this book to those who want to understand the early 20th century, and the people who influenced culture and life, but don't want a list of dates and places."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling look at healing after a crisis","review":"\\"All is Not Lost\\" is a compassionate look at journeying through major life-changing crisis, grief, or loss. The author skillfully deals with the many aspects of a true crisis from the normal questions of \\"Why me?\\" to working through grieving to healing. It also deals with anger, disappointment, acceptance, hope, and the other emotions that go along with grief. Each chapter ends with an exercise to help you move along through the healing process. \\"All is Not Lost\\" takes you thoughtfully, gently, and lovingly through the healing process. It is a highly recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"As only Nat could sing it","review":"This CD bring back memories of my younger years.

Look for a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Goes Back To His Roots.","review":"Gratitude is a cover CD in which Castro and the band pay their respects to R&B and blues artists that have influenced his life and his music. Covered here are Sam & Dave, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Howlin' Wolf, BB King, James Brown, Albert King, Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Buddy Guy and Wilson Pickett. Castro doesn't cover any new ground and doesn't select anything obscure to cover. Rather, he dusts off some better known tunes such as I Take What I Want, Bad Case Of Love and Tulane, and buts his heart into recreating these tunes to the best of his ability. Nothing original, but what's here is fun to listen to and will have to do until Castro returns with some new material."},{"rating":"2","title":"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: \\"GRATEFUL FOR TOMMY'S BLUE COVER!\\"","review":"This is a good fun blues \\"cover\\" by Tommy Castro. It's probably the best, stick to blues CD (with some R&B) of his that I've heard. Covering everyone from a \\"bluesy\\" Ray Charles, to Albert King, to Howlin Wolf, to James Brown. Even finishing with a real good rendition of Buddy Guy's \\"When My Left Eye Jumps\\". On a personal note, one of Shaq's all-time favorites, Albert King, is covered with a surprisingly, bouncy, \\"Everybody Wants To Go To Heaven.\\" Tommy, certainly isn't laying any new, creative, roads, into the blues world, but with the dirge, of living, practicing, blues, performers, out there, this is worth picking up while you wait for Shaq, \\"The King Of The World Blues Reviewer\\", to find some new \\"classic\\", gems for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough, honest memoir of a man and an industry","review":"This book is an addictive read. It has a spare, captivating style. It shifts between Joe's immigrant upbringing, Hollywood gossip, and \\"close-ups\\" which are insider dish pieces about unnamed folks in the industry.Without having a clue about Joe Eszterhas or his career, he managed to write a book that made me interested in him as an unruly, sometimes immoral, but ultimately honest and engaging man. Also, I was fascinated with the Hollywood mechanics. And finally, the fly-over values and Joe's escape from addiction (not to mention Hollywood) were very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading exciting from beginning to end","review":"Having been born in Hungary I escaped during the 1956 revolution with my family. We also ended up in a refugee camp first in Austria and then Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. I can relate to Joe's life experiences on a very personal level. He ended up in Cleveland, Ohio and I ended up in Newark, New Jersey. He writes honestly and details Hollywood deals and greed. Once I picked up the book I couldn't put it down. This is a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Redeeming Value","review":"Don't bother buying this book; if you MUST read it, get it from the library, but be aware that there are NO admirable people in this book. In fact, it's a pretty depressing look at what I always thought Hollywood was like: the adultery; the lost children; the drugs; the alcohol. It's just a sad story about sad, lost people. I know the author prides himself on having moved back to Cleveland, to his roots; however, I don't think his presence improves Cleveland in any way. As a person of Hungarian ancestry, I'm disheartened by what he has done with his life--professionally and personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"***","review":"Some interesting bits, some informative bits, some entertaining bits, but a lot of dull stretches, and the endless macho posturing gets really tiresome. It's always laughable to me when people like Esterhas (and John Milius and Tom Clancy and G. Gordon Liddy) who worship at the the alter of machismo assume that all who read them share their same \\"code\\" and will be struck with awe at their \\"impressive\\" feats. So it impresses Esterhas that Robert Mitchum once exercised flatulence in the face of a woman on a plane who dared ask him to stop smoking. Wow! That Robert Mitchum is such a rebel! Ooooh! Ahhhhh! Yeah, that's the type thing Esterhas admires. If you do, too, then maybe you'll like this book. I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they kidding?","review":"This man's talent is clearly as a salesman. Eszterhas has yet to write even one thing of merit. His movies are horrible. Yet he was once the highest paid screenwriter in Hollywood. It demonstrates that the studios do not know anything about quality. Eszterhas is no dummy, but he's no writer either. His success is a testament to something, but God only knows what. An epidemic of bad taste?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I had to give it one star","review":"We the public are to blame for people like Joe and Sharon and Sly. We pay our good money to go see their terrible movies. They laugh at us all the way to the bank.I wonder what Joe's first wife was talking about when he returned to her (for 27 seconds) and she ran through the house yelling...I won! I won! Won what? Him?Wears shorts and tank tops to meetings, sleeps with anything that moves, and doesnt speak to his old father for years. Won what Gerri? The booby prize? Take that $32,500 K a month and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is such a thing as bad press...","review":"Having worked for many years in both PR and marketing, I truly believe there is such a thing as bad press. Fifty pages into this book and I had to return it to the library where it will hopefully be buried! This book is a shining example that it doesn't always take talent to make tons of cash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much More Than A Hollywood Tell All","review":"Love him or hate him, at the very least you have to tip your hat for such a raw and honest biography. I admit when I first bought this it was for the titilation factor; I wanted to read all the dirt on Sharon Stone and Michael Ovitz, and all the other Hollywood heavyweights he's worked with. What I didn't expect/didn't know is how much of the book would be about his young life, growing up a Hungarian immigrant in Ohio, and the struggles his family had. Nor did I expect the deep and complicated relationship with his father, or the heartbreaking recounting of the end of his first marriage. It's an epic biography. Frankly I'm surprised he's not dead after all that's happened to him. The stress alone would knock out most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"lol","review":"This reads like a vanity-press book written by a talentless megalomaniac. Esztherhas doesn't have one even halfway decent movie to his credit: his films are lamebrain fare. The editors at Knopf have really lost their heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"shock and awe","review":"As an avowed feminist, I refused at first to buy this book because I have never been a fan of Joe Eszterhas. At my best friend's insistence, I finally, begrudgingly, picked one up. That was Friday night. On Saturday at 4 a.m. I was still reading. I cancelled my plans on Sunday. Didn't pick up my phone. When I finished it Sunday night, I was sobbing in bed. I was totally unprepared. I never expected to laugh so hard, hold my breath and, finally, have my heart broken. It is an amazing piece of writing and one which I know will stand the test of time. I was shocked at how it affected me and awed that someone could take the circumstances of their live and turn them into what reads like sweeping novel, full of rich characters and events that defy belief. But I do believe. So, Joe Eszterhas, if you're reading this -- you got me. Please write another book. And please -- write another movie. I promise to go this time. You are not who I thought you were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge the book, not the man","review":"It seems some people are giving this book a low rating based on the movies this guy released...which, let's face it, aren't exactly the pillars of morality. However, Joe writes about his life and holds no punches. He reveals some good dirt on some Hollywood folks, including Sly Stallone, Sharon Stone, and more.The Hollywood stories account for a little more than half of the novel...there's a lot of interesting stories about Joe growing up.This memoir is written really well and gives a good, insider's look at the weird world that is Hollywood. If you can look past Showgirls and Basic Instinct, this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing Good Content Crappy.","review":"I bought this book when it was first released and looked forward to reading it based on the reviews. I have to admit, the first half of the book was enjoyable and entertaining. His young life was interesting.But--the second half was horrible. I hated the details of his marriage and how he cheated on his wife with their best friend. It was excruciating to finish the book, but I thought it would have some redeeming quality. Instead, Joe moves to Ohio, of all places. And that was after he treated his wife of many years like crap by putting her through hell.I sold the book immediately after I read it. What a creep and his creepy (new) wife. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Surprise","review":"I bought this book at the airport for a plane ride to Tokyo thinking it would just be a trashy Hollywood book I could read to make the 17 hour flight go fast. I had never heard of Joe Eszterhas. Wow! This book was incredible. The vivid descriptions of his childhood intertwined with the inside world of the movie industry. I found myself actually not caring at all about the dish on the actors, I was more captivated by the strange ways all the deals are made to get from idea, to script to movie. Eszterhas is such a brilliant writer, I could feel, taste, and smell the Lorain Ohio he grew up in. I was so engrossed in this book I passed up 3 of the 6 meals they served on the plane!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, Egotistical Rubbish","review":"I must have read a different book to other reviewers.Probably the most pretentious, full of himself book I've ever read. I found myself disliking the guy the more I read - absolutely no personal insight or sense of irony.He eventually found a reason to hate his dad who'd sacrificed everything for him and manages to finish off with an entire \\"woe in me\\" section based around his dad and getting throat cancer.I don't think I've ever read a book by a person with so little insight into what a moron he is. Depressing, selfish and arrogant book - just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screenwriter Propaganda with Dirty Stories Attached","review":"Joe Eszterhas has an engaging prose style much simlilar to Bukowski in content as well as sentence structure. The book reads quickly so do not be daunted by its 730 plus pages. However, Eszterhas complains constantly how he has been bullied, manipulated and dumped upon while in the self reflective moments he shows he can give as much as he takes. He takes pride in claiming he is a family man with family values but shows how he deliberately alienates family members, frequently uses drugs and drinks, smokes and cheats on his wife to excess. The man is full of hyperbole and self/moral contradiction. If I have learned anything from this book it is that perhaps I still have time to reincarnate myself as a screenwriter as most of the dilemmas he depicts in achieving career success do not involve issues with writing only ego wrestling. I liked the book but not more than average."},{"rating":"2","title":"after considering many, this is great","review":"This footrest was easy to configure and has a nice surface.

I've been trying to introduce chores and a sense of responsibility to the running of the household to my oldest kids. Mrs. Boyack has found an approach that makes sense, and an attitude of \\"training\\" your children, not just nagging them, and this makes for people capable of taking care of themselves on all levels once they leave home.The \\"plan\\" and the five year goal time line are great ideas that helped solidify some of the ideas I've had, but hadn't figured out how to implement just yet. She also has some good ideas on allowance, earning money, and other financial tasks that are essential for children to understand once they grow up.The author has a great sense of humor and readily admits that her family is not perfect either, but there is hope, and progress can be made.

I was going to start with the section headings, but that would get the unwelcome attention of the Amazon word filters. Then I was going to start describing highlights from the anthology but I ran into the same challenge. Then I looked at the other reviews and they were either pressed for time or ran into the same challenges as I did.So, how about a generic impression - a lame, toned down version of a beautiful, powerful, volume. It's a really good assemblage of the subject matter in first-hand accounts, studies, deviancies and vignettes. It gives the reader insight into the truths behind stereotypes and misconceptions. It gives the reader a glimpse into the minds of the real people who live lives different than the accepted norm. It's a great volume.I recommend it.- CV Rick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Games!","review":"While I wouldn't exactly call myself a Russ Kick fan, I love, love, love this book.

I thought this book would contain some factual information. ( it gives a fraction of a fraction of true information ) However it is nothing but a bunch of stories written by individuals. ( god only knows if their even authors ) The subjsects are from the pretty norm to the very strange. The author of this book clearly has his own identity as well as mommy and daddy issues. Everything that he writes about clearly belongs being disscussed in therepy sessions. If you like reading about disgusting sexual encounters with people that are clearly disturbed, this ones for you.

Her voice is incredible and her range for singing up-tempo grooves to slow jams was quite refreshing. The full package was extremely exciting to listen to and I have not taken this cd out of my changer in my car. I have to hear her daily. If you really enjoy listening to good music when the artist puts their own charm into songs and can definitely hold a note, then Chrissette Michelle \\"I Am\\" is worth the money. I love it when I can listen to a cd from first track to last without wanting to stop (except for the occasion to replay a track again before moving on to the next. I am glad I purchased this cd and am scouring the intenet to see if there are others cuts from her out I can download."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"Absolutely delightful and entertaining from start to finish. I learned of Chrisette Michele during a recent interview on XMRadio. I am absolutely thrilled with the purchase and I really hope this is the start of a fantastic career for her. She has a purity to her voice, yet there is a familiarity with the Jazz greats. There is also a resemblance to Corinne Bailey Rae -- (whom I absolutely adore). I must say that Chrisette's voice is notably more powerful, and seemingly, better trained. Still, I TOTALLY adore them both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a talented young lady","review":"I love this CD. I heard one song on the radio and had to get this. It has a jazzy feel to it.

The sound is soulful and mature, especially for her age. The combined sounds of Ella Fitgerald, Sarah Vaugh, Billie Holiday, Natalie Cole, and a bit of Jill Scott and Nancy Wilson are heard throught the CD. The upbeat songs like \\"Let's Rock\\" are just as nice as the mellow sounds of \\"If I Have My Way\\". Chrisette has a promising future ahead of her. Looking forward to hearing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Warm Welcome to Ms. Chrisette Michele!","review":"Just got it last night -- great debut!

I just got this CD from a friend today. Once I put it in, I haven't listened to anything else. She sings about real situations, feelings, and all of the songs are so soulful. It's like she made an album for all kinds of days - when you want to party, when you want to cry, when you want to be sexy, when you're in love, etc. I've just bought tickets to her show in Nashville on August 18.

The first one that comes to mind is of disappointment. After hearing the first two single releases: the mid tempo 'If I Have My Way', and the gorgeous 'Best of Me', I expected more than I got. These two songs were the reasons why I purchased this CD album in the first place. The rest of the CD, apart from 'Mr. Radio' (which addresses the way love is portrayed through love songs on the radio) is inoffensive and bland.But after reflection I think this is a decent start for a first CD release. It also bides well for Def Jam records, now that L.A Reid is now in charge of affairs there (in times past this kind of CD would never have surfaced on Def Jam.) I wish that Babyface had been let loose on this CD as sole producer, as his & Chrisette Michele lone effort (Best of Me, which features an excellent video) is the stand out track on her. Oh well. Roll on CD number two."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent cd","review":"this cd is really good...kinda has that jazzy feel to it..all the songs are tight, and Christte kinda reminds me of Jill Scott...

My favs are Golden, Good Girl, In This for you, Is this the way love feels, et.al. There's not a bad track on the CD. I guess when you're in the company of LA Reid and Babyface, where can a girl go wrong? This is the only CD I'm listening to now, and I'm advising all my friends and family not to sleep on Chrisette. She was here in Detroit for a free concert over the weekend of June 22nd, and I missed her because of a family wedding. Never again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This CD is the BOMB!!!!!!! I love every song!!! Very relaxing and soothing to the soul. I love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Singer!","review":"Chrisette Michele is an awesome singer hands down, with a different style compared with the general commercial marketof today. She has a positive message for women, encouraging them to maintain a positive self image, confidence, excellence,and she esteems self respect. She is a powerful vocalist, very soulful, and authentic. If you are looking for an artist with substance and talent, this would be a great buy for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in R&B","review":"First of all, I have to say \\"oh my goodness\\" about this album! I love it! When I heard her vocals on Nas's song, that was when I loved her voice and the girl is only in her 20's. She sound very mature for her age and my most favorite songs are \\"Like A Dream\\" and \\"Let's Rock\\". Her songs has variety and depth in them. I'm a female in my early 30's and I feel in these days of R&B, we, as adults, need mature sounding songs that are still kept in today's lifestyle. I would say to Chrisette Michele, I can't wait for your next CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift","review":"I bought this for my fiance and she loves it!

Miss Michele has a gift and I hope that she can use it to continue to produce excellent music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I heard two or three singles off the CD before purchasing it and remember thinking I've got to get that CD. After hearing a couple of family members go on and on about it I finally purchased \\"I Am\\". I am a lover of neo-soul music which I think Chrisette Michele's \\"I Am\\" category fits into but I especially like this CD for the vocal sounding and styling of Chrisette Michele and the refreshing mix of early 20th century soul music feel along with the jazz and contemporary R & B influences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album Full of Class","review":"Chrisette Michele is a breath of fresh air to come out with quality meaningful music. She came out with her first single \\"If I had My Way\\" and its talking about taking a relationship to the next level with a person and she went about the song concept in a classy way. Many different artists would've gotton to the point in a more tacky way and I respect her for that. The next single \\"Best of Me\\" was about her dealing with losing love but finding the better part of herself to move on from the situation. After hearing both singles, I knew I needed to give her album a listen and I'm glad I made the purchase. I wasn't disappointed and I would recommend it to anyone that's interested in listening to \\"real\\" music with a soul, jazzy, blues feel. Other joints to check out is \\"Golden\\", \\"Mr.Radio\\", and \\"Is this the Way Love's Supposed to Feel\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been a long time since something this good was produced","review":"I felt that I had to write something to convey how moved I was when I stumbled upon this CD. I never heard of this artist, but after listening to the CD the first time, I was blown away. (Hint: There are bonus tracks if you download the CD from Itunes that are live versions of Golden, I am One, Good Girl and If I have my way).Buy this CD. I can promise that you will not be disappointed. I have told so many of my friends and family about this CD that I am sure that they are tired of me, but that is how strongly I feel about it. The CD is wonderfully written and makes me feel great when I listen. That is the reason we have music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, subtle, gracious and enduring.","review":"Finally. A young female singer who isn't begging for a man, bragging on her sexuality and going on and on about the material things she has. There is a maturity in the lyrics and the phrasing of these songs that wows me. Each song actually tells a story or sets a mood. Not to knock other singers, but her positivity (in a time where many sisters aren't really selling a lot of positive) is refreshing. In particular, I would love to see the song \\"Good Girl\\" played to young women over and over again.But it's the voice, the delivery, the complexity that sells this CD to me. Truth be told, this child could probably sing \\"Little Miss Muffett\\" and still make a classic. Her voice is at times silk, at others, velvet, and without all of that over singing and caterwauling that some folks seem to think makes them a strong singer.I enjoy this Cd, it's on heavy rotation in my car and home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest CYE season to date","review":"This is my favourite comedy on television, but the 4th season was a disappointment by far. 'The Producers' storyline gets stale after the first couple episodes, it really was like they just gave up for this season and stopped trying. \\"Coast mode\\" as someone else described it, fits quite well.One of the things I love about CYE is that every episode is something new and different, but season 4 definitely lost that comedic magic.If the new season isn't an improvement over this, I think it's time that they call it quits. But I'm hopeful that CYE's best days are ahead.I'd say buy every other season on DVD, but skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime","review":"If you liked previous seasons of this show, this is another winner.

Sometime funny but more often disappointing. The invention and imagination we hold dear may be inevitably declining.Especially since collectors as myself, who have supported the previous seasons will be very shy of any future purchase.We should remember the influence of John Cleese creator of Fawlty Towers, maybe the finest TV comedy to date,who simply realised his legacy after two seasons.With the passion comes the prejudice, so fans as myself should well accept and so encourage Larry to his next project..My best wishes to his continued success.

Extended guest appearances by Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer can't save (and may actually contribute to) this one from being the weakest season to date. (How much deadpan dourness can a viewer take?)But even when Stiller and Schwimmer aren't around, this season is on \\"coast mode.\\" Too much reliance on forced, unfunny variations of David's now-predictable shock-value humor. Not enough Cheryl Hines. Even Jeff seems bored/tired. If the next season's no better than this, everyone should call it a day and quit while they're still ahead of 90 percent of the junk on TV. They're entitled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth buying a used copy","review":"I'm a CYE fan who's too cheap to buy cable, so I anxiously awaited this DVD. In fact, I'm so lame I bought it twice--once on Amazon.com, and then, because I couldn't wait for it to arrive via free Super Saver Shipping, again at a record store. (Yes, I am ashamed of this behavior.) Anyway, I'm disappointed. There's a lot of dead space in the episodes, with improvisation that isn't especially funny. The whole season feels slack. It's worth picking up a used copy, but I'm sorry I spent thirty bucks on it (twice)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite season so far!","review":"Gotta love HBO and Curb! This season brings back the best Democrat, LARRY DAVID and he does not disappoint! My favorite episode is \\"The Car Pool Lane\\" where all hell breaks loose when Larry wants to use a hooker for the car pool lane to beat that I-405 Los Angeles traffic. The actress that plays the character of the prostitute does a hilarious job in this episode. It is also endearing to see Anne Bancroft in one of her last performances before she died.

The book needed a good copy editor, too - it has far too many errors.Molly deserved a biographer (and perhaps an editor to work with the writer) who could shape a well written account of her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOLLY SPOTTED ELK: A PENOBSCOT IN PARIS","review":"THIS WAS BOUGHT AS A PRESENT.

Ivory Tower's self titled album is a display of raw progressive metal, unlike the bands that I've mentioned above, Dream Theater and Symphony X, and you really gave to give it a good unbiased listen to know what I'm talking about.Most of the review draw a parallel with Dream Theater and that is just plain wrong. This is not Dream Theater and this doesn't try to be Dream Theater. Ivory Tower may not have the best vocals around, but they deliver; the instrumentalists are very skilled and the music is solid prog metal.I recommend that you listen to this album before you buy it, because it might not be your \\"thing\\", but if it is you'll love it for sure. It's not a coincidence that many people rate this album 5 with stars, while others rate it with 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is teh troo prog!!!!!!!!!!","review":"ivory towe4r is one of the best bands ever i like dreem theater but this is better than images and words that album would be better without kebinbin more he sucks this is the stuf right here no poser prog like dredge and tool this is troo all the way if u don't like this u probably like pain of salvation too i want to see this band in japan theyre the best jamapenese thing since wang computers and sushi."},{"rating":"1","title":"James LaBrie called...","review":"...and this is what he said...\\"Excuse me, is this the singer from the band Ivory Tower?

I wasn't looking to buy my boss a gift, but when I saw this it was perfect. It was so unexpected by all as to the uniqueness of the theme of this gift that everyone kept saying..........\\"I have never seen anything like this before.\\" \\"Where did you get it.\\" The price was good and the look was good. The delivery was pretty quick. It was packaged well. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but no Twilight","review":"Schuyler Van Alen, always the outcast at her upscale private school, suddenly finds out that she's a member of an elite \\"family\\" of vampires, The Blue Bloods. The Blue Bloods came to America on The Mayflower trying to escape the one thing that can kill them. For centuries they've lived in peace. But now the danger is back.This was definitely a different take on vampires. I enjoyed the story. It managed to keep my interest throughout. I really loved the way that the author took real historical events, like the disappearance of the original Roanoke colony, and made it such an intriguing part of the story. There was a period in history where people actually did equate consumption with vampirism. I thought that was a nice touch. I've heard a few different people say this was better than Twilight. I don't agree, but I did enjoy the story and look forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Placement?","review":"This book is over exploding with brand names, it's slightly obnoxious. I didn't really enjoy this book but the end is a bit of a \\"cliffhanger\\" so I half want to buy the rest of the series just to see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldnt recommend","review":"This is one book I wouldnt recommend. It wasnt horrible but not something i would recommend to anyone, there are way better books out there that i would rather spend my four hours on. There werent a lot of details... well I take that back there were a lot of details on what the characters wore names and designers but the book itself was pretty shallow. I also really didnt like the fact that it jumped around a bit. It was kinda confusing who they are talkin about at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fashionistic lifestyle vs. Vampires","review":"When I read this book, it seemed the author was trying to get rich off of the vampire theme craze that's going on after Twilight. Thank god I didn't buy the book and instead checked it out at my local library. The story line was predictable. The style of writing was annoying and also predictable. I found the book was more about fashion than a complex, exciting and adventure filled story. I have to say that the ending's imagery was amazingly acceptable. Except, it was just too little too late. Bottom line is that I can certainly live without reading the sequels from the \\"cliffhanger\\" at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"I hope this author gets some sort of financial kickback from all the designers that she mentions in this book, because that's all the book is about! I really don't need to know what every single person/vampire is wearing and what designer purse they are carrying. Not much else to the plot. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing Style","review":"Though I loved the concept of this book, and the storyline---I'm not huge on the writing style. I felt that even by the end of the book, the author never really gave me a chance to create an attachment to any of the characters. They were just pawns in the storyline rather then anything else.Again--great storyline and I like where it was heading, but I prefer a more character driven book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written","review":"Could have been an intriguing premise, and the author does actually have a few original ideas about vampire lore, but WOW was it difficult to get through. I realize it's a \\"young adult\\" novel, but I don't think that's an excuse for bad writing. I found it SO puerile! Just plain badly written. Throwing around brand and band names in the vain attempt to lend edge or modernity to her story was a very bad idea. The modelling aspect was just ridiculous; it read more like a young girl's fantasy of what being a model would be like. The dialog is sludgy and stupid. There's no suspense; the characters are caricatures. The book reads like a 9th grade creative writing assignment which warranted--maybe--a B+. I literally had nothing new to read and had purchased this used for a quarter awhile ago, so I struggled through it. It was not worth the time. At all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a quick read and the series ROCKS!","review":"After seeing this book only received 3 1/2 stars, I decided not to buy it. My friend later recommeded the book. I loved it! I read it in an afternoon. I don't know what some of these 1 & 2 stars were for...? I thought it was a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book really \\"sucks!\\"","review":"I am thoroughly disappointed with this book. I had read all three and none held my interest.At first, it's looks promising but then as you progress through the book, It felt more of a \\"fashion\\" book. The writer is trying to incoporate her extensive knowledge of fashion instead of building it's substance. Always referring to a name brand down to Bliss's thong. The story is interesting but writing felt rushed.I did not fell in love with any of the characters. I simply dislike Jack Force, I can't figure out why Schuyler could fall in love with him - it seems more like an infatuation rather than love - He is no where near in comparison to Edward Cullen or Jacob Black!!!what a waste of time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires Done The Way I Like It","review":"Although I am getting tired of Vampires and stuff, I was really sucked into this book. I think it was the whole Reincarnation, flashback through history thing. I am a sucker for that kind of stuff. Then I found it hilarious how the idea that most of the beautiful, rich people in New York and around were Vampires. I am really excited to read the 2nd book in the series.Review Originally Seen Here: [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing New Kind of Vampire Novel","review":"I just started reading the blue bloods series. I am nearly up to date and ready for the next novel. I actually started with some of the later books and I am now working my way back to the first. I have been continually surprised by the creativity and heart this series has shown. I was never a big twilight fan (no offense!) so I welcomed a new vampire mythology. It felt fresh and exciting to visit a world that didn't reflect the the old vampire rules. The author has created her own vision of a world of vampires who are angels cast out of heaven and looking for redemption. There are enough vampire series out there (and I like them all!) but this one seemed special and different for me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting vampire mystery in NYC....","review":"This book is awesome, I love how it I could not put this book down. It is about a young 15 year old who lives in NYC and is an outcast from classmates in highschool. This story combines mystery, history and love.I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gossip Girl meets Twilight!","review":"This YA novel is one that I chose to read because of my obsession with Twilight. I figured after about the 7th time I'd read through the entire Twilight series, it was time to move on to a different vampire series. This books really reminds me of a good mix between Gossip Girl and Twilight. It's got all the vampire stuff, very different from \\"Twilight vampires\\" but it's still in there in its own way, but the focus of the book is these vampires and their roles in high society in NYC (hence the Gossip Girl reference). The book flows well and it's an easy read. There's good love stories through out and the book is never dull. Also, I think that the series just gets better and better, so keep going with it. I look forward to De La Cruz's next book in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book if you liked the Twilight series","review":"I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down until I finished. It entranced me along the lines of the Twilight and Vampire Academy series. I was happy not to be disappointed as I have been in looking for other series along the vampire line. Schuyler's and Oliver's true relationship was a surprise and the turn Dylan takes was a shock. I cannot wait to read the next book to see where these story lines go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise mangled by laughably bad writing.","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. I don't think better editing would have helped much - the author's \\"skills\\" are so rudimentary that even a reasonably intelligent twelve-year-old would have to wonder how she managed to get an actual publishing house to look at, let alone pay for and bring to market, such crap! Unbelievable . . . everyone involved should be embarrassed. RIdiculously bad and a huge waste of time. Wish the rating system had a zero-stars option because this book certainly deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have time to waste.. then..","review":"If you have time to waste, then this is not your worst choice. It's not that boring - in fact, it's quite entertaining. But if you're looking for something serious and original, this certainly can't be one. I'd dare say; Gossip Girl + Twilight + Vampire Chronicles = Blue Bloods. This is one of the most unoriginal books I've ever read so far. And it's not even well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This was a \\"blah\\" book. There wasn't any real meat to it. It was trying way too hard to be a cross between Gossip Girl and Twilight but falling way too short. It was boring and I forced myself to finish it hoping that it would get good, but of course it didn't. I would not recommend this book and I am not going to be reading any of the follow-up books. I would give it one star but I can see what the author was trying to do and I can see how it might be a good idea, it just didn't work here, but maybe the other books in the series are able to pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mehh","review":"I'm not real impressed with this book. It seems like the author was more concerned with dropping names than character development. I also get the feeling that she made an effort with the first 3/4 of the book and then realized an impending deadline and hurried to finish the book. This book just isn't worth your time, the Twilight series was also written by an amature author but there is just no comparison between the two- if you want a good Y.A. Vampire read pick the Twilight series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly even a vampire book.","review":"There were pages and pages where she just listed off the details of what her characters were wearing. And if she had the time to do that, why couldn't she bother to give them actualy characterization? Schuyler and the gang were as dull and flat as dull can be. I read it because a friend made me, so it's not usually my thing. If you usually enjoy books like \\"Gossip Girls\\" or the \\"Au Pair\\" series, you might like this. I certainly didn't. If you're looking for a good vampire book for teens, try Twilight. It's utterly absorbing, with characters you can fall in love with. It has everything this did NOT. Don't waste your money. Read Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"I struggled to get through the book","review":"I never thought I'd find anything worse than Vampire Diaries and Need in the paranormal romance category but low and behold, Blue Bloods is worse, much worse. For everyone who is into the whole Paris Hilton and my diamond shoes don't fit deal you might like it. Even with the series that I'm not fond of I always pick up the next book just to see if it gets better, but there's no way I'm buying the sequel. This book should be taken off store shelves and burned so people don't waste their money. There's way too many amazing books out there to ever have to resort to buying this. If you're in need of some good paranormal romance books, shoot me an email and I can recommend a bunch that are way better than Blue Bloods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intresting.","review":"What I really like about this book, that the authur gave a different twist to the typical vampire senerio. It took me awhile to get hooked,but once I did it was a good book. I cant' wait to read the next one. I would have perferred to see more love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"I felt like I was reading Sex and the City and the popular girl was a well dressed Carrie Bradshaw as a vampire. Dumb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly enthralling!","review":"When I read the first book a little less than a year ago, i could barely put it down! This is a big recommendation for those who like a good urban fiction. Amazing plot all around, i give this three thumbs up! JACK AND SKY 4EVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"This was another total waste of my valuable reading time. Again, the plot was there, the actual potential for a really good read was there; but, there was no development. There was nothing there to drive me to turn to the next page. I actually made myself read this one---yet, I could not bring myself to finish it... It was simply a narration of the plot. When an author gives you more description of the sidewalk than the characters, there is a ton to be desired to the actual story line. I did not even finish the first book of the series I was so bored. I think I will have a bonfire to burn the three I bought together (I cancelled my order for the fourth book of this series), and add to it the two that I bought of the Immortal series. Again, they were both a total waste of money and valuable reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best part was the Synopsis","review":"I read the plot of the book and thought it sounded entertaining. The writing is horrid, there's no flow, the story never actually progresses.... It is the worst \\"writing\\" I have ever read. The only reason I finished reading it was because it was so short and I bought the book. Don't waste your time, this wont entertain you in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Twilight","review":"Being a huge fan of the Twilight series, I wasn't sure I would like this book. It's an okay read. The only redeeming quality is the presence of Schuyler. If it wasn't for her character I wouldn't have been able to stand all the high society snootiness and the superficial teens who consume mass quantities of designer clothing. It was an interesting read, overall. I didn't feel like it was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that impressed","review":"I picked this book up after reading Twilight and New Moon (trying to pass the time until Eclipse), but I was really dissappointed. Some of the content was too adult (getting naked at parties, drinking, and smoking)..they're only 15!!! If I had kids, I don't think I would want to read it. She also did waaay too much name dropping- I thought maybe she was being endorsed for all of the brand names she used (ya know, kind of like when the movies sneak products into the shot). I figure, with trends changing as fast as they do, this book will be obsolete in a couple of years. It was shallow, with too much detail on what they were wearing and not enough detail on the personalities of the characters and the plot (which seems like it could have been interesting)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different Vampire Book","review":"I liked this book, it took me awhile to get into the book, but once I did I enjoyed the book. I think it might be a little bit confusing for young teens to read. When you find out how the Vampires come back year after year. It took me by surprise. Very weird and confusing, but it is different and when you read as many vampires books as I do a little different is good. Can't wait for the 2nd books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I for got to add to my original review","review":"Did anyone else notcie how much this story resembled the City of Bones.I read this book second and can tell you I will be in no hurry to read the other one in the series. The City of Bones books are so much better! No fashion lessons and more morals. No under age sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disapointed with this book :(","review":"I didn't like at all the fact that these are supposed to be 15 to 16 year old kids who are drinking and having casual sex. This was very disappointing. I thought this was supposed to be a young adult book. The character should have been older for the content. This had the potential for being a good story. But I also felt like I was reading a fashion magazine most of the time. I mean she even tells you what name brand underwear the characters wear. Who needs to know that! Stick to the story! without all that none sense and age issues for me I think I could have liked the story. It was just so so for me as is. Nothing I would read again. This also wouldn't be the first book I would recommend to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"It was an ok book, more for young crowd. I would have liked it to be longer. But overall it was alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and devastatingly addictive","review":"This book kept me glued to it. It was a real turn-pager for me. I enjoyed the twists and the background of the storyline. I have always been a vampire fan myself, but this took it to a whole new level. I would highly suggest vampire fans to read this fantastic book.The characters in this book are magnificent and fun. Melissa De La Cruz has done an amazing job in writing this book. A good Bravo! is deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue bloods","review":"Very good! I love vampire series and this was one of the best. Melissa de last Cruz is a great writer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fanfiction","review":"I feel that the general plot and idea of this book could have been something great. Unfortunately, it is written so poorly. There is more description of clothing than any actual good description of the characters and what they are going through or feeling. It's so jumbled and such an afterthought. It really felt like bad fanfiction to me. Good idea, bad writing. Pretty unlikeable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suprisingly good read.","review":"I bought this book while searching for new things to read. The cover was attractive and the information about the book was intriguing. Once I received the book though, I put it down for several months because it just didn't seem like it would be a good read. Once I started, it was quite the opposite. I was surprised that, even though this book was centered around a lot of preps' lives, the writing was complex and it wasn't simplistic or watered down to fit a younger teen audience; which is how many young adult books are. This book had a quick plot and you just wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen. The only complaint I have for this book is that it was too short and ended way before I was ready for it to end. If you want a good, short read, you should definitely pick up Blue Bloods!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that helped me cope with Twilight","review":"I needed something to help me cope with finishing Twilight. It's not as romantic and passionate as Twilight but still has a good story and action to it. It keeps me sucked in. It's a different way of seeing how vampires really live within society. I think if you really liked Twilight, you'd really enjoy this too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Bloods","review":"Interesting twist on the vampire genre. Enjoyed it; those that enjoyed Twilight, etc. might enjoy this too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good, but it just wasn't","review":"I will be the first to admit that I am a fashion junky; I love reading Vogue and own a ludicrous amount of shoes... but COME ON!The plot itself would have been good, if not for the fact that, in detail, each piece of clothing that each character was wearing was described painfully in detail. What it was, where it was from, everything about it... and most of the clothes were cliche items such as the Chloe Paddington bag that the \\"it\\" girls in Hollywood at the time were carrying. By the end of it, I was so sick of the clothing descriptions, I had to put it down. De la Cruz should have spent more time fleshing out the characters and less time creating a written fashion show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you like vapid thirteen year old writing","review":"I picked up this book on a recommendation from an online source to be a good alternative to Twilight. However it reads like a fashion-concious thirteen year old girl with all the name dropping about designers and long descriptions and little action. Do we really need to go on for 3 pages about the exact length and shade of someone's miniskirt? The quasi-incest of the Frost twins?I wish Mrs. De La Cruz would be introduced swiftly to a writing tutorial that is age-approriate for an adult writer instead of this \\"hehe\\" and \\"lol\\"-inspired nature of this book. I felt insulted while attempting to read this poor excuse for a pretty cover of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal and Boring","review":"Was this a book on fashion or vampires, I'm not quite sure? After struggling through the first 50 pages, I was so bored I took it back to the store and got my money back. Big YAWN on this spoiled brat teen society that is focused on what they wear, what designer labels they are and what snobbish department store they were bought in. A very disappointing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible example for young girls","review":"I recently finished reading another YA series about vampires, and thought I would give this book a whirl. To sum up, I was SHOCKED at the ideas portrayed in this supposedly YA novel. Sex, drugs, alcohol, and disobedience to parents filled the pages of this less than tasteful novel. I would never want my teenage daughter to read this and think that drugs and alcohol and teenage sex are cool. I am saddened to think that girls are reading this and thinking the behavior described is okay. If you are a parent, I would think twice about letting your child read this series, or any of this author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as described.","review":"Book was described as \\"like new\\".Book arrived missing the jacket, hardcover is stained in different colors.Far from being \\"like new\\" as described.NOT HAPPY AT ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This Book had such mixed reviews.

This book was a great success and recommend it for any vampire book lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"blue bloods book one","review":"I was afraid this would be a rip off of the Twilight series but boy was I wrong. My co-worker and I have become addicted to this series also (I'm 50 and she's in her 40s). Some parts are a little racy for teens but I think it's fine for adults.I ordered the whole series and my co-worker is ahead of me but she reports that she can't put the books down. I've had a similar problem. Rather than a romance as Twilight was this has an interesting story to keep you glued to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Bloods.","review":"Alright.(on my defense this is my first written review)i did alot of background reading before i bought this book, the back cover sounded amazing. Scheyler sounded promising with forbiddin romance and paranormal creatures.But... turns out being a vamp isnt what this book is about. its more of a badly written soap opera that sucks(pun intended.)this book has three different narrerators. in all my favorite ya books i get to know the narrerator and feel like i get into character, this one every time i start to get a feel of sky(mimi, or bliss) i get to another short chapter with another person.Not a good series in my taste. AND I USUALLY LOVE CORNEY VAMP LOVE STORIES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrr","review":"Blue Bloods is a violent car crash of gossip girl meets the worst vampire book you have ever read. No character is likeable, it seems like an excuse to drop brands and names and fantasise about being uber rich and living in Manhattan. How many people actually live like the kids in this book do? It's obscene and if that is the way the super rich live then I am more than happy to maintain my middle class, simple, jeans-and-a-tshirt existence.Gawd what a waste of money and time.I suppose at 21 I might be getting too old for these books but dayum, must so many of these YA paranormal offerings being utter and unremitting s***?It seems like if you write about hot teenage boy vampires these days, no matter how thin the plot or how unlikable the characters, you're publishable.Blue Bloods made me grind my teeth in an effort to finish the damn thing. In my humble oppionion it is not worth anybodies money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time.","review":"The author chose to focus more on fashion than on the plot and its characters, thus leaving the story half-baked. I thought I was picking up a book about vampires, not Vogue or Elle! The author went overboard with her obsession for designer labels that it just got beyond ridiculous. The characters weren't well developed, as was the plot. The flow was very choppy. It was painful reading the book but I forced myself to finish it hoping that the author would redeem herself somewhere down the line. Alas, it was not to be. This was a complete waste of time, paper, and ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drooping plot, trite language, and yet...I liked it!","review":"Despite the fact the author seemed to give up on the last 5 chapters, and hurried the book to an odd conclusion, this still proved a fun book. The concepts behind the plot were facsinating. The fashion world as vampires? Of course! Why didn't I think of that! The explantion for the disappearance of the colony of Roanoke was very unique. As an adult reader of YA literature, I'm always on the look out for something that will tempt a reluctant reader. This will do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue bloods","review":"Good quick read. Can not wait to start the next.

I didn't think that anything could ever even come close to twilight, but i was wrong. I have just finished \\"my bloody valentine\\" which is the last book released so far from the blue bloods, and i am so hooked on this story! Mellisa D.L C is such a wonderful author, but in this book, i did notice a lot of \\"set up\\" writing. Because of the setting of the story, she had to describe a lot of fashion, appearance of buildings/homes, schools, and i felt like i was reading a fashion magazine more then a fantasy/love story. But soon enough that passed, and i found it to be important as the story continued because she set up the mental pictures you need to picture the story right.all in all, although this book is more introductions and fashion description, its a necessary book to \\"set you up\\" for the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good kind of different","review":"The title says it all. I'm usually pretty picky about my vampire stories, I tend to gear more towards Anne Rice's traditional plot. But Blue Bloods is definitely a good change. The Blue Bloods have a completely new world and lifestyle of being immortal. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing look at vampires","review":"I tend to stay away from the teen vampire novels myself, because I found them a bit lacking, and very amateur.Vampires always has been a adult thing, in my opinion. The whole idea is mature-themed.So when I picked up this book, I was pleasantly surprised to find it refreshingly entertaining. I like Melissa's world of vampires (maybe even more than the ones in Twilight).In the end I like my vamps more meatier and grittier. (you really can't get that from teen novels, so no complaining.)But when you need a change of pace, this book is definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth time and money","review":"This book is not worth your time reading it, or the money. It's all about 500 dollar designer jeans, shoes, purses, cars, apartments, antiques - yawn - and other high price status symbols - a very shallow and materialistic theme runs right through the whole book. Does the author collect commission on the labels she constantly praises?? The vampire theme is thrown in as an afterthought, I guess because it sells.The main character, Schuyler, is being nicely developed, but the close relationship of the reader with Schuyler gets lost as soon as she gets involved in the predictable plot. I guess unexpectedly landing a job as a jeans model changed her mind about wearing unique and different outfits herself....?The plot is a bore, and nothing is resolved at the end of the book. A typical set-up to sell 'to be continued' endlessly. I for sure will not continue to read the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt deliver","review":"I seem to have developed a liking for this genre over the last few years.

It was more 'lets look at all these insanely beautiful skinny people) the characters were card board mannequins. I love the idea of vampires. Even if they are beautiful and powerful and strong, life has it draw backs .Not blue bloods they can ::: They can eat with out guilt, they are insanely rich,go out in sun, all secretly in the modeling business??!!No blemishes, forget about lung cancer from all those cigarettes!Oh and don't worry no embarrassing teenage pregnancies, they can't reproduce.

Blue Bloods is the lovechild of the Twilight series and the Gossip Girl books, but is far superior to either one of them. Set in Manhattan among society's elite, Blue Bloods tells the story of fallen angels, vampires, and a secret history.Considering the glut of books about vampires and privileged teens, Blue Bloods managed to stand out while still being just a good young adult book. It's not a literary masterpiece, but it's solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not compare to the Twilight series","review":"Although not an absolutely terrible read...if you are looking for something along the lines of the Twilight series this is not it. I actually picked this book up at my local bookstore on the recommendation of the sales person.

So if you are looking for something now that the twilight series is complete, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time....","review":"Melissa de la Cruz's, Blue Bloods, offers a new take on vampirism. It is unique and has a lot of potential. Sadly, this book is confusing! You have no idea where the story is going and why it's going there.The story has some likeable teen characters and their relationships are pretty well developed. But in the end, you are left dumbfounded. So what is a blue blood? I have tons of questions, still unanswered.It seems to me that the author had lots of ideas that would have been great, but couldn't decide which to use and which to discard.

The cap rolls up and exposes your ears. Still there seems to be room at the crown- so it is not being pulled up for need to house the cranium. Bought the item to secure the ears from ocean water- it fails. I have used the Speedo vinyl and TYR warm cap, both of which roll up a bit over the ears- but neither of those ripped- the Aqua Glide ripped after less than 2 dozen uses, and I followed the directions on how to put it on and care for it.

I have long ( down to my bra strap), thick, coarse, curly hair. This type of swim cap is much easier to put on. It also has little nubs on the inside that help it stay pulled down so I'm not tugging at it all the time. My hair does still get wet around the edges though much better then other caps I've tried. The convex ear places do well but I still wear ear plugs. I would have given this a 5 star but the cap eventually developed a tear which ripped off below the ear where I pull it down. So if the durability was better, I'd have given it 5 stars for sure.

Part of the problem is that it's too small. It's not too tight, in the brief moments it spent on my skull it wasn't uncomfortable. But it will not stay put. I'm between L and XL in drugstore sunhats, so not a small head, but not abnormally huge either. I have long hair but very fine, it doesn't add bulk.After wrestling with the Aqua Sphere Aqua Glide I got it on, anchored by my goggles. It crept up over my ears, but stayed on for a length, before popping off in the flip turn. I shall be sticking to the speedo bubble cap with chin strap.

Penton has endeavored to produce a straightforward account of the major actors in the WT movement. JW's whom I know were open-minded enough to have read this book recognize its historical accuracy, but often resent the fact that it shows too much of the fraile, human,and naive side of the Watchtower's principal players. Why? Because to do so weakens their faith in the organization, that it is THE sole organization on earth directed by Jehovah.

The author did not take into consideration to the point that it should have been expressed, the love and dedication of the late Pope John Paul II to the Holy Mother. The author just passed over this fact and seemed to avoid it in order to stick to her idea that Mary has been neglected for so many years. In fact, I don't see it.

It starts off slow and, like many complex books in the genre, somewhat confusing at first, but it slowly starts developing a focus. By the time you are half-way through it, it actually starts to seem kind of normal. By the end, it is action packed with several really interesting characters. Unfortunately, like another reviewer wrote, it also becomes obvious there are going to be loose threads left around. Annoying when you really want to know how things turn out for several characters.This is a book that begs for a sequel.

Why do I get the feeling that these authors have no intention of ever telling a coherent story again; that all they want to do is create a \\"universe\\" where they can earn a few bucks by putting out another chapter in a never-ending story every couple of years.This book started out well-enough, but my dense mind caught on to the fact that the plot wasn't going to be resolved at about page 300 (out of over 400). There were just too many loose ends, with not enough pages remaing to tie them all up.Science fiction used to be fun and intriguing. Now, thanks to books and authors such as this, it is only plodding and pointless. Have we as an audience really become so unsophisticated?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysteryplanetary","review":"Although Mr. Daniel is an imaginative Sci-Fi writer and seems knowledgeable about the hard science aspects of his story, there are things that make this book unsatisfactory. The most disturbing of these is that it isn't pointed out anywhere to the buyer that this is actually an unfinished book. Several important subplots are introduced and then abandoned by the end of the narrative. It's as frustrating as a detective mystery in which you are not told \\"who done it.\\" Also, the writer haphazardly jumps around among many different characters and you find yourself having to continually flip back through the book to refresh your memory about who this person was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it isn't as bad as Warpath.","review":"One of the worst books I've read in the sci-fi genre.

The technological ideas in the book are teriffic. But the author contantly bounces around from viewpoint to viewpoint, from character to character, time period to time period, without letting you get to know, and therefore care about, any of them. For example, the characters in the introduction don't have even the slightest bearing on anything for the next several hundred pages, and quite frankly the book may have been more tolerable if those early chapters were completely axed. For that matter, much of the technology is presented as an entire chapter of asides that interrupt any flow the story would normally have had, had it not bounced around so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would make a nice Sci-Fi TV series","review":"The two main stumbling blocks that brought me to abandon this novel at page 67 was the scifico-babble (similar to psychobabble) terms like \\"grist\\", that are not defined up front or somewhere close to the beginning of the book, and, for me, the necessary ingredient of clarity/coherence. The reader is forced to jump in and immediately believe the alien concepts of life forms in the far distant future without a \\"glossary of terms\\" as it were that enhance the reading experience from page one.

Aside from the main theme, \\"Ancient Voices\\", I'd also recommend \\"Tribal Council\\", a track that relives the castaways writing their votes, until the extinguishing of fire for the unfortunate member voted off the island.The rest of the tracks leaves you imagining scenes from the reward and immunity challenges-- the drama, excitement, the humor, etc. This CD is filled with percussions, ethnic instruments, coupled with synthesized effects and a modern arrangement, although it's quite obvious that composer Russ Landau used many of the sounds from sound loop libraries.I'd recommend this for everyone who's a big fan of the show and soundtrack music affecionados. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"vote it off the island","review":"Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins.

There wasn't really any continuity in the plot. There didn't seem to be any reason for Russo to come to his conclusions about Cate. The reason for Cate's behavior was never really explored; the killer was an odd choice and finally the death of a peripheral character was not consistent--there would have been fingerprints of both women in the room. That was a back story that wasn't developed. This book could have used some editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't want to read this","review":"Even if you are a die-hard Scottoline fan, you don't want to read this book. It is by far one of the worst, maybe THE worst thing I have ever read. Nothing about it is believable and is so full of holes.

Aren't we surrounded by enough advertisements in our daily lives? How could she concentrate on writing a good story when she's thinking about where to best place the next product? Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"This book was so-so, no big thriller. It seemed in-complete to me. I think she forgot to fill in a couple of the blanks. I won't go any further, read it for yourself but wait for the paperback. This book was very disappointing, not well thought out and half done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Blond","review":"This story line was tough to swallow.

The ending - although a surprise - came at you way too fast - and rather like someone who said \\"okay I think I'll choose so and so as the culprit.\\" The romance aspect had teenager written all over it - both with Cate and her friend. And the overall end - give me a break - that doesn't happen in \\"real\\" life. There really was no \\"mystery\\" in the real sense - you felt the murder was just a secondary consideration.What a waste of time! I could have used the time I wasted on reading the book to do something really productive - like watch my grass grow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New character, familiar plot with a twist","review":"Cate Fante is the newest and the youngest federal judge in the Eastern district of Pennsylvania. She is uncertain whether or not she truly wants the job. She is presiding over a case between Richard Marz and Art Simone, the producer of a famous television series. Her judgment wrecks havoc in all their lives. Cate has secrets that become front page news. It is hard to be empathetic for the judge except when she goes back home and is haunted by memories. Each engaging chapter ended with me looking for more action in the next page. I was left hanging with some storylines and characters. Overall it was an enjoyable legal thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This book was just over-the-top ridiculous.

Exactly why did the protagonist pick up anonymous, low-rent men? The vague explanation given [more brushed over], and the easy \\"I just won't do it anymore\\" solution was, to say the least, unsatisfying.The actual murderer's character was completely one-dimensional and unbelievable.I have read several of Scottoline's previous novels, but this will be my last"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Don't waste your money buying this book. The plot (??) is ludicrous -hate to give the so called story away it's so unreal.

This book eclipsed that notion. Dirty Blonde is stupid, goes nowhere, and has only 1 redeeming character (Nesbitt, a cop). The book was totally unbelievable, on any level, and had absolutely no direction. It is a shame when an otherwise decent writer becomes enamored with her 'best selling new york times author' moniker and assumes her readers will buy anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Judge with a Secret Life","review":"Dirty Blonde is a very entertaining page turner. Cate is an interesting character. She was not perfect and did have a mean streak. She was real although her insights were at times hard to believe.The story moves along very well. It also has some interesting side characters such as her friend's son Warren and the moral issue involving whether Cate should sue the Court. As other reviewers said the end was not satisfying. I admit I did not see who did it early on which may only prove I am not as sophisticated a reader. I also thought her trip to her home and the issues concerning her early life was a distraction from the story and did not add muchThis was first Scottoline book and I will read more in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Give Us a More Worthy Heroine","review":"The writing is very competent, but I had a major issue with the main character. Perhaps because I am so sick of seeing real life people in positions of power abusing their office, I have to give this book only one star. Cate Fante is a federal judge, yet when a man she picks up in a seedy bar dies under suspicious circumstances, does she come forward? No. Instead, she endangers the people around her. The other thing I took issue with was the casual way people address themselves in her private chambers: \\"Hey, girl, \\"Whatcha gonna do?\\" ad nauseam (OK, so that's Latin, but anything is better than this street-speak in halls of higher learning and judgment). I'm half way through the book and was curious to see what other readers thought. The only reason I might finish the novel is in the hope that this judge gets her just desserts, but somehow I don't think she will as the story is so contrived and manufactured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a Lisa Scottoline fan and have enjoyed all her other books, so I had looked forward to this one. I was very disappointed.The heroine, a judge, is not only incredibly dumb, but extremely uninteresting. Her behavior was to hard to believe for a woman who had the professional job as a judge. The cast of characters held no interest for me and frankly, I couldn't care less why she acted the way she did nor who committed the murder. The writing was boring, too long and a very weak ending.All of Lisa Scottoline books are usually are a fast read; not this one. This took me forever to read and when I realized it was going no where, I started skipping some pages.I do not recommend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Interesting to learn more about the Judicial system.

The book could have better been titled \\"Dumb Blonde,\\" as the heroine, a judge, is incredibly dimwitted. The psychological rationale for her behavior was too superficial to be believable. Her continued poor choices and ditsy behavior was just to hard to reconcile with a woman who was so professionally outstanding that she became one of the youngest female federal judges. Way too implausible, with a weak ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The judge","review":"What a fun book! The eponymous Dirty Blonde is Cate Fante, a new federal judge with a very hot secret. She never dreams that it will become public, but there are Hollywood types involved in her latest trial, and they think her life will make a great TV drama. After she passes judgement on the lawsuit, the plaintiff and defendant each wind up dead. There are other interesting characters in the guise of Cate's best friend, a former lawyer now struggling to do right by her little autistic son, and Cate has a secretary with the proverbial heart of gold, and two bright but colorfully immature law clerks. One of the other judges has it in for Cate, as does a city cop, and soon her idyllic life appears to be permanently in the trash can. Author Scottoline is a competent writer who spins out a lively, often humorous story that won't win awards, but does entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy to hold heavier gear","review":"I bought this stand a few years ago and I rarely use it.

The bottle with the blue lid, and the one with the white lid, are my favorites.Customer service at the Nalgene company was also very user-friendly in actually measuring the bottles for me so I could get a more accurate idea of their size. Well pleased, I would order again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, and not loose like the cheap channel locks","review":"The one complaint I've always had about channel lock pliers is that they are loose, and don't generally feel \\"accurate.\\" The push button seems to free up a lot of that slop that they typically have. They do go just as wide as a standard pair of channel lock pliers.The grip is about on par with a decent set of channel lock pliers.Overall, the cost isn't much more than a set of the cheap made in china basic model. And these of course come with a lifetime warranty! A great buy in my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pliers","review":"So far, I've had good use out of these pliers. They're solidly-built, which is an obvious and absolute must for hand tools. The only non-metal part of the pliers appears to be the grips, which is another good sign--plastic usually falls apart nearly instantly. The adjustibility is controlled by an easy-to-use button and the design is simple enough that you couldn't possibly get it wrong. Of course, this is probably the element that'll eventually break, but there's no telling how long it'll last. So far, it seems like these pliers will be with me for the rest of my days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secure Grip and No Pinching","review":"The Irwin Vise-Grip incorporates a clever push-button lock to secure the grip you need for any job to be done.

The shape of the jaw made it quicker and easier just grab onto something. Very comfortable grip too.Dunno what these things arer intended to be used for, but they dont seem to be made for plumming or fitting or anything heavy duty. Wish they were stronger. Dunno what kind of warranty Irwin has either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to handle","review":"These pliers are great because they fit easily into my hands (and my hands are on the small side) and are easy to grip and hold onto. They are lightweight, yet very strong and grip nicely on the things I need them to grip onto. I can't tell you how many times I've used a pair of pliers that were a bit top-heavy and had them topple right out of my hands as I was using them. These pliers don't do that. The weight is evenly distributed and they grip firmly onto objects, without sliding around. The handle fits nicely into my hand and doesn't slide around, thanks to the coating on them.

I'll be buying a new hairdryer today because I am afraid I may start an electrical fire or something.

Why has my gun jammed ?","review":"Believe it or not, Bill Holmes almost got a contract to sell this gun back in the 80's, but it was dropped in favor of the H+K MP-5.

Strangely enough, this gun doesn't seem to have an ejector (or anything resembling or acting as one), nor are there any instructions for making it. That, along with the fact that there are references to diagrams that don't exist suggest that either Bill Holmes knows nothing or the stupid publisher has omitted essential material.

This DVD has two main drawbacks: The musical selection is geared much more to industrial music than to trance, house, or electronica. So the music is darker and more repetitive. That is my main complaint. If you're into the industrial sound, you'll probably be pleased with this selection. My other complaint is that the music does not always appear to be well-synched with the video. Many videos left me wondering if the band had anything to do with the visuals, or if some outside company just threw together some visuals at their own discretion. And the visuals are not really all that good.

I have played others and they are very different.

Stay away. Buy Vern Poythress' \\"Understanding Dispensationalism\\" and John MacArthur's \\"The Gospel According to Jesus\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say? This is a very bad book!","review":"I am amazed by anyone who attempts to redeem this very poor book. Vindictive, inaccurate and yes, un-scholarly! Read the reviews by Richard Mayhew in the Master's Journal and David Turner in Grace Journal (both reviews of the original edition). Honestly, there are other MUCH better and fairler reviews of dispensationalism (Poythress' for instance). You don't have to agree with dispensationalism but PLEASE let us disagree without this sort of \\"purple prose.\\" Kistler should have started from scratch rather than attempt to \\"fix\\" this really bad book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book that disects radical dispensationalism","review":"Great Job! Really made me examine my dispensationaal beliefs - has helped steer me ever closer to the covenantalists. However, Gerstner seems to want to paint all dispensationalists with the same broad brush. There is a vast difference, for example, between MacArthur and Saucy on the one hand, and Chafer, Ryrie, and Hodges on the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Thought","review":"Dr. Gerstner discribed me perfectly as a moderate Calvinist, Dispensationalist. I was challanged, I even found an old copy of OT Allis in a used Bookstore to follow up on some of Dr. Gerstner's points. The second edition is more fun than sitting in a debate listening because you can read the opposing positions carefully and analise both. Excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD, Excellent Show, Excellent Band","review":"What more can I say...these guys know how to perform, and their music is truly amazing. Take it from someone who isn't usually a fan of \\"this type of music.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel- some issues with the translation","review":"I love the Story of the Stone, and overall I enjoyed this translation (in fact I read all five volumes!!). The only things I didn't like was the use of modern english slang in some areas, and the poetry translations.Otherwise, the set is a marvelous translation of a great classic. The Story of the Stone is a novel that should be included in any true curriculum of the \\"great books\\". There are sequences that are emotionally moving and powerful.This is the most complete translation in English I am aware of."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's very good","review":"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I was very pleased with this flag! The fabric is light enough to unfurl in a breeze, yet withstood a hearty Colorado wind without problems. The colors are vibrant and didn't run when I dampened the flag before I tossed it in the dryer to remove the wrinkles before I hung it. This was a great addition to my daughter's Mardi Gras Sweet 16 party and we can continue to use it as both a flag and a wall hanging. I'm quite happy with my purchase, especially for the price! Great, fast service, too! (="},{"rating":"2","title":"Good approach to Scriabin sonatas","review":"I've heard a lot of Scriabin's sonatas performers: Hamelin, Horowitz, Szidon, Ashkenazy among others. Recently I bought Hakon Austbo playing Scriabin sonatas. I knew him from the Messiaen piano solo recordings. He plays all the Scriabin sonatas very well. I could find in every sonata what have already heard from others performers' recordings. Yes, I could. For a first approach to Scriabin sonatas is perfect. For whom, like me, wants to hear a very good playing and musical nuances, that is a good option too. That is why my 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunrise will not set tonight...","review":"Ok. It's like they knew what I've been listening to? (chilled out mood music)Absolutely what I've been waiting for! All the songs are great!I like all the remixes. GREAT JOB ON THIS EP, GUYS!!I will not compare these songs with any of their old songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunrise","review":"This is a brilliant CD. A great mix of electronic and classic vocals. We are hooked. This CD is bound for success. We highly recommend it, a must have for all music libraries."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUSE AND EFFECT IS SELLING OUT!!!","review":"What happened guys? I loved your first 3 CDs! This one has only 5 songs and they are pretty mediocre. \\"Innermost Station\\" was a great CD so I expected more this time. The music is pretty bad on this CD and there are too many remixes to remind you of that. You should not be able to produce a CD with only 5 songs and charge so damm much for it either! The good news is Camouflage's new CD \\"Sensor\\" is AWESOME so buy that instead. Iris \\"Connect\\" is also another band that sounds like Cause and Effect used to before this pathetic CD. Yes, I am sounding bitter. I hope this CD is not going to reflect your future music or else this C&A fan will also move on like most Depeche Mode fans from their last 2 albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Rehashed NFL Films Footage.","review":"I bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er Superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much. They just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the Superbowls and just highlights of the game itself. There is special features of some players like Young and Rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on ESPN years ago. Nothing new is on here just old NFL Films shows that they made for ESPN. Very disappointed. They most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"This DVD was underimpressive. It recounted the regular seasons of teams that didn't make the playoffs but not for the 49ers. The coverage for the 1981 season and playoffs was especially lackluster. The only real decent part of the DVD was the coverage of the actual superbowls. That part was in depth. Also, the cover blurb is a bit misleading in that I thought there was going to be actual game footage with announcers and everything. All it had was highlights and a narrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Drop","review":"I bought this collection expecting to see season and championship highlights of the FORTY NINERS, not other teams. None of the season highlights have been about San Francisco. The team was only included in the Super Bowl highlights, which was minimal. I am not at all impressed with a collection that should focus solely on the Forty Niners and their road to five Super Bowl victories, but barely has any actual highlights of them. I would not waste your money... you could see the same Super Bowl highlights on Hulu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money. Terrible!","review":"This is the worst compilation I have ever seen, besides the fact that the Niners won 5 Superbowls. There are more highlights of other teams than the Niners. What happens to all the Niners' highlights? You would think they would include highlights of each of their season leading up to the Superbowl.Pro: You cannot change history. The Niners went to five and won all five Superbowls.Cons: Poor picture quality (like it came from the 70's), confusing highlights back and forth of other teams, poor narrating. Just a very poor compilation without proper transition and cohesiveness.You should skip this and spend $24 and buy \\"America Game Superbowl Champions - Forty Niners\\". You will enjoy that series a lot more. Nothing but Niners highlights, superb picture quality, and narrated by ex-players themselves with their actual stories and experience with each of their Superbowl season.4ever 9ers Faithful."},{"rating":"1","title":"very misleading","review":"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about? Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD.

Ledeen presents de Tocqueville's \`Democracy in America' in a straight forward, easy to read style. If you like what you read here, go for the big time and read de Tocqueville's \`Democracy in America' and you will be the richer for it.The importance of de Tocqueville is that he presents an American character that made America great. Whether you are of the Right or the Left, you cannot help but compare those character traits with our current... well, you fill in what you will.A negative with Ledeen's work is his loss of focus by deviating to address President Clinton. I regret to say that was out of place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha ha! An Israeli neo-conman writes about the 'American Spirit'","review":"I only bought this book becaue it only cost $2.00, and I knew it would be a joke anyway. I tried to keep an open mind while reading it, but found it little more than a re-hash of Toqueville's book albeit with a neo-con spin.Ledeen by the way is widely suspected of orchestrating the 'Iraqi yellow-cake' rumor on behalf of his puppetmasters in the Israeli lobby.Not a good choice of authors for this 'unextraordinary rendition' of a timeless classic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serves the Neo-Conservative agenda of distraction","review":"Written with a sickeningly sweet naivete which only a true believing romantic could appreciate. Ledeen seems to think there is no class system in America, that regardless of wealth all Americans accept each other equally, and that anyone can run and become president. I wasn't sure which planet he lived on until a few days later, his name came up on [...] under a search for \\"neo-conservative.\\" The neo-conservative movement and the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) should be thoroughly reviewed by all voting Americans before the upcoming 2004 election.

The nifty container makes it very portable and doesn't look out of place to drink at the office. It is a great way to get more protein in your diet for whatever reason you may need it. It is a bit pricey, but it is worth it. Amazon.com is the only place I could find the vanilla flavor. I've only found the chocolate in stores and I'm not that big a fan of chocolate.

I enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view. I liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times.However, I found much of the story to be utterly predictable. From the moment I started reading, I could tell exactly how Tibby's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the \\"cool\\" kids would turn out.

It was a good sequel to the first book of the series and it was written just as well. The character development carries over from the first book and it is so good. When bad stuff happened to the characters I felt bad for them, like they were my own best friend. The book is about the second summer that the girls have the pants and it just tells all the cool stuff that they do over the summer. The stories and thew dialogue are all so intriuging and so natural. The stuff that the girls go through is stuff that I'm going through right now and it's so much easier to read and enjoy a book when you can relate to all the scenarios that the author portrays.

The writing is easy enough that a 4th or 5th grader could read it, but the themes are too mature for that age range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I found this book to be very interesting and worthwhile.This book grabbed you and did not let go of you until the very end, and I was very upset because I couldn't put it down so I finished it very fast, I was happy though because I had the second one to read which is just as good.Basically the book switches from one place to another as four best friends go their own ways during their summer vacation, some experience happiness some experience sadness, all situations that are important in someone's life and very realistic.I definately suggest this book and the second one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Ugh. I loved the first book but by the time I read the paragraph about Carmen's date with something about how she wouldn't like him ordering something \\"girly\\" seriously? I didn't think Ann Bashares was that sexist. Already putting it down. Don't need anymore preaching about gender than there already is In this world.

It gives the girls with new challenges. The book was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Summer of the Sisterhood","review":"This book is about Lena, Briget, Tibby, and Carmen's second summer with their magical pants.This summer, Lena must get over Kostos and learn to accept heartbreak.Briget goes to Philidelphia to visit her estranged grandmother and renews her love of soccer.Tibby goes to film college in Virginia and must learn to accept Bailey's death.Carmen has to get used to her mother dating and falling in love again.The Second Summer of the Sisterhood is a good book, although its very inappropriate and unrealistic. This book made me hate Kostos. He stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"THESE PANTS DO iT AGAiN!","review":"Last summer the magical jeans that belonged to Bridget Vreeland, Carmen Lowell, Lena summthin and Tibby Tomko-sumthin did their magic by being the love pants. Lena met Kostos, Tibby met Bailey(not love love, friend love), Carmen met, well, someone, and Bridget met that coach in soccer camp. It's been so long I can't even remember. But all I know is, this book is wonderful. It will make you want to read on and on and not put the book down. What happens when Lena goes back to America and Kostos stays in Greece? What happens after Bee and that hott coach seperate? What does Tibby decide to do after Bailey the next summer? And what ever happens to Carmabell?? You'll really love the books, whatever age (mostly like gurls from 11-16). But who cares, I insist!!! This book is seriously the best EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Exactly A Classic","review":"This story was good for the most part. It was dissapointing in regards to the Lena love life, and Carmen refuses to learn from her mistakes, an essential element to all human life tht Ann Brashares can't seem to comprehend very well, and Libby's character continues to annoy and seem dead and life-less. It does contain a very good Bridget story that I loved, particularly because Bridget seemed to be the only character with actual depth. Buy this if you really want to continue in the adventures, but otherwise, it's not necessary to your survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GROSS BOOK!","review":"i pretty much enjoyed this book. but i think that the series is a bit repeative. Basically, in every book at least one of the girls makeout with some guy and sometimes i think that they are doing it. I think that it is gross that the author keeps on having the characters do stuff like that. i would not recommend this book to people who are under 13 or people that arent comfortable with reading about people making out. i think that people would rather read the 1st book then the 2nd and 3rd ones. if you took out all the gross stuff in this book then it would be alright, but with it, the second summer of the sisterhood, is a very sucky book."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST BORING BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I read this book for a book report and couldn't finish it, it was sooooooooooooooo bad. I mean all it was was 4 girls who send letters. and the stupid pants it was soooo bad it was almost shreaded and then burned and then flushed down the toilet but then i realized i could give it to charity so i will. I HATE THAT BOOK. PS i started the best book and finished it in 2 days for the report and did the report in 3 days because it was so inseperable from me.the book was PRINCESS IN THE SPOTLIGHT. BY MEG CABOT. CABOT RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet taste of Now and Then","review":"I loved this book series and if you loved the first book you'll most definetly enjoy this one as well. These books give a new meaning to love and friendship, they show you that even the strongest friendships and relationships hit rocky points. In my opinion i think this series should be made into movies. It'd be like a new school version of the movie \\"Now and Then\\". I dunno about anyone else but I'd sure go and see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"~~wow!! read this!!~~","review":"After reading the first one reading the second was a must. This book really tells it like it is. You have your ups and your downs. By the time i was reading the second book i really felt like I personally knew Tibby, Lena, Carmen, and Briget. It hurt when horrible stuff happened and it felt great other times. Ann Brashares really has the reader into the book feeling emotional over what happens. The plot was exciting!! Better than the first. Lets just hope theres a third summer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"After the fantastic first appearance of this book, (The first summer of the sisterhood) this book was a bit of a letdown. The only character really interesting to read about was Bridget, and some of the action between Kostos and Lena is a little too mature for the young teen. I reccomend the first of the books, but the others are not nearly as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This","review":"This is a very well written novel for teen girls that is very in tune to what teens are actually like, not just the wishy washy nonsense about teen girls. A true winner and a great novel for any girl, young or old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful series of books","review":"I started reading the books so i would know what my teenage daughter was reading and to be able to talk to her about things she was interested in. I didn't believe i would be receiving much enjoyment out of the series. This was definitely NOT the case as i loved the books so much i couldn't put them down and read them in 5 days. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Summer of the Sisterhood","review":"This series of books is great, there are laughs, cries and lessons learned. A thoroughly enjoyable read wether you're a teen or older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was a really awesome book. I didn't like it as much as the first one though. I didn't find Tibby to be very interesting in this book or the last one. Briget was my favorite both times because I never know what is coming next with her. I really did enjoy the book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls you will love this book","review":"I read the second summer of the sisterhood by ann Brashares. This is a very good but for mature girls and youg teens. The original ideas keep you reading...This book is about 4 girls that have been best friends sience they were born.. 2 years ago they were all going sperate ways for the suumer for the very first time.And the day before they all leave they go shopping at a thrift store when carmen found a pair of pants and she went to try them on they fit her like no other, so she had the other girls try them on and they fit them all like really fit all the girls, and the girls were all different shapes and sizes... so the girls decided the pants were magic so they came up with a plan to send the pants back and forth over the summer....The only thng i wasnt to excited about was how long the book was but im not a volinteer reader.... I would highly recomed this book to anyone loves to read and love friend ship stories..I Would read this book again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After falling in love with the first book, I was anxiously awaiting the release of the second book. After waiting patiently, I was filled with zeal when I saw the second book on the shelf at the book store. I bought it and read it all through, and quite frankly, all i have to say is that this book sucks. Not only is this book unrealistic, virtually no one can relate to it or the situations that the characters find themselves embellished in. The only story which I found semi-interesting was Bridget's, since it actually had some moral values. Lena's story is so crazy. It is as if Kostos is the only reason she is alive, and that if she doesn't see him at least once a day, she'll curl up and disintegrate. The first book is the only one worth reading in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just YA!","review":"The Sisterhood was one of the best books I read last year, and the sequel is no disappointment. I've recommended these two (and given them as gifts) to people who are way past their teen years, and they love them as much as I did. Definitely read the first one first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good teen book","review":"I thought the second summer of the sisterhood was so good, but if you want to undersand it you have to read the first book. Its so funny, and it lets girls between the ages like 12-16 to learn some pretty interesting things and some cool stuff. I would recommend it to girl, and mostly girls, unless some guys like those kind of books. Ann is a great author and i hope she comes out with another book because i would say that those are the best books ive read"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Summer","review":"This novel was extremely well written and laid out. Any reader who read the first book will thoroughly enjoy the second. The girls are growing, changing, and experiencing new things that they never thought would happen to them. Readers can really relate to this book because most of the problems are typical teenage things. You feel as if you are in the book with the girls, and as if you become part of the sisterhood yourself. Reading this book was sheer excitement and it will keep you on the edge of your seat with curiosity and concern for them. You actually come to care for the characters and you know them like the back of your hand. The Second Summer of the sisterhood was a great novel andteenage girl would enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also a good book","review":"This book was also a very good one, although, at times, very depressing, make sure you remember \\"It's just a book!\\" The bond between the girls is stronger than steal, so it's a good encouragement. This book deals with Young love, sexual desires, breaking up, and death, these two books (books meaning this is the second book, the first is the sisterhood of the traveling pants) are at the top of my lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This summer was better than the first. I just love that Bridget! This one made me happy, sad, and I even cried a little more (for Lena). All teenage girls should read this book and the prior one, it totally captures every teenage girls feelings through these four girls, plus bringing in the complicated relationships you can have with your mothers at that point in life also. Ann you're awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SECOND SUMMER OF SISTERHOOD","review":"Ann Brashare has done it again! This wonderful book is about four young girls that are all connected by a pair of magic pants.Each summer the girls set out for different adventure. This book contains romance,truth,family,and death all together in a heart-warming story. I really liked this book and I hope you do to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where can I find those pants?","review":"I love the premise of the book, I think that the plot gives the author license to take the story wherever she wants. Its great how each best friend has their own story within the story - I got a little confused sometimes, though.I could relate to all of the girl's stories - Bridget really changed from the first one, and sometimes I wanted to hit Tibby for being so ignorant. But they are \\"human\\", right? It's a fantastic book and everyone should read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of two great books","review":"I don't know if I like the first one or this the best, but they both are very fun to read. I mean, you laugh, you cry, and I really don't think nudity is a problem, the book was made for young adults and 11 years should probably read books more pre-teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Summer of the Sisterhood","review":"I thought the book was great. It showed how a group of teenage girls delt with the problems many other girls face, and solved them because of their friendship. The girls are varied in personality, but they still get along and are the best of friends. The setting in the story is varied. From Washington D.C., Greece, college campus and Alabama, the story was in a number of settings that takes place in the present. The book really kept my attention and I sped through it. I would recommend this book to any girl who wants to read a good book about friendship and the lessons of life they deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel!!","review":"Readers who loved the first book will adore the next installment by Ann Brashares. It is probably necessary to have read the first book, because characters from the first one tend to bubble to the surface.Carmen: What???? Her mom is dating? Carmen can't seem to take it, because her mom acts all obsessive over this dude. She actually DARES TO BORROW THE PANTS.Lena: Falling out of love wasn't easy for Lena to do, but she hasn't seen the last of her Greek boyfriend.Tibby: Ah, film school. The movies, the weird people who work there, the cool kids, and the...Brian?!Bridget: How dare her dad not tell her about the letters from her grandmother!! In a huge fury, she impulsively sets off for her grandma's home, and learns more about her mother than her father even wanted her to know.Along with some good humor bites, this story has some tough lessons about life, as learned by the sisterhood of the traveling Pants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first, but a nice mother-daughter book","review":"As I said above, I liked the first book better but the characters became even more human in this second installment! We get to see Carmen have yet another parental crisis, Lena lighten up while dealing with her first real love, Bridget finally come to terms with her past and Tibby finally creates a movie she is proud of. Mothers and daughters really play a huge roll in this book.Once again this author is not afraid to address real teen issues. Worth a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sort of disappointed","review":"if you read the first one, you'll definitely enjoy this one. i'm recommending this book to all readers, but while you're reading don't imagine how you want it to end...you will be disappointed. all and all this was a great book although it didnt reflect how i thought it should end."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHECK OUT BALLET FRIENDS INSTEAD!!!!","review":"This book is so depressing and I agree with the first reviewer. I don't like to read depressing books for pleasure reading. The third book is just alright. I thought Carmen was extremely whiny and annoying and stuck-up about what college she should go to. I hated the parts with Tibby and her boyfriend. It was very lame. But the fourth book stunk the most. It was a disappointing last book, and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I think the series is overrated anyway, and it's been totally exploited with the dumb scrapbooks, box sets, and the average movie. Recently a friend told me about a brand new series called Ballet Friends Books and it sounds incredible!!! The site is balletfriendsbooks and it's got tons of info on the new books, plus free music, and cool stuff. It sounds like a really funny hip series, which is like a breath of fresh air!!! So if you like good books, take my advice and check it out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate","review":"I read the first book called The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and their were only 2 parts of the book that were nasty. It included hugging and nudity. I thought that maybe the 2nd book would be better, so i read it. I got 2/3 of the way into the book and then their was the nudity again. I hated the book. It is sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Summer of the Sisterhood","review":"Ages 11 and up.

Carmen is dealing with her mom dating and wearing the pants on the a date. Tibby is still getting over the loss of her friend Baliey and is going to film camp this summer. Finally, Lena lets the pants do their magic on her love life, yet again.

Overall, Silman is a good author. If you are looking for a book that cover thinking processes, then look at \\"Psychology in Chess\\" by Krogius, \\"Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors\\" (a very interesting chapter on the subject) and/or \\"Chess for Tigers\\" (also very entertaining).The use of chess psychology is important and understanding negative images is important, but this book doesn't teach you this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn the Reasons behind the Actions","review":"This is a advanced chess book for the improving player. It is beyond tactics or tricks, but dives into the positional element of the game. It deals with imbalances, Knight verses Bishop endings. It has sections dealing with weak squares and where to attack the other party. This book allows the average chess player to see the board clearer. After reading the book one will have a better understanding of the development and future of the game. You learn to read the weaknesses of the pawn structure and the defense to choose the best game plan for victory. This book improved my ratings on Yahoo. I am up to 1551 with a strong win over a 1575."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studying chess","review":"This is a good book in that it sheds light on a number of chess considerations.

The book is bloated with name dropping and his self indulging rants. I also feel sorry for his students that were used by him in his book. He shows no respect for them and appears to enjoy ripping them to shreds.Personally I will never buy another Silman book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing of Substance","review":"This book's treatment of chess is too shallow to improve anyone's chess. Indeed, the book is itself filled with misconceptions! In fact, when hearing Silman speak of the book, he said that he wanted it to be a virtual \\"My System\\" for idiots. If you really want to improve, buy a book by a GM like Nimzowitch or Keres! This book insults its reader and is pervaded with an air of patronizing contempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Can't The Students Do Anything right?","review":"It seems that Jeremy Silman's students can't do ANYTHING right. No matter what they do, it is wrong. Maybe that says something about Silman as a teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Amateurs but not Beginners","review":"This is a great book for amateurs, but true beginners should look else where. One should have a basic understanding of chess and chess terminology, even though Silman does a great job at explaining what he means.

There is a serious problem with this. It is not realistic for a person to use the things that the book suggests - you would be bogged down. A player needs to learn patterns based on some of the ideas given in this book. Silman's other books are better. This book will do little to help you improve your game."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for true amateurs","review":"i bought this book based on reading the reviews. after opening the first page & feeling like a freshman dropped mid semester into the middle of a 400 level college course, i sent it back a couple days later! I literally had no idea about most of what was being discussed. I really can't say if this is a good book or not - if you play a lot of chess & study a lot, it may very well be. If you like to dabble here & there & just want to begin to grasp some better concepts - look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEGINNERS BEWARE","review":"I bought this book as someone who was trying to expand my game from a basic, albeit beginner's level, and was immediately in WAY over my head after about 3 pages of reading. While I'm sure this is probably a wonderful book for those more experienced, do not let the title mislead you. This book is for intermediate to advanced players, not us beginners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"How to Play Poor Chess\\"","review":"One star for this book is generous.This book is written on something all intermediate chess players could write about - poor chess playing.My complaint is that the book spends too much time on instructing the reader on poor chess and not enough on proper chess playing.The reader is forced to go through in detail what thought processes (however faulty) each student is using. The reader is treated to having to do this move by move. Why? So Silman can then criticize them, their thoughts, and their moves. Sounds good doesn't it?It's not.I hated this book.And I gave it away mint.It is disappointing since Silman authoured 2 fine books: Reassess Your Chess and the corresponding Workbook. They are well worth having and are much better instructional books to help the intermediate player improve practical play."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book About Weak Players' Weak Play","review":"I own 3 books by J. Silman (Reassess Your Chess and the matching workbook in addition to this one). The Ameteur's Mind does not measure up to the other two. The book covers many of the same topics as the other two books but waters it down by having the reader go through many games played by amateurs in an attempt I suppose to help the reader identify with the faulty thought processes of these low level players.Unfortunately this does little to really focus on improving my game. The main problem I found is that too much time is spent on wading through others' mistakes that do not apply to my own game. Much of the material I found irrelevant and the book could be half as long as it is.I suggest buying the other 2 Silman books which are very good and you won't be missing anything by not having this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be your first book in strategic play and planning","review":"After giving \\"How to reassess your chess\\" such a bad review (one star) someone told me to take a look at Silman other book (Especially after he won the Chesscafe award for his latest book). And my opinion is that this is much better book for improvers. \\"The Amateur's Mind\\" is instructive (through the whole book) and gives a player (around 1500) a very good introduction in middle game strategic elements and planning.I believe I have to look at \\"How to reassess your chess\\" again, but until then I would recommend \\"The Amateur's Mind\\" as one's first book (1500-1800) in strategy and planning and for instance \\"Strategic Play\\" (1900-->) by Mark Dvoretsky as a good second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely helpful book","review":"I have many chess books, some for beginner's, some way too advanced. This book is exactly what I needed for where I was in my chess learning. I could do good openings, but get to a point where I would get \\"locked\\" in a closed, balanced position and get confused on how to proceed; every option looked dangerous and there was no clear \\"right move\\". Seeing strings of all possible chess moves, like from chess software of advanced books, didnt help me. I needed to understand the thought processes of good chess play, and reading annotated games of Silman and his students helped me think like a \\"good\\" chess player and I saw immediate improvement in my game. This is not the first chess book you should buy, but if you find yourself getting lost in the midgame this book could help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for 1300+","review":"After you stop dropping pieces in games, a book like this helps. The chess info here is also in other books but the delivery is totally new. Using amatuer's way of thinking in every game helps me with \\"how not to think\\". Simple tactics, endgame, this book and a desire to analyze should take me far. If you have time to read, you will like this book.

He particularly wanted something with a stir sick and a dispenser valve. He only likes top of the line items. I read reviews before buying this and am very pleased with the purchase. It works really well and it looks really nice with the brushed chrome matching most of his other appliances. It is substantial and takes up considerable space on a countertop. He told me he would give it a star off because he thinks it's difficult to clean. However, I told him one of the reviewers said it could be cleaned by running soapy water through it while running. So, he said I could give it a 5 and him a 4 for not being smart enough to figure out how to clean it on his own. The motor is powerful but loud and the valve to dispense the smoothies works really well. Overall, he's very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics SHP 1000 Really Performs","review":"I searched extensively in retail stores for a powerful blender with a large volume. I thought I was going to have to go the expensive professional blender route. I saw the smaller version of this blender in stores and loved the stirring stick that fits through the lid but will not reach the blades. I looked on line and sure enough I found this bigger unit. Now when I make smoothies with frozen fruit I don't have to cut the strawberries in half because it is powerful and I can stir while it's blending. This cuts my time in half and it makes more smoothies at one time. It only has a few speeds but I never knew what to do with all those speeds on a blender anyway. The dispensing nozzle is removable and can be replaced with an included cap. I do this because I prefer to pour and it's easier to clean. I just throw the whole top in the dishwasher.

It is quite nice for cleaning though, it makes it easy to run hot water through the jar and have it all just flow out.The one slight problem I've experienced is with the seal between the lid and the glass jar.

Boy was I wrong!The plot was pretty forgettable. I just finished the book today and already can't remember half of what happened in the beginning. The characters, with the exception of Cassandra, were two dimensional. The \\"romance\\" portion of the book was laughable at times (the two main characters hardly said two words to each other when the fell into each other's arms and proclaimed their love). In fact, a plot beyond \\"Downtrodden girl narrowly averts becoming a mistress\\" was pretty weak.All in all, there are much better novels to be read out there.

The author starts out by saying that you'll probably not make any money as a porn director and then says that you'll probably end up in jail making your film.You know what they say, \\"Those who can't do, teach.\\" I don't think the author was ever successful so he's down on the industry as far as making any sizable cash flow.Then his directing tips were packed into the second half of an already very thin book.

She draws us into camp, making the experience as real as if we were actually there. If I could own just one title about this experience, this book would be my choice. Clio Mathews was 28 when arrested by the Japanese military in Manila on 5 January 1941. She was placed in charge of a room of over 100 women prisoners, slept for 37 months on a hard table top crowded next to two other women, and did her best to maintain order in the crowded room. The story line describes vividly the weakness, fatigue, and memory loss that accompanied the final five months of virtual starvation from October 1944 to 3 February 1945 when the camp was finally liberated.

The modifications included adding a little bit of olive oil here and there to make the food taste better - I find that for example lentils boiled with some onion and garlic taste pretty plain, even after adding the spices suggested. Another thing I dislike about this book is that the author uses A LOT of garlic in her dishes to make up for lack of flavor, and also that she substitutes yogurt for olive oil in quite a few dishes - what a useless idea for those of us who don't even like yogurt. Finally the organization could be better.

While he does actually calculate out this expenditure, his math is flawed. He grew many other things in the garden including flowers, but yet he assigned them super/farmers market prices thus isolating the tomato as the full bearer of any uncovered costs. The same could be done for any crop in anyone's garden. He could have just as easily called it The $49 Cucumber.Aside from this one story which comes at the end of the book, the work on the whole is a must read for anyone considering taking on a large scale gardening project (particularly in the North Eastern US).

At that point I figured this book was not worth reading, not even for fun.I've been gardening in my Northern New York backyard for thirty years. I am in my sixties and sure I have aches and pains from it. That means I'm still alive. Yes, sometimes things work and sometimes they don't, but the taste of truly fresh food is what keeps me signing up every spring. I'm also driven by, the chance to be out in nature, to observe all the critters, not kill them, to breathe fresh air and get my hands in the soil.

Try as they might, they couldn't get radio or rock fans in general to care about their growth as artists. And indeed they did try; the progression that you hear on these obscure and unreleased final recordings from their more popular and mostly unintersting early recordings is astounding. Yes, different, and certainly way more involving. I would recommend this two-cd set to all fans of classic rock who wish to step outside of the limited FM box and experience something a whole lot different.

The only way to upgrade firmware or do anything that requires connecting the 2720 to a computer is via an actual PC. If you have Virtual PC, good for you. But it won't connect to the 2720. Technical Support at Garmin cannot help you, either; they are completely Mac/VPC oblivious at this point. You can scour the 'net in search of workarounds, and you will find many. But they are for older Garmin products and with Pre OS X Macs running older versions of VPC. You will find nothing that will cure the inability for a modern Mac with or without Virtual PC to connect to the 2720 via the USB connection.

Mounted on my BMW R1200 GS, it doesn't vibrate, isn't harmed by the heat (I rode from Phoenix through Vegas and up past Death Valley in July) and is bright enough to see in bright sunlight. It is also extremely easy to unhook and re-attach in my car, pickup, or in one case, a moving truck. The non-slip base they send along with it was an added bonus that I was unaware of when I made the purchase. This makes it really easy to place the system on any dashboard where it remains stable.

However, the maps for my area (San Diego) are dated and, more importantly, of poor quality. For example, new developments for which the streets have been in the Thomas Guide for two years are missing from the maps in this unit. The unit also frequently gives bad directions because of poor quality maps that do not properly distinguish side streets from collectors and arterial streets. For example, major east/west arterial streets in downtown San Diego that have synchronized traffic lights are not distinguished from side streets that have stop signs every 50 yards. Multilane suburban collector streets are frequently not distinguished from single lane side streets.

Well, that may work if the bra was able to keep it's shape when it went in to begin with. I would imagine if you were an A cup...maybe a B this MIGHT work. However, the few B's I threw in and my C's didn't fit right. The minute I put the second ball over the first they were all bent out of shape. I was also living in an apartment at the time which had a smaller washer, the ball didn't even fit between the agitator and the side of the washer so I couldn't get it in the machine.

The holes are big enough for the entire bra to come out of the ball and even if it does not come out, the cups fold over on themselves and get heavy creases pressed into them by the inner ball. Or the straps come out while the cup is caught in the ball so the bra gets pulled and stretched in the wash.

So i was so excited to try them...but alas...here's why:1. The ball opens during the washing, (the hinge is poorly constructed). So bra strap will be entangling other clothes in the washer.2. Sometimes it scratches your bra with the rough surface of the plastic on the ball.3. It says to tuck in bra straps into the inner ball...useless. It still comes out.4. Ball size too small for a 36B cup.

This one was purchased from Hat World at Patrick Henry Mall in Newport News, VA. The only thing I will do differently is I think I will use (clean!) socks to slip over the hooks in the bras as they grabbed a mesh bag I had a couple of shirts in and wound them all up.

Well, just after about 2-3 weeks of use, the balls would pop open in the washer. I tried using gentle cycle only and put only 2 balls in the machine max at a time with only 2-3 three light articles of clothing and they still popped open. I've had to constantly fish around in the machine for those little cheap plastic latches that always come off the balls during use. This is a great concept and I am mad that these balls are so cheaply made.

So I virtually wasted my money. I do not recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bra Baby not worth it if you are side D or larger","review":"Trying to use this product was a struggle when attempting to wash size 34-D or 36-D bras. D size cups are simply too big to fit snuggly around this contraption. I tried fastening D-sized cups to the BraBaby with safety pins, in an attempt to at least keep the cup shape from getting creases or crushed during the wash. Unfortunately the bra cups still came out of the wash misshapen. I then tried to re-shape the cups, smoothing out wrinkles and creases before air drying, but even after all that effort my bras were actually no more protected using this product than if I just threw them in a regular wash as is. I would suggest you don't waste your money and time on the BraBaby. Hand-washing or taking your chances in a Woolite delicates cycle would be a wiser choice for making a nice bra last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves 0 Stars...","review":"I am disappointed to see these sold on here. This is quite possibly the biggest waste of money and plastic ever. It ruined my really good bras, and to top it off, when I contacted them regarding their product, they did not even have the decency to respond at all. I now have the Tide bra bag and couldn't be happier. Try that instead. It's virtually impossible for your bra to get twisted up or come out of the bag. You can even fit two or three in at once (if you wear a smaller size, like me, haha). I have also used it to was other delicate items as well. Don't waste your time and money on the Bra Baby.

However, the Bra Baby comes easily undone in my dryer, thus defeating the purpose. I've even gone so far as to use safety pins to hold it closed, but it sometimes still comes undone. Even when it stays closed, the bra moves around inside, getting folded and causing the padding to get crushed. I've been reading reviews of the BraBall and it seems to be much better, so I'm thinking of investing in one of those... We'll see how that goes...Update: After having used the BraBall now for a number of months, I can say that it is far superior to the Bra Baby. Only problem with it is that it's slightly bigger and doesn't fit well in my small washer. But it's pretty easy to put it in open and close it inside and then it causes no problem. I would definitely recommend the BraBall over the Bra Baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Don't buy it! It doesn't hold the bra snuggly enough so it still can fold up & crease.

They were trying to make ends meet with this new product, and fending off knockoffs from Asia. It sounded like a great product, so I was excited to give it a try.Unfortunately, it's really poorly designed, as all the other reviewers have noted. The cups of my bras won't fit into the Bra Baby, and it's not like they're big--my bras are all padded underwire B cups. So when trying to put them into the outer ball, the underwire and the padded cups get all bent and messed up.The construction of the Bra Baby is also really flimsy, as others have noted. It worked fine the first time or 2, but now when I open the washing machine at the end of the cycle, the Bra Baby is not only open, but the 2 halves have come completely apart.Anyway, I'm going to try the Bra Ball now, which has so many glowing reviews.

My bras aren't that big, all either size 36B or 36C. But when I tried (just out of curiosity) to see if a 34B would fit inside, it did . . . barely. So it seems that the wires on any 36 bra are too wide, but that wires of a 34 might be okay . . . but that's a close call, too. I wish they had been more upfront about needing to wear a 34B or smaller before selling them to 36Bs like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on first use","review":"This item broke the very first time that I used it.

I had used it for a year and LOVED it. The new BraBaby box came, and it said on the box they were a new, improved version. These did NOT work. They were extremely hard to open, the holes were too big and the ball, too small, and in one wash they ruined two of my most expensive new bras! I returned them and then looked and looked for someone who was selling the original BraBaby. Finally, at Bed, Bath and Beyond, they were able to find a seller with two originals from across the country. They were worth the wait! Everyone needs to let BraBaby know that these new and improved versions are anything but, and maybe they will bring back the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable?","review":"These items are a great idea, but within a few washings the latching tabs broke in the wash.

I have since resorted to using the mesh bags, which also does a good job of keeping the straps from tangling up with the rest of the laundry load. We will stick with the bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"First, it comes with no instructions on assembling the cheaply made plastic pieces.

I kept using the product, washing bras only with towels and jeans, where it didn't seem to do any damage.

It needs to to point to the receiver on the camera so anything that obstructs the path from the remote to the sensor on the camera results in no shutter release.

Sometimes I forget about it being there until I need to be in a group shot then I am I think more thankful for that little pouch being on my camera strap than I am of the remote, LOL!

A friend of mine pointed me this way and I have to say, I'm glad he did.This little guy is also perfect for self portraits since you can't be behind the camera and focus on yourself.

The remote made it easy to light something, get out of the frame and take the shot, without having to run to the camera to press the shutter button. I've also used it for nighttime shots of the moon, and a family portrait at a reunion.

But, I was taking a class that inspite of its name and description turned out to be a self portrait class. So, I got one and have been using it very heavily for the last month with my D80. So far I have not had any problems activating the shutter, even from behind the camera(within a realistic area), or with it facing away from the camera while I was holding it in front. I like the several second delay that allows you to hide it before the photo is recorded.I do agree that Nikon should sell it with the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most fun accessory!","review":"Everybody should have one!

It must be defective right? NOOOOOO. It's that you're camera isn't in the right (shutter) release mode. Yes, that's it! The fault here lies with Nikon for not providing any clue or instruction with the ML-L3 remote. Bottom line, and please forgive the caps, just TURN THE SHUTTER RELEASE DIAL TO THE LITTLE ICON THAT LOOKS KINDA LIKE YOUR NEW REMOTE. Then try it again...see it isn't busted. Bad on Nikon for not providing ANY documentation with this unit. For those of you who own a D7000, page 80 of the owners manual is the place to go.

The remote has met all my expectations. With long exposure, night shots, it's great to just push the button on the remote and wait for the camera to finish the exposure. The remote is small and fits well in your hand.It's a must for things like fireworks. I got a bit confused, looking for BULB on my camera, but with the camera set to remote, bulb changes to TIME. One click and the shutter opens, another click and the shutter closes.Inexpensive and it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works flawlessly as directed in all Nikon documentation!","review":"Even thought the specs don't list my camera on it's support, I gambled and got it anyway for my D50. It works exactly like its predecessor and is built for the Nikon DSLRs. For the money, it's a no brainer. There are more expensive, after-market/3rd Party products available that do a little bit more, but they're huge compared to this itty-bitty thing that will essentially achieve the same result if you know what you are doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"For $15, this little remote will do exactly what it is designed to do.

Only 4 stars because I wish it could at least activate the remote mode automatically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"A great remote and well worth the price. I know it doesnt come with instructions but it is easy to figure out. I use it with my D-60. Just change the settings on the camera menu to remote.

It's smaller than I thought, which is excellent. I can keep it in my camera bag all the time without sacrificing much space. The only downside is that there is no half-press control (common to all Nikon IR remotes), so there can be a delay if camera is in auto-focus mode. However, since the D70 has no remote port or factory battery grip, this is the best I can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set up","review":"Took me longer to open the box than it did to set up this remote.

Taking fireworks and sunset shots are a breeze with this gadget.There seems to be varying opinion regarding the ease of use of this product and I think I've figured out that it completely depends on your camera model. My D80 allows me to select the remote for use with just a couple button presses on the camera body and doesn't require me to root around through any menus on the LCD, so I find it very easy to use.

Great for including yourself in family or scenic photos without having to outrun the self-timer. It also ensures that you will not shake the camera pressing the shutter release in longer exposures.That said, setting up your camera to receive the remote's signal is not intuitive (at least, not for me). Compounding that, no instructions are included with the product. I first thought the controller was broken.Compounding that, there are instructions buried in my D80's manual, but they are simply not found with a logical search of either the table of contents or the index. After an email to Nikon (and a strong recommendation to throw in an instruction sheet), everything is fine.With that caveat, buy this product.

While doing landscape photography, I often find myself using a small aperature (for maximum depth-of-field), polarizers and graduated neutral density filters; all of these block out some light. With such low amounts of light entering the camera, my shutter speeds tend to be rather long and susceptible to being blurred simply by pressing the on-camera shutter release. The ML-L3 remote allows me to open the shutter without introducing any camera shake and that alone is makes it worth every penny.The low price contributes to making the ML-L3 remote a no-brainer.

It functioned very well and I didn't have any major problems with it. While shooting outdoors there were occasional instances of the camera not receiving the signal. It works awesome indoors where the signal can bounce off of walls (if you're in a situation where you want to trip two or more cameras).I have used this while interviewing people. I often am required to submit photos of the subject during the interview and a lot of people find it awkward to talk to you candidly while you are pointing a camera at them.

I can set up the pod, step away and just hit the button. It also helps with taking family(group)pics. No more setting the timer then sprinting over to the group and taking my place just in time.

I would like to try the Amazon model this year and compare both units. I have a plan to use a small telescopic inspection mirror (not in camera field of view)indoors and outdoors to test the use of the remote behind the camera on a tripod. I believe bouncing the beam will work. I will try to update the post after further testing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This product is ESSENTIAL if you take lots of self-portraits. It eliminates having to set the self-timer, and then getting into the shot, and then -- for taking multiple shots, having to repeat this process and ruining the flow of things.

Actually, I would rather fault Amazon on this, as if you scroll along the \\"People who bought this item also bought...\\" for the D3100 you will find the ML-L3. Misleading I would say, as I am not the first to suffer under the confusion. The ML-L3 also gets one star for failing to include instructions in the box. Granted the \\"Technical Details\\" doesn't list the D3100, but I ASSUMED (bad, bad!!) that the D3100 was an upgrade over the D3000 and that equipment for one would be compatible with the other.

This didn't light up for me and I thought that either the remote was broken out of the box or else the battery was dead. Nope. I had to come look at the reviews and discussion groups on Amazon to figure out how to work this remote.

I found that with my D80 the remote feature would reset if not used after about 1 minute. It was useless for what I needed it to do. But if you're just looking to sit right in front of your camera and use it, then it would be fine I guess. Just not for what I needed it to do, and I have read mixed reviews regarding distance. i felt it was worth a try, but worth more to return it. Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and limited","review":"Unfortunately, I paid more for what it's going for now, so I'm already annoyed.Firstly, It doesn't state anywhere what its limitations are, which have been thoroughly described in the other reviews.

Plus you can take repeat shots of the group image (with yourself in it) without having to run back and forth re-setting the timer.

I bought it to be able to use blub mode without having to hold the shutter release button. Works perfectly for that. On my Nikon D70s, depending on your camera settings, it will autofocus, release the shutter immediately or after a delay, and even activate the af assist lamp.The big, but only, disappointment is the terrible range. I have to be in front of the camera, preferably on it's left side, and less than about 4 feet away for this to work reliably. I can imaging someone wanting to take remotely triggered self portraits or group shots with this on a tripod. Not ideal for that stuff at all. This of course is likely camera dependent, but I wouldn't imagine it varies too significantly.At the low price and for all that it can do, I certainly recommend this for close range remote triggering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gadget!","review":"I purchased this Wireless Remote to use along with my Nikon D-90.

Not sure if this was just a \\"bad batch\\" or what....I had read some good reviews, so I felt confident the product would work well. Bummer! I will say that I was willing to try for another replacement (3rd time's the charm), but Amazon (unsolicited, by the way) recommended I try another seller, and said they would look into the problem so that other customers wouldn't have the same issue.

With this thing, I don't always have to be the one stuck behind the camera. I've bought two of these. My first one broke just recently because I dropped it a lot. It's a great product that not only lets the photographer join in the picture, but it also helps you get sharp photos. When you use the remote, you don't press the shutter, so you shake the camera less and the photos are sharper. It's also cheap!

I mostly take night shots (long exposures) using a tripod and the slightest movement will blur my picture. when i push down the shutter button, that would shake my tripod (not a very expensive one) and i would have blurry pictures. Now, i have the ml-l3 and i cannot live without. It is a must have for any pro-photographer, as well as amateurs. And you can't beat the price either. My advice: Just Get It! P.S.

With the camera set properly for remote control, the unit makes the camera fire only 50% of the time. It will not work behind the camera (for macro work) that is why Nikon added a cable release on the new D70s. I am told the following remotes will work on the D70. You can find them here at: [...]. I have not tried them myself but have it on reliable information that they preform better than the ML-L3.A person does not have much of a choice when it comes to buying a remote for the D70 and for the life of me I cannot understand why Nikon would sell such a cheap and disappointing piece of junk.

It is 640x480, as opposed to older models, such as the Dell Axim X30 (which I also own), which is 240x320. This makes a huge difference, not only for displaying photos, but also for surfing the web and writing notes. My X30 would crash when displaying the front page of the New York Times. Not so for the X51v (perhaps that is a difference between Windows Mobile 4 and 5). Writing notes free-hand was a bit crude on the X30. Not so for the X51v. Most of all, Photos are impressively richer and more detailed. Before my pictures were serviceable; now my photos look gorgeous, a feast for the eyes.I know of no other handheld device with a screen that has a resolution this high, not even the Palm LifeDrive (which is 320x480). One day, screens larger than 3.5 inches will have pixels this fine. When they do, it will be amazing. This handheld is worth it for the screen alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaws mar otherwise nice device","review":"I really like this pda, but due to some irritating design flaws, I can't recommend it.

I've had Palm pda's for years and never had this issue. Also, Dell (apparently) wants a monopoly on all it's parts, so you can't even purchase an extra stylus in an office supply store.

The author pokes fun, from time to time, at George Harrison's seriousness regarding gurus and spirituality, but always with affection. The detail and insights are terrific. Too many authors take the subject of the Beatles overly seriously, and such is not the case here. Mr. Huntley manages to shine light on much about George and his music, and for once I came away with some really wonderful tidbits about my favorite Beatle. Your collection is truly incomplete without this gem. Can't wait for Mr. Huntley's next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"George is God; eveyone else sucks (especially the Beatles Clapton & the Stones)","review":"This is not a professional publication; it's someone's personal essay.

The author has a deft hand for rendering everyday life interesting and a knack for scenic description and colorful detail without flowery or effusive language. I was very drawn to the characters: found them easy to relate to because they were not overly outrageous or bizarre but just (for the most part) normal people rolling with some odd twists and turns.

I also highly recommend \\"Crossroads\\" to any one familiar with Seattle and Washington State, as it is fun to imagine following the main character as he navigates the streets of Seattle and the scenery of the state."},{"rating":"2","title":"A high quality read","review":"The characters in this book aren't extraordinary people. However, Mr. Arnold connects them with the reader very well with entertaining and informative back stories. You can't help but root for Taylor to solve the mystery.

An excellent first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More research and less supposition needed.","review":"The infamy of Ivan The Terrible has lasted for centuries but if you are looking for insight into this tyrant's reign of terror I would suggest you look elsewhere. The author generally replaces supposition for research and this becomes a boring collection of Ivan's deprivations, without a solid historical context. Yes, the man was a horrific figure, but without a better sense of time and place, there is no understanding of the man and what motivated him. I gleaned more information from the book's chronology then I did from the text. A failure as a biography, but could be used as the basis for a horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"What a beatifully written and even more beautifully illustrated book!!

It is one single piece which makes cleaning an absolute delight. It is sleek, not bulky, you cannot even tell there's a booster seat in the chair. My son loves it, even though he is just 18 months, he fits well in it and doesn't fall out despite the lack of straps. I have thought about just going to Joannes to get something to make straps out of, but so far its working out just fine. My son actually has so much fun sitting in it that he always wants me to take it off the chair so he can play with it. My only semi quandry, is what's the deal with the clasp? I eventually sort of figured it out, but there are no instructions so I'm not sure If I did it correctly. I only used the clasp thing and not the extra ring at the top. But it's secure to the chair so i'm not complaining. I love this product, another great thing from Baby Bjorn. They rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"I really like this booster seat and so does my son. It was always a battle to get him to sit in his old seat but not with this one.

More expensive, but surprise of surprises, it has not failed me yet!It has worked each and every time I've needed it.Proof positive yet again, if you spend a lot of money on your camera and lenses, why skimp on the small accessories.I would highly reccommend this cable release to everyone who wants a dependable accessory for their Nikon camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better rubber covering","review":"I've owned 2-3 of these cable releases. They work fine...but the rubber cable cover on the camera end weakens with usage, causing the cable to bend and exposing the wires. Once that happens, the cable can misfire just by moving the camera. This release needs a stronger rubber covering on the end that attaches to the camera. Other photographers have also complained about the same defect."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for macro work","review":"I purchased this release for macro work and its made a HUGE difference in my photography. Its also reduced my dependence on Nikon VR lenses so I can start taking advantage of some more affordable third party glass that doesn't have an image stabilization feature.

It works as advertised. It is just a simple shutter button. It requires no batteries (one less thing to worry about). It has a lock for the bulb setting, which is essential for longer exposure shots. I am generally right next to the camera when I am shooting so the 31.5 inches of cable wasn't an issue for me.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who shoots long exposures or anything where camera shake can be an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Cable release that works well.","review":"I was looking for a basic cable release rather than one that replicates many of the features that Pro Nikon DSLR's already have.

I do a lot of close-up and long exposure work, so I consider a shutter release very important. I tried to get by on the cheap with a $10 third party substitute for the Nikon MC30, but it fell apart after only a couple of days of light shooting. So, with gritted teeth, I parted with $60 for this model. It is heavy duty, with a solid feel and sure action. This baby is the way to go if you need one. Is it actually worth the cost? For $60 there really should be more to it, like an interval timer or LED flashlight. However, it is a simple, heavy duty mechanical swith, no batteries required, that should last a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparent Nikon Knock-off","review":"I have used an MC-30 almost every day for 2 yrs. We severed the cable and had to order a new one here. This new one lasted less than 2 days before it began miss-firing. Then we saw the neck behind the nut (that affixes to the body) was cracked. Wires exposed.On comparison with my old one, it's clear they are two different products. My old good one say made in Japan. Its not a plastic connector, its a sturdy rubber-like material that can be flexed a small amount. The latest one is hard plastic and says made in China. Given any tug or torque on the cable is going to 'wrench' this joint, it's clear why the plastic cracked, and a rubber casing offers the sufficient amount of stress relief to keep the cable alive for a significantly longer period.Not too long ago the guys at fstopers dot com posted a similar review about a Nikon grip [...]. I guess Amazon doesnt care, and I didnt pay enough attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after a couple of years","review":"I've had the MC-30 for 2.5 years. It worked fine for a year or so, then the release stage (full press) started behaving erratically. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't. It got worse and worse, and now it doesn't work at all. I make thousands of photos, I know my camera well, this is clearly a quality issue with the MC-30. I spent the last couple of years in a tropical country with high humidity, at the seaside. Just to make it perfectly clear - it never came close to water, let alone be in contact. I'm talking humid atmosphere here. Think Florida. Corrosion was the commonplace for low-quality products, but I would expect an expensive Nikon piece to just work. I was in the tropics, not in Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"Very good product, does what I needed, however I wish it was few more inches longer and softer.

It does the same thing and is flawless on my D300. I do not see the purpose of paying $50 more for a piece of plastic that triggers a shutter.

It's one of my favorite novels as a child so I decided to rebuy the Kindle version.Unfortunately starting from location 202 in the Kindle version the entire novel is italicized with the exception of random words.Perhaps this is just a minor issue for most readers and most likely the publisher's fault in converting the novel into Kindle's format, but I find it frustrating to read the entire novel italicized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"After the superlative RIFTWAR SAGA, I had no idea where this book came from and the writing style was really off in comparison.What happened? Maybe Feist didn't want to write another so soon after being on contract? I don't know.Whatever the case, the writing was totally off of his usual, brilliant style and after reading this and the BUCANEER'S TALE, I came to the sad conclusion that I would no longer get the emotional resonance I had gotten from the RIFTWAR SAGA. A true pity.I think this is an okay read but I can think of some 30 to 40 fantasy novels alone that are better. George R.R.

There are both male and female submissives and bottoms discussed throughout the book, the most extreme scene involve Nana and her primary female lover (she also has a husband).

It is with cynicism and humor that he tells us about his damaging past and the bleakness of his present.

From the perspective of an adult who went through divorce at a young age, this book will help young people understand the complexities of divorce and help them cope.Whether you are a teen going through the upheaval of divorce in your own life, or you have friends whose parents are divorcing, this book is a must read.

This was one reason I wanted to join the military and specifically the Navy. As soon as I got out of High School I joined the Navy and was able to visit the Memorial to Taffy 3. When I found this book I couldn't get it fast enough. I devoured it and I cried over it at the sacrifice of the sailors that came before me. This is an INCREDIBLE account of an EXTRAORDINARY victory of the US Navy. I can't recommend this book strongly enough, you will fill with pride for our Navy's victory and you will mourn for the terrible losses of these brave sailors and their ships. I can only hope that this book is made into a movie so it will reach the masses and our country will come to understand what this battle meant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Naval battle book","review":"This is truly a wonderful and sad book at the same time.

All I ever heard and read in high school about WWII and the naval battles against the Japanese Navy in the Pacific is that the United States won the war! This book capably presents the truth that it was never quite a certainty as the battles unfolded. It is a wonderful thing to have a talented writer and researcher as Hornfischer dedicate his extraordinary talent in presenting this excellent well written definitive history of the US and Japanese naval battles near the Phillipines in October of 1944.

Hornfischer has a wonderful ability to cover the big picture while having a fine eye for details and individual stories. Though far less well-known than Midway, the Battle of Samar was arguably the US Navy's most gallant action in WWII. Perhaps it has been glossed over because that otherwise excellent leader, Bull Halsey, got sucked out of position, making the sacrifice necessary. If you are interested in that conflict, in military/navel history, or in American heroism, you won't want to miss this well-written book. We still have such men defending the Republic out on the far flung battle lines, but it's an open question if we have enough of them to face down a crisis of WWII magnitude.

The author claims the Gambier Bay was \\"the only aircraft carrier ever sunk by enemy naval gunfire\\" (a Google search for Glorious and Scharnhorst will readily provide evidence to the contrary). The author indicates the American escorts made 4 or more torpedo strikes on the Japanese vessels when in fact only one torpedo hit was achieved, and the statements concerning gunnery seem similarly exaggerated.

When DDs Johnston and Hoel and DDE Roberts turn to attack battleships and cruisers (the Roberts' displacement was roughly that of one of Yamato's turrets), it makes for compelling reading. History readers will quickly relate Taffy 3 as a naval parallel to the First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry on July 2 at Gettysburg (see: Richard Moe's \\"The Last Full Measure: The Life and Death of the First Minnesota\\") -- Sacrifice of the few for the preservation of the whole. Hornfischer departs from the action to paint a portrait of the who and why early in the book, and suggest some honor and fault at the end (e.g., \\"Hall-ass\\" Halsey taking Ozawa's bait?) The book is sufficient in detail but not overburdened - it's a good and fast read.

The background is well set so that the reader is drawn into the milieu of the era in which the battle takes place and provides the politics of command. I rate this read 5 stars.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best WW2 Pacific War Account. Ever.","review":"I have devoured Pacific War accounts for years. This is hands-down the best. The Battle Off Samar is one of those encounters that read like fiction - in fact, were it a novel or movie it would be nearly unbelievable. Utterly outnumbered, outgunned, cornered, and left high and dry by the rest of the US Navy, a small group of escort carriers and destroyer escorts not only held off the Japanese Navy, they won the most unlikely victory since the British defeated the Spanish Armada. Riveting from the first word to the last, this is a fantastic account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Story of WWII in the Pacific","review":"This book really tells me about the value of good intelligence during a military operation.

Unable to outrun the Japanese fleet, the U.S. sailors attacked with such ferocity that the Japanese believed they were being attacked by a much more powerful fleet. Hornfischer's account is a graphic account of the horrors of war, and a stirring tribute to the sailors who put themselves in harm's way. Especially impressive is Hornfischer's list of sources he used in writing \\"Tin Can Sailors\\" - this list includes everything from military films from the WWII era to interviews with the survivors of the engagement. \\"Tin Can Sailors\\" is a stirring account of heroism and honor amidst the insanity of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Greatest Tradition of American War Literature","review":"I picked up \\"Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors\\" warily, wondering what more could possibly be said about American valor in World War II after 60 years of nonstop books.

Thank you, Mr. Hornfischer, for restoring these forgotten warriors to their rightful place in our national legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"FReview from an Tin Can Sailor","review":"While there are several small technical errors pointed out by other reviewers, the book is an excellent look at the battle and the sailors who fought their ships against overwhelming odds. Having served in Destroyers (USS Berkeley DDG15 and USS Henderson DD785) I can attest to the personal feeling of belonging to one of these small, but mighty fighters. Author Hornfischer takes us from the manning up of these ships in the United States, through the little known battle off Samar, all the way to the reunions decades later. The narrative takes the reader through the personal side of Tin Cans and their crews. The actions of these ships had much greater impact than their size would indicate.

As World War II and its almost unimaginable challenges and human losses recede futher into the past, books like this should be read by as many people as possible. The circumstances and details of the battle described by Hornfischer are mind boggling. It is so hard to believe that humans can endure and triumph under circumstances like those he so expertly describes.

From the very beginning, it was clear that the photography was going to be clunky and amateurish, and it was. The sound was OK, and fortunately the subtitles were very good. The story was of the rambling variety - I could have gladly edited out 20 minutes of the film. To its credit, the DVD has a Making Of Commentary, which helps pinpoint the beautiful region of Spain where the film was shot.The main story was interesting enough - and the 13 year old boy, Pablo, was a sympathetic character. The tension created between him and Paco, \\"the stranger with a past\\" was quite interesting, but the film's climax bordered on the ludicrous.This film would have been a success on Argentinian or Mexican television, but I can't recommend it here.

People shouldn't expect Liz to be doing the same type of music she did when she did Exile In Guyville. Somebody's Miracle is the type of CD I can see her making at this stage. For those who say her voice isn't suited for this stuff, it does have a way of surging on choruses. Plus, she differentiates herself vocally from the crowd. I don't care what other reviewers say - I loved this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOORRRRING...","review":"this is one of the most horrible albums that i own. i wish i had never bought it. i only bought it to see which direction liz phair would go with this album, after the fall of her last self-titled album. the only songs i like are \\"leap of innocence\\", \\"somebody's miracle\\", \\"everything to me\\", and \\"everything (between us)\\", the last song i mentioned happens to be the best one on the entire cd. liz has lost all the creativity in her writings and if i didn't know any better, i'd say her 7 (possibly 8) year old son was doing the writing. if you have been a long time fan of hers, like myself, but own all her albums except this one, then don't waste your money buying it. it's a complete disappointment and after hearing it, i've finally lost all hope in her as an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's everything to me","review":"This album is completely charming.Liz sort of mixes her styles from previous albums Whitechocolatespaceegg and Liz Phair to create this increadible cd.

So you might want to wait to pick up a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I've been a fan of Liz Phair since her \\"Exile in Guyville\\" days, and even though a lot of critics slammed her last album for being too \\"poppy,\\" I really liked it. \\"Liz Phair\\" was a much better album than \\"Somebody's Miracle\\" because it had continuity. Even though there are some good songs on the new CD, the album contains a mixture of old-school sounding Liz tracks, such as \\"Why I Lie\\" and \\"Got My Own Thing,\\" and mindless pop melodies like \\"Stars and Planets\\" that are almost painful to listen to. Overall, I think \\"Got My Own Thing\\" is my favorite song on this CD. There are a few other notable tracks, but this album left me feeling very disappointed. Hopefully Liz will do better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern day production ruins potential","review":"The production on this album, like her last, is so antiseptic and highly glossed that it removes any impact or true emotion that the music may have originally had in its preproduction state. Only on a handful of slower acoustic tracks does some of Phair's talent and genuineness come through. Listening to Exile in Guyville (my favorite album for about a year when I first bought it and one of the best records of the nineties) then this is a shock. It is really sad how you can get from there to here. Ironically, I think one of the reasons her last two efforts have been so bad, fared so poorly, and been so ill-received is because of the betrayal of raw, emotional music (irrespective of the subject matter) in favor of overproduced prepackaged fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we need another middle-of-the-road pop album?","review":"Let me start by saying that I loved Liz' work in the 90's, and I also appreciated the last album. While it was dangerously close to fluff at times, the lyrics still had a dangerous edge. Part of my enjoyment of her music comes from hoping for the \\"did she really say that\\" moments of \\"guysville\\". You have to admit, she doesn't have the strongest voice, and her attempts at melody seemed forced at times. Still, I liked that she was dealing with racy subjects in a fairly adult fashion.On this latest album, I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Do we need more pale songs about domesticity and yearning, especially when the voice delivering them is so thin? On \\"guysville\\", the music was ragged and raw, and you always wondered if it was going to fall apart, the way you did on early Replacements albums. Here, it's precise to a fault. If I wanted polish and blandness, I'd buy a Celine Dion album. Come on, Liz, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closer To Nothing","review":"I saw someone asking about the song \\"Can't Get Out of What I'm Into\\" not being on the album. They cut it out because Wal-Mart said they wouldn't put it on there shelfs. And we all know that wouldn't be good. She blamed the fact that her last album was a bomb because Wal-Mart didn't carry it (not even the edited cut) and forced her to go on tour playing as she referred to as 'Armpit cities like Memphis, Dallas, Kansas City.' Oh, poor thing! On the bright-side she'll always have her multimillionaire daddy to buy her a six and a half million dollar beach home in California. The song \\"Closer to You\\" is the replacement for \\"Can't Get Out of What I'm Into.\\" And that's good because it's extremely plain and sounds like everything else on the extremely flat album. On her new take of \\"Can't Get Out of What I'm Into\\" she says, 'Two more years and I'll go back to school.' That might not be such a bad idea. I'm sure you could learn some music theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"What happened to the brilliantly talented artist who created masterpieces such as Girly Sound, Exile in Guiville, and Whipsmart?What happened to the artist who created the inconsistent but very solid album, whitechocolatespaceegg?

There's only one explanation that I can think of for this mess. Alien abduction. This is not the real Liz.

I wasn't thrilled about her self-titled album but there were a few decent songs and, of course, her trademark smattering of the f-word. \\"Somebody's Miracle,\\" however, was a huge disappointment. It's never been about her voice because, while I like listening to her, it's really not that great. It was more about getting her point across--bluntly. Having to rely on her original lyrics, she really missed the mark on this one. I knew that the album was probably not going to be that great and it doesn't even carry a \\"parental advisory\\" warning, but I didn't expect such syrupy, yucky lyrics. I will remain a Liz fan because I know what she's capable of but her evolution isn't working for me. I think by going mainstream she gained a lot of fans on one side and lost a lot on the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Liz Phair go?","review":"I cannot tell you how shocked I am so listen to Liz Phair's new cd. Is this what she is trying to do, shocking us by taking this direction? \\"Why I lie,\\" and \\"Got my own thing\\" are the only two songs that sound like a Liz song. I can actually listen to this cd with my kids in the room. Not to say that is bad, but after listening to Disney Princess 1000 times, I need something different.....not with this cd. Very Very Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the time to read this review","review":"I don't like her new album -at all-, it sounds nothing at all like the self-titled album. I can't even see fans of the material before the self titled album liking it at all though either, it's just such utterly pedestrian 'alternative rock'. Liz should just get the Matrix to help write all her songs because those are the good ones. Not meaning to hate, I saw her last year and it was a GREAT time but this new album left me warily disappointed. Where's the distortion? Where's the pop? What a surprisingly dull and pointless release. Liz Phair sounds as flat and lifeless as a Sheryl Crow record. I'm sorry I bought this - It was a chore in of itself to listen to it all the way through the first time I heard it, not quite the reaction I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Same Liz","review":"I get bemused when critics write that Liz Phair has sold out or gone soft. The poor woman apparently isn't allowed to grow up or mature. Some writers and fans want her to eternally remain their caricature of the twentysomething alt-rock sex object. Well, if you are willing to meet \\"Somebody's Miracle\\" halfway you will find its the same old Liz of her earlier great albums, with more experience and wisdom. There's the same witty, self-deprecating lyrics in songs like \\"Lazy Dreamer\\" and \\"Why I Lie.\\" There's the same hard-rocking, off-kilter melodies and rhythms, albeit with a touch more production. And there's Liz's endearingly rough vocals, which always crawl inside my head and stay there. Even if this record was as misguided as its detractors say it is (which it isn't by a long shot), a Liz Phair record is a rare event and always an occasion for celebration. And when she sings, \\"I'm praying for it\\", I, for one, believe her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fab one from Liz!","review":"If you loved whitechocolatespaceegg and Liz Phair, you'll love this one too, listen to \\"Everything to Me\\" and \\"Got My Own Thing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"WITHIN EVERY FROG LIES A PRINCESS","review":"I went every inch into this album as a skeptic. I love the early Liz as well as the self titled liz, and this album hit me like a curve ball at first. I questioned whether it was too slow or too mundane. But then one song after another started jumping out at me. The opener, Leap of Innocence, is sung just enough out of key to make it stick. And Somebody's Miracle is such a bittersweet love song. Table for One rocks and is completely haunting. Liz is still at the forefront of female artists out there at this time and I do hope people give this album a shot. It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"an artist lost","review":"Liz Phair not that long ago was a Artist who was challenging Herself&seemed that though she wasn' getting Her full due she was at least making some interesting music. the Material here is very middle of the road.nothing stands out on this Disc.Vocally she is just kinda there.another one of these Records&it could be lights out on her Career as if that isn't already being Proclaimed by some folks already??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's 'I Can't Get Out of What I'm Into'?","review":"When I was living in Chicago, I had a 2nd generation copy of the girlysounds tape.

I got this from Amazon so because I wanted to hear then new take on \\"I Can't Get Out of What I'm Into\\", one of her most spunky and punky song. It's not on the CD. Did I get an edited version? What's the deal? Can someone the me? What I got instead is a CD with a bunch of flat sounding songs with not one lick of spunk or punk. What's the deal?

At least when she was an indie chick she had the word \\"alternative\\" to excuse her from needing to sound any good.

I do not like the last two Liz Phair albums nor was I a big fan of whitechocolatespaceegg, but at least the latter album had SOME rocking numbers on it. Don't expect to hear anything on this album like 6'1\\" or May Queen. 0 stars for giving us \\"Can't get Out of What I'm Into\\" then taking it away!

He has good detail and it reads true. I really enjoyed the character. As I read this book it measured up to the best of Lamour. It was inviting story that went somewhere. The flavor of the book reminded me of the early Lamour books and Lamour's Last of the Breed, which was my favorite Lamour book. I liked it better than Johnstone books.

If you like Louis L'amour's books then you will love Brules. He is the man that we all wish we could have been, in the time of history when survival of the fittest was the way of the land. This was a hard time that demanded hard men to tame the \\"wild west\\". What they got in Brules was one of the harderst and most dangerous men(when rialed) they could have imagined.

This recording is beautiful. It is inspired; it reeks of sincerity and accomplishment yet it seems to fall so naturally under Ms Devlin's hands.I love the subtle and not so subtle complexities of Vodou rhythms of which I've heard fragments in discs portraying the sacred nature of the Vodou drum through to Maya Deren's film. I've yearned for a recording like this: one that displays both Arada rites with the Pedro. At last it's here.

I assume it was the original recording at fault, you know how it was back then...in the fog. The tracks that are of high fidelity are terrific but the inconsistency is dissapointing.

Of course, they reveal information, which in a more guided manner will be omitted.

Before this book, I had never even heard of differentiated instruction and had never been exposed to it. This particular work of Tomlinson's is especially helpful in today's classrooms as more and more we see special education students being included or mainstreamed (inclusion and mainstreaming are not the same thing) into the general education environment (though it would also be especially helpful to special education teachers).

It is a believable read. To a person that has never had problems with CPS, it might appear this book is exaggerating in some instances. However, fighting the system myself, I see no exaggeration. I think every parent should read this book to be aware of the corruption within this agency.

I wanted to help her, but I was clueless, and my efforts did nothing to truely help her. This book is non-judgmental, clearly written, well organized, offers specific therapies to help overcome hoarding and specific help on how to clean up the accumulated mess and prevent relapse. It is really helpful, but the reader has to plan to take the time to actually think about and do the exercises. It takes time, but it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended for the hoarder","review":"The reviews of this book really helped me make the final selection. The book seems to go straight for the logic of most hoarders; where as the other books are nice for those trying to help the person this one gets to the point.If someone is the enabler who is reaching out to help the hoarder, this information is not couched and can be harder for the enabler rather than the hoarder to hear. The person I gave it to laughed, read the check list, and then said instantly - oh my that is me.It definitely helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Film","review":"I had been wanting this one for years, having seen it advertised as a trailer on several other films.Patricia Neal and Shelley Winters do a great job - Winters makes me want to come unglued for her small-mindedness and self-centeredness.

I am miserably and thoroughly allergic to dust mites, pollen, mold, feathers, cigarette smoke, everything! I have taken various OTC, RX and inhalers to minimal or no effect. I did allergy shots for three years (two shots once a week) and was finally told that I would not likely improve much more. My father in law (who is a retired doctor) mentioned trying a homeopathic remedy. I am a lawyer and am very skeptical about alternative medicine. However, I did the research on the various options and settled on Allerphase. My allergies improved within twenty four hours. While everyone else around me has been coughing and sneezing their way through a Midwestern spring I am comfortable. I have just ordered a second bottle and have sung its praises to others I know suffer from allergies."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bang for the buck...","review":"I was looking for a nice, affordable red dot sight for my Sig 522 plinker. I had seen some favorable reviews for this red dot optic on some other sights, but was surprised with the range in prices listed between websites. I went with the 40mm truglo off of Amazon and have been very pleased with it. It is a lot larger than you'd think from the picture provided, which in my case is a good thing. It provides a wide sight picture allowing quick and easy target acquisition. I had it out at the range today and was able to lock in the sight in 3 groups of 3. Hard to beat this scope at this price. Am considering getting another for my AK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Camper","review":"Truglo Red-Dot 40Mm Sight is perfect for my Ruger Mark III. I have used it all summer and never had to readjust anything since initial sighting. Well over 3,000 rounds to this point. Definitely worth the money. I had lower cost sights and they just don't compare to this one. Amazon was great with the free shipping. Two days and it was on my step. They say 5-8 days but I have never waited that long ever. Good job and thanks to Truglo for a great sight at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"The parallax was horribly asymmetric with the dot becoming a line and darting off the left side with movement to the left. UP/Down and to the right was smooth and like it should be. This had nothing to do with the position adjustment. The lens caps pop open by themselves all the time. The transparent lens covers are so low quality they are not useful when down. Just didn't make the grade at all. A Leapers replacement worked out much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"very juicy!!!","review":"Wow. That was a good book! I liked it a lot. I thought it was very good.

These are the people who add color and character to the world. Betty is one of them: a young, sweet, naive kid who lost her adolescence and her hopes of just being married to the boy she was crazy about. This story is so very sad and extraordinarily riveting. Beautiful writing, just enough...following Betty and her family through the war and then along the 60 years that have followed. She has amazing guts...as much as her dear mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, could not put it down, Great story!","review":"This book is unbelievable! The author makes you feel like you are there experiencing everything.

Yes, both Betty and her husband Otto survived the concentration camps. The deep emotions of her story are still evident in her voice and face. This is a true life story about both the horrors of war and being a Jew in WWII Europe and of true love.True, this is not an ending to give away. Read Betty's story. It will rip your heart in many directions. You will not be disappointed. You will not be able to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact or Fiction?","review":"This IS a great book, no doubt. A real page-turner. But a true story? Maybe just loosley based on the truth. An inside source (yes, a friend of a friend) knew Betty Schimmel during her years in Budapest & after. This source claims Betty Schimmel never spent even a day in a concentration camp and says she spent her time at the Swiss safe house in Budapest. Kind of makes you wonder about some of the amazing coincidences in the book. Still worth reading -- but don't believe everything you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"hooked till the end","review":"To See You Again is one of those rare books that actually keeps you hooked till the very last page. An unbelievable story of love and survival against extreme circumstances in Hungary.

It grabbed you right in the beginning. A young girl growing up in the horror of the Holocaust and how that affected her whole life. I couldn't put the book down and the ending hit made me cry for hours. After finishing the book, I couldn't stop thinking about Betty and her struggle. As children, we all read Anne Frank's diary and we saw the horror of the Holocaust and how it ended a young life. In Betty's book, we see how the Holocaust changed her life forever. My main thought while reading the book was how different her life would have been had she been born at a time of peace. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD doesn't live up to magnitude of rides","review":"When I saw the list of coasters that would be featured on this DVD, I was instantly turned on. The quality however, leaves something to be desired.First problem is mastering. It's possible that I got a bad disc, but there are drop-outs on several tracks.The second is the actual POV that they use. Most of it is park-sponsored, and much of it shot on sub-par tape formats that look ugly for DVD. Switching views only works some of the time, and rides like Dueling Dragons only show you one side of the ride.The graphics follow a random standard of fonts and information included, and make the show as a whole seem like a high school video product.When will someone who really knows what they're doing shoot one of these videos?"},{"rating":"1","title":"AMERICAS GREATEST ROLLER COASTER THRILLS","review":"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FOR ITS ENJOYMENT AND TO USE AS A DEMO FOR MY COUSTEMERS.IT SAYS DTS SUROUND SOUND ARE U KIDDING IT SOUNDED LIKE STEREO SOUND WITH 1970'S MUSIC WHERE WAS THE DTS SOUND.THE BIGGEST WASTE OF $20.00 DOLLERS I HAVE EVER SPENT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"america's greatest rollercoaster thrills the ultimate scream","review":"I wish they would of stuck to the previous format, with the front seat ride feature.

Just to name a few. I would recommend buying this if you really love coasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I purchased this DVD because of it's features listed in the technical information sheet. As a Home Theater Salesman in Australia, good dts software is hard to come by, but very necessary. Non-violent, but yet exciting dts scenes that can be demonstrated to the average family are hard to find, especially ones with dramatic flucuations in dynamics etc. This DVD promised everything; dts; multi angle; interactive menus, etc. While the multi angle feature on this title is excellent for demo, the soundtrack itself is hopeless. The dominant sound is music in dts, and not rollercoaster sound effects as I had hoped. I'm hoping that if a second disc is made, there is an option to remove the music in the sound option menu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both pitchers cracked quickly","review":"I used this pitcher to make iced tea in the fridge (i.e., no boiling water).

After just one use, the handle started cracking at the top. I was making some iced tea, the tea was not even that hot and when I poured the liquid into the pitcher I heard a loud cracking noise, and noticed it starting to crack. I should have listened to the other reviewers. This pitcher is NOT heat resistant. Not for hot liquids.

I never put hot liquid in it (used for lemonade only) and don't feel I misused it. I had handwashed it only. The crack didn't leak, so I continued to use over the past month because although the crack was ugly, pitcher was not leaking. Today crack much bigger (wraps all the way around the glass handle) so I'm sure it is unusable now(handle could fall off on me causing unsafe situation). Wow, my $20 didn't get me very far. And, this is not an \\"ugly\\" pictcher, but certaily looks are nothing to write home about either. Looks just like the \\"Mr. Koolaid\\" pitcher.

It is about a courageous editor, Angie Drum, who discovers that her own son, the mayor of a Kansas cowtown, is corrupt. She chooses to expose him and his cronies, at great anguish to herself. Her moral courage and determination lie at the heart of the story.The cover depicts three armed gunmen, but do not be misled. There are no gunfights in this story. The Hollywood West does not exist in this novel. It is simply a story of a woman of great spiritual beauty wrestling with her conscience, and in the end, doing what is right, at terrible cost.I am grateful to Amazon for letting me provide an accurate description of the novel for the benefit of readers and customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry Scandinavian Wit - Nonpc and funny:)","review":"I'm a huge Scandinavian film fan.

You will Like this...","review":"This review is to discuss the DVD quality. If you're looking to have the sexy Heather Thomas in full screen beautiful color and a sharp well defined picture then you will be grossly disappointed with this joke for a DVD. The movie itself is a very entertaining little flick. With plenty of great shots of Heather in the typical 80's outfits. But the overall quality of the transfer to DVD was made from and old VHS tape that someone had laying around. Complete with your typical distorted waving pattern throughout the entire movie. Usually caused by not have the proper cables connected right. The colors are muddy and the picture is soft also typical of VHS movies. Very sad since I had hoped on having Heather at her physical peak in pristine DVD form. Unfortuantely, this studio needs the money badly and is only hoping that other Heather fans will purchase this sad representation of a mastered DVD. The movie was well worth better treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great B movie","review":"It's campy, over acted, and low budget, everything a good B movie is supposed to be!!!

I am a white guy who loves rap, I threw a lot of rap away when I got saved 8 years ago, so I have a vacuume for good rap, but the lyrics have to be edifying. T-Bone fills the void! Hard core sound, without all the cursing and all the sex talk. He proves that you CAN produce HIGH Quality Christian rap without lowering yourself to the gutter.

And T-Bone's messages just can't hold a candle to those of past hiphop legends. I'm not here to burst your bubble, maybe you normally don't listen to rap, so if you think T-Bone's the greatest, I will let you think that. So just ignore those hip hoppas who laid the foundation in the past that T-Bone is now standing upon. Yeah, they're all garbage right? None of these secular artists ever even mentioned their beliefs in their music before, huh?By the way, my favorite MC ever is Rakim, and he practically never cussed, and I'll be damned if T-Bone could ever construct as coherent and inspiring of a song as \\"The Mystery (Who Is God?).\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Bone's Best Album","review":"This is his best album.For those who like West Coast muzick then get this one.This is what I bump when I'm hittin' switches on University Ave. on weekends.I'll shut up but get this one if you don't then you're missing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ...","review":"I was really eacited to read this, but severely let down.At first it is somewhat intriguing, different, alittle edgy, strange, but quickly transitions into pretty much unreadable, really random, and not making any sense - as opposed to surreal, which was what I had interpreted from reviews, and was therefore hoping for.Bleh."},{"rating":"2","title":"a definite must read","review":"i read this book last weekend, in one sitting. once you start, you won't want to put it down. and once you do put it down, it will stay with you for a long time, different parts echoing in your head. it's an incredibly funny book, but funny with pathos, threaded with an immense sadness. it's also incredibly timely, and very politically oriented in a wacky, all-over-the-place kind of a way. as jonathan safran foer says in his blurb on the back, it's a book that can't really be described. you just have to read it. i promise you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"Not only does this look cool, but it runs really quiet and it performs a lot better than others on the market.

Any of you that have read Meg Cabot's \\"Princess Diaries\\", I assure you, its not as gross.Samantha Madison lives in Washington DC with Lucy her popular cheerleader sister and Rebecca, an annoying genius. She's in love with her sisters boyfriend and ever since the \\"celebrity drawings\\" she has to take Susan Boone's art class. To top it all off, she saved the President of the United States from an assasination attempt. Now everyone thinks shes a hero.Her life definetly changes. She is appointed teen ambassador to the UN and she meets the presidents son-David. Who also happens to be VERY cute.This is a story where Samantha, or Sam learns how to truly \\"See\\" and learns about true love. I highly recommend it. A good book for teens. Its funny and touching. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent book!","review":"Samantha is an outcast, and doesn't care. Her sister Lucy is the most popular girl in school, with a cute boyfriend, Jack, who Samantha likes. Her younger sister is a geinus. Suddenly her sister reports to her parents that shes been drawing her friends with celeberties, and they make her take art lessons. She saves the president outside of one, and everything changes for Sam.I recommend this to people who enjoyed the Princess Diarys. Just be aware that the book contains a little bit of inappropriate lanugage. I read this in 6th grade, and have read it several times since. I think this book is definitly worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great!","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the Princess diaries and I was really excited to get Meg cabot's new book. I was not dissapointed. Sam madison is just as great a character as mia, but I found it easier to relate to her insome ways. Instead of being a prinscess, sam jumps a would-be-assasin and saves the president's life. She becomes an overnight hero and everyone wants to be her friend. i thought this book was hilarious"},{"rating":"2","title":"All thumbs UP","review":"Great book Ms. Cabot is a great author. Of all the books I've ever read, her's are the livliest!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"yech","review":"To be blunt, reading this book was NOT a pleasurable experience. I felt like I was being continually whacked over the head with the Plot Exposition Shovel. I don't remember the authors I used to read as a teen like Norma Klein, Judy Blume and Paula Danziger being so blatantly moralistic and repetitive. \\"Draw what you see\\" ok, we get it; we only need it mentioned twice at most.Secondly, David seemed to act more like Sam's big brother than her love interest.Third, knowing what bands a character likes/wears does not mean you are off the hook when it comes to developing their personalities.Fourth, it seemed like Catherine (best friend) just suddenly became confident and socially adept overnight. What was up with that?Fifth, I can't see the President of the United States kowtowing to a teenage girl that easily, as he did with the choice of painting in the art contest. Doesn't he deal with tougher adversaries as leader of the free world?But I liked the book's dedication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs Up!!","review":"Samantha Madison thinks she doesn't fit into her family because she has an older sister who is the most popular girl in school and a younger sister who is a certified genius. She just been caught selling celebrity portraits at school in her German notebook which she is making a C-minus in. Now she is being forced to take art classes. She's just been appointed teen appointed teen ambassador of the UN. And...the prsidents son just might be i love with her!!The reason I like this book is because alot of the things that happen people can relate to. I also like all the conflicts that go on with her and her friends. It is an awesome book and keeps you interested in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever!","review":"All American Girl is great read for all ages. It is definitely my favourite book of all time. I'm not really that into the lovey-dovey stories but this one was a complete mix of romance, humour and it was sort of real life, though it is not very likely to happen to anyone walking down the street. When I first bought the book I read it form 9oclock at night till half one in the morning. After this I recommended it to all my mates and lent it to a mate. I bought it in January this year and lent it to mate then aswell, but she only returned it last week because she enjoyed reading it so much and she read it six times. It is a good storyline and anyone who liked the princess diaries will love this book. It will really keep you reading so I would advise you to start reading in the morning.I hope this review helps you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look else where","review":"I'll just come out and say it, this book was terrible. Unlike the Princess Diaries, which I couldn't put down, I had to force myself to read this book. After such a long wait, I fount nothing but disappointment. Cabot tries to make Sam as likeable as Mia, but it doesn't work. Sam a weak, watered down, shadow of Mia, with a lot of black clothes to fill in the blanks. Mia could be you or a best friend. Sam is definitely the type of girl you trip in the hallway at school. She's that annoying. If you were a fan of the Princess Diaries, I'd advise waiting for the fourth volume instead of wasting money on this book. If curiosity gets the best of you, just check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top Ten Reasons not to Read All American Girl","review":"10.

Too many top ten lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever!","review":"I hated this book. As someone else had said, it was a replica to the Princess Diaries. Dont read it if u hate fictional stories.....this story would never happen in real life and its wicked weird!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"Many teenagers are now reading this book. But what I want to know is what is the point of it? The main character is way too strange. Her sister is totally unbelievable, a popular girl, does NOT want to help her dorky sister look better, she just wants to stay away from her, especially in public. Second, popular girls date only popular guys and vice versa. After these few points have been made. The reason I read this book was because many others liked it. The story is so fake that is not even interesting anymore (I'm a fantasy book fan, and even fantasy books are more credible than this), I mean, how possible is it that you see the president go and buy things when he could just send somebody else to do it?! Then, the top ten reason lists that you can find throughout the book are way too annoying, at about half of the book, I just started skipping them. So, this is why I DO NOT recommend this book. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All American Girl","review":"I absolutely love this book! I think it is one of my favorites and the funniest book I have ever read in a long time. I like the fact that Meg Cabot writes in pop culture things from the present day and writes the story like you could be writing it yourself. I can't count the number of times I burst out laughing while reading this book. I highly recommend this story to anyone who enjoys any of Meg Cabot's books, or would like to just have a good laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I love reading Meg Cabot books because they are so much fun and easy to read. This is a quirky love story complete with a multitude of top 10 lists. I just loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to buy storyline&#65533;","review":"As someone who has read many YA books, I have to admit this one doesn't stand out, except maybe for the sheer outrageousness of the storyline. Samantha Madison is teenage artist living in Washington, D.C. One day while skipping her art classes her parents force her to attend she inadvertently saves the president's life. Along with her newfound celebrity comes...yup, you guessed it, a romance with the president's son. I could see most \\"twists\\" in the story from a mile away. I do like the minor plot about art however."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I had read most of the Princess Diaries books and enjoyed them when this one came out and my friends and I decided to read it. I didn't like it at all. The story was pretty boring and the main character seemed like almost the exact replica of the girl in Princess Diaries. It was too alike for me and all the characters were pretty one-sided. The writing also was not very good. The one thing that could have saved it was the two sisters in the story who made it interesting, but they couldn't make up for the rest of such a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This was such a cute little book for me because I am a preteen and know what it feels like to be like Sam. I recommend this for girls ages 9 to 15. I loved this book! Read it ! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It!","review":"This book most certainly deserves 5 stars! Samantha Madison jumps a would-be assin and manages to save the life the leader of the free world and all the while is worried about getting busted for skipping art class! Her humorous top 10 lists add a great mix to the story and her major crush on Jack, her sister's boyfriend, and her new feelings on the First Son are very realistic. The ending was great and I liked this book better than the Princess Diaries because the main character is not always whining about how her life is SO over. I definetly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"I'm not one to read that much, however this one just grabbed me. It is wonderfully written. I just love how there is mention of real-life celebrities, bands, places, artists, movies, books, and brands. For example, most books make up names for things (you know, like fictional bands), but this one mentions No Doubt, and Billy Joel. The story has a fair share of moments that make me laugh out loud. Just the little things some of the funnier characters (like her older sister) say really make you smile. By the end of the book I was dying to find out whether or Samantha's love interest, the son of the president, would accept her or not. This was a fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Books For Teen Girls","review":"Meg Cabot Does it Again!

I would not change a thing in this book. Except I wish this Samantha Madison wasn't gothic. I mean, she doesn't have to be popular, she could be like the Princess Diaries, a normal girl. That whole gothic thing freaked me out a little. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read, impressive teen book","review":"Fast-paced, satisfying read and better than a lot of books I have read lately that are for adults.This books reminds me of my teen years of a book called \\"The President's Daugher\\" (out of print..can't find it!!!).Good: pacing, you really feel like you are in Sam's head, realistic love interest/boyfriend, scene settingBad: some repetition of basic themes, references to No Doubt that will not stand the test of timeFinal: Great read, worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"MEG CABOT DELIGHTS US AGAIN!!!!","review":"The new Meg Cabot book is great!

I don't like parts of it like, all the artist talk and what her sister's BF looks like and some of the words she says but other then that I loved it! Its about this girl who saves the presidents life and the presdident's son falls in love with the main girl, Sam. She has to take art lessons that she does not want to and is always fighting the press. I can't tell you all of it so I better stop! you should read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Princess Diaries","review":"This is a fabulous book.

This book is definitely worth your time, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Blue - Out of the Past","review":"This book was not what I expected. It is a compilation of radio and TV reviews from the 1947-1951 period, and mildly interesting for those with a knowledge of the public personalities of that era.

I turned it off after 12 minutes and wished for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Annoying","review":"Slow plot. Slow to get to the main plot. Predictable. They movie was filmed from the point of view of an amateur. That was very annoying as the camera jumped all over the place and was always in the actor's faces making the movie annoying. I was very disappointed with the movie based on others reviews. I almost coudl not make it through the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to my expectations","review":"First off, the movie is filmed like its a reality show. Think Paranormal Activity. I found his very annoying. The previews all touted, from the makers of Training Day. I really liked Training Day, and this is not in Training Day's league. The story is simplistic and disjointed with an unsatisfactory ending. I hoped for more from this movie and it was consistently disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable","review":"I have absolutely no idea how this movie is rated so highly. Personally, I found the acting at times to be ridiculous. I would give specific examples (especially the ending scenes) but do not want to spoil anything for people who have not seen it.If you want the average American movie that is action driven and you want to burn a couple of mind-numbing hours, go for it. If you are looking for a compelling film with any depth at all, avoid this movie.I also found the persistent first person camera view annoying. At times it felt like the Blair Witch project with badges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless movies with never ending 1st person perspective","review":"This movie is very, very long. There is a lot of character development, but no actual story and for some reason EVERYONE in the film is recording themselves. There is a good bromance vibe and some great one-liners, but it's wasted because there is no point - have I mentioned there is no point to this movie? There is no point. There are several almost points: a rookie, a bitter old cop, human trafficking, a romance, the Mexican cartel, and a mysterious commando team who might be interesting.Don't waste your money or your time: you've always wanted to learn to play guitar, right? Work on that tonight, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I was looking forward to this movie as it kept being referred to as a Training Day like movie which I did enjoy. This is not the case with this movie. Story line is awful and how these two inept cops keep literally walking in on these major drug finds is a major flaw. Okay one I can believe but they keep finding these major drug houses literally just by walking up to them. Not a good movie, not a good story line. Skip It."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"This is the best cop movie ever! when i saw it in theater i couldnt wait for it to come out on amazon instant its my favorite movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"I gave this movie 4 stars it was very good and entertaining but could be jumpy at times. The one police officer was filming with his video camera so it looked jumpy at times.

You could see how dangerous it is to be a police officer every day never knowing what your walking into on any given day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie bad ending","review":"Great movie but the end is dissappointing. good acting and I liked the home movie feel but it was a little nauseating at times"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete story line","review":"Good movie, but the story line was incomplete.

People say its \\"real life,\\" its not, its all Hollywood! This kind of crap gets everyone killed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and profane beyond what many can tolerate","review":"This is quite a realistic portrayal of what it is like for some LA cops to patrol in drug and gang infested areas of LA. It does not paint a pretty picture of LA. It could just as easily describe \\"burned out\\" areas of any major city in the U.S. It also likely sets some records for profanity in a movie. I watched it for its reality. But there are at least a few scenes that may offend blacks. It would probably have been just as accurate to show Hispanic and white racist gangs.The cop bravado is probably very isolated for LA cops, though I am sure it exists. There is definitely a macho police element. Part of this is just a Hollywood filter on it. But it does get at the inside the culture of many city police squads that have a \\"we're going to get them before they get us mentality.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of dizzying action","review":"The point of view camerawork was a bit distracting at times but overall a very action packed, good movie. Also a bit gory at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of watch","review":"Hard to initially get into the story line but warms up after a whileSurprising ending which i did not see coming"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty but touching","review":"There is a good tension in this film between the humanity of the protagonists and the wanton urban wasteland that they must operate in. This film has something for both the guys and the gals. Highly recommended if you like gritty, cop movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"You should definitely watch this movie. It gives you a new respect for people that serve our communities. Really humanizes our public servants."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak, unpleasant","review":"First, this movie gained very little from it's POV shooting style, and it added little to their ability to tell a story.The final third of the movie really didn't make much sense. Why did the street gang go after these two regular patrol officers? What did they hope to gain? Didn't they understand the risk they would be taking? And after the two officers left the apartment where they took shelter, why did they continue to hunt down their attackers (even though they were clearly outgunned), instead of trying to hide and protect themselves until help arrived?Overall, a single typical episode of the TV series Southland is much better than this movie, giving more meaningful stories about the lives of LA police officers (with stronger characterization)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera movement causes motion sickness","review":"Too much movement on the filming.

Great acting and storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, gritty, LA cop movie","review":"This movie reminds me of the movie \\"Colors\\", only updated to present day. There is a bit of \\"Adam 12\\", \\"Colors\\", \\"Training Day\\", all mixed together and updated. Well done, and understated with the handheld camera techniqued. Keeps you glued to the screen, all the while developing the relationship between the two LAPD cops on patrol.

But this is Blair Witch meets Colors from 1987 meets someone directing and someone writing - and neither has a clue whatsoever, about anything. The dialog is weak and unbelievable in every sense of the word. The story is a joke. The actors can't decide if this is a comedy or drama, and so you are left with neither. Every scene is Blair Witch coupled with a story line and dialog that leaves you wanting to punch the writer in the face for thinking you are such an idiot. I literally couldn't stand it 20 minutes in. I took a 2 hour break then resumed the movie giving it one more chance. 20 minutes later I gave up. This is the worst movie I have seen in years.

The story built rather slowly, but it was very well done - and the climactic scene near the end was incredibly tense and heart-wrenching. There wasn't a false note throughout the film and I really recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Action","review":"Good story and lots of action. Gyllenhaal and Pena provide good performances. No deep meanings or unusual plot twists ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie...","review":"This isn't your typical crime action movie. The filming perspective is similar to the movie \\"Cloverfield\\" where the characters are doing the actual recording. Where this can be a little hard to follow at times, it does add to the overall perception of the viewer. The plot is good and the acting is good. I'm glad that I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The closest thing you'll get to a \\"ride-along\\"","review":"Wow! This is a must-see kind of movie! I have friends in blue and green, and they all say that it is as close to the real thing as a movie gets. See it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Went in unknowingly...","review":"Came out a winner. I was expecting pretty boy Gyllenhaal to pout, do a bit of the stare he does and the film would be called a day. Directed by the director of Training Day you say? Okay, we'll see if you're worthy!!! But luckily this film keeps you on your toes. Some scenes you could do without. Some don't believe the modern day cholo wouldn't film themselves doing every day to day gangbanging... Well guess what ladies and gents... Speaking from experience, I can very much say they do. So your points are invalid. Need proof? Rent and watch Snow on tha Bluff. That's even further proof that the new age is apparent for the modern day thug, let alone a gang banger. I can add my points of validity, this is gritty and very much holds truth in the modern day society of how the drug war is. Quite impressed. No Denzel this time around ladies, sorry for the disappointment...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good \\"camera\\" movie","review":"This movie is pretty well done from a writing and character standpoint. Shot decently and very watchable. It is, however, incredibly unrealistic and favorable toward the lapd. There is no \\"gray\\" in this movie only black and white and the real world doesn't work that way (obviously). But...if you disconnect from the background and focus on the story it's a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 minutes at the end of the movie is great but the rest..well","review":"I had heard about this movie and was looking forward to watching it but with the exception of the action scene near the end, this movie was a disappointment. I personally hate the type of movies that film from the perspective that it is not a movie and it is just the guys taping themselves. The camera work ruins this movie for me, terrible angles and the whole I am carrying a camera while I raid a house thing is so unrealistic it is laughable. The story could have been so much more, but the dialogue was poor as well. The plot had a lot of potential but fell far short. If you can handle the camera issues then you might rate this higher but if you dislike the self filming type of thing, then you will be disappointed as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight to being a police officer in LA","review":"Unique movie in the way it was photographed to tell the story of two police officers and the bond they developed. If the incidents are half way accurate in what LA police officers are having to deal with today, this country has real big problems ahead with the drug cartels, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is...","review":"WOW!!!

The video was atrocious. I know they were trying to get the home video effect going but it just ruined the whole movie. It was like watching a bad episode of COPS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and moving cop story","review":"If you can get past the shaky-documentary camera treatment -- which is authentic but sometimes annoying -- this is a well-done story of two beat cops in south-central L.A. whose trust and love for each other relationship fuel their effectiveness and risk-taking on the job. Jake Gyllenhaal was good but the under-rated Michael Pena gave an outstanding performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is not your average cop story, it has a very realistic, very human feel to it.

A must watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nocked it out of the park!!","review":"End of Watch was excellent movie. I liked the whole cameraesk video taping the life of a South Central LA PD officer.

I didn't care for the ending of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, bad language","review":"Overall I enjoyed this movie. Not the best cop movie I've ever seen, but good nonetheless. I must admit I'm getting rather tired of the whole \\"must drop the f bomb every 2nd word\\" mentality that movie producers seem to have nowadays. So as I said in the title....good movie, bad language.

Don't waste your time or money on this 'movie'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much. The big tag line is this is from the director (I think) of Training Day, which I think is VERY good. I love good cop dramas/action movies.

So, for ME, this was a major fail.Rent first (which I didn't...shame on me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not get past the first half hour!","review":"Terrible!Boring.Stupid.Sad to have actually spent money on this movie! BOMB. What was I thinking?

Don't spend money on it. Probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Seriously, I am a grown man and can handle plenty of crudeness, but this movie must have said the F*$% word every 2-3 seconds, it was annoying to listen to and I felt like I had spent 2 hours degrading myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated how it was filmed","review":"What bothered me most was the filming style. If I want to watch jerky home movies, I'll watch my own. Well, actually, mine are filmed better than that.For more than half the movie it was boring and nothing happened.And jumped around a lot which made following the plot difficult.It just wasn't a smooth professional looking movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"Lately I've been extremely dissatisfied with Hollywood's spin on action adventure! Keep the psychobabble and the nuance for the quirky indies. DiCaprio's J Edgar stunk out loud as did Harrelson's Ramparts! Now I have the opportunity to add another disappointment to the list, End of Watch. Could have been a riveting action/adventure flick but was ruined by all of that absurd insight to the flawed personalities/characters of it's protagonists. Lay off the character development and get on with the film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a waste","review":"This is a movie that had so much potential. It has a good line-up of stars, but the story lacked a plot. I usually LOVE movies of this genre, but this in all manner was at the bottom of the stack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"Personally I thought this was drivel, the dialogue is laughable, bad guys/girls are hams - Jake Gyllenhaal is, as usual, good, but he can't save it. Officer III (a rank just below Sergeant it seems) goes off on some anal sex rant to which the correct response would be \\"are you having mental problems?\\" and to get him back on his meds pretty quick. It takes a seriously strong stomach to handle the little speech Gyllenhaal is saddled with as the movie opens - I can paraphrase it as \\"cops are the most amazing people in the world and also a bit like Terminators\\". Yes... well... kinda clashes with the later sentiment (borrowed from Southland) that its the only way someone with no real education can earn a half decent wage. The moron who wrote this knows the world through TV and movies and, in my opinion, have never actually been out in it. Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-acted and under-written","review":"I can see what they were aiming for, but it missed the mark. Way too much meaningless and vapid backstory, a very slow start, extended scenes of pointless \\"witty\\" banter leading to nowhere, overly stereotypical cop behavior, all leading up to about 10 minutes of an actual cohesive, and somewhat interesting, story.Notwithstanding the 4 star rating here on Amazon, I think 2 stars is generous. I like a good cop show as much as the next guy, but this was a disappointment. I had to fast forward it a couple times, which is never a good sign for a movie, but at times it was that boring.If you want a good cop show, buy every season of The Shield and watch it from the start. You won't regret it. One of the best shows on television ever. Even better than the Sopranos."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"Camera work was ok but besides that this was a storyline that went nowhere.

Jumpy and to the point motion sickness ensued. Terrible. Good story ruined by cinematography of a 2 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I saw the previews for this a few months ago and thought it looked interesting. Two policemen take on the drug cartels? Cool, right?To be honest, I wish I had my 90 minutes back. I didn't feel any chemistry between the two main characters, and everyone else's character development was pretty much non-existent. Sure, the two officers told lots of jokes, but I never really cared about them. What actual investigation did they do? Why did they deserve to be killed?How about the anatomy of the hit? How was it scheduled? Its plot wasn't developed at all--just phone call, gangbangers talk, then BANG. What about the anatomy of the cartel? How did it operate? Who were its leaders?The idea that a policeman would film his life was fine, but all the \\"Look at me! I'm on camera!\\" really took time away from actually telling a story from multiple angles. Just seemed like a whole bunch of crass dialogue between two guys, neither of whom had anything to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"end of watch","review":"It was a pretty good movie considering I didn't have any expectations about it.

The actors were surprisingly good in their roles. Jake Gyllenhaal surprised me with his portrayal of an LA cop.

These are excellent actors. However, the supporting characters, which are often the best in movies, are paper thin and one-dimensional. The non-action scenes seem mostly contrived to get you to the next action scene. If you are an action junkie, and really don't care if a story has a strong narrative, rich plot development and that kind of thing, you are going to be happy. If you are expecting another Training Day with interesting characters throughout the movie, don't expect much.

The Rocker Seat takes all the strain off your back and keeps you in the garden or yard for as long as you want. The traditional garden benches are too high and you still have to 'bend' over for anything low on the ground. The rocker seat is adjustable and allows you to sit lower to the ground without strain to your lower back. It also moves with you as you lean forward and side to side. You can't go wrong with this product :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite balanced","review":"I used mine today for the first time. Sat down and promptly fell backwards onto the lawn. Fortunately, it was mostly my pride that was hurt, but it might have been my head. I expected it to rock forward but not flip over backwards that way. Something about the center of gravity isn't quite right. I had mine pulled up to the highest setting, and perhaps that's why. Even at that setting, it's still low and not easy to get back up. I think I'll get a cheap plastic lawn chair, cut the legs short, and use that. With a pair of chair arms, you can push yourself up, and a chair won't flip backwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Company stands behind their product","review":"I purchased an orginal Garden Rocker a few years back. Hey, this little seat saves much back pain and makes yard chores a bit easier. I use it when ever I may be kneeling or low to the ground. Maintaining the flower beds....I would not be with out it! If you have a green thumb, and a creaky back, be wise and make the purchase. I recomend the cusion cover, just because it is a cusioned cover....now my rear end is happy, too. Now, let me tell a story about the company, Vertex. I had a problem, I contacted them, and they did me right! They didn't make any hoops for me to jump through, at all. The only question they asked was, what is your address. I related a problem, and they responded with perfect customer service! You can bet I am happy with them. And, you can bet I'll consider the other products they offer. And, nope I do not work for them. Amazon...great company, perfect customer service; Vertex....great company, perfect customer service. Thanks Vertex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps a Gardener's Back","review":"I bought this garden seat after watching a segment on Gardening By the Yard with Paul James. I love it. It helps my back when I'm pulling weeds and planting. I even use it for other purposes, like keeping my seat dry when I'm playing in the sandbox with my son. It's adjustable and truly does rock when you move. My only complaint, and it's minor, is that sometimes, because it's so lightweight, it's a little unstable. But after some practice, you'll love it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes weeding easier","review":"I like the mobility the rocker provides as opposed to a stationary garden seat. It expands the area within reach and requires fewer repositionings than a non-rocking weeding seat. Though the seat is adjustable I think the maximum height is still a bit short for my 5'8\\" frame. Another 2 inches in height would have made this the perfect garden seat. It also takes a bit of practice before you feel completely stable on the seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"little people only","review":"I loved this seat, but it broke the second day I used it.

I Did It Again\\". Hmm... \\"Lucky\\" is not a bad song after all. As long as I know, Britney won't choose this title if she's 17. This is because her presentation in \\"Baby... One More Time\\" & \\"Oops!.. I Did It Again\\" is TOTALLY DIFFERENT! Anyway, it's kinda story in \\"Lucky\\". If I'm not mistaken, the story is about a girl whose name is Lucky and she does not satisfy with what she has(being a famous person). When she's lonely, she'll cry.

I think the message given from the song lets many girls realte to it.. even though we aren't these big time movie stars. I think some teenage girls feel \\"lucky\\" because in many ways they get what they want from their famlies, have great friends and live the life that they want. But I think at night, when your by yourself, you still feel like something is missing.. it might be love or maybe you just don't know. I really liked this song.. and also the other song \\"Heart\\" featured on this single.. \\"Heart\\" is a really pretty song.. her voice is beautiful and the back round music is also beautiful.

Will bring happiness for years to come!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A prophet of the KM revolution","review":"Debra Amidon is a prophet of the KM revolution and uses suitably prophetic language. She is at the centre of a world-wide network of KM specialists. This book is part grand vision, part synthesis of the various strands of KM, part guide to practice, and part guide to the literature and celebration of some 'great names' in the field.As a grand vision it risks utopianism by ignoring some realities and paradoxes that do not fit with the vision. The synthesis is useful, particularly in its insistence on a holistic view of the technology and human aspects of KM, although specialists in other disciplines may not welcome the attempt to subsume the whole of strategy and management under the KM umbrella.Those seeking a guide to practice will find some very useful tools, perspectives and approaches, but may be frustrated by the very conceptual level at which many are pitched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important questions about our future","review":"This book opens your eyes on many important questions and guides you through the world of people that may have the answers.It's not a simple 10-step guide to success in your business, but a wise, well-researched analysis of the current trends in business and society. Really a must for leaders of today and tomorrow. Fascinating lecture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentless","review":"This cd captures Walter at his absolute best. From start til finish you can really feel every song deep down, in every note Walter plays and every word he sings.A stand out track for me is \\"Cry If You Want To\\", a song which Walter wrote fo his son. It is beautiful and moving. \\"I'm Tired\\" is a powerful song with exciting guitar playing and strong backing. I love the way in which this cd has been recorded, capturing both the benefits of the studio and live performance. This is yet another outstanding release from Walter Trout and the Radicals. Relentless is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trout's Best Effort!","review":"Walter Trout keeps getting better with each release. On \\"Relentless\\", Trout gives us 14 original tunes and over 70 minutes that rock, in a blues way of course, from start to finish slowing down every now and again for a change of pace and to break any monotony. Trout's songs seem to be theme oriented and based upon his life experience as a traveling musician. The songs are in the vein of a Joe Bonamassa, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Gov't Mule or Jim Shuler and Monkey Beat. While all songs are new and original material, \\"Jericho Road\\", a radio friendly slow tune done in a southern rock fashion, sounds vaguely familiar. Nevertheless, it's 5 stars all the way and clearly one of the better releases this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walter Trout-Relentless-Outstanding!!!","review":"I'm sitting here listning to Walter Trout's Relentless CD, and am just blown away! This guy is one of the finest guitar players I have ever heard, if not the finest! As a singer songwriter, he is in my opinion as good as the very best. There is not a bad cut on this disc and I love the way that they recorderd it, the soundstage is big and raw, a real live feel to it. If you are a fan of Walter Trout (and everyone should be!) you will have to have this disc. What a talent this guy is!! What a band! Get the disc, spread the word!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentless","review":"Walter is best served live and this is no exception. To bad the audio quality is bad even on the SACD. Is it just me or does his voice drop on the last two songs? Sounds like his mic quit? Walter is such a great player and I hope he releases a better copy of this. I will buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong!","review":"Wow...this is some great (mostly) electric blues! Culled from an Amsterdam live set, I believe, Walter Trout puts on a killer show. Mostly rockin', fast paced blues rock, but he occasionally slows it down, adding to the depth of the album and keeping it from being too one-dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product information is not correct","review":"The information says:Volume Two 1952In this Volume from 1952 must be a short Movie with Barbara Stanwyck (Title: Gaslight).

The other three serials are from the yeas 1954-55.So the fact is: this is a very uncorrectly and bad information, because You mean, the serials are all from the year 1952 and Volume two of this year.

This album is very good and believe it or not If I Knew Now what I Knew Then is even better. But Vagrant Records has once again lured one of my favorite bands into the world of record sales and headline tours. Hot Rod Circuit played the Olympics recently. Their newest songs on the new Vagrant Comp. are popped out to the max. Not that they're bad or anything (they're waaaaaayyy better than Audio Learning Center or Viva Death) but they've taken a step backwards. Pick up this album in the meantime. Highlights are the Power of the Vitamins and Flight 89 (North American)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice selection","review":"I like the first Motown Classics Gold compilation quite a bit and I'm glad they put another one out. Even though my Motown collection is always growing, and I already have most of the songs that appear here, it'd be nice to have some of the other songs here to enjoy. Still, I don't get why 'Dancing In The Street' by Martha & The Vandellas and 'My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)' by David Ruffin are on this compilation, since they already appeared on the first Classics Gold volume. It's redundant. There could've been other songs in their place to discover or rediscover.But never mind.

Yeah that sounds a bit much but look at what you get for the price! I don't know of any other box set that's as inexpensive as this. Thank you Ninja Tunes.It brakes down like this, the first cd has mostly hip hop, the second cd has a lot of jazzy hits, and the last cd called \\"Missed, Flipped & Skipped\\" is my favorite filled with unbelieviable beats for your head. I have not stopped listening to this cd set yet. It truly has something in it for everyone. Jazz appreciation and experimental electronic music are a big part of this album.

The label, as it stands, is on the up and up, introducing the best aritsts that jazz-core and hip hop (REAL HIP HOP, NOT LUDACRIS) have to offer. The problem, is that this compilation only lets you get your feet wet in the ocean that this label has to offer. Tracks by Amon Tobin, Saul Williams, Kid Koala KILL the rest of the cd. I would honestly reccommend this compilation to those who are ready to dive into some deeper music, it's the perfect introduction into the world of electrojazz and tru hip hop heads. Heavy and hard, this one carries. Just know that this compilation is mearly a cliff note in the world of the tunes of the ninja. Ninja tune reprazent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good topic, falls short on advanced measures","review":"The author covers a broad array of very important infrastructure topics. The book is useful and valuable for anyone who has ever tried to justify the value of IT-based infrastructure projects. However, two of today's most powerful tools, real options analysis and simulation, are dismissed by the author as too complicated or abstract to be of any use for managers. While Renkema is correct to presume that most managers do ahve have a handle on these concepts, I was somewhat dissapointed to see that he did not encourage these avenues of methods to get at better numbers with which one can quantify the value of infrastructure. Nevertheless, the book is full of useful information regarding the decision-making process within bureaucratic environments as well as dealing with topics such as risk, argument structure, financial analysis, and qualitative analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION","review":"If you want to know more about the Columbine shootings you can find more information on the web instead of in this book.

You would think that someone with a Master's degree would know how to do some kind of research on a topic they are writing a book about. The facts presented in the book are not accurate.

It pains me to think that someone will read this \\"book\\" (for lack of a better word) and walk away thinking they know who the killers were or what really went down."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite recording.","review":"This certainly is a good example of how subjective music perception can be, or how random music reviews are. I bought this CD after reading all the incredibly positive reviews, and, after listening to it, couldn't be more disappointed and embarrassed. I find some songs here excruciatingly slow and drawn out. I don't enjoy the sound of Mrs. Davrath's voice (to me it often sounds thin and shrill), or the sound of the orchestra, and some of the woodwind instruments sound outright amateurish (nothing wrong with that at all, but frustrating on a supposedly professional CD).For anybody who wants to get to know these songs, which are among the most beautiful pieces of music I know, I would urge considering the unbelievably wonderful recording by Frederica von Stade, or at least the very professional and popular recording with Kiri Te Kanawa."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so pretty","review":"This looks much prettier online than in person.

The supply was excellent and the book quality as described."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but...","review":"Reading this book, I felt like I was back in social studies class, fighting to stay awake. Much of the information is interesting but it's about as excitingly presented as an educational movie, or a taped guide to a museum exhibit. It has that same dumbed-down, patient, worthy feeling.The P.C.-ness of the book can induce its own kind of snooziness. Despite all the evidence he gives to the contrary, Josephy can't keep himself from portraying the Americas before the Europeans invaded as an Eden and the Europeans as devils. An Indian slaughters or conquers another Indian, and that's fine. A European slaughters or conquers an Indian, and that's evil. Zzzzzzz.Does anyone out there know of a steelier-eyed and less sugar-coated history of native America?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down.","review":"I was fascinated with the insight into Saddam's rise to power. I started reading this book just before the war began in Iraq. I was convinced that we were right to make sure Saddam was overthrown. The nation of Iraq has been in turmoil since day one of Saddam's reign and too many innocent lives have been lost. As a Christian interested in prophesy, this book also answered many of my questions as to Iraq's role in the events leading up to the Tribulation. As a bonus, Mr. Dyer has included some fascinating photographs of the ancient city of Babylon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in on mayhem","review":"You might have heard that Saddam thinks he is linked in some way to the great kings of the days of yore in Mesopotamia. It's an interesting part of his megalomania, and you might imagine that he uses this fantasy to justify his rampages in the same way that the Israeli settlers in the occupied territories of Palestine use the legends of Moses and Joshua to justify their murder and degradation of the Palestinians. Don't waste your money on this book. There's a minimum of information on Saddam Hussein and plenty of Dyer's usual mix of Biblical cutting & pasting and sanctification of American & Israeli power-grabbing. This is religion in the service of politics, no better than that of Osama Bin Laden. This book is a base attempt to cash in on war-fever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolish thoughts for foolish people","review":"This book is utter crap.

I would suggest it for both dub and sub fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ending fitting of a true shinobi anime.","review":"This really brings a major story arc to a amazing conclusion.

I didn't care about the personal accounts from the journalists and the segment called \\"Command Decisions\\"----would have just preferred a narrative.

How can one artist so consistently release material of such high quality? This is why Madonna will always be one of the most influential artists of her / our / the next generation. 'Music' the single, is an extraordinary track. Simple (but VERY catchy) 80's inspired lyrics over a modern (futuristic?) electronic beat. Madonna has not been so musiclaly inventive since...no, not 'Ray of Light', but 'Erotica'. But you lucky Americans - you also get 'Cyberrega' as a B-side, a track only available on the US release, and the Japanese and Australian versions of the album. And it's another corker -don't buy this and miss out another great track (Madonna is not known for being generous with her B-sides). It takes 'Shanti/Ashtangi' a step further. Beautiful, haunting Indian vocals over a fantastic electronic/trip-hop style beat. Excellent! Can't wait for 'Music' the album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual...","review":"The queen of the reinvention, Madonna goes even further into electronica with this single which has the flavor of her songs from \\"Ray of Light\\". The difference between that album and this single is that the French helmer Mirawis has spiced up this (and I'm told other tracks on the forthcoming album) with French electronic beats. You can really hear them here. The only thing about this CD that I don't really like (but not enough to fault it a star) is that the original version isn't on the CD, only remixes. The closest one to an actual regular length song is track 8 which doesn't get into repetitive phrases like tracks 1-7.

I've read bits and pieces throughout the years on this young, vibrant, captivating lady, but nothing compared to the breadth and width of accounts that this book entailed.Although they are accounts from interviews with over 150 people involved in Edie's life, the author was able to edit and organize them in such a way that it reads like an epic novel. It's almost like her life just unfolds in this book and it is also a brilliant capture of the 60s period.I highly recommend this book. Couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edie:An American Review","review":"Although this book is over twenty years old, it is still a good source of info about this \\"Girl of 1965\\", Edie Sedgwick. Not only does the book document the rise of Edie at Andy Warhol's Factory, it chronicles her wacky childhood of privledge and turbulent teen years. Her sisters and only surviving brother give detailed accounts of Edie and her struggle with eating disorders and frequent hospitalizations. The family also talks about the abuse they suffered at the hands of their father, Francis Sedgwick, and the effect it had on the entire family. \\"Edie\\" is a great read on a life of a woman whose life ended long ago in a time that seems unreal to most young people of today. \\"Edie\\" not only documents a time in pop history ,but a life which was lived tragically wrong and gave out all too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed in Drag-On.

Well, how wrong I was. This album basically is filled with poorly designed beats and terrible rhymes, it wont take many tracks to just ditch this album. Drag-on could really do better, he has the potential to be a real ROUGH-ryder, but he needs LOTS of improvment. It IS his first album, so he still may improve, but this album just isnt any good, poorly put together-seems rushed. If you considered him, you might want to RE-consider. Dissapointing:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Drag-on's debut might have been highly anticipated, but it falls short of even the lowest of expectations. His delivery is awkward, the beats sound like they have been recycled for the umpteenth time, and the topic matter leaves something to be desired. He essentially raps about -- nothing. The beats are typical Swizz Beatz production, and unfortunately, they don't sound new. If you're not a Ruff Ryders fan (I'm not), don't get it, it won't make you a convert. If you are, there's other CDs you should get first, like Eve's or the Lox's.

They gave Trick Daddy's new album 3 mics, its definitely 4 or 4 1/2. Back to Drag-On. This cd is pretty tight. At first i was kinda disappointed cause i only saw 9 songs on the back of the cd, then i started to believe the source, but then i saw the other 10 songs. Every song has a good flow to it. If you have a system these beats will bump. Drag on makes his beats real pulsating. Every hit will get your adrenaline rushing. There isnt really a laid back song on the cd.

There are 19 songs on this album and only 3 are good this is garbage im going to put this Cd in the garbage because that's where it belongs.

The only good tracks are Niggaz Die 4 Me, Split these Bars, and Click, Click, Clack. Other than that, the beats are whack, they sound like the producer composed them in five minutes.

The only reason it got one star from me is because of the beats. The lyrics are worthless. Drag plays out the title of his album in every song almost.

So I visited this site to read other people's review and was stunned to find to find that the average rate was 5 stars!

Dawn French is great as the Vicar, and the rest of the cast each has their own charm to add. A woman Vicor is an unwanted surprise to this sleepy little town, but she wins them over in some very hilarious ways.I can only imagine what went on behind the scenes - how they kept a straight face during some of the scenes is a tribute to their abilities as actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious, wonderfully romantic","review":"I can't say enough good things about this two-part finale to a charming television show, except that even if you never watched VoD, you can't help but love watching Geraldine finally find the love of her life!

You will laugh until you cry and then you just may cry because you find yourself so happy for Geri and Harry! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end is near....","review":"This last episode of the series finally gives Geraldine what she wants, and that is a man of her own.

It's always diffcult to keep the last episode of a comedic series light-hearted when all of the players, writers, and crew are feeling sad and nostalgic, I suppose, but here the writing is just not up to the importance of the moment. Still the romance with the truly appealing (and pleasingly believable) Richard Armitage left things in a good place for our dear Vicar, and in the end this is an absolute must see for those who have followed the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pretentious need not bother","review":"So my third review on this site is again something that features Richard Armitage. Oh, he is charm itself in this show, but the Armitage love aside, this is a wonderful series on its own. This particular DVD is the series finale and the only one to cast Armitage. Even though I watched it just because he is in it, I've now discovered Dawn French and heartily glad. She is a wonderful comedienne. I'm sorry I didn't know of her sooner, and her ensemble cast is the perfect foil. I have now gone on to watch almost the entire series, and I have enjoyed it so thoroughly that I doubt watching the series finale first was ill advised.But be warned if you are pretentious or priggish or just generally offended by anything even remotely irreverent, you won't like this series.

The ending of my book \\"Hannibal\\" visits them as a married couple after escaping the FBI and mafia clowns. No, Hannibal sees them as kindred damaged souls and is glad Clarisse did not suffer any worse than 'knowing' her father had been killed. Without the further trauma of witnessing it first hand as a child, then welded to psychopathy by also witnessing the cannibalism on family.Clarise has also killed many people, and the line between what is justified killing and what is not will be debated as long as there is killing I think.Personally I think their neighborhood in south america would be particularly safe for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains a lot","review":"Not quite the scare factor of \\"Lambs\\", but it paints a picture of the trauma that could create a Hannibal Lecter.

Even her kindness and love cannot soothe the nightmares and sorrows that plague him. Showing a cunning aptitude for science he is accepted into medical school, which serves to hone his skills and provide the tools to exact justice on the war criminals that haunt him day and night.

Gaspard Ulliel, with a phony dead look in his eye and his hair hanging in his face, looks like he could have been plucked from any high school drama club.

Where do I begin? For starters, they completely missed the boat on the complex nature of Hannibal Lecter for he is no weak, blood driven psychopath. There's nothing in this movie that remotely hints at the sophisticated genius and savage animal that both grow within Hannibal at equal measure. The sexual tension between Hannibal and his 'aunt' is also a joke for to date none of his movies have ever indicated him toward a romantic interest in anything. His relationship with Starling herself was one that bordered on something between paternal and collegial as though she were a rare find of a colleague. So this movie is clearly a work of fantasy and I imagine if the author of the series were to watch it, he would either be inspired to laugh himself silly or cry at the misrepresentation of his greatest creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal Risible","review":"They couldn't find a more appropriate looking lead than this smirking kid playing young Lecter?

Great author, but he should have quit Hannibal after \\"Hannibal\\" and gone on to something else. What's next, Hannibal vs. Rocky in \\"Die Lard?\\" Rent this movie, don't buy it.

I felt as if we were seeign the development of another killer, but not once did I feel like this was HANNIBAL LECHTER. I truly wish I had never seen this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done.....We liked better than original SOTL","review":"We really thought this was a well done film in the Hannibal Lector saga.In fact, I have to confess I never really saw the fascination with the original \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".I always felt that film was kind of bland and never understood how it became such a craze. Perhaps I will watch it again sometime soon now and see if I like it better all these years later.But as I sit here writing this today, I would have to say I found this new \\"prequel\\"-- HANNIBAL RISING to be a more entertaining and intriguing film than the original that started it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghoulishly gruesome, pop psych explanation of a psychopath, but a good story","review":"I think this is the 2nd best in the series, after the truly first-rate Lambs Silence. The story is tautly wound: Hannibal is completely de-humanized as he loses his family to war-time thugs, mixing his budding sexuality with cannibalistic revenge. While this is a rather simplistic explanation of the psychopathology of a monster psychopath, it makes for a great viewing experience, so long as you want to witness his horrifically graphic series of atrocities. The acting is extremely good, to say the least, and the story is coherent, full of incredible images, and tragic. People expecting realistic psychology, I think, should look to documentaries: this is entertainment, not science, as if psychology ever could be more scientific than intuitive.Recommended. Just make sure you have the stomach for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birth of a true monster.......","review":"This wasn't a bad film. The acting was very good in this film. Gaspard Ulliel as the young adult Hannibal did an excellent job. Li Gong was very good as Lady Murisaki, Hannibal's aunt and only link of humanity left. The Story was good. While the film was suppose to be an explaination as to what made him a monster. Instead the film kind of turns out to be more of a tragedy. Knowing that the horrible things that happened to Hannibal Lecter and his family will eventually turn him into a very dangerous monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal Rising","review":"You almost feel sorry for Hannibal, but this was a chilling, horrific story, and it does explain how he started to evolve into the character that we know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reason why Lecter loves Starling","review":"At first I watched this movie and thought that it does not fully explain why Hannibal Lecter became Hannibal Lecter. I read all the books as well and never got it until the other night I watched Silence of the Lambs again, and it hit me. The stories between Lecter and Starling are similar, yet they chose opposite ends of the path. Here are their similarities:When they were both young they each became orphaned.When they were orphaned they each had a charge to take care of, Starling trying to save the lamb, Lecter and his sister. Which incidentaly, were both eaten.This fractured Lecter while it steeled Starling and this is where they separate. Starling is what Lecter could have been and he loves her for it.So when I came to this realization, this movie made more sense to me and now I like it.I'm still wanting to see Hannibal at his prime, between his begining and then right before his capture. The murders that made him infamous, I hope Thomas Harris writes that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Blu-ray edition","review":"This is one of the worse Blu-rays I have ever seen. The quality of the picture is fine,but there are no extras at all; not even subtitles. There is no, I repeat, no disc menu and the pop-up menu consists of only audio choices of 5.1 or DTS 5.1 or French 5.1. I would not buy this edition or recommend it. Instead get the wide-screen edition DVD. It'll play fine on your Blu-ray with an excellent picture and this film is certainly worth watching for all Hannibal Lecter fans and all fans of Thomas Harris. It was not a big hit when it first hit the theaters and I don't know why. It is very good. An excellent screenplay (the first by Thomas Harris) and very good direction by Peter Weber. I guess folks were tired of the series. It is an underrated thriller. I can't believe the Blu-ray edition had any input by Harris or Weber. It is a waste of the Blu-ray format. Get the regular wide screen edition, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST!","review":"I am an AVID FAN of Hannbal Lecter/ Anthony Hopkins and I have to say this was an absolutely stupid, unreal, fast forward to get it over with, movie! The ONLY thing that would make you even THINK this was about Hannibals boyhood is the photo on the front cover of the DVD! The character they have playing Hannibal Lecter is a terrible missmatch and in no way would you believe he later became the man we see in the other movies -Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. If it didn't have the name Hannibal Rising on the cover you would NOT BOTHER TO SEE IT! Don't waste your money on this one. I'm sorry I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"By the end of it, I felt this movie was really underestimated. I didn't know why. It caught my attention since its very dramatic beggining and never let go. I thought the cinematography was great, as well as the music. The actor cast as Hannibal was very good also, he had a very fitting intense quality. As a matter of fact, I thought it was superior to the two previous entries in the series, Red Dragon and Hannibal. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Started out interesting, then became repetitive. I think the film makers wanted us to sympathize with Hannibal because of the trauma he experienced as a child, but that wasn't enough to make us care about him as a psychopathic murderous adult. Because we don't care about him--or his victims--there is no emotional investment, no real stakes. I don't mind violence (and this movie is violent), but having characters that I don't care about is unforgivable. It's too bad because I was excited to see Hannibal's origins. Now, I don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This movie has no right to be mentioned in the same breath as the other hannibal films, it was absolutly horrible. The story was weak and frankly not up to par. I had heared the movie was a flop before went to see it myself but i thought this is a hannibal film, it cant be that bad. I was wrong, very wrong. This movie seeems to have nothing to do with the other films and doesn't have enough story/meat for it to stand alone. I wouldn't even reccommend this as a rental. It's an all and all waste of money and time. I was so upset and let down by this film, they should have never put the name hannibal in the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring \\"Batman Begins\\" Rip-Off","review":"This movie wants to be \\"Batman Begins\\" and have it's teenage audience so bad it can taste it! Unfortunately it flopped and for good reason. It's an unecessary over explanation of a character that was far more terrifying having some mystery about him. It's a collection of homages to the other films in the series, which makes it feel like an uninspired cash in aimed at the teenagers who wouldn't watch \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\" because it's an \\"old\\" movie with that \\"old\\" guy in it. Takes away from the series more than it adds. The film is slow and boring, you keep wondering when it's gonna end. It seemed like a 3 hour movie with nothing of much interest happening. Wished I'd saved my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining and creepy, like its supposed to be","review":"Its supposed to be a story about the beginning of hannibal lector. I dont think the actor should have tried to exactly mimic anthony hopkins, as people evolve and change as they get older, i think it would have been stupid to try and make the young hannibal exact to the adult hannibal. l I thought it was a fine movie, that was entertaining, creepy and gory, not once was i bored. I thought Gaspard Ulliel was great and would love to see him continue to work in english roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most important questions are never answered","review":"\\"Hannibal Rising\\" doesn't answer the most important questions.

This guy is in a rut and assumes the erratic romance which is more difficult to attain must be valuable. Conversely, the calm stable romance he doesn't quite trust. All 3 characters are headed for some challenges regardless of their choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run away Leonard!","review":"Whether the protagonist is male or female, this is the guy/gal your Mom warned you about.

Two Lovers is an old fashioned movie, deep with emotions. It's a film for grown-ups. There's nothing being blown up, no special effects, just plain and simple good acting by all the actors. Vinessa Shaw, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rosellini all give fine performances but its Phoenix's film, he really shines. James Gray is a wonderful director who is highly underrated in this country. He knows how to pull human emotion and tell a real story."},{"rating":"2","title":"authentic, real, powerful","review":"a great indie film, despite the \\"a list\\" cast. essentially compares infatuation vs. love. simple, yet perfectly executed. don't want to give away the plot, but if you like drama/romance that is authentic (not some romantic comedy junk) then, please, rent/buy this movie. very similar in theme/tone to \\"Strictly Sexual\\", if you liked that movie, you will like this also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipd movie making perfected","review":"Insipid movie recipe:* Bring in 3 power house actors (Joaquin Phoenix, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini)* A dull script full of cliches not even worthy of TV movie of the week* Throw in very bland lackluster direction* Design a dark set, have the actors wear dark clothes and shoot the film with little light* Steer for 111 minutes in luke warm waterWatching this movie is as exciting as watching a drip coffee maker fill its pot.

Someone should have had the decency to pull the plug long before I was suckered in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting, horrid script, lame plot.","review":"I am really dissapointed in this movie. The two women who are involved for this man are completely lacking depth or believability. Paltrow seemed to barely try in her role--which is easy to do with how dull the script is, and I think Leonard is not worthy of either woman's attentions. Plus he is extremely boring. He is like one of those guys who tries to be funny and quirky when inside they are actually retarded. Sandra fell way too easy for Leonard, and they had sex without ever having held a whole conversation. The whole movie is just chalk-full of emotionally-disturbed people who are so needy they jump for the first person who shows interest in them-being Leonard.It could have been waaaaaay better had the script been written better, and if the actors had tried to pretend they wanted to make a successful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie","review":"It will be sad if this is Phoenix's last movie as he is a really good actor. But this movie is not about anything exciting, just a guy stuck in the family business who picks the more exciting girl but when she doesn't pick him, he settles for the other girl. The cast is great with Isabella (needed more screen time) and Gwen but beyond that it is a waste of time unfortunately, not worth seeing in the theater or as a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to moviegoer's intelligence","review":"I watched this movie just for Phoenix. No wonder he left this business, and refused to publicize this movie on the Letterman's show.Phoenix, a depressed suicidal only child of a Jewish couple, is set up with the daughter of business associate, but falls in love with the neighbor (Paltrow). Paltrow, a drug addict, is the mistress of a rich attorney who is unlikely to leave his wife for her. The movie is poorly made and full of cliches. One does not care what happens to any of the characters. An insult to the intelligence of any moviegoer, this movie reminded me of \\"Seven brides for seven brothers\\" of 50 years ago, but without the beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, predictable, AWFUL","review":"I am stunned I even sat through this entire movie. From the first minute to the last, I was wishing it would end or, at least, that something would happen. Anything. It was just awful, just supremely awful. Joaquin Phoenix is PAINFULLY BAD.

The characters were horrible, the dream sequences were horrible, but Tom Clancy is a great writer except when he is writing this series. There is absolutely no way I will ever read another Power Plays book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This one's a dud. Tom Clancy had less input into this book than presidential pooch Millie did to Barbara Bush's \\"Millie's Book.\\" It's sad that Clancy lends his name to such mundane, formulaic, episodic writing -- which would never see the light of day but for Clancy's name on the cover as \\"collaborator.\\"For technical bloopers, check the authors' blaming of the Hindenberg disaster on \\"the ignition of hot hydrogen gas.\\" In fact, the rapid burning of the Hindenberg resulted from the fact that the bags containing the hydrogen were coated with flammable cellulose nitrate or cellulose acetate -- not from the hydrogen itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please,no more collaborations","review":"Being a dedicated Clancy fan,I feel cheated by this book.So much of it is irrelevant and the book seems totally out of joint. The author, whoever that is, spends many pages on sequences that have little to do with the plot. Others have noted that dream sequence, I feel the long sequence in Maine was rather unnecessary though it was interesting. The characters are superficial and seem cartoonish. I found the book irritating to read and had to force myself to finish. Please, Tom, write your own books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it is printed on.","review":"Terrible. Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) the likes of Patriot Games and Hunt for Red October I feel bitterly disappointed by this spectaculary unsuccessful collaboration. It seems to me that dedicated Clancy readers are being exploited and cheated by being duped into buying this utter rubbish that is clearly not his work. It is the work of an ameteur. If this book did not have Clancy's name on the front of it than it would surely not have been published. I had to force myself to finish it. I really couldn't care less what happened to anyone in the story as the characters were so badly drawn and deadly boring. I am very glad that I kept the receipt. Line your hamster cage with it, use it to start your fire, even make little aeroplanes out of it, but PLEASE DON'T READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The beginning of the book starts out great, it immediately grabs your attention and keeps you glued to it throughout.

It is a fairly decent book however, it could be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Clancy Rip-off","review":"I bought the Abridged CD version. There were no tracks on the CD. Therefore, if you stopped listening, you would have to search the entire CD to determine where you left off. A 70 minute disk needs several breaks.The story was abridged. Whoever did the production should look for another job. The first third of the novel was almost impossible to comprehend. I read/listen to approximately 5 books per week. This one was one of the worst editing jobs I have come across.The story itself was a major reach. There was little or no character development.I will not waste my time on any more series inspired books by Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow Watch","review":"This book was absolutely the worst book I have ever read.

I have read Shadow Watch and a few other books 'authored' by Tom Clancy and a contributor. It is like really poor ghost writing. Compared to the 'real' Tom Clancy, these are a pale imitation! The plots and characters are amateurish. After reading my second book where Tom Clancy has collaborated with another writer, I am disappointed that his skill level has sunk this low. Avoid them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend you not spend time or money on this one.","review":"This is another Clancy book I can't recommend. The plot was not believable and it ended with a whisper. This did not have the feel or readability of a Clancy book. The characters and plot were trite and the villian was pretty pitiful.

I recommend you not spend your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nada to write home about","review":"Pretty weak effort here, as Clancy puts his imprimatur on another \\"Clancy-less\\" novel.

I always felt that the Power Plays series was the weakest of the group and this book proves it. I will not read another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy, Beyond a shadow of a doubt","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this poorly-written Tom Clancy 'collaboration' novel. I've read 3 superb novels by Tom Clancy, and Shadow Watch differed so greatly from them in terms of content and readability that I have to wonder whether Tom actually contributed to this novel at all!Structurally, the writing was clumsy and obtuse, the plot was stale, and character development virtually non-existent or cliched. I had to force myself to read the novel past the second chapter.My advise: Don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Ghostwriter Material!","review":"At one time Clancy could claim the title of the greatest writer on earth.

Maybe he can come back to life with the Bear and the Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The poorest collaboration yet","review":"Shadow Watch is poorly written, pointlessly rambles, inaccurate, fails to resolve the situations opened by the author(s).I find it hard to believe that Tom Clancy read, much less collaborated on this work. I have read and enjoyed all of his fiction and most of the collaborations and, in my opinion, this is the worst.A shuttle explodes on the launch pad. We never really know why or how. There are several dream sequences in the book which have no point I could find. Fortunately, these are italicized and are easy to skip. The cocaine carried on three flatbed trucks is loaded into a Beechcraft Bonanza, a single engine light plane. At the end, the villain, thwarted, simply walks away. He may be seen in a later book but I will never know.The last line of the acknowledgments reads \\"But most important, it is for you, my readers, to determine how successful our collective endeavour has been.\\" For this reader, the endeavour was not successful at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Way Decent","review":"As this is the first Tom Clancy read, although I have several movies based on his books, suck as The Hunt for the Red October, Patriot Games, and Clear and Present Danger.Although I thought his writing was good and was a cliff-hanger like feeling throughout the book, as I read other reviews I guess his other books must have been alot better.Anyways some of the sub-plots were well written and were interesting (urchin diving with Tom Ricci), they only showed he was tough and the man for the job, but took to many pages to show it. Also the train wreck took to long to explain with insignificant people who just died in the end. It was important to the fact that the Terroists weapon was ready for use, but the extant to the wreck was explained was un-necessary.The whole part in Russia where the guerrilas buy the HMD or whatever is still kind of hazy as to what actually happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"It got 2 stars for 1/5 of it's pages.","review":"Start reading it only if you get it for free!

Not much of a plot was present. There was very little beginning or end to the story, merely a bunch of techno-babble for a middle.

Its best to stick with Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan and John Clark series if you are in need of real page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun features, but poor quality","review":"Very disappointed in the Excalibur Castle. Don't get me wrong -- the features look like a lot of fun, it is colorful, and every part was in perfect condition when it arrived. HOWEVER, it simply does not have a sturdy design. This entire castle is held together with -- count them -- only 4 screws. Nearly every piece (of which there are about 30) is supposed to stay together through interlocking pieces. Now, this method may be okay for molded plastic, but it doesn't work for the wood pieces in this castle. As a result, when you get the castle together (which was really very simple and took no more than 15 minutes), it is very rickety. All of the pieces shift and move, and you can't relocate the castle without it falling apart. It simply isn't sturdy enough to justify its price tag.

The Letter Factory is particularly good and appropriate for children as young as two.The Story Book Factory and the The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park don't follow a well structured system nor do they do a good job of teaching the things they presume to teach such as punctuation. Taken as a movie for entertainment, the Amusement Park one is bearable but the Story Book Factory is very dumb.

This a choppy \\"new ageification\\" of the piece with not especially notable singing which extends the piece over an entire album. Allegri's music is interspersed with modern compositions and intrumentation. Worse, all sorts of tricks are played with timing -- voices being slowed down to create heaven knows what desired effect [try track 8].There are many other recordings of Allegri available (even of pieces other than the Miserere).

Yesterday I pulled an Armani dress out of a jumble of clothing merely because I examined the stitching and fabric and knew I had a quality item. The lable was the last thing I looked at.

The eight preludes run the gamut of emotional intent yet Bekova handles the jazzy numbers one and two with as much innate sense of ragtime as she measures the dark depths of number five. The Sonata is handled with lyrical virtuosity (why isn't this piece in the mainstream piano repertoire?) and the three miniatures with which Bekova finishes this disk are utterly beautiful.

I expected an improvement over the shave I get with the Mach 3 Turbo. I have been trying it for about a week now and overall have decided that the Power is not worth the extra cost. I don't feel it gives me a better shave than the Mach 3 Turbo and I will not be purchasing additional blades once the ones that it came with wear out.In addition to the lackluster shave, I found that I often turned the razor off by accident due to the poor location of the power button. I also did not really like the feel of the vibrating razor on my jaw because the vibration is transmitted right to the ear drums which is annoying.In summary, I don't think that the Mach 3 Power is worth the extra cost.

It's kind of like shaving in one of those vibrating lounge chairs, only much easier. The vibrations definitely produce a closer and more comfortable shave than other Mach 3 products. That might be partly because these vibrations force you to slow down--a good face saving technique with any shaving system. One problem for me was finding the camouflaged on/off switch. Fool that I am, I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and practically disassembled the handle as a result.

The cost of this razor compared to the Mach III is the only discernible difference between the two.Either stick with the Mach III or use the Schick Quattro (I prefer the Quattro as the blades last longer than the Mach III in my opinion.)

Terrible quality.","review":"This razor really does improve your shave. I'm baby smooth for a full day and half, as opposed to half a day. It's not a gimmick, even if it sounds like one.Now for the bad news. I've been through 3 of these and the piece of junk button that switches the motor on and off broke on all three. It starts with the thing not turning off easily. Then it won't turn off at all, so you have to take the battery out every time. Then water gets inside and rusts the contacts and causes excessive battery drain.I know the thing works though, because when I'm too lazy to put the battery in, the shave is noticably less close.So basically, great concept. Terrible flawed product. If you can afford to replace it once every few months, it can't be beat.A much more minor complaint is that the on/off button is exactly where I put my finger when I shave, so before the button breaks, I often accidentally turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?!","review":"Good gawd...this thing is expensive for a freakin' razor!And expensive doesn't always equate to better.

The shave with the M3Power was neither closer nor more comfortable than using the Mach 3.I enjoy testing new razors when they hit the market, and I'm just glad I bought this overpriced and overhyped gadget on sale. The signficantly higher price for refill razor heads compared to the Mach 3 refills is insane!Save your money and do not buy this overpriced gimmick.And to all those suckers, excuse me, I mean...consumers who buy and continue to use this razor believing you're getting an improved shave: The executives at Gillette thank you for making their paychecks fatter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Concerns","review":"This is a vibrating razor.

I'm sure after purchasing it you would be more than happy with the improved shave that it gave you but before you go spending your money on it why not try replacing the razorblade in your current razor?The only reason that people are discovring an improved shave from this gimmick is i'm sure purely because they haven't changed their razorblades in a while.

Feels like I'm shaving with an electric. No resistance, no pain, no cuts. Awesome.Since the Mach3 Turbo came out, I've found that the turbo blades lasted no where as long as the original Mach3s. There's no way in hell I'm gonna spend $20 for 6 M3 Power blades.

Well skepticism aside, this razor simply gives me a closer shave than my old Mach 3 Turbo. Whether it's has anything to do with the vibrations is hard to say but you can't argue with results. I have a very heavy beard and even after a day or two of growth the M3 Power goes through my stubble extremely smoothly and without leaving any nicks or abrasions. So if you're on the fence, let me push you over, the razor is well worth the money. P.S. The replacement blades only cost 50 cents more per package than the old Mach 3 Turbo.

It gave a smooth and comfortable shave with fewer strokes than my other razors.I though it was a little pricey but it works so well I will probably keep buying the blades and use it.The only niggling complaint I have is the position of the on/off button - it is exposed midway up the barrel. I keep touching it and turning off the vibration mid-stroke. It should have been placed in another position.

But if you're debating between the Mach 3 and the M3Power, or thinking about upgrading, this isn't the way to go... if you're expecting this to give a closer, smoother, more comfortable shave, you're going to be suprised.

It uses the Gnostic Gospels as a reliable source despite the nearly universal rejection of them by modern reputable scholership. As a result, the first portion of this poorly executed attempt at an entertaining biography is largely innaccurate and biased. The reenactments of loosely related miracle accounts are worthy of a high school play at best. If you do choose to buy this, don't even bother with the first section.The second part is a head and shoulders improvement over the first, but it still falls far short of a well done documentary. It clearly favors an atheist (or at the very least agnostic) viewpoint in reporting the history of the very early church.

Fleeing a pampered life into the chaotic life that Groo brings about, Ruferto and his new companion encounter Pal and Drum, the schemers who cut an arms deal with Groo. Of course, they've never learned that the best deal to cut with Groo is to RUN FOR THE HILLS! Groo gets wealthy through no fault of his own and winds up penniless as usual.Note: the printing quality is generally okay to very good for the series, but this is generally a collection for Groo fans and comic book fans.

Abramoff plays a large part in the book, as he ran the College Republicans with pals Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed.To understand the Republican Party, you must read this book. Easton's knowledge spans the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton years, and goes beyond the personalities you see in the media to paint a picture of a party rooted in college activism, philosophy, and a desire to push the country to the Right.This book comes highly recommend to anyone interested in our political strucutre, Republican or Democrat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure","review":"Both the artwork and the script are stunning.

All three films were riveting, but this one is the most personal, the most touching and the most artistic. You meet the authors in interviews, and find out their background story, as well as what prompted them to write about their experiences. Famous actors then read that writing as the filmmakers illustrate the stories in a variety of different ways....still photography, animation, footage shot by soldiers, etc. This film is visually compelling and emotionally powerful; non-partisan; human. It simply tells some of the stories of the men and women who serve - what they see, what they feel, and what they experience. The film is poetic, beautiful and should be seen by every American, regardless of political affiliation."},{"rating":"2","title":"History in the making","review":"Regardless of one's politics, it's important for all of us to understand what our troops and families have and are going through in our war on terrorism and appreciate the sacrifices, big and small, they've all made.

From first hand accounts on the frontlines, to those who've aided, both medically and psychologically, to the final trip and tribute a Marine officer gives to his fallen comrade the dvd picks up where the book leaves off, offering us a slendid visual potpourri; from live action film to stills to a loose animation, almost storyboarding of events as seen through the eyes of a young soldier.

Not being satisfied with simply taking over the government and banishing the aristocracy from France, those animals showed their savagery by guillotining everyone, even innocent woman and children. The Doctor and his group materializes right in the middle of the French Revolution and are immediately captured by peasant soldiers and condemned to death, only to be saved by the real heroes, Jules Renan and his friend Jean, representing the Scarlet Pimpernel. Fortunately, Reign is spared much sadness by not focusing on the executions, but instead on the Doctor's attempts to rescue his captive friends, and then the fall of the Robespierre and rise of Napoleon to power. The ending of Reign is poignant indeed, with the Doctor stating \\"Our destiny is in the stars.\\" Carry on Doctor.

Johnson's books do not succeed in refuting Mayr, and you won't be ready to critique modern theories of biological origins until you understand what Mayr has to say.In a nutshell, armchair logic is not a substitute for time spent in the field and in the laboratory. The evidence--physical, chemical, biological and geological--simply does not support the Young Earth hypothesis so popular among creationists.Sorry to burst your bubble. Do read Mayr before you proselytize, though: you owe it to yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Like his past books, Johnson deftly shows the flaws in evolutional theory.

Defeating Darwinism, however, is 132 pages of arrogant, dismissive, self-congratulatory tripe, which does not manage to rise even to the level of standard preaching to the choir. If you are looking for something substantive to read on creationism, there are plenty of much better books out there, both for and against. If, on the other hand, you are already convinced that creationism is true, and what you really want is a cheerleader who will mindlessly cheer you on and badmouth your opponents for no good reason, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophistry by any other name...","review":"Through a flurry of misconceptions, sweeping assertions and selective presentations of the facts, all while under the veil of 'baloney detection' to seem as a reasonable and unbiased author, Johnson proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is a lawyer and not a biologist. He wants to convince people that he knows the facts, instead of wanting to know the facts. Full of obfuscation and internal inconsistencies, this book is extremely slick, and will undoubtedly leave the uncritical reader thinking that the notion of evolution is in academic disarray. Nothing could be further from the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This guy blathers on about how science should be approached from a neutral perspective with an opened mind and without preconceptions. Fine. Nothing wrong with that. But then he totally contradicts himself by proposing that the basis of scientific investigation should be the supernatural beliefs of one particular Christian sect.I think aliens came here in UFOS and populated planet earth. They used special ray guns that turned animals into rocks and that's where fossils came from. Fossils exists don't they? So there's proof of my alien theory. It makes just as much sense as \\"intelligent design\\". Hey, the aliens were the \\"intelligent designers\\". That makes sense to me and I have just as much evidence for it as creationist/IDers do for what they propose. I want that taught in schools too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only effective for True Believers.","review":"Those who never intend to accept modern evolutionary theory will lap up this book, and continue to congratulate themselves that somehow \\"the tide is turning\\" toward their head-in-the-sand viewpoint.However, those who intend to use the scientific method to make practical advances in the biological and earth sciences will find little--if anything--of value among Johnson's arguments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for critical thinking enthusiasts","review":"Once again, Phillip Johnson has written a supremely reasoned, readable, and revelant book on Darwinism. This is a great book for those who love critical thinking and need effective tools to try to open the minds that have been closed by years of indoctrination in the theory of particles-to-people evolution. This is definitely one of the best books I have read in my 25 years of studying the creation-evolution controversy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real content here.","review":"Johnson never gets to the details of his arguments. The book is simply an attempt to shove Christianity onto science. He starts out insisting that God belongs in science without really saying why. He never points out an area of science that needs God, except he keeps mentioning evolution in that connection. But the lack of details makes this book unconvincing even for its intended audience. If this is the best creationists have to offer, science has nothing to worry about (except the stupid, ignorant public). The book amounts to one long, boring whine. He shows you can write competently without actually having a brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do check out his \\"references\\"","review":"And you'll find quote mining, quotes taken out of context, deliberate distortions, and other falsities.Why do creationists have to \\"lie for Jesus?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written propaganda","review":"I just picked this up in a library book sale and I must say that I wish I had my $0.15 back. It looks like there's at least one fallacy or falsehood on every page. Johnson briefly addresses some fallacies he thinks he's encountered in dealing with scientists, but somehow he fails to see that the very same fallacies permeate his writing. I've seen more coherent and eloquent arguments for creationism on free websites. I'm no longer a creationist and I'm convinced that creationism in our times is essentially a conjecture based on ignorance and faulty reasoning.

You can decide if that is a good or bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad, misinformed irony.","review":"It is unfortunate that the scope of some concepts are simply beyond the average person who is not willing to devote more that several hours to learning about it. It is ironic that creationists are so concerned with the \\"Truth,\\" without taking much time to look for it. An \\"open mind\\" means to look at all sides of the issue before you draw even a tentative, not a final, conclusion. Therefore, if you believe in the importance of an \\"open mind,\\" as this book purports to espouse, you will be interested to read the other side of the story as well. May I suggest a work by a biologist, rather than a lawyer (as this author is).

I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming. Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world. Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-science for pre-college students","review":"This book is worse than the ignorant letters to the editor creationists write to my hometown newspaper. Johnson must know that his arguments have discredited; yet he presents them to an audience of high school biology students. Any knowledgeable teacher will be able to refute these arguments, much to the embarrassment of the student. Unfortunately, the real intent of books like this is to intimidate teachers into not presenting modern science to their classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"science = naturalism","review":"Johnson has always been critical of science for being too naturalistic, and this book reveals his continued distrust of it. Of course, he wants supernatural phenomena included in science, but the methods of science can only address that which lends itself to inquiry, and things supernatural do not. The view that a god miraculously created is insufficient to explain the many details of the biological world. The theory of evolution does just that, and it has predictive power, just as other scientific theories. It does not explain our surroundings at the exclusion of a god. What it does exclude are the views of biblical literalists such as Johnson who mask their intentions through philosophical rhetoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Scary Piece of Propaganda","review":"I have just read several of Phillip E. Johnson's books on creationism and found some of them interesting. This book, however, is problematic. This book is intended as a book for high school students and is designed to counter biology class presentations on evolution. Sadly, it is shallow and biased, it presents incomplete and unfair arguments against evolution. It presents thoroughly discredited arguments just as if they were not fraught with problems. It saddens me to think of young minds reading this without having oppurtunity to see the complete picture. Don't get me wrong, there are intellectually honest, interesting presentations of creationism out there (Michael Behe's Darwin's Black Box, for example), this book just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for Creationists","review":"This book was not meant to challenge the belief of Evolution, but rather to give you the tools to do it yourself. Darwinists should not read this book unless they are planning to debunk their own religion.

I highly recommend this book for anyone who is neutral on the subject or who believes in intelligent design, but Darwinists- don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not about science!","review":"Look at every book on this subject and read the reviews.

This certainly can't be called hardcore honky-tonk;indeed, the steel guitar, if heard at all, is mixed incredibly low in these productions.

The thing that makes this typical show really stink is the dub. The people that they choose are just horrible.

What's nice too, is that this is a relatively inexpensive craft to try. A piece of linen, some wool, a needle and a hoop and you're good to go. Portable too. I really like this book.

It truly is an uncomfortable listening experience. The problem seems to be that the compositions are trying very hard to be interesting and they don't flow well. They are bebop tunes disguised as progressive jazz. If you listen enough to it you can hear the tunes reaching to be something that they never achieve. The players are great, but I really turn off to the two cuts with Regina Carter. Violin is something to me that doesn't fit in this context. It's like putting an accordian in the mix of Bitches Brew. It just doesn't go, you know? Also the tunes, and I call them tunes, have no relation to each other. All types of different styles. This is jazz that is very easy to follow, but really something to stay away from. This is really poorly written material. I'm trying to be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"What went wrong here? The musicians are excellent: Russell Malone, Billy Hart, and Barron himself.

As for jazz violin, well, it's almost bearable.

With that being said we never even thought twice that this shelf was going to be something other than real wood. My opinion is that this shelf should have been priced around 120 to 160 dollars. We also came to find out that it doesn't even hold 702 dvd's as claimed.

As I wore it, I realized that it was quite warm, even though it was VERY VERY thin leather, and not at all like the photos shows making this jacket appear quite thick.So, I decided to be positive, however, after 1 1/2 weeks of wear, I noticed thinning at the elbow areas. Also, I saw a small area of stitch release in the middle of the arm, where there is really never any tension.A day after that, this area became a 2 inch hole...OMG!

Pete Lockett is a world-class percussionist who gathered together other able colleagues to produce this CD. For all you curious Bruford fans, Bill appears on roughly half the tracks and spends most of that time behind his kit.The CD's rhythmic explorations vary between direct attacks and gentle, almost hypnotic, soundscapes. Expect a lot of Indian/Eastern rhythms here. It's a great record for shuffle play, and stands well on its own as a background \\"soundtrack\\". Still, there is much here that rewards direct and intentional listening. If you like all percussive instrumental albums (ala Mickey Hart's Planet Drum and its kind), then you will fully enjoy this offering, and eagerly await a Pete Lockett's Network of Sparks 'Two'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish student perspective..","review":"My honors Spanish 5 class watched this. We couldn't even understand everything so who can beginner learners understand?Anyways, not to be a cynic, but my honest opinion is that it was very boring and a waste of time. Pretty much the whole class was laughing at the cheesy, overly-done acting. Not entertaining or enjoyable learning at all. If the reason anyone is looking this movie up, if you're interested in practicing listening skills, then watch a CURRENT Spanish soap opera from cable(acting is slightly better), Spanish music, or some Spanish Disney channels. There you can learn everyday lingo and not feel like banging your head against a wall.

With a pop/rock sound, Greg has created one of the best solo albums I've heard. He has a gorgeous voice, and awesome songs that don't just consist of falling in love. Sure he has that love ballad with 'We're In Love' but considering he wrote that song himself, is amazing.

I have been a big fan of Greg for a while now, back in the Dream Street days! But this Cd shows how much talent Greg has a person, and as a solo artist! It so much different from the music he did with Dream Street, It is better. If you don't have this Cd...you are deffinetly missing out!!

He has come so far and he will go a long way!~We all know that greg is absolutely gorgeous!

His voice is so different from the others in a wonderful way. I love his voice, its awesome. It's such an awesome album! No two songs are alike! Greg also wrote 5/9 of the songs, so you can hear the emotion and everything! It seriously is a great album, and you will not regret it. It has a rock edge, but if you'll like it, no matter what music you dig. Something for everyone! My favorite song is \\"Take me back home\\". I have lots of great memories of that song from seeing Greg live on the Aaron Carter tour, and I also love \\"We're in love\\", \\"Worthless\\", and \\"Every summer\\".

This CD shows Greg's talent with 9 pop songs, all with a little egde of rock. Greg wrote and co-wrote most of the songs. He's made it big with \\"Take Me Back Home\\" and \\"Every Summer\\" already. More favorites of mine include \\"Worthless\\" and \\"We're in Love\\". Greg makes his comeback proving fans and others that going solo was definetly a good choice.

While it was a disappointment to see only nine songs on the CD, this is one of those times where quality overrules quantity. Greg sounds great on every song, whether it's a soulful ballad like \\"Worthless\\" or \\"We're In Love\\" or a faster rock song like \\"My Life\\". And it was nice to see that he wrote several of the songs himself. I think this album is going to surprise a lot of people who wrote Greg off as a 'teenie-pop' artist. He's grown up a lot since Dream Street, and it shows on the CD, which has much more of a rock feel than when he was with DS. This is definitely a step in the right direction for Greg, and I think this album reflects that. Hopefully it will be a success -- he deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Ever!","review":"i think Greg Raposo's CD is the best CD ever! it ROCKS!

Needless to say, I like for what it is: Low-budget filmmaker Charles Band's attempt at a \\"Star Wars\\" clone...but without the \\"stars\\" or the \\"wars\\".But this DVD is a different story. \\"Metalstorm\\" was originally released in 3D at a screen aspect of 2.35:1. I can accept this DVD not being 3D. What I cannot accept is Universal's decision to release it in 4x3 full screen format only. 5 years ago, there may have been some flawed logic to releasing it in full screen. After all, TV signals were still SD and HD-TVs were only beginning to become mainstream. But, in 2010, there is no excuse. Universal has killed this DVD.

While at the time I found Jaws 3-D to be at least suspenseful I, as a teenager, was going to walk out of this horrible film. The only reason I stayed was because I paid for this movie and I wasn't going to walk out on something I paid good money for. In retrospect I think I did more harm in staying. I don't remember the plot the characters or much else. What I do remember is the I the rage that I felt at having wasted time and money by watching this film.

It is often just plain wrong. So no reader should put faith in any of the allegations that Mr. Bovard puts forth.Unfortunately, this book adds adds nothing at all to an intelligent debate of the successes and failures of the Clinton administration.

I do agree with his comments about the drug war, and asset forfeiture.

It's like Buffy meets Bram Stoker!The book tells of an ageless feud between two vampires that continues in a modern-day Seattle, with our heroine caught in the middle.

Second, would be its' timeless and poetic lyrics that couldn't have been supported better by any other band, or any other voice (also courtesy of Andrew McMahon). Finally, would be its' breathtaking melodies that could bring any true musician or fan to their knees. \\"Konstantine\\" is perfect in every way, as perfect as each individual's flaws in the inspiring relationship.

It is a worthwhile read and I look forward to more novels from Ms. Hart."},{"rating":"2","title":"arterpastor","review":"I came upon this book in a bookstore recently, and, because this is Ms. Hart's debut novel, I thought I would like to read it.

I hope this will be the first of many books from Erin Hart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ma'am, don't quit your day job.","review":"I'm an avid reader of many genres, and am always more than willing to give new authors a fair shot. Unfortunately for me, I decided to give Erin Hart's first novel, Haunted Ground, the proverbial college try on one rainy afternoon.I found the book's pacing to be sluggish, and its dialogue rich with typical Irish cliche. My overall impression was that Hart is a maniacal American obsessed with the Emerald Isle, but doesn't know the culture well enough to write a plausible story without going overboard. In short, she tried much too hard.And, concerning my own personal experience with the novel, I tried much too hard... to finish the book. Despite my efforts, I was forced to put this piece back on the shelf after only 5 chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find","review":"I picked this book up at a library book sale for 50 cents. I would have been happy to pay full price for it! In the tradition of other forensic novels, we get a great deal of detail about the head found in the bog. The story intertwines the search for other clues about the bog lady, with a current mystery--the disappearance of a mother and child 2 years earlier. There is great character development of the main characters--Cormac & Nora in particular--as well as the local police detective. The details of Irish history enhance the story and make it much more interesting. Clearly the author has done her research and it has paid off in this well-written mystery/romance/forensic novel.

Frankly I found it on the \\"remainder\\" table at Barnes and Noble. Our family has a history in Cromwellian Ireland, so after reading the book, I purchased another copy from Amazon to send to my first cousin. What happened to the Irish people under Cromwell was unspeakable and yet on an individual basis the people intermarried as they did in \\"Haunted Ground\\".There is an additional modern mystery of the disappearance of a wife and child, as there was in the ancient mystery. The book makes for good reading and gives a little window into history and perhaps helps explain the \\"toubles\\" that have plagued modern Ireland. Recommended for supence/mystery readers and those who enjoy historical novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite what I was expecting but a good read nonetheless","review":"I was expecting more of a good Irish ghost story.

Haunted Ground isn't one of them. The plot is transparent, easy to figure out after only 50 pages or so, and so are the few relationships that Hart attempts to develop. The rest is just window dressing. It puzzles me how so many reviewers have found this novel full of Celtic lore and history. I didn't notice much of either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Head-Hopping","review":"I was prepared to like this book, especially after the rave reviews found here on Amazon, and Audible. But I found that Haunted Ground: A novel, quickly lost my interest. Why, you may ask? Because the author has too many characters and she head-hops between them constantly. Each section is narrated by a new character, and frankly I lost interest. I prefer books with one, possibly two voices but not a half dozen. This is particularly disconcerting in audio format. Plus, I found the drippy American character with the tortured past and murdered sister a bit trite and maudlin.Feh, overall, 2 stars. If she had stuck to a single or maybe dual perspective it might've captured my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating history","review":"Erin Hart is an excellent writer.

Somehow these bowls do not have the finesse of the older ones I have, the shape is kinda klunky. They just lack the panache my older french white servware has. I would have sent them back but it was not worth the expense and trouble. Well I threw the lids away and they make good enough dog food bowls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview for the newbie","review":"I am launching my own video production company with one employee (so far) - myself.

Having read some fairly negative reviews I was a bit hesitant, but since the sun was stopping us going out with the baby in the stroller, I thought it was worth a try. We find it brilliant. Once attached to the stroller, it can be pushed down to the foot area and left attached while down. Then you just pull it up when needed. It does stretch tight when fully fastened, but we have not had any problems with it popping off or not reaching the canopy. Additionally, I find that leaving it attached at the foot area means that I can put burp cloths or baby wraps at the bottom of the stroller without them falling off, as the sunshade makes a sort of pouch. (Our baby is now only 2 months, I suspect this storage plan will not work once she is bigger). I wish I had bought this shade from the beginning, when she was still in the bassinet. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're joking, right?!","review":"Completely useless. Like everyone says, it doesn't fit. It won't stay on.

When it arrived, and after my husband had put it together, we were both pleased to have the litter box secreted in a piece of furniture--so much more attractive in our bedroom than a Booda Box. The white finish perfectly matched built in white cabinets, and we gained two more surfaces on which to place things. Even though we cleaned it every day, by day three our 45-pound dog had discovered it. Ugh! We caught him with his head completely inside of the box, selecting the delicacy he wanted from the shallow litter box. We immediately decided to use this piece of furniture as a pet house only. If we just had cats as pets, I would have rated this item four stars. Because the litter box lacks depth, too much litter was thrown out the door to justify five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet house","review":"Originally purchased so I could hide the litterbox.

You also must buy one that's not very high due to the way the door opening is made. Because of the tiny litter box with low sides that has to be used in this thing, litter gets kicked all over and urine ends up all over the inside of this thing. It was a complete nightmare to try to keep up with all the messes from the cat urine and litter everywhere. I tried to use this thing for a few months, but then when it picked up so much urine odor that it was smelling up my house, it had to go. This was a huge waste of good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought this litter box hider with high hopes but the actual product is very poorly made with cheap and flimsy materials.

Too bad they didn't put a little extra effort in the materials used for its construction. Product is flimsy, difficult to put together and very brittle.

Cleaning up all the crappy foam and cardboard pieces took longer than putting it together which should have been a hint of how this was going to work. After two weeks of \\"use\\" and whatnot it's started to wobble back and forth. The door isn't level so it doesn't close all the time.

I've put together a lot of 'some assembly required' furniture but this one is the worst! I am very dissapointed as I was really looking forward to using it in my bathroom - instead, I'm going to have to ask a wood working friend to plane together the pieces and see if I can recover it at all.My reommendation: Order from someone else that makes sure their pieces fit togehter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I seriously lucked out when ordering this on Amazon.

We had to buy a new pan to put inside because our other ones were too big- and that was fine. But our cats would track litter outside and all around the cabinet. And I mean A LOT of litter- piles. The worst part is the opening hole to the cabinet is so low we had to get a shallow litter pan. Unfortunately the low pan doesn't keep the cat's urine contained. So we have urine all over the inside of the cabinet and outside the door. If the opening was higher then we could have gotten a higher pan and avoided some of the mess. Unfortunately this cat house is useless to us.

Be sure to open and put together in a well ventilated area. The box will smell of fresh paint for the first week.

Well pleased with the appearance and construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice little piece of furniture","review":"I'm not a fan of covered litter boxes because they keep the scent in and are more confined for the cat. But after my cats responded well to a partially covered storage container litter box, I decided to purchase this for our bathroom because the litter box in there was an eye sore. Plus, the cats kept tracking litter all over the floor, and the dogs had easy access to a free treat :). The whole thing was easy to assemble, and it looks nice in the bathroom. The cats do use it, but they are more partial to the storage container litter boxes. We drilled some holes in the back of it just to give it some extra aeration (because there really isn't any, other than the door opening- my only complaint). All in all, a nice little alternative that seems to be agreeable to the cats and the people (Oh , and the dogs can't get their big heads in there either)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"100% satisfied !!","review":"We live in a relatively small house ( 2 BR 1 1/2BA ) and have to multi-purpose our half bath.

I had been looking all over for some solution to the unsightly cat box in the corner -- When I saw The Merry Pet Cat Washroom/Night Stand it seemed the perfect answer. It was so easy to put together -- I did it by myself in about 20 minutes. The pieces were sturdy - not flimsy at all. All pieces were clearly marked, even the hardware were separated in small plastic baggies and marked, and the instructions clear and concise. The photo does not do it justice -- it is much better looking in person. With complete confidence I would highly recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet use and other","review":"Another great item I have gotten from Amazon. I have one cat and needed a way to still let him use his litter box but not have the ugly thing showing. So I purchased this. Love it.

Being able to hide the litter box is a plus, but adding what appeared to be a beautiful hiding place made this product look like a great option. Please do not let the pretty photos fool you! First of all, the item is not even close to worth what you pay for it. It is made of cheap particle board. I even question whether it would have functioned for more than a week. I had to have my husband reinforce every aspect of this item with glue and nails. When the product arrived, the box looked like it had seen better days.

A regular litter box with a lid would work just the same as this and it would take up less space. I like the look of the cabinet but in order to keep the floor from having kitty litter all over the place I have to turn the cabinet with the door facing the back wall. I used to have a corner litter box with a lid and there was a lot less mess on the floor with that than having an open litter box inside this cabinet. It just wasn't worth the money for any reason. It takes up too much space, you can still see the litter box, and it doesn't help with the mess. My cat is not one of those cats who just kicks litter up real high all over the place. He is pretty tidy, but there isn't much that can be done to avoid a mess with this cabinet. If you are looking for one then you should probably try your luck with one that is a little longer so there will be more space between the litter box and the door.

The back is load bearing cardboard(or some kind of thin dense material). It wasn't even cut to the correct size. The parts that were wood, we're of low quality. One of the supports for the top split on me. I Had to glue and clamp it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We have a multiple cat household and looking for an additional stylish cover for ons of several litter boxes. This product definately looks much better in the picture then the actual item. It is made with inexpensive material and was a pain to assemble. The parts didn't fit properly making it look more cheap. Our 4-legged kids are using it; however it is cubmersome to get to the litter box and clean. Would like to see a pull out drawer in the bottem, but of course that would add to the price of the item. I guess that cliche' rings true: \\"You get what you pay for\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"According to the measurements listed, my cats covered litter box should fit in this unit. WRONG! Not only did it not fit, it was actually WAY too big. The product is very cheap material and would break easily if you assembled it the wrong way. I think this is a great idea, but unfortunately it's poorly executed. Luckily, Amazon gave me a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I am very pleased with this cabinet. I ordered a covered litter box that fits inside just right, using the measurements someone else listed in their review. I actually ordered the covered version of the litter box in a photo someone posted. They show the litter box with the shield but the same company makes a litter box with a lid(I bought the one without the flip top lid because of the reviews). The color is darker than pictured. What I received has more of a mahogany finish, but I think it looks better than the cabinet pictured! It is worth the money. I did not line the bottom of the cabinet, as others who reviewed suggested, because the litter box is covered, so I cannot comment on how it holds up if the cat misses inside. The cat loves it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty and I love it!","review":"A little difficult to put together, but is purrrrrfect for my 3 year old dainty Persian and myself. The companion high sided letter box fits and works perfectly. I did line the inside walls, floor and roof with clear contact paper as suggested by a previous buyer. A small throw rug at the entrance keeps the area very neat and litter free. Thank you Merry Pet and Amazon for carrying this product. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Even Fit Together","review":"After putting the first two boards together, I noticed how loose the pieces were after the screws were in. When I tried put on the third piece, when the screws aligned to the holes, the boards decorative edge got in the way of allowing the two boards to screwed together. I would have had to saw off a piece of the edge to even get this thing together. I've bought and put together 20 or more Ikea furniture and never had this problem. This product is very cheaply made. Save yourself a headache and skip buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand up to cat pee, lasted about 6 months.","review":"Hello,We received this item in early December 2010.We got about 6 months out of it.If you have a female cat or male cat that can keep in the tray then it is probably a decent product.If you have sprayer it won't last very long. Perhaps if you lined it with thick plastic you could get more life out it.Many of the parts that appeared to be solid wood are disintegrating and revealing themselves to be MDF or something of that ilk.It did originally look better than most competitive products we have tried.Now it is just falling apart.Looks like it is back to plastic for us.Best of luck in your quest for a stealth litter tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holes are too big","review":"I'm mechanically inclined and have plenty of experience putting together cheap furniture from IKEA, so it's definitely not me. The holes for the bolts on panel B are too big, so there's no way to attach that side. Not even bothering with an exchange. For $100 I expected it to be at least slightly sturdier than it was, and definitely for it to be able to be assembled upon arrival. So annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh not so great","review":"This looks nice but it is not very study at all. You should set it up close to where you are going to permanently place it. I doubt it will be able to survive a move. We are thinking about getting a different litter box. When the cats jump out of this one the litter comes out with them so there is litter all in front of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor customer service","review":"I received the product very timely. There was one piece missing in the product and the instructions said to contact Merry Pet rather than return the product. Therefore I put the product together (minus the missing piece) and my cat seems to really like it. I like it too. The piece missing was a back panel which wasn't vital to the overall functionality of it was still missing. I have called them three times and no one answers. I always leave a message with my name, number and address. I have yet to receive a return call. Although I like the product I would probably never purchase anything from this company due to the missing part and their poor response to it. I could return it but it is more trouble than it is worth.

I have it in my laundry room and you can't even tell there's a litter box in it! I've had several guests comment on it wanting one like it. It was very easy to put together. I had it put together in less than 15 minutes. The only complaint is that does not use a standard size litter box - I had to buy 2 litter boxes before I could find one that would fit - I should have measured the space before shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe and poor quality","review":"Very disappointing after readking other reviews. I'll make this to the point.1) Several pieces came scrathed, dented, and chipped2) Some pieces did not fit into the pre-drilled holes3) Price is too expensive for the poor quality4) Most alarming!...There is a strong unpleasant fume that is generated by this product. Either the paint or stain lacquering is generating a fume that I feel is unsafe to be inhaled by anyone in the house. I do not want my pet breathing in these fumes. I'm sure anyone concerned about their pet would not either.Fortunetly, Amazon is being cooperative about replacing it. But I'm afraid that I going to get another defected product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and bad","review":"The good: ever so much more attractive than having a litter box in view. Assembly was simple, and the item functions well.The bad: cheaply made. One section split slightly as soon as I looked at it, and it's not even at a stress point. The thinnest piece is the floor, which needs to bear the weight of litter box and cat, so we'll see how that holds up. And a couple of the pieces weren't precisely square, so the front is not as perfect as one would hope. And you'll need to buy a new litter box, because your old one won't fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if your cat sprays high!","review":"I was SO excited to get this cabinet, because we have a ranch house and not much room, and litter boxes are a real eyesore. The cabinet is lovely, and pretty solid. Then the problem: I put a large size litter pan in it, and let our 3 cats use it for 1-2 days. When I went to clean it, I opened the door and pulled the pan out, and splash! Urine all over the floor. Our older male cat who likes to urinate upwards, had sprayed all over the walls of the cabinets, creating a generous pee puddle under the litter pan. Gross. I can't use this cabinet! I ended up buying the Goodstuff Hidden Litter Box that looks like a plant, and since it's all plastic on the inside with no seams, it's worked perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy falls in love with a boy named Chris.","review":"A girl named Amy Wise stars to like a boy named Chris.

In fact, it was so tight that I kept looking at it thinking it was jammed. Once I was able to run it back and forth a few times, it loosened up a good deal. Once I put some paste wax on it (dry bar soap works too) it was much smoother.I think this stiffness may be done on purpose. I put my expensive set of Klein nut drivers in the bag, and if it came unzipped and they all fell out, I was be none too happy. I imagine the stiffness is to stop that from happening.Good size, good construction, what's not to like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not like other Klein bags: avoid","review":"I'm disappointed in this canvas bag. The zipper doesn't run smooth on it. I think Klein knows what a problem this is because they include a nylon pull on the zipper to give you better leverage. A much better Klein bag in the same price range is their Cordura ballistic nylon one. Essentially the same price, a more sturdy bag, and far better fit and finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully crafted novel","review":"Norman Zollinger is the master of the historical novel, and Meridian is probably his finest.

I am not sure about the actual book, but the only weakness of the kindle edition is that the explanation for tying a knot and the corresponding pictures are not together and even seem to be out of order. One of the knots is described but not shown. I am not super upset as I intend to get a dedicated book for knots... but still frustrating. Overall... I cannot express how much I believe that this is a book that every beginner and intermediate climber will find useful and should include in their library.

What a surprise! Fortunately I was not injured and tried again while holding on to a door. It took several practices to be sure I could sit down safely, but I won't use this outdoors as intended since it is so easy to tip over backwards. The side and front movement is nice, but the back should be redesigned for much better stability. Had I seen this rocker in a store and tried sitting on it, I would never have purchased one.

Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a back-saver","review":"If you enjoy gardening and have a creaky back or knees, get this seat! It relieves a lot of the strain of bending or kneeling. I ruptured a disk in my lower back and could not garden at all until I got this seat.

Although, in my opinion, her debut album was definitely a special one... This new one comes very close to being just as good. I usually like to listen to an album before I spend money buying it, but when I ordered it on an impulse, and finally got to listen to it, I was indeed pleasantly surprised. She has not strayed too far away from what I believe to be most important--the central message about God's love and His influence in her life and her music. With this album, I can truly see effort, and the fact that she has contributed to the lyrics also impresses me. I definitely recommend it if you have already liked her music. It's definitely one to buy...and listen to often. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another cd worth buying. This girl rocks","review":"Jaci is such an inspiring artist.

I bought it thinking it sounded cool. It doesn't, if you like Latin-influenced repetitive pop, go ahead. I myself like the sort of Latin flavour, but most of this cd is fairly slow. The one highlight would be Every Time I Fall, but not worth the money. If you liked a Celine Dion cd ALL the way through, you might like this. But if you want upbeat Christian music, think Michelle Tumes or Wow Hits 2003 or 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"This album was supposed to be a smashing hit. It was supposed to be incredible, excellent, wonderful.It did not appeal to me at all. Not a single song stood out, not a single one made me think anything except, \\"Jaci could do better\\".Not a single song had lyrics compelling enough for me to read them twice. Not a single song touched me, moved me, changed me.Quite a disapointment, really. Perhaps her Pop style doesn't appeal to me any more.If your looking for a CD that's going to change your life, look for Rebecca St. James' Transform.No offense, folks. But Jaci appealed to me more when I heard Heavenly Place. Now, she seems to be dry.I'm hoping that sometime she come out with a new song that touches my heart.

As a person whom I've talked to briefly I have witnessed the joy and love for the Lord that she shares in concert. God has given her a talent and an opportunity to reach milllions of people not only in this country but in many more.I know that God has big plans in her artisitc life because of her openess to share the message with all her fans.

Of course, the disc I had recorded couldn't be finalized at that point (saying \\"Disc Error\\" when I tried), so it was about an hour wasted. This is not the first time this has happened, and it has happened using different brands of CD's. Also, the CD's I AM able to make seem to skip easily when played anywhere but from the player itself.

They have idoits with no training answering the phones. You can actually hear them reading through the same notes you can find on the web. Call with a complex problem and they ask dumb questions like \\"are your cables plugged in?\\"My second complaint is that with fast dubbing, the deck adds a half second of blank time between tracks. Therefore, don't bother copying a continuous play CD. They sound really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This is a fine product when it works - and that's the catch. Sometimes it will and sometimes it won't. The directions are adequate if you are comfortable with electronics equipment. Otherwise, you have to trust your intuition. The first unit I received arrived already broken. The second one has provided me with two months of alternative pleasure and maddening frustration. [Right now the machine cannot read a disc I just recorded on it.] It can be a nightmare trying to get it to work properly at times. When it does work, it can be a joy. But I would rather have something that is reliable. It is apparent to me that Philips has issued a product with some real quality control probles. I would not buy it again and am already searching for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems, Problems...","review":"I have to number myself among the nay-sayers who have had loads of problems with this unit.

Wasted CDs that would not format, not be recognized, or not be ejected.It also will not work with 80 minute Music CDRWs, so forget buying these, although that's increasingly all that you can find available these days in stores.It's a lose-lose machine, compounded by Philips terrible customer service, not-in-service phone numbers, and general \\"try to find us, we dare you\\" approach to repairs.Buyer be ware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is a waste of money","review":"You'll be guaranteed disappointment if you waste your money on this item. I know.I purchased this unit new, and it worked great for 14 months. I recorded both CDs and my piano playing (mics right into the back of the Philips unit) for family and it was flawless. I'm not sure what the deal is with other reviews about non-Philips CD-Rs, but Memorex CDs worked fine in my Philips unit.The problem is that two months out of warranty, the CD-R module went bad. I mean really bad, to the tune of $641 and $617 as the two estimates to fix it. Unit won't record, won't playback on one side, and now is a very expensive single-CD player. Would you pay twice as much as new to get it fixed? Neither would I.After discussions with other CD-RW owners, there are clearly better options out there; read other reviews. . .but if you choose to purchase this item, you will be hoping it's not one of the many many lemons that Philips has issued.Let the buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This item was not only plays cds, it burns cds.

Then it started to get unreliable; CD's would play in one player and NOT AT ALL in another or CD's would record but sound like really scratchy LP's (copies made from an original right out of the wrapper!) I think that anyone who gives this product a great review has either just bought it (like I also would have at the time) or is just LUCKY to have gotten a good one.

An echo of that film came with the recent world touring groups of Gypsy Caravan. A highlight for me was my introduction to Fanfare Ciocarlia, a Romanian brass band that performs sibra, hora, ruseaca, manea dances and other tunes, fingering their instruments at lightning speed. As complex as traditional New Orlean jazz band but at warp speed, this group makes you want to dance once you get passed being frozen with awe of their brilliance. This early one-hour recording (1999) keeps to their roots with tune selection. Once common, such brass bands are now rare among the villages, but Fanare Ciocarlia keeps the tradition alive. Play this album with friends and see their surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common tape mechanism failure","review":"The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that I hear Sony may have fixed the problem in ones made after mid 2009. The tape door won't close and, upon researching it on some support forum, I found what seemed like hundreds of people having this same problem.

Anyway, the image is very grainy. There seem to be thousands of microscopic black dots in the images - both on the viewfinder screen and the tape (played on a tv). I called Sony support & they were not helpful at all. They suggested I send it in. I'm returning it to get a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid value. Honda of camcorders","review":"Small compact and good quality picture and features. I like the touch screen LCD and the video guide that shows you how to take great videos. I have had the camera for a week and am blown away that they can deliver this much value for $200. FYI The camera does have AV output under the front right plastic corner panel there is a firewire output. It is a bit difficult to open and you think you are breaking the camera because it is made of the same material as the other portions of the camera housing. I was able to output video from this camera to my computer using firewire with both Roxio video editing software and Pinnacle Studio 8 software. Overall the camera is very good quality and provides a nice picture. If you plan on doing night or low light shots I would consider this camera before other makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy.","review":"Very very disappointed with this toy.

I wouldn't mind paying more to be able to follow the concepts and fully understand them. Afterall, this is business analysis with \\"Microsoft Excel.\\" There's just no \\"Excel\\", just text.

There has never been a voice as pure and as beautiful as Eva's. Once again she proves she could handle any kind of music, and each song becomes her own.

Run don't walk to buy \\"American Tune\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say about Eva, the woman had soul...","review":"It didn't matter what genre of music she was singing, Eva's angelic voice always oozed soul. The thing that made the biggest impression on me when I first heard Eva's voice was it's pureness. It's a powerful, passionate, soothing, crystal-clear instrument that has the capacity to move anyone.Eva was all about the music: No frills, just beautiful simplicity at it's very best. What made her music this way was her lack of self-obsession. She never thought much of her enormous talents and, instead, just sang with all the heart and soul you can possibly imagine. I never hesitate to purchase an Eva Cassidy cd, and neither should anyone else. I highly recommend all of her available recordings, especially last year's IMAGINE, 1998's SONGBIRD, and THE OTHER SIDE. Hopefully, this will not be the last Eva cd we will see released. Let's hope that there are still many more songs to be unveiled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but not the masterpiece of \\"Blues Alley\\"","review":"New music from the Eva estate. This album will be a huge seller, and may outdo \\"Songbird\\". I will say this though, nothing to date surpasses \\"Live At Blues Alley\\" (the true Eva CD). Nevertheless, this is still a fantastic album.\\"American Tune\\" is a collection of 10 songs featuring covers of some very humble tracks including Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colours\\" and The Beatles \\"Yesterday\\". The title track of course being a Paul Simon cover..Included on this album is another version of \\"God Bless the Child\\" which she did as a duet on her album with Chuck Brown titled \\"The Other Side\\".The highlights on the album are \\"The Water is Wide\\" and \\"You Take me Breath Away\\" - so beautiful they will bring tears to your eyes.This may be the last of Eva's recordings, so grab yourself a copy and disappear for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment from incorrect lyrics","review":"I bought this CD specifically because Eva covers Simon & Garfunkel's \\"American Tune\\" and the preview on Amazon sounded good. However, upon purchase and listening, this song was performed with a major lyrical blunder that completely changes the song and makes it unlistenable. Specifically, she completes the first verse with \\"Still tomorrows goin' to be another workin' day, And I'm trying to get some rest,That's all I'm trying to get some rest.\\" This is the lyric for the fourth and final verse, not for the end of the first and it completely alters the song's meaning.The rest of the CD sounded like someone singing with a karoake machine - too much emphasis on the vocal performance. It didn't blend well, though I understand that this particular collection was some working material and not a final, polished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"There comes a point...","review":"I fear that the predictions are true and that Eva Cassidy's answering machine tape will be released next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Gem","review":"Once you are introduced to Eva Cassidy's music, it is impossible to forget.

From that first time I heard this album, I was blown away... I had really no prior knowledge of this album or the type of music Eva Cassidy did in the past, so I was telling everyone that even though it's all cover songs, it's just simply amazing...

Then it died soon after the warranty expired (naturally).(The crown/setting knob came out completely, then condensation began to develop, then the watch stopped working altogether.)I liked the watch and thought it was worth repairing via Citizen. But they wanted more than the watch costs new to perform the repairs. Now it sits in a drawer.Citizen apparently makes disposable watches -- when they break, just buy a new one.I've indeed bought a new watch, and it wasn't a Citizen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch!","review":"I'm a little bit particular about my watches. I like a quality watch with few frills. It should look as if the band and watch flow together. This watch is very comfortable, and so light that I forget that I am wearing a watch.

This particular Eco-Drive fits the bill with a demure face and the features that I want. The Eco-dive system means I won't have to go searching for a battery for the the life of the watch, an activity that I find strangely onerous.I also took advantage of next-day shipping on this item, so I would not be excessively out of time. Amazon came through with flying colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch!!!!!","review":"This is a great piece of craftsmanship. I say this because its light weight, durable, and I enjoy the fact that its powered by light.

I'll probably buy my dad one for his birthday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design and style, some functionality issues.","review":"The watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice, unique design. Unfortunately I have had terrible issues with the pins between the links. There are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and I have to shimmy them back in all day long.

This is the kind of issue I would expect from an inferior watch, perhaps one well under 100 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco-drive to junk yard","review":"The watch looked as advertised but didn't work. The date/time setting was wrong when we got the watch. I followed the instructions and set up the date to present to my husband for his b-day two days later. Well, it was right for half a day and next morning it didn't change, my husband set it up again, half a day later it was wrong again. When we tried to set it up, it was not moving. In addition, it really pulled my husband's hair and he had to actually shave his arm. That was weird. It's going back. Citizen -- I am not a citizen anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try the Band Before You Buy","review":"The watch itself is very nice; good looking and accurate. The band is terrible, at least for me. It severely pinches and pulls the hair on your wrist. The band is very stiff and inflexible, more like a bangle bracelet than a watch band. The links are also quite wide making it unlikely you will be able to remove the right number of links to get a good fit. On my wrist the band is a bit too big but if you remove one more of these big links it is too tight. I STRONGLY recommend you try this watch band before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I don't know who thought this was a good idea; but, this is downright boring!

It has nothing new to say, the musicianship is simplistic, the lyrics unremarkable, and the voice passionless and weak - except for a very few bars when it began to take on strength, then faded again. I never even finished the CD - the first nine songs were more than enough.I know it's a no-no to reference except very obliquely the lead singer's father, but I had great hopes of this band because of that relationship. Without expecting any kind of clone, imitation or tie-in, I tried VERY hard to like these guys, respect their uniqueness, and appreciate what they were doing. I gave them far more time, attention and sympathy than I would have given any other new band that started off so weakly in the very first cut. But unfortunately, unlike the father at a much younger age, the son and his friends seem to have nothing to say that I care to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with ksrb totally","review":"Simplistic and totally unremarkable.

They usher in a sound that can't possibly be categorized and they leave the listener wanting more. I heard they're about to go on tour with Lifehouse and I am panting at the mouth 4 tickets. All of their songs are the best tunes I've heard, but my all time favorite is \\"Everything will never be o.k.\\". The chorus, the lyrics, the guitar chords all tie in perfectly. I think everybody needs to rush out and hook themselves up with this cd. Fiction Plane rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Left Side of the Brain is you like Fictionplane","review":"I discovered Fictionplane through Pandora and immediately added both albums to my wishlist. This one was the first I received and listened through, mediocre at best. I'd give it 2.5 stars at best. It misses the sense of music composition and groove that \\"Left Side of the Brain\\" seems to have. The songs are too much of the singer singing shallow, generic \\"Here's my messed up life\\" lyrics. The music behind the lyrics definitely seems like there's a lot of reach and experimental spirit, but nothing sounds good; it's mismatched and too-often harsh. So far I've liked everything off of \\"Left Side\\" but only found a track or two on this I'd willingly listen to again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tunes!!","review":"I bought this after hearing only one song from the cd. I'm a huge Sting fan and wanted to see how his son compared, and I wasn't let down. While Joe Sumner isn't quite up to par with his dad their voices are similar enough that if you're a Police fan you'll probably appreciate it.I also enjoy the style of music FP seems to gravitate towards. They're sort of mildly dark, a grey feel, and they tell stories without telling stories. I dunno, give em a listen and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album","review":"This is truly one of the best CD's I've ever purchased.

Fiction plane's \\"Everything will never be ok\\" album is an all-around great cd. I have listened to it constantly since getting it last week, and I'm not tired of it yet! Joe's voice is incredible! The producer David Khane has another great album to add to his track-record including Sublime, Barenaked Ladies and Wilco. \\"Everything will never be ok\\", \\"Hate\\" and \\"Real Real\\" are great tracks.

The only thing that could fit through the hole it comes with is liquid. And even then I would honestly be surprised anything would fit through that hole at all.

All my friends with far more expensive guitars were all impressed. After playing it, they all asked the same question -\\"How much did this cost\\"? Followed by \\"You're kidding\\" when I told them!

But once again Miller ruins a perfectly good story with illtimed sex scenes and a woman who loses her train of thought as soon as her significant fellow starts lifting her skirt.I found the story of Polly and Devon more interesting than that of Brigham, and I hope to somewhere find the story of Charlotte and her sea captain, although having said that I'll probably find the same combination of near rape that seems to be creeping in to most of Miller's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This book was okay.

It was a choppy storyline, with parts of other stories and characters that suddenly appear mid-novel. It just wasn't a love story. Now I'm a fan of a lot of romance writers, cheasy plots and all, but the story needs to flow. This one was one of the most disappointing novels I've ever read.

He opens with the somber Aria and the variations spring to life thereafter. The variations come with a stately speed, without rush but certainly no lack of momentum either. He offers colourful registration, with each registration suited to the character of each variation. The Goldberg Variations, already a monumental piece on its own, is made even bigger by his rendition that certainly does the Beckerath organ at Eglise Immaculate-Conception justice. The playback level needs to be reduced to achieve a genuine and lifelike effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing and difficult read!","review":"I found this book to be a disappointingly sparse and sometimes unintelligible history of St. Andrews and its caddies. The author unfortunately presumes that the reader is intimately familiar with both the golf course layout and the native language of it's caddies. Consequently there are no helpful maps or diagrams included and frequent referral to the glossary is an awkward but necessary expedient to reach a degree of understanding.

Proves to Push Zydeco Further","review":"On Lets Go!, singer/songwriter/accordionist Nathan Williams utilizes his contemporary Zydeco inventiveness by throwing hints of reggae, R&B, pop, and blues into the traditional Zydeco mix. Williams, a soulful baritone, progresses in this genre (once again) by throwing instantly infectious melodies at you while the rhythm section holds the groove down. You can here the bands diversity on cuts like \\"Everything Happens for the Best\\" (where hints of reggae come through) or \\"Hard Times\\" (Williams shows his natural vocal prowess with a down home blues moan). What becomes immediately apparent while listening through Lets Go! is that most of the tunes are instantly hummable and recognizable, yet they never tend to flounder after numerous listens. Nathan Williams may not be the most well known Zydeco artist, but his songwriting leaves him at the forefront amongst the seasoned vets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought.....","review":"I thought this was an Ionic flat iron,(indeed it is) but it does not get hot enough (it does not have auto heat you adjust the temp yourself) and does not get your hair as straight as the real ionic products made for professional use.

The only problem with it is the author's venomous and unmasked hatred of women in general. It is this very hatred that discredits his arguably sound points. This book was almost a great analysis of the consequences and difficulties of having women in the military, but it falls short because of the author's inability to leave his bigoted anti-women opinion on the backburner and deal strictly with the facts. I finished this book both angry and disappointed...and found little to credit the author with except a fine writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"customer review","review":"I gathered from Mr. Mitchell's writing style and opinions that he has a hatred of women as human beings. He would despise women weather they served in the military or not. He pretty much views females as parasites that leech off and destroy an otherwise well functioning society when they decide to leave the kitchen and put on some shoes. I can only conclude that he is indeed, a closet homosexual and he deeply despises and resents women because of this. If only DADT was repealed when he was in the military, maybe he wouldn't be such a prick. Please read the book if you want to hear a closet homosexual man's cries for help."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slap in the face of our Troops","review":"Mr. Mitchell clearly has a contempt for women, as human beings and as soldiers. I realize his book was written a while ago, but under President Bush, womens' role in the military has been expanded far beyond anything in the past of the American military. And our female troops are performing admirably in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Mitchell's book is a slap in the face to the women sailors of the USS Cole, and the women who are protecting all of us in the War on Terrorism. It's a disgrace that our brave Troops have to defend themselves from the biased and falsified \\"reporting\\" of authors who should be seeing a psychiatrist to get to the reasons for their misogyny! One star is really being generous for this worthless junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Paper","review":"Mr Mitchell simply must hate women. His book is a very one sided account of women in the American military. At no time does he mention the accomplishments of the many talented women in the military. I also found the book to be poorly researched. Mr Mitchell mentions that women were the cause of the tradition of West Point Plebes staying at the Academy for Christmas being cancelled. The Plebes in the Class of 1968 were the first to have Christmas at home in 1964-this can be confirmed by reading Gus Lee's novel of West Point or asking a 68 grad. Major Rhonda Cornum if she did receive the DFC etc received it after all crewmates received them. Originally, she only received a Purple Heart and a POW medal.

As I read it though, I felt Mitchell has an underlying dislike of women overall and his writing could not be completely taken as accurate. I know for a fact that not all men who oppose the idea of women in the military feel this way but it is evident that Mitchell is a man has a few issues with bias against women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitchell hits the mark, tells the truth","review":"Brian Mitchell hits the mark in \\"Women in the Military; Flirting with Disaster.\\" He tells it how it is, destroying all femenazi and neoliberal fantasies about gener equality.

Next, the batter figure broke off - not a necessary part, we just did without. Then the lever you pull back to set the batter up to swing broke off. Since you now can't pitch or bat, you can't play. It's so sad because my son really loves this. He tries to just pretend with the players - but even that isn't fun because he doesn't have a batter any more.Really disappointing for a pricey toy.

One comprehensive book of sample questions (I used MSCE Exam Prep by Que but I hear the examcram series is very good also) and the Microsoft Resource Kit (I used the free copy available on the CD ROM). Using this book as a template and with lots of study and doing practice questions from the other books, I managed to pass my WIN95 exam in only 10 days -- not by choice, I was under a deadline since the 063 exam was being retired.

I am sure that the current Georgian government has paid these puppets enough so that the truth about the decades-old Georgian chauvinism could be prevented from being known by the international community. It is quite amazing to see that they have gone as far as requesting the University of London to dismiss Mr. Hewitt or asking St. Martin's Press to stop the sale of the book.

No way on earth should an item this big, meant to hold so many articles, be so shoddily constructed. The least amount of pressure from the items you store in the box causes the walls to separate.

If you like that sort of \\"book\\" go for it.I think the book is so bad I will not waste my time with Amazon to get a refund or replacement book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment! :(","review":"I bought this as a gift for my 3 year old who is infatuated with Cars. The tin arrived slightly dented. The magnets are very tiny and the two \\"additional scenes\\" were cut incorrectly and one of them does not even take up the full space on one side of the tin! My kids are creative and love playing with all of their toys in a variety of ways, but this only held my little one's attention for about 5 minutes. It's too small to really enjoy any \\"play\\" with it, and, in my opinion, $13 is a bit too much money to spend on some tiny magnets that might get played with on the fridge. I am returning this (along with the Toy Story tin I bought for my 5 year old daughter who had absolutely no interest in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...kids love it","review":"Great product...kids love it...compact...good to travel...can use most any place...restaurant, car, plane...we took on a cruise and it did it's job!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nihao My Concubine CD","review":"Being a hard core Ranma fan I found it hard to review this CD without being biased but I think I did pretty well. If you are an insane Ranma fan, like myself, get this CD. It has an excellent mix of different kinds of music, including a few Jazz songs, and even some psuedo-kabuki selections, and the last song \\"A Piece of Love\\" makes the whole thing worth it. My only problem is the lack of music with actual lyrics (\\"Piece\\" is the only one), that's why I had to give it a four."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome album by an awesome band!","review":"In all my 7 years as a metalhead, I've heard so many people say that metal is the music of the devil. But when I first heard of Vengeance Rising, I gave them a listen, and they completely took that theory and threw it out the window! My favorite music genre + the Christian religion = ONE AWESOME BAND!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"These guys are metal-masters of the highest caliber. The music is tight and well written and the lyrics have substance. Larry Farkas has to be one of the best guitarists around. He is easily in the same league as the late-great Dimebag Darrell. If these guys have a weakspot, it is the vocals - they're good (as opposed to excellent) throught the album with a handful of spots where they are excellent.Bright spots :Mulligan's Stew and Burn are both mindblowing with leads that will leave your jaw on the floor. Mulligan's Stew really stands out not only for it's main solo, but for the incredible background leads that wind through the entire song (ala Rocky/ST)Metal just doesn't get any heavier than this. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor representation of current styles","review":"I have several of Charles Randalls' prior books dating to 1994. Sadly, this one did not deviate much from their content. This is a very poor representation of current trends and styles. Most photographs looked as though they were taken in the 80s' and 90s'As an interior designer, I am always looking for ways to offer my clients new and fresh ideas for their windows. I would be embarrassed to bring this book as an aide in selection of window treatment styles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Dewalt","review":"At this price, cheaper than the El Cheapos you buy at the dollar store but so much better. Wrap around design cuts glare and are Safety glasses"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro Silver Mirrors","review":"I bought these Saftey Glasses(2)to use for work (construction) and they turned out to be so popular with the crew that I gave them away because I couldn't keep the guys from barrowing them. Mostly use while cutting wood, rebar and useing the nail gun. I've already recommended to my friend to buy these Pro Silver Mirror Safety Glasses and I will have to buy some more myself at the very reasonable price offered on Amazon. Best suggestion I can make is to buy more than 2 or 3, friends and family will want a pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but scratch easily","review":"I love these glasses, but be very careful as they scratch rather easily for a pair with such a high MSRP."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice fit","review":"nice fit, will fit men with larger types of heads well, it is nice enough to wear out with a gold shirt when just hanging out or going to the mall"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD...","review":"This was a great CD, and I enjoyed it very much. Although some pieces were wonderfully vocalized and composed, a few sounded like they were put together in two minutes. I still recommend this CD to Ranma fans, because it isn't very expensive and it's DEFINITELY worth it. n.n Buy away! By the way, my favorite tracks were: Don't make me wild like you, Little Date, So many mem'ries, No Way! Part 2--- Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranma CD enjoyed by all","review":"Can't understand Japanese? This CD is kinda cool anyway, even if you can't understand it, the lyrics are written in English on the inside cover, so you can sing-along in English, but I suggest that you don't buy the CD if you know nothing about Ranma or you won't understand, but in my opinion it was cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Recording, interesting interpretation","review":"I found the recording and the tone of the guitar superb. Some of the interpretions I found exceptional, others I've heard better from Barrueco's \\"300 Years of Guitar\\" CD. Having said that, I found the musicianship top rate. I wish the CD also contained the Suite Populaire Bresillienne, but it is a good collection nontheless. This is a very difficult CD to find, but I think it is worth the search."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I'm so glad they remade the series to follow the manga, it is SO much better all the way through. Although part four is when things really start to get dicey. Every episode is amazing - I can't stress this enough, seriously"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"This part of the series reveals some mysteries about some of the characters. The story is very creative and ties in real alchemy with this world of fantasy in a well thought out manner. Viewers would have to watch the entire show to appreciate its content though."},{"rating":"2","title":"anime of the century","review":"this anime is the gold standard to witch all other animes should be compared, the voice actors are the best funimation has to offer and the animation is top notch, for all you new fans who are confused i know i was the manga came out first and then the first fullmetal alchemist tv show then the fullmetal alchemist brotherhood came out just recently and got wayyyy more better rateing then the first tv show the reson was that the brotherhood version was staying true to the origanal manga and the first tv show no offence but it was badly directeted and made poorly, in the fullmetal alchemist world there is sevral debates about witch came first the first tv show or the manga and i can tell you with utmost truthfulness that the manga came first so if you like reading get the manga and if you like watching get the fullmetal alchemist brotherhood and if you like playing get the video game all around the best anime tv show iv ever had the plesure of watching cheers see you later"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Volume 4 of FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is another great volume of the series. With only one more volume left, things get around to the climax of the entire story. Once again, everything with the BD is of great quality. Another anime series must-buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ughhh","review":"Toni is the managing editor of \\"Relix\\" magazine, which explains her ability to obtain high-level musicians (such as Jorma Kaukonen) for her releases. The problem, as always, is her voice. At her best, she sounds like Natalie Merchant with a severe case of tone deafness. At her worst..... hmmmm..... is there a need to continue?Pass on this and run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"It doesn't light up like it's supposed to, it's smaller than your index finger and it does nothing.
